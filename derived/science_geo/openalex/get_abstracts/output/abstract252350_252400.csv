https://openalex.org/W2090018138,"Depletion of intracellular calcium stores activates store-operated calcium entry across the plasma membrane in many cells. STIM1, the putative calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) modulator CRACM1 (also known as Orai1) in the plasma membrane have recently been shown to be essential for controlling the store-operated CRAC current (ICRAC)1,2,3,4. However, individual overexpression of either protein fails to significantly amplify ICRAC. Here, we show that STIM1 and CRACM1 interact functionally. Overexpression of both proteins greatly potentiates ICRAC, suggesting that STIM1 and CRACM1 mutually limit store-operated currents and that CRACM1 may be the long-sought CRAC channel."
https://openalex.org/W2094662908,"In the fungal phylum Ascomycota, the ability to cause disease in plants and animals has been gained and lost repeatedly during phylogenesis1. In monocotyledonous barley, loss-of-function mlo alleles result in effective immunity against the Ascomycete Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, the causal agent of powdery mildew disease2,3. However, mlo-based disease resistance has been considered a barley-specific phenomenon to date. Here, we demonstrate a conserved requirement for MLO proteins in powdery mildew pathogenesis in the dicotyledonous plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Epistasis analysis showed that mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter4,5,6. These findings imply that a common host cell entry mechanism of powdery mildew fungi evolved once and at least 200 million years ago, suggesting that within the Erysiphales (powdery mildews) the ability to cause disease has been a stable trait throughout phylogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2035395679,"The human cytidine deaminase family APOBEC3 represents a novel group of proteins in the field of innate defense mechanisms that has been shown to be active against a variety of retroviruses. Here we examined whether members of the APO-BEC3 family have an impact on retrotransposition of human long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1s or L1s). Using a retrotransposition reporter assay in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that in the presence of transiently transfected APOBEC3A, L1 retrotransposition frequency was reduced by up to 85%. Although APOBEC3G and -3H did not influence L1 retrotransposition notably, expression of APOBEC3B, -3C, and -3F inhibited transposition by ∼75%. Although reverse transcription of L1s occurs in the nucleus and APOBEC3 proteins are believed to act via DNA deamination during reverse transcription, activity against L1 retrotransposition was not correlated with nuclear localization of APOBEC3s. We demonstrate that APOBEC3C and APOBEC3B were endogenously expressed in HeLa cells. Accordingly, down-regulation of APOBEC3C by RNA interference enhanced L1 retrotransposition by ∼78%. Sequence analyses of de novo L1 retrotransposition events that occurred in the presence of overexpressed APOBEC3 proteins as well as the analyses of pre-existing endogenous L1 elements did not reveal an enhanced rate of G-to-A transitions, pointing to a mechanism independent of DNA deamination. This study presents evidence for a role of host-encoded APOBEC3 proteins in the regulation of L1 retrotransposition.

As functional L1 proteins are also mobilizing nonautonomous non-LTR retrotransposons (e.g. Alus) in trans (3Dewannieux M. Esnault C. Heidmann T. Nat.

A functional full-length L1 element is ∼6 kb long and includes a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) consisting of an internal promoter, two open reading frames (ORFs) separated by a 63-nucleotide intergenic region, and a 3′-UTR terminating in a poly(A) tail (4Dombroski B.A. Mathias S.L.

ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding protein (ORF1p) that has nucleic acid chaperone activity in vitro (5Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2251-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ORF1p and ORF2p demonstrate a profound cis preference for their encoding transcript resulting in the formation of a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) (12Hohjoh H. Singer M.F.

Genet. 2005; 14: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After RNP formation, the L1 RNA gains access to the nucleus where it is reverse-transcribed into a cDNA copy most likely via target site primed reverse transcription (8Feng Q. Moran J.V.

Integration of the resultant L1 cDNA and the completion of retrotransposition were suggested to occur by alternative mechanisms (18Zingler N. Willhoeft U. Brose H.P. Schoder V. Jahns T.

L1s have altered the genome structure in a multitude of ways (3Dewannieux M. Esnault C. Heidmann T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 19Ostertag E.M.

Host gene expression is influenced by polymerase II promoter activity discovered on sense and antisense strands of the L1 5′-UTR (23Speek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and by transcriptional disruption resulting from intronic L1 insertions (24Han J.S. Szak S.T. Boeke J.D. Nature. 2004; 429: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although there is direct evidence for the regulation of L1 retrotransposition on the transcriptional level, very little is known about host/L1 interactions that might be required for cell type-specific L1 expression and retrotransposition. So far, several host-encoded factors influencing L1 retrotransposition on the transcriptional level have been identified (25Minakami R. Kurose K. Etoh K. Furuhata Y. Hattori M. Sakaki Y.

There is also evidence strongly suggesting that the human L1 element is susceptible to RNA interference (31Soifer H.S. Zaragoza A. Peyvan M. Behlke M.A. Rossi J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, to this point, regulation of L1 expression and retrotransposition is far from being understood. As APOBEC3G, a member of the recently discovered human cytidine deaminase family named apolipoprotein B-editing catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3), deaminates cytosine residues to uracil in the growing minus strand viral DNA during retroviral reverse transcription, we wanted to evaluate whether members of the APOBEC3 family also interfere with L1 retrotransposition, which is also dependent on reverse transcription of template RNA. The APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases is considered to be an important part of anti-retroviral intrinsic immunity (for review see Ref. 32Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 1109-1115Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In primates, the eight paralogues APOBEC3A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, -G, and -H (A3A-H) have been described, although rodents carry only one single Apobec3 gene. Human APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) have been shown to be active against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), which lacks the virion infectivity factor (Vif) (33Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C.

Both APOBEC3s induce C-to-U transitions by cytidine deamination on the viral minus strand DNA during reverse transcription, causing genome degradation or hypermutations (38Mangeat B. Turelli P.

Studies showed that other lentiviruses, gammaretroviruses, deltaretroviruses, spumaviruses, LTR retrotransposons, orthohepadnaviruses, and avihepadnaviruses are also sensitive to the latter APOBEC3 proteins (38Mangeat B.

This indicates the existence of an additional antiviral mechanism mediated by APOBEC3 proteins, which is independent of cytidine deamination. L1 elements have been discussed as potential targets for APOBEC3 activity, because their spreading depends on a reverse transcription step. It was shown previously that L1 retrotransposition is not sensitive to A3G (59Turelli P. Vianin S. Trono D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43371-43373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We wanted to evaluate the effect of other members of the APOBEC3 family on L1 retrotransposition and therefore applied a well established L1 retrotransposition reporter assay (60Moran J.V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the presence of A3A reduced the L1 retrotransposition frequency in HeLa cells by up to 85%. Expression of A3B, A3C, and A3F inhibited retrotransposition activity by ∼75%, whereas A3G and A3H had no influence. Furthermore, we were able to enhance L1 retrotransposition frequency in the absence of cotransfected APOBEC3s by knocking down endogenously expressed A3C via RNA interference. Although mutation of the putative catalytic deamination domain of APOBEC3A completely abolished its activity against L1 retrotransposition, we did not find editing of L1 de novo insertions in the presence of APOBEC3 proteins. In addition, sequence analyses of preexisting L1 insertions did not reveal any enhanced frequency of G-to-A transitions. Our data suggest a novel mode of action of APOBEC3 activity against the non-LTR retrotransposon LINE-1. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's high glucose modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.29 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete). Human A3.01 T cells (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK) were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.29 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Human keratinocytes were kindly provided by Dr. August Bernd (Zentrum der Dermatologie und Venerologie, Johann-Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt/Main, Germany) and cultivated in Hanks' medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 100% humidity in 5-7% CO2 and passaged using standard cell culture techniques. PBMCs were isolated from EDTA-treated whole blood of healthy donors by Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) gradient centrifugation. Plasmids—L1 retrotransposition reporter construct pJM101/L1RP (62Kimberland M.L. Divoky V. Prchal J. Schwahn U. Berger W. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hum. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), respectively. Plasmids expressing A3B, A3C, and A3F were generated by performing RT-PCR on RNA of PHA/IL2-activated human PBMCs. To isolate A3B (pcA3B-HA), forward primer CEM15-CM13 (5′-TAAGCGGAATTCTATCTAAGAGGCTGAACATG-3′) and reverse primer CEM15-HA-C (5′-TAGAAGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATAGTTTTCCTGATTCTGGAG-3′) were used. The amplicon was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the NotI- and XbaI-restricted fragment was transferred into the NotI and SpeI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). To clone A3C (pcA3C-HA), forward primer CEM15-CM13 (see above) and reverse primer CEM15-CM28 (5′-AGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATACTGGAGACTCTCCCGTAGCCTT-3′) were applied. The amplicon was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3.1(+). To clone A3F (pcA3F-HA), forward primer CEM15-CM12B (5′-TAAGCGAAGCTTCTTAGTCGGGACTAGCCGGC-3′) and reverse primer CEM15-CM29 (5′-AGTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATACTCGAGAATCTCCTGCAGCTTGCTGTC-3′) were used, and the amplicon was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO. After HindIII and SpeI digestion, the resulting fragment was transferred into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). To clone A3H (pcA3H-HA), the coding region was amplified by PCR using the forward primer CEM15-CM42 (5′-CAGGCGAATTCCTGCTAAGGAAGCTGTGGCC-3′) and the reverse primer CEM15-CM43 (5′-TTCAGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATAGGACTTTATCCTCTCAAGCCG-3′) with the plasmid IRALp962F0354Q (obtained from the German Resource Center for Genome Research, Berlin) as template. The PCR product was transferred into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). APOBEC3 expression constructs used in the retrotransposition reporter assays were generated by subcloning the respective APOBEC3-HA sequence from the above-described pcDNA3.1(+) vectors into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) using the following restriction sites: A3A, KpnI and XbaI (pcA3A-HA.ZEO); A3B, HindIII and XhoI (pcA3B-HA.ZEO); A3C, HindIII and XhoI (pcA3C-HA.ZEO); A3F, PmeI and PmeI (pcA3F-HA.ZEO); A3G, EcoRI and XhoI (pcA3G-HA.ZEO); and A3H, EcoRI and XhoI (pcA3H-HA.ZEO). The APOBEC3A mutants pcA3A.E72A and pcA3A.CCAA were generated by overlapping PCR using pcA3A-HA.ZEO as template. 5′ and 3′ fragments were amplified with primer sets specific for the overlap region, including the mutations and the external primers (hu3A1, 5′-GCTTGGTACCACCATGGAAGCCAGCCCAGCATCCG-3′; hu3A4, 5′-CATGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACGTC-3′). Subsequently, the mixture of both PCR products was amplified with the two external primers. The resulting fragment was cleaved with KpnI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+)Zeo. Sequence analysis revealed an additional mutation (M153I) in pcA3A-CCAA. The identity of the described APOBEC3 expression plasmids was confirmed by sequence analyses. Western Blot Analysis—For analysis of APOBEC3 protein expression, 2 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA the next day using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. HA-APO-BEC3 proteins were detected using an anti-HA antibody (1:6,000 dilution, MMS-101P; Covance) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). For the detection of α-tubulin, an anti-tubulin antibody (1:10,000 dilution, B5-1-2, Sigma) was applied. Signals were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). L1 Retrotransposition Reporter Assay—Retrotransposition rates were determined by applying the rapid and quantitative transient L1 retrotransposition assay described previously (61Wei W. Morrish T.A. Alisch R.S. Moran J.V. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection reaction, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 2 × 105 cells/well. The following day, each well was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid pJM101/L1RP (62Kimberland M.L. Divoky V. Prchal J. Schwahn U. Berger W. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hum. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2036460370,"This study is to investigate the molecular mechanism of radiation-enhanced cell invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlating with clinical patients undergoing radiotherapy and subsequently developing metastasis. Three HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7) and normal hepatocyte cell line (CL-48) were irradiated with different doses. The effect of radiation on cell invasiveness was determined using the Boyden chamber assay. Radiation-enhanced invasion capability was evident in HCC cells but not in normal hepatocytes. Invasion was observed in gelatin-coated but not fibronectin-coated or type I collagen-coated membranes. Radiation upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mRNA level, MMP-9 protein level and MMP-9 activity. MMP-9 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited radiation-induced MMP-9 expression and thereby significantly inhibited radiation-induced HCC invasion. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt chemical inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin suppressed radiation-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression. Transient transfection with dominant-negative Akt plasmid also showed that the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway was involved in this radiation-induced MMP-9 expression. Moreover, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) decoy oligodeoxynucleotide suppressed radiation enhanced MMP-9 promoter activity completely. PI3K/Akt chemical inhibitors inhibited radiation-induced NF-κB-driven luciferase promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicated that sublethal dose of radiation could enhance HCC cell invasiveness by MMP-9 expression through the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signal transduction pathway."

In addition, five novel peptides that share considerable structural similarity with the purified latarcins were predicted from the L. tarabaevi venom gland expressed sequence tag data base. Latarcins were shown to adopt amphipathic α-helical structure in membrane-mimicking environment by CD spectroscopy. Planar lipid bilayer studies indicated that the general mode of action was scaled membrane destabilization at the physiological membrane potential consistent with the “carpet-like” model. Latarcins represent seven new structural groups of lytic peptides and share little homology with other known peptide sequences. For every latarcin, a precursor protein sequence was identified.

In the course of evolution, venomous animals developed highly specialized and sophisticated strategies that basically serve prey capture and/or aggressor deterrence. It is believed that elaboration of venom organs provided for drastic increase in hunting and defense efficiency. The molecular basis of such efficiency was formed by fine-tuning venom composition. A number of strategies were suggested to have been employed in the process of venom content optimization: increase in the number of functionally diverse compounds, usage of highly selective and effective molecules, and synergism between compounds (1Kuhn-Nentwig L. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2651-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Venoms of a vast number of animal species represent complex mixtures of compounds (ions, biogenic amines, polyamines, polypeptide neurotoxins, cytolytic peptides, enzymes, etc.) that exert various functions (ion misbalance, increased cellular and tissue barrier permeability, extracellular matrix and cell membrane disturbance, cytolysis, necrosis, and myo- and neurotoxicity), eventually leading to a common goal: fast paralysis/death or sharp pain. Synergism of action is thus an important characteristic inherent to venom components. Important clues to unraveling synergistic effects between different venom compounds have been provided (2Corzo G.

We believe that another marked trend common to venomous animals from diverse taxonomic groups is the unique biomolecular diversity of venom polypeptide components. In some cases (Conus peptides are an obvious example), polypeptide molecules constitute what may be called naturally edited combinatorial libraries (6Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), i.e. a significant number of homologous molecules are simultaneously present in the same venom. Structurally important residues (mostly cysteines) that define the overall molecular fold remain conserved, whereas other residues are subject to change and selection so as to form different functional assemblies and provide functional diversity. In spiders, this trend is exemplified by neurotoxins belonging to the inhibitor cystine knot structural motif (7Escoubas P. Rash L. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 9Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J.

We suggest that the same strategy works with venom cytolytic and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; EST, expressed sequence tag; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MICs, minimal inhibitory concentrations; DPhPC, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPE, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; DOPG, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol; PQM, processing quadruplet motif; RPEs, repetitive polypeptide elements. i.e. a wide range of structurally related homologous and non-homologous molecules aimed to exert lytic action against cells of different origin are simultaneously present in the venom to ensure efficiency. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of seven short linear cysteine-free antimicrobial and cytolytic peptides designated latarcins from the venom of the spider Lachesana tarabaevi. We also report the results of L. tarabaevi venom gland expressed sequence tag (EST) data base analysis, which enabled us to identify five additional putative lytic peptides and to characterize precursor protein structures for every latarcin. We believe that latarcins are an example of the marked biomolecular diversity of venom cytolytic peptides. Chemicals—Chemicals were obtained from Fluka Chemie GmbH (Deisenhofen, Germany), Sigma, and Chimmed (Moscow, Russia); all solvents were analytical grade. N-(9-Fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem. Isolation and Purification of Latarcins—The venom of the Central Asian spider L. tarabaevi (lyophilized powder) was purchased from Fauna Laboratories, Ltd. (Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan). Crude venom (collected from several spiders) containing 1 mg of total protein was fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Jupiter C5 column (2 × 150 mm, 300 Å, 5 μm; Phenomenex). A short (35 min) linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-70%, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was used. Eluent absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Fractions with antimicrobial activity were further separated on an Ascentis RP-amide column (2.1 × 100 mm, 3 μm; Supelco). The separation was carried out using a 40-min linear gradient of acetonitrile (20-60%, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Final purification of active compounds was performed on a Luna C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 100 Å, 3 μm; Phenomenex), and peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (20-60%, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 40 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Mass Spectrometry—Separated fractions and crude venom composition were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). [email protected] LR (Micromass UK Ltd.) and Ultraflex TOF-TOF (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) instruments were used. Calibration was performed using either a ProteoMass peptide and protein MALDI-MS calibration kit (mass range of 700-66,000 Da) or a ProteoMass peptide MALDI-MS calibration kit (mass range of 700-3500 Da) (both from Sigma). Molecular masses were determined in linear or reflector positive ion mode using samples prepared by the dried droplet method with a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml in 70% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) matrix. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—N-terminal sequencing was carried out by automated stepwise Edman degradation using a Procise Model 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Peptide Synthesis—Latarcins were synthesized in a stepwise manner by a solid-phase method using Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry. Fmoc-protected amino acids (10-fold excess) were coupled by in situ activation using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazol for 2-4 h. The Fmoc-protecting group was removed by treatment with piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide (1:4, v/v; twice for 20 min). The following side chain protections were used: t-butyl ether for Ser, Thr, and Tyr t-butyl ester for Asp and Glu; trityl for Asn, Gln, and His; t-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys and Trp; and 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldehydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for Arg. Peptide carboxyls were synthesized on a trityl chloride resin (0.8 mmol/g), whereas peptide amides were synthesized on a Rink amide (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)phenoxy) resin (0.51 mmol/g) (both from PepChem, Reutlingen, Germany). The resin was washed with N,N-dimethylformamide before usage as well as after each deprotection and coupling step. Peptide cleavage from the resin and side chain deprotection were carried out using trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol/H2O (95:2.5:2.5) for 4 h at room temperature. The resin was then filtered, and the crude peptides were precipitated by adding cold diethyl ether (-20 °C). The precipitated peptides were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in cold diethyl ether (repeated twice). Finally, the peptides were dissolved in t-butyl alcohol/H2O (4:1, v/v) and lyophilized. Synthetic peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC on a Diasorb C16 column (250 × 25 mm, 7 μm; BioChemMack, Moscow, Russia), which was eluted with linear gradient of acetonitrile (0-60%, v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. 99% purity of synthetic latarcins was achieved, which was verified by HPLC on a Luna C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 100 Å, 3 μm) and by MALDI-MS. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were measured between 190 and 250 nm (0.2-nm step) at 20 °C. Latarcins were dissolved in water and 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol; the concentrations of the peptides were 0.16 and 0.08 mm, respectively. A 0.01-cm path length cell (quartz SUPRASIL) with a detachable window (Hellma GmbH & Co. KG, Müllheim, Germany) was used. Base-line spectra were measured for water or 50% trifluoroethanol solution and subtracted from the corresponding peptide spectra. Data were analyzed using the CONTINLL program as described (10Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1982; 20: 33-37Crossref Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial Assays—Bacteria (Arthrobacter globiformis VKM Ac-1112, Bacillus subtilis VKM B-501, Escherichia coli DH5α, E. coli MH1, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1) were cultured in low salt LB broth, whereas yeast cells (Pichia pastoris GS115 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190) were cultured in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for latarcins was performed using a 2-fold microtiter broth dilution assay in 96-well sterile plates at a final volume of 100 μl. Mid-log phase cultures were diluted to a final concentration of 1 × 105 colonyforming units/ml. Dried HPLC fractions or pure peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of water and added to 90 μl of the bacterium/yeast dilution. The peptides, a non-treated control, and a sterility control were tested in triplicate. The microtiter plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C (bacteria) or for 48 h at 30 °C (yeast); growth inhibition was determined by measuring absorbance at 620 nm. MICs are expressed as the lowest concentration of peptides that caused 100% growth inhibition. Hemolytic Assays—The hemolytic activity of latarcins was determined using fresh rabbit blood. 2 ml of blood was mixed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (8 ml) containing heparin (10 units/ml) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. 1 ml of diluted cells was incubated with peptides at various concentrations for 3 h at 37°C under gentle stirring. The samples were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. Hemoglobin release was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 414 nm. The negative control (0% hemolysis) was 1 ml of diluted cells incubated without the peptides, and the positive control (100% hemolysis) was 1 ml of cells in distilled water. Insecticidal Assays—Crude venom and synthetic peptides were assayed by injection into early third instar Musca domestica larvae (weight of ∼60 mg). Samples were dissolved in physiological saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)), and a volume of 2 μl was injected into the fourth segment of the larva. Controls received pure saline. Paralytic and lethal effects were monitored for up to 24 h after the injection. Planar Lipid Bilayer Membrane Assays—Latarcins were tested for ability to cause conductance changes in planar bilayer membranes. Bilayers were formed (painted) using the technique of Mueller et al. (11Mueller P. Rudin D.O. Tien H.T. Wescott W.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) across a 200-μm aperture in a horizontal Teflon septum separating two 2-ml chambers of the experimental cell. Membranes were formed from lipid solution in decane (20 mg/ml). Diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) and a mixture of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) (7:3, w/w) were used to mimic eukaryotic and prokaryotic plasma membranes, respectively. Electrical measurements were performed at room temperature using Ag/AgCl electrodes in 100 mm KCl solution buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Peptides dissolved in distilled water (1 mg/ml) were added to the upper (cis) chamber. Current across the membrane was measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and digitized with an L-780 ADC (L-Card Ltd., Moscow, Russia). The cis-chamber was referred to as ground, whereas the trans-chamber was clamped at holding potentials relative to the cis-chamber. For each of the peptides, the starting concentration was 1.5 μg/ml. Voltage across the membrane was clamped at 100 mV for 10 min, and then negative voltages were applied starting from -20 mV with 10-mV steps until -100 mV was reached. Each step lasted 30 s. If the membrane remained intact and no current was detected, higher peptide concentrations were tested. AMP Identification and Separation—The venom of the spider L. tarabaevi 3By classification of Zonstein and Ovtchinnikov, 1999. from the Zodariidae family was initially shown to possess comparatively high antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC = 0.05 mg/ml). For this reason, it was chosen as the biological source of putative novel antimicrobials. To isolate individual active components, crude venom was subjected to fractionation by RP-HPLC. The fractions obtained and the crude venom composition were analyzed by MALDI-MS (Fig. 1). L. tarabaevi venom was found to contain ∼100 components that could be divided into two roughly equal groups according to their measured molecular masses (2-5 and 7-9 kDa). During one-step RP-HPLC separation on a C5 column (Fig. 1), all antimicrobial components active against E. coli eluted with a relatively high percent of acetonitrile. Active polypeptide compounds with molecular mass in the 2-5-kDa range were further purified to homogeneity on an Ascentis RP-amide column (data not shown). In total, seven AMPs were isolated from L. tarabaevi venom and named latarcins (Ltc 1, Ltc 2a, Ltc 3a, Ltc 3b, Ltc 4a, Ltc 4b, and Ltc 5). For each of the latarcins, chromatographic peak area was calculated, and its relative abundance in the venom was thus estimated. We found that latarcins could be ascribed to low content venom components (0.1-0.5% of total protein). AMP Structure Determination and Synthesis—Purified latarcins were subjected to automatic Edman degradation, and their full amino acid sequences were determined (Table 1). The observed difference of 1 Da between theoretical and measured molecular masses allowed us to establish C-terminal amidation for Ltc 3a, Ltc 3b, Ltc 4a, Ltc 4b, and Ltc 5.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of latarcins isolated from the venom of L. tarabaeviPeptideSequenceMonoisotopic molecular massMass differenceCalculatedMeasuredDaDaLtc 1SMWSGMWRRKLKKLRNALKKKLKGE-COOH3071.83071.5–0.3Ltc 2aGLFGKLIKKFGRKAISYAVKKARGKH-COOH2900.82901.00.2Ltc 3aSWKSMAKKLKEYMEKLKQRA-CONH22481.42481.70.3Ltc 3bSWASMAKKLKEYMEKLKQRA-CONH22424.32424.60.3Ltc 4aGLKDKFKSMGEKLKQYIQTWKAKF-CONH22900.62900.90.3Ltc 4bSLKDKVKSMGEKLKQYIQTWKAKF-CONH22882.62882.3–0.3Ltc 5GFFGKMKEYFKKFGASFKRRFANLKKRL-CONH23427.93428.10.2 Open table in a new tab As seen from their amino acid sequences, latarcins represent short linear cationic amphiphilic polypeptides. Ltc 3a and Ltc 3b differ by one residue at position 3 (bearing Lys or Ala, respectively); Ltc 4a and Ltc 4b differ by two residues at positions 1 (Gly or Ser, respectively) and 6 (Phe or Val, respectively). Except for these two pairs, latarcins show negligible levels of homology between each other. Thus, five structurally different groups of AMPs were found to be simultaneously present in the venom of L. tarabaevi. Multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW (available at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) was performed (Fig. 2B) and revealed some degree of sequence similarity between Ltc 1 and Ltc 3a/3b (53% identity) and between Ltc 3a/3b and Ltc 4a/4b (∼50% identity). Latarcins are strongly cationic molecules: pI >10, and the net charge at pH 7 varies from +5 for Ltc 3b to +10 for Ltc 5. The distribution of positively charged lysine residues with intervening bulky hydrophobic groups found in latarcin sequences is common to other AMPs. Such distribution allows the peptides to adopt marked amphipathic structures in an α-helical conformation. Clusters of hydrophobic and positively charged residues become obvious when the peptides are plotted as a helical net or wheel. All newly identified AMPs were chemically synthesized to provide sufficient material for detailed functional analysis. Synthetic and naturally occurring peptides were proven to be identical by comparing their molecular masses, RP-HPLC elution profiles, and biological activities. Analysis of the L. tarabaevi Venom Gland EST Data Base— We performed analysis of the L. tarabaevi venom gland EST data base (obtained in collaboration with DuPont Agriculture & Nutrition) with latarcin sequences as query and identified full precursor protein sequences (named pLtc x) for every latarcin as well as four new structurally similar sequences (Fig. 2). Latarcins represent secreted polypeptide molecules, and putative leader sequences were identified using the SignalP 3.0 program (available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) in every precursor protein. Mature peptides correspond to the C-terminal parts of the respective precursors. Ltc 3a, Ltc 3b, Ltc 4a, Ltc 4b, and Ltc 5, which were shown to be C-terminally amidated, all bear an additional C-terminal glycine in their precursor sequences, which provides additional evidence of the suggested post-translational modification. The Ltc 1 precursor has an additional C-terminal lysine residue that is suggested to be cleaved off post-translationally. Precursors of homologous peptides Ltc 3a/3b and Ltc 4a/4b share a high level of identity: pLtc 3a differs from pLtc 3b by one residue in the mature chain, and pLtc 4b differs from pLtc 4a-1 by 12 residues. For Ltc 4a, we found two related precursor sequences (pLtc 4a-1 and pLtc 4a-2) that differ by one repeat of a 28-residue block. We also found a close homolog of Ltc 2a that differs only by the C-terminal residue (Asn instead of His) and three additional sequences that share the overall structural organization with latarcins. The peptides were by analogy named latarcins: Ltc 2b for the Ltc 2a homolog and Ltc 6a and Ltc 7 for the new unrelated structures (Fig. 2B). Full precursor protein sequences were also identified for the new peptides (Fig. 2). Note that pLtc 6-1 and pLtc 6-2 are close homologs (pLtc 6-2 differs from pLtc 6-1 by two residues) and that both serve as precursors for Ltc 6a. The newly identified putative mature peptides Ltc 6a and Ltc 7 have negligible similarity (<20% identity) but share common characteristics with other latarcins, i.e. they represent short linear peptides with a net positive charge that may adopt amphipathic structures in an α-helical conformation. For this reason, Ltc 6a and Ltc 7 were chemically synthesized to investigate their possible functional activities. On the basis of structural organization features, latarcin precursor proteins may be subdivided into three groups (Fig. 2). Simple precursors have only one motif that specifies the propeptide-processing site. This site (X1X2X3R, where any of Xn = E) was initially identified in precursors of spider ion channel-blocking toxins and was described previously as the processing quadruplet motif (PQM) (12Kozlov S. Malyavka A. McCutchen B. Lu A. Schepers E. Herrmann R. Grishin E. Proteins. 2005; 59: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A simple latarcin precursor follows a structural organization scheme (prepropeptide) common to a wealth of secreted molecules and consists of a typical signal peptide, a rather extended acidic fragment (prosequence) that is removed post-translationally by cleavage at the PQM to finally yield the mature chain (latarcin) that corresponds to the C-terminal part of the precursor. Binary precursors differ from simple precursors by having two PQMs. Therefore, we suggest that these proteins give rise to two mature peptides each. By analogy with simple precursors, we named the C-terminal putative mature chain common to both binary precursors Ltc 6a. The preceding sequences enclosed between two PQMs in pLtc 6-1 and pLtc 6-2 were found to share ∼70% identity with Ltc 6a and were named Ltc 6b and Ltc 6c, respectively. Ltc 6c differs from Ltc 6b by one residue at position 30 (Lys instead of Arg). Thus, each of the binary precursors has a modular structure and seems to be processed post-translationally into two highly homologous mature peptides. Complex precursors have five (pLtc 4a-1 and pLtc 4b) or six (pLtc 4a-2) PQMs and are suggested to be cleaved into five or six mature peptides, respectively. The C-terminal parts of precursor proteins correspond to mature latarcins. Sequences enclosed between PQMs are organized into highly homologous tandem repeats named repetitive polypeptide elements (RPEs), which do not share homology with mature latarcins (Fig. 2C). For this reason, complex precursors are suggested to be cleaved post-translationally to yield two types of mature chains that may have different functions. In total, 12 precursor protein sequences yielding 19 mature linear peptides (12 putative) were deduced from the L. tarabaevi venom gland EST data base. CD Spectra—All synthetic latarcins were analyzed by CD spectroscopy to investigate their secondary structure in pure water and in membrane-mimicking 50% trifluoroethanol solution (Fig. 3). The results of secondary structure element content estimation by CD spectroscopy are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Secondary structures of latarcins as estimated by CD spectroscopySolutionSecondary structure contentα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnRandom%Ltc 1 Water9262243 50% TFEaTFE, trifluoroethanol782218Ltc 2a Water6302341 50% TFE694720Ltc 3a Water31162132 50% TFE871012Ltc 3b Water39112030 50% TFE851113Ltc 4a Water9292438 50% TFE881011Ltc 4b Water10262440 50% TFE881011Ltc 5 Water5242744 50% TFE861211Ltc 6a Water26182531 50% TFE6841315Ltc 7 Water17192440 50% TFE764911a TFE, trifluoroethanol Open table in a new tab Generally, similar to other well documented linear AMPs, latarcins assume a random coil structure in water and form α-helices in 50% trifluoroethanol, which is viewed as an indication of their high helix-forming propensities (13Giangaspero A. Sandri L. Tossi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5589-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Ltc 3a and Ltc 3b were shown to be peculiar; they become partially spiralized in water (>30% α-helix), which is unusual for short linear peptides. Biological Activities of Latarcins—Latarcins show pronounced antimicrobial effects against a number of Gram-positive (A. globiformis and B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) bacterial strains in vitro. The corresponding MICs are listed in Table 3. In general, latarcins show MICs in the low micromolar range. Among the bacterial species tested, P. aeruginosa turned out to be the most resistant, which was frequently observed previously for other AMPs (14Peschel A. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The growth of these bacteria was still effectively inhibited by Ltc 1, Ltc 2a, and Ltc 5. We have also proved that a bactericidal and not simply a bacteriostatic effect is achieved, although usually at higher concentrations than the MIC (data not shown). Moreover, the antibacterial action was significantly lower (4-20 times) in the presence of divalent cations (20 mm CaCl2), which agrees with the proposed mechanism of cationic AMP action that implies electrostatic binding to the negatively charged target membrane surface (15Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Latarcins were tested for antifungal activity against yeast cells (P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae), which were found to be much more resistant than bacteria, but their growth was still inhibited by higher concentrations of peptides (Table 3).TABLE 3Antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of latarcinsMICLtc 1Ltc 2aLtc 3aLtc 3bLtc 4aLtc 4bLtc 5Ltc 6aLtc 7μmGram-positive bacteria A. globiformis0.50.70.30.70.30.31.1>70>70 B. subtilis1.00.41.22.91.11.10.6>70>70Gram-negative bacteria E. coli DH5α1.00.52.5234.54.40.6>70>70 E. coli MH10.70.76.0283.24.40.6>70>70 P. aeruginosa4.16.7>40>45>35>3518>70>70Yeast P. pastoris176.7202336>35>37>70>70 S. cerevisiae>335420231835>37>70>70Hemolysis Rabbit erythrocytes (20% lysis)806.0>120>120>120>12040>120>120 Open table in a new tab Tests to determine the hemolytic activity of latarcins were performed and showed that erythrocytes are highly resistant to Ltc 3a, Ltc 3b, Ltc 4a, Ltc 4b, Ltc 6a, and Ltc 7 (Table 3). Ltc 2a exhibited comparatively strong hemolytic activity, whereas Ltc 1 and Ltc 5 were moderately hemolytic. Ltc 6a and Ltc 7 (identified as putative AMPs) showed neither antimicrobial nor hemolytic activity. Latarcins did not cause lethal effects on house fly larvae when applied individually (10 mg/kg) or in a mixture (10 mg/kg for each of the peptides). However, paralysis, appearance of necrotic spots, and liquid flow out of the injection opening were observed. Planar Bilayer Membrane Studies—Synthetic latarcins were studied for effects on the permeability of planar bilayer membranes that mimic zwitterionic eukaryotic (DPhPC) and anionic prokaryotic (DOPE/DOPG, 7:3) plasma membranes (Table 4). In general, the more biologically active peptides showed lower effective concentrations on the corresponding model membranes. Most of the peptides induced membrane breakdown at micromolar concentrations and negative potentials. However, Ltc 1 and Ltc 7 caused some conductance changes in membranes formed by DOPE/DOPG and DPhPC, respectively, without membrane rupture. We note that Ltc 6a and Ltc 7 were found to cause changes in model membrane permeability; therefore, we suggest a cytolytic function for these peptides with a biological target that might differ substantially from those tested in this work.TABLE 4Disruption of planar bilayer membranes by latarcins Minimal peptide concentrations that caused conductance changes under negative voltages (-80/-100 mV) are shown.PeptideMinimal effective concDPhPCDOPE/DOPG (7:3)μmLtc 10.50.5aConductance changes observed without membrane ruptureLtc 2a23Ltc 3a163Ltc 3b>192Ltc 4a712Ltc 4b516Ltc 50.40.4Ltc 6a174Ltc 77aConductance changes observed without membrane rupture8a Conductance changes observed without membrane rupture O"

Here we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase of EGFR, namely c-Cbl, also mediates receptor modification with the ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd8. EGF stimulates receptor neddylation, which enhances subsequent ubiquitylation, as well as sorting of EGFR for degradation. Multiple lysine residues, located within the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, serve as attachment sites for Nedd8. A set of clathrin coat-associated binders of ubiquitin also bind Nedd8, but they undergo ubiquitylation, not neddylation.

We discuss the emerging versatility of the concerted action of ubiquitylation and neddylation in the process that desensitizes growth factor-activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Growth factors and their transmembrane receptors, harboring intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, play essential roles in cell fate determination. Whereas the process leading to growth factor-induced activation of signaling pathways is relatively well understood, mechanisms that initiate signal desensitization are only beginning to be unraveled (reviewed in Ref. 1Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In analogy to the pivotal role played by phosphotyrosine and respective binding domains (e.g. Src homology domain 2) in positive signaling pathways, ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding domains (e.g. ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs)) regulate receptor endocytosis and sorting for lysosomal degradation (3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). For example, recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, called c-Cbl (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The appended ubiquitins are thought to recruit a set of endocytic proteins (e.g. Eps15) through their UIMs (reviewed in Ref. 11Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Hofmann K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well understood cellular functions of protein ubiquitylation, the roles played by ubiquitin-like proteins such as Nedd8 and SUMO are less characterized (12Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Nedd8 is the closest kin of ubiquitin and it is linked to other proteins by an amide bond linking the carboxyl-terminal carboxylate to lysine residues. Neddylation is initiated by a heterodimeric complex comprising Uba3 and the amyloid precursor protein-binding protein (APP-BP1). Ubc12, an E2-like component, then mediates conjugation of Nedd8 (13Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S. Tanaka K. Kato S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2263-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but the identity and function of Nedd8-specific E3 ligases are less understood. Modification of Cullins, the first discovered neddylation substrate, is promoted by Roc1/Rbx, a RING finger protein (14Gray W.M. Hellmann H. Dharmasiri S. Estelle M.

Cullins are shared subunits of SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL-F-box) complexes, assembled E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate ubiquitylation of proteins involved primarily in cell cycle control. Neddylation of Cullin1 and Cullin2 activates their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward substrates like p27 (18Morimoto M. Nishida T. Honda R. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which led to the suggestion that Nedd8 assists the positioning of the E2-ubiquitin complex and subsequent ubiquitin transfer (21Pan Z.-Q. Kentsis A. Dias D.C. Yamoah K. Wu K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1985-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Another target of neddylation is the cell cycle regulator, p53 (22Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.-C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The present report identifies EGFR as a target for neddylation by c-Cbl. Receptor neddylation strictly depends on ligand stimulation, and in coordination with ubiquitin, it accelerates sorting of EGFR to degradation. Materials and Antibodies—Unless indicated, materials were purchased from Sigma, radioactive materials from Amersham Biosciences, and antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to Nedd8 were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) or Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA). Receptor Down-regulation Assay—Ligand-induced down-regulation assays were performed as described (23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated for up to 2 h with EGF (100 ng/ml) in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.1% albumin) and then rinsed with ice-cold binding buffer. Surface-bound EGF was removed by using acetic acid wash (0.15 m NaCl, 0.15 m acetic acid, pH 2.8). The number of surface-exposed ligand binding sites was determined by incubating cells for 90 min at 4 °C with a radiolabeled EGF. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled ligand. Receptor Internalization Assay—Ligand-induced internalization was measured as previously described (24Sorkin A. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated with 125I-EGF (10 ng/ml) for 2–10 min. Then, monolayers were rapidly washed with ice-cold binding buffer. Subsequently, surface-bound 125I-EGF was removed using a low pH acetic acid wash (pH 2.8) and quantified (surface-bound ligand). The cells were then solubilized and their radioactivity quantified (internalized ligand). Construction of Expression Vectors and Transfection—Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A plasmid encoding a carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged EGFR was generated as follows. The FLAG sequence was inserted by PCR using oligonucleotides containing a BstEII site (5′-GCAGAAGGAGGCAAAGTGC-3′) or an XhoI site (5′-CAAAGCAGTGAATTTATTGGAGCAGGAGGAGGAGATTACAAGGACGACGATAAGTAGCTCGAGCGG-3′). Ligation in an expression plasmid was performed following restriction of DNA encoding EGFR and FLAG with these enzymes. Human Ubc12 expression vector was received from R. L. Neve (Harvard Medical School). FLAG-Ubc12 was generated by PCR amplification of full-length Ubc12 and introduced in conjunction with a FLAG sequence into a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Mouse 3Myc-Nedd8 (25Liakopoulos D. Busgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was provided by S.

Plasmids (1 μg, unless indicated) were introduced to cells using the Lipofectamine™ transfection method (Invitrogen). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were starved overnight for serum factors and then treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Establishment of Stably Expressing Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cell Derivatives—The CHO cell line carrying a temperature-sensitive E1 Nedd8-activating enzyme, ts41, and the parental cell line, E36, were obtained from J. Hirschberg (Hebrew University, Jerusalem). To establish stable derivatives expressing EGFR, we co-transfected cells with pcDNA3-EGFR and pBabe-Puro vectors. In Vitro Nedd8 Conjugation Assay—The reaction mixture contained rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATPγS, and 125I-labeled recombinant Nedd8. Bacterially purified recombinant GST-Cbl (50 μg) was added as indicated. EGFR was immunopurified from A431 cells and receptor-bound beads were incubated with the reaction mixture for 1 h at 30 °C. For labeling of Nedd8, we cleaved GST-Nedd8 with thrombin. Nedd8 (10 μg) was incubated with Na125I (1 mCi) and the IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce). Following incubation at 22 °C (5 min), free iodine was separated from Nedd8 using the D-Salt Excellulose Desalting Column (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation, Pulldown, and Immunoblotting Analyses—Cell extracts in solubilization buffer were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with antibodies pre-coupled to immunoglobulin-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times, followed by addition of gel sample buffer. Samples were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with albumin (3%), followed by blotting for 1 h with a primary antibody, washing with TBST and re-blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For pulldown assays, cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with glutathione-agarose beads or with GST fusion proteins precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads.

The following sense and the respective antisense sequence were selected for effective knockdown of Nedd8 in cells (construct C; nucleotides 162–181): 5′-GACAGCAGCTGATTACAAG-3′. Multiple Nedd8 Molecules Conjugate to EGFR in a Ligand and c-Cbl-dependent Manner—UIMs recognize ubiquitylated cargo through a hydrophobic surface patch on ubiquitin (28Bilodeau P.S. Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because the corresponding patch is conserved in the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 and conjugation of the latter is limited to monomers, we hypothesized that Nedd8 plays a role in endocytosis of EGFR. Hence, we briefly stimulated HeLa or RWPE-1 prostate cells with EGF and probed anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates with antibodies specific to Nedd8. This analysis detected weak neddylation and rapid down-regulation of the endogenous EGFR (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with receptor-null CHO cells ectopically expressing EGFR (Fig. 1A). Because c-Cbl ubiquitylates EGFR in a ligand-dependent manner, we tested if it can similarly conjugate Nedd8 to EGFR. Hence, we co-expressed EGFR and c-Cbl in CHO cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a peptide-tagged Nedd8. This experiment confirmed neddylation of EGFR upon treatment of cells with EGF (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that Nedd8 is directly conjugated to EGFR, rather than to an associated protein, we immunoprecipitated EGFR under denaturing conditions. This experiment made use of co-expressed FLAG-tagged EGFR, Myc-tagged Nedd8, and c-Cbl. Subsequent to stimulation with EGF, cell lysates were boiled in 1% SDS, prior to diluting out the detergent and immunoprecipitating EGFR. The enhanced signal observed upon stimulation with EGF, as well as the smeary appearance of the ligand-activated, covalently modified EGFR (Fig. 1C), indicate that Nedd8 directly conjugates to EGFR. In agreement with this conclusion, replacement of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Nedd8 with an alanine prevented conjugation to EGFR (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in line with the notion that Nedd8 forms no polymers analogous to lysine 48-linked chains of polyubiquitin, a mutant Nedd8 molecule whose lysine 48 has been replaced with an arginine retained normal conjugation to EGFR (Fig. 1D). Taken together with the retarded electrophoretic mobility of neddylated EGFR molecules, these observations imply that EGF enhances covalent conjugation of multiple (>10) monomers of Nedd8 to each receptor molecule. Because the level of Nedd8 is dynamic (29Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Nedd8 expression levels on receptor degradation. The results presented in Fig. 1E demonstrate that gradually increasing Nedd8 expression, reciprocally affects EGFR levels prior to activation by EGF, but the remaining receptor retains the characteristic ligand-induced degradation. Next, we examined the effect of ectopic Nedd8 in a receptor down-regulation assay. This assay utilizes transfected CHO cells, which overexpress EGFR and therefore their down-regulation is limited, unless an exogenous c-Cbl is introduced (23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 30Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As expected, ectopic expression of Nedd8 slightly accelerated the rate of EGF-induced down-regulation of EGFR (Fig. 1F). Likewise, ectopic expression of c-Cbl significantly enhanced receptor endocytosis, but maximal effects were observed upon co-expression of c-Cbl and an ectopic Nedd8 (Fig. 1F). In conclusion, c-Cbl mediates neddylation of EGFR, which is associated with accelerated removal of activated receptors from the cell surface. The RING and TKB Domains of Cbl Are Necessary for Neddylation of EGFR—Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 of EGFR recruits the TKB domain of c-Cbl (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined a kinase-defective mutant of EGFR (K721A), as well as a receptor mutated at tyrosine 1045. As expected, neither mutant underwent neddylation in EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Because the TKB domains of all three forms of Cbl, namely: c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3, share specificity, we envisaged that Cbl-b and Cbl-3 will mimic the neddylation effect of c-Cbl. This prediction was confirmed by ectopic co-expression of each Cbl protein together with Nedd8 (Fig. 2B and data not shown). c-Cbl contains several domains, whose involvement in receptor neddylation was tested by analyzing a series of mutants (Fig. 2C). Deletion of 17 amino acids from the RING (70Z-Cbl) abolished neddylation of EGFR (Fig. 2C). Likewise, defecting the zinc ligation scheme of the RING (C381A) eliminated EGFR modification. These observations predicted that the RING recruits not only ubiquitin-loaded E2s, such as UbcH7 (5Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), but also Nedd8-E2 complexes. To confirm this model, we analyzed the ability of c-Cbl to physically recruit UbcH7 and Ubc12 (an E2 specific to Nedd8). The results presented in Fig. 2D indicate co-precipitation of wild type c-Cbl with both E2s. Furthermore, no interaction was observed in the case of 70Z-Cbl. Similarly, replacing glycine 306, which is essential for phosphotyrosine binding, indicated involvement of the TKB of c-Cbl. Noteworthy is the observation that tyrosine 371 of c-Cbl, a putative phosphorylation site, is essential for receptor neddylation (Fig. 2C), as well as for ubiquitylation (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 32Thien C.B. Walker F. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, transphosphorylation on five tyrosine residues located at a regulatory carboxyl-terminal half of c-Cbl seems unnecessary (Fig. 2C). These observations are consistent with the following scenario: upon ligand binding, EGFR molecules undergo phosphorylation on tyrosine 1045, which binds the TKB domain of Cbl proteins. The recruited Cbl undergoes activation upon EGFR-induced transphosphorylation at the linker region (tyrosine 371 of c-Cbl), which allows the flanking RING to correctly orient Ubc12 molecules to discharge their thioester-bonded Nedd8 molecules onto EGFR. To test this model we reconstituted the reaction in a cell-free system comprising an immunopurified EGFR derived from A431 cells, a bacterially produced c-Cbl fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Cbl), a radiolabeled Nedd8, and reticulocyte extracts, a source of E1 and E2 components of the Nedd8 conjugation system. No significant neddylation of the isolated EGFR took place in vitro in the absence of c-Cbl, but the recombinant fusion protein remarkably induced neddylation of EGFR (Fig. 2E). A requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrated by complete inhibition of the neddylation signal by a kinase antagonist specific to EGFR (AG1478). Because in vitro ubiquitylation of EGFR occurs under similar conditions (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of adding unlabeled ubiquitin to the neddylation reaction. In line with the possibility that Nedd8 and ubiquitin are conjugated to overlapping sets of lysine residues of EGFR (see below), increasing concentrations of free ubiquitin gradually reduced receptor neddylation (Fig. 2E). In combination with results obtained with living cells, these observations attribute to c-Cbl a Nedd8-specific ligase activity toward EGFR. A Dominant-negative Mutant of Ubc12, as Well as Knockdown of Nedd8 Expression, Inhibits EGFR Down-regulation—Replacement of a cysteine residue conserved in the E2 family with a serine creates an effective dominant-negative mutant of Ubc12, which forms stable ester-bonded complexes with Nedd8 (33Wada H. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, we used Ubc12-C111S to sequester the endogenous Nedd8 of living cells. The results presented in Fig. 3A confirm that Ubc12-C111S covalently sequesters the endogenous Nedd8 of Bosc cells, as well as ectopic Myc-tagged Nedd8 molecules (bottom panel of Fig. 3A). As expected, Nedd8 sequestration inhibited receptor neddylation. Importantly, it also led to a reduction in ligand-induced degradation of EGFR and a significant enhancement of receptor expression (Fig. 3A). Along with other lines of evidence, these results establish a role for endogenous Nedd8 molecules in ligand-induced receptor degradation. CHO cells expressing the dominant-negative form of Ubc12 (Ubc12-C111S) displayed retarded receptor down-regulation, but cells ectopically expressing an inert mutant (C111A) exhibited normal receptor behavior (Fig. 3B). Thus, depletion of endogenous Nedd8 suggests that neddylation is essential for EGFR endocytosis. To test this conclusion, we used RNA interference. Three pSuper vectors (27Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) containing 19-nucleotide long inserts derived from nedd8 were tested. Because anti-Nedd8 antibodies better detect the conjugated protein than the free molecule, we utilized the aforementioned ability of Ubc12-C111S to bind Nedd8. When expressed in CHO cells, Ubc12-C111S displayed a protein band that was recognized by antibodies to Nedd8 (Fig. 3C). Upon co-expression of Nedd8 fused to three Myc peptide tags we observed an additional band corresponding to an Ubc12-(Myc)3-Nedd8 complex. Utilizing this system, we identified one siRNA construct (construct C), which reproducibly reduced the level of Ubc12-Nedd8 (Fig. 3C). Introduction of this construct, along with c-Cbl and EGFR, into CHO cells verified the ability of the vector to eliminate conjugation of ectopic Nedd8 to EGFR, and also revealed complete blockade of EGF-induced receptor degradation (Fig. 3D). These results established the efficacy of the siRNA approach, and enabled us to examine the involvement of the endogenous Nedd8 in receptor down-regulation (Fig. 3E). Depletion of endogenous Nedd8 almost completely blocked the initial phase of receptor down-regulation, but the inhibitory effect gradually decreased. Whereas complete blockade of receptor endocytosis in the first 10–15 min of EGF exposure is consistent with the observed inhibition of receptor degradation (Fig. 3D), the transient nature of the inhibitory effect may reflect siRNA instability or compensatory mechanisms. Regardless of the exact mechanism, depletion of endogenous Nedd8 by using either RNA interference or Ubc12-C111S clearly indicates that neddylation of EGFR is essential for ligand-induced down-regulation and degradation. Receptor Down-regulation Is Defective in ts41 Cells, but the E1 Activating Enzyme for Nedd8 Can Rescue the Defect—The ts41 mutant was derived from mutagen-treated CHO cells (E36) and it leads to cell cycle defects (34Handeli S. Weintraub H. Cell. 1992; 71: 599-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ectopic APP-BP1 gene, which encodes a subunit of the E1 activating enzyme for Nedd8, rescues the defect of ts41 cells (35Chen Y. McPhie D.L. Hirschberg J. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8929-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As an independent test of the biological significance of EGFR neddylation, we analyzed ligand-induced degradation of EGFR in ts41 cells grown at the permissive (32 °C) or restrictive (40 °C) temperatures, in comparison to the parental E36 cells (Fig. 4A). Whereas at 32 °C the two cell lines displayed similar kinetics of ligand-induced receptor degradation, this process was relatively slow in ts41 cells grown at the restrictive temperature. In line with partial dependence of EGFR degradation on intact neddylation, when stably expressed in ts41 cells and tested at 40 °C, EGFR displayed retarded down-regulation (Fig. 4B). To directly relate the defect of ts41 cells to the neddylation system, we repeated the down-regulation assay in cells transiently expressing the genetically defective component, APP-BP1. Due to ectopic expression of EGFR, which is known to saturate the endocytic pathway (30Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the extent of receptor down-regulation was limited, especially at 32 °C (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, the ectopically expressed E1 component of Nedd8 significantly enhanced receptor down-regulation. As expected, APP-BP1 elicited no effect on the rate of receptor down-regulation in E36 cells or in ts41 cells maintained at the permissive temperature (Fig. 4C). Because it was postulated that Cbl plays a critical role at the level of endosomal sorting, rather than at the level of internalization (23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28950-28960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we analyzed EGFR internalization rates. As expected, the uptake of a radioactive EGF at 32 °C was slower than the rate of internalization at 40 °C. Moreover, ts41 and E36 cells displayed essentially identical rates (Fig. 4D), in line with intactness of the endocytic machinery of ts41 cells and a non-essential role for Cbl-mediated neddylation/ubiquitylation in the initial phase of endocytosis. In summary, the results obtained with ts41 cells confirm a role for the neddylation machinery in late endocytic sorting of EGFR. Nedd8 Conjugation Enhances Ligand-induced Ubiquitylation of EGFR—We next examined the possibility that neddylated EGFR molecules serve as better targets for ubiquitylation. Sequestering endogenous Nedd8 molecules of CHO cells using an overexpressed Ubc12-C111S remarkably reduced the extent of EGF-induced receptor ubiquitylation, and also moderately stabilized EGFR (Fig. 5A). Another experimental approach entailed expressing ectopic Nedd8 at very low levels. Under these conditions receptor neddylation was barely detectable (Fig. 5B and data not shown), but ubiquitylation was clearly enhanced. Hence, both results support the notion that receptor neddylatio"

Alternative mRNA splicing of the PDE genes produces over 60 PDE isoforms that distribute in various cellular compartments and control physiological processes. PDE molecules contain a conserved catalytic domain and variable regulatory regions.

We report here the structure of the catalytic domain of human PDE5A1 in the unliganded state, as well as the structures of the protein in complex with inhibitors sildenafil and icarisid II (Fig. 1). These structures, together with that of PDE5A1-IBMX, reveal four different conformations of the H-loop, which is juxtaposed to the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. In addition, comparison of this PDE5-sildenafil structure with the previously published structures shows significantly different conformations of the methylpiperazine portion of sildenafil. These unique features of the PDE5 catalytic domain and the sildenafil configuration are key considerations for understanding the action of sildenafil and for development of PDE5 inhibitors. Protein Expression and Purification of Catalytic Domain PDE5A1—The cDNA of the catalytic domain of human PDE5A1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the bovine PDE5A cDNA (23Huai Q. Liu Y.

The coding regions for amino acids 535-860 of PDE5A1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the expression vector pET15b.

The E. coli cell carrying pET-PDE5A1 was grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.7, and 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added for further growth at 15 °C overnight. Recombinant PDE5A1 was purified by the columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), Q-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Biosciences). A typical purification yielded over 10 mg of PDE5A1 with a purity of >95% from a 2-liter cell culture. The mutant proteins with deletion of residues 663-678 and 661-681 were produced by the standard protocol of site-directed mutagenesis. For the deletion mutant proteins, four glycine residues were inserted as the spacer to minimize the disturbance on the three-dimensional structure. Overexpression and purification of the mutant proteins used the same protocols as for the nonmutated protein. Expression and Purification of Full-length hPDE5A1—Human cDNA coding for full-length PDE5A1 was cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) and then ligated into the baculovirus expression vector pAcHLT-A (Pharmingen). The resulting plasmid pAcA-PDE5 (Met1-Asn875) was used to make point mutations (G659A, V660Q, N661A, N662A, Y664A, H678A, and S679A) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild type and mutant constructs of hPDE5A1 were expressed in Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells were cotransfected with BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) and one of the pAcA-hPDE5A1 plasmids. The cotransfection supernatant was collected at 5 days post-infection, amplified three times in Sf9 cells, and then used directly as virus stock without additional purification. Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in complete Grace's insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) were typically infected with 100 μl of viral stock and then harvested at 92 h post-infection. Protein yields were ∼2.7 mg/liter infected cell media and were largely soluble. The Sf9 cell pellet (∼2 × 107 cells) was resuspended in icecold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitor mixture, homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose (Qiagen) column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing a stepwise gradient of 0.8-20 mm imidazole and eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Eluted PDE5A1 protein was dialyzed versus 2000 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 150 mm NaCl. All recombinant PDE5A1 proteins exhibited a purity of >98% as determined by SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic Assay—Enzymatic activity of the isolated catalytic domains of wild type PDE5A1 and its deletion mutants was assayed by using [3H]cGMP as substrate in a reaction mixture of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2,[3 H]cGMP (40,000 cpm/assay) at 24 °C for 15 min (25Wang H. Liu Y. Chen Y. Robinson H. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30949-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.2 m ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2. Radioactivity of unreacted [3 H]cGMP in the supernatant was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The turnover rate was measured at nine concentrations of cGMP and controlled at hydrolysis of 15-40% substrate. Each measurement was repeated three times. For measurement of IC50 values, 10 concentrations of inhibitors were used at a substrate concentration that was one-tenth of the Km value and an enzyme concentration that hydrolyzed 50% of substrate. To assay the activity of full-length hPDE5A1, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05-250 μm cGMP, and [3H]cGMP (100,000-150,000 cpm/assay) and one of the PDE5A1 proteins (26Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation time was 10 min at 30 °C. In all studies, less than 10% of total [3H]cGMP was hydrolyzed during the reaction. All values determined represent three measurements. The Km and kcat values for cGMP were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of data using Prism GraphPad software. Crystallization and Data Collection—All crystals of PDE5A1-(535-860) were grown by vapor diffusion. The protein drop was prepared by mixing 2 μl of protein with 2 μl of well buffer. The unliganded PDE5A1 crystal was grown at room temperature against well buffer of 0.2 m MgSO4, 0.1 m Tris base, pH 8.5, 12% PEG 3350, and 2% ethanol. The PDE5A1-sildenafil complex was prepared by mixing 1 mm sildenafil with 15 mg/ml PDE5A1 at 4 °C overnight and crystallized against a well buffer of 1.0 m sodium citrate, 2.5% ethanol, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The PDE5A1-icarisid II complex was prepared by mixing 2 mm icarisid II with 15 mg/ml protein at 4 °C overnight, and crystallized against a well buffer of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 12% PEG3350 at room temperature. The unliganded PDE5A1-(535-860) was crystallized in the space group P3121 with cell dimensions of a = b = 74.7 and c = 130.7 Å. The PDE5A1-sildenafil crystal had the space group P6222 with cell dimensions of a = b = 164.6 and c = 193.1 Å. The PDE5A1-icarisid II crystal had the space group P6122 with cell dimensions of a = b = 110.7 and c = 106.2 Å. Beamline X25 at Brookhaven National Laboratory was used for collection of diffraction data of the unliganded PDE5A1 and X29 for PDE5A1-sildenafil and PDE5A1-icarisid II (Table 1). All data were processed by the program HKL (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure of the unliganded PDE5A1 was solved by rigid body refinement of the PDE5A1 catalytic domain in PDE5A1-IBMX. The structures of PDE5A1 in complex with sildenafil and icarisid II were solved by the molecular replacement program AMoRe (28Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), using the PDE5A1-IBMX structure without the H-loop and IBMX as the initial model. The rotation and translation searches for the crystal of PDE5A1-icarisid II yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.74 and R-factor of 0.31 for 3054 reflections between 4 and 8 Å resolution. The rotation and translation searches for PDE5A1-sildenafil yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.22 and R-factor of 0.52 for 11,612 reflections between 4 and 8 Å resolution for the first molecule, and of 0.39 and 0.41 after the second molecule was added. The electron density map was improved by the density modification package of CCP4 (29Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Multiple Conformations of the H-loop of PDE5—The crystallographic asymmetric units contain one molecule of the catalytic domain in the structures of the unliganded PDE5A1 and the icarisid II complex but three molecules in PDE5A1-sildenafil structure. The electron density maps showed that the entire catalytic domain in the PDE5A1-icarisid II structure and molecule A in the PDE5A1-sildenafil structure were traceable. However, residues 668-676 of molecules B and C in the PDE5A1-sildenafil crystal and residues 793-807 in the unliganded PDE5A1 lacked electron density and were disordered. The Ramachandran plots showed that the backbone conformations of 90-94% residues in the three structures were located in the most favored regions, and no residues were located in the energetically disallowed regions. The structures of the unliganded PDE5A1 catalytic domain (residues 535-860) and its complexes with sildenafil or icarisid II are composed of 14 common α-helices and a variable H-loop at the active site (Fig. 2). Structural superposition of the unliganded PDE5A1 over the complexes of PDE5A1-IBMX, PDE5A1-sildenafil, and PDE5A1-icarisid II yielded r.m.s. deviations of 0.29, 0.42, and 0.54 Å for the Cα atoms of comparable residues (536-659, 684-787, and 810-860), respectively, suggesting overall structural similarity. However, the H-loop (residues 660-683 on the basis of the structural comparison with seven other PDE families, which are slightly different from the previous assignment of residues 661-676 (23Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13095-13101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) adopts four conformations and different tertiary structures in the crystals of the unliganded PDE5A1 and its complexes with IBMX, sildenafil, or icarisid II. In the unliganded PDE5A1 structure, the H-loop contains a few turns, but the majority of the H-loop residues are in a coil conformation (Fig. 2). Binding of IBMX converts the H-loop into two short α-helices involving residues 664-667 and 672-676 (Fig. 2F) and shifts the Cα atoms of the H-loop as much as 7 Å from those in the unliganded structure. In the structure of the PDE5-sildenafil complex, the H-loop in molecule A is converted to a turn and a 310 helix at residues 672-675, and the whole loop migrates as much as 24 Å to cover the active site (Fig. 2). However, residues 668-676 of the H-loop in molecules B and C are disordered. The most dramatic change in the H-loop occurs in the structure of PDE5A1-icarisid II, in which the H-loop contains two β-strands at residues 662-666 and 675-679 (Fig. 2F) and migrates as much as 35 Å from the position in the unliganded PDE5A1. To verify that the conformational changes are not because of an artifact of structure determination or crystal packing, electron density maps were calculated, and lattice interactions in the various crystal forms were examined. The maps that were calculated from the structure with omission of the H-loop showed solid electron density for almost all residues of the H-loops, thus confirming the true conformational variation in the PDE5A1 structures. This is supported by the fact that the B-factor for the H-loops is comparable with or slightly higher than the overall average B-factor for the protein atoms as follows: 48 versus 38 Å2 for the unliganded PDE5A1, 61 versus 40 Å2 for PDE5A1-IBMX, 33 versus 33 Å2 for PDE5A1-icarisid II, and 38 versus 27 Å2 for PDE5A1-sildenafil. In addition, the following facts suggest minor roles of the lattice contacts in the conformational changes of the H-loop. First, the unliganded PDE5A1 and its IBMX complex have the same space group and the similar unit cell parameters (a = b = 74.7, c = 130.7 Å versus a = b = 74.5, c = 130.1 Å) but different H-loop conformations. Second, the PDE4 H-loop that was inserted into the chimeric PDE5 structure is involved in the crystal lattice interactions of PDE5 but retains its conformation found in PDE4 (22Zhang K.Y. Card G.L. Suzuki Y. Artis D.R. Fong D. Gillette S. Hsieh D. Neiman J. West B.L. Zhang C. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. Schlessinger J. Bollag G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 279-2861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, the dramatic conformational changes of the H-loop must be the consequence of binding of the specific inhibitors. In addition to variation of the H-loop, minor conformational differences are observed for another active site loop, the M-loop (residues 788-811 on the basis of the structural comparison among seven PDE families, in comparison to the original assignment of residues 787-812 (23Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13095-13101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). Residues 793-807 of the M-loop are not traceable in the structures of the unliganded or IBMX-bound PDE5A1. However, the well ordered M-loops in the structures of PDE5A1 in complex with sildenafil or icarisid II contain an extra 310 helix and a 10-residue extension of α-helix H14, in addition to the correspondence of a 310 helix to the N-terminal portion of H15 in the unliganded PDE5A1 (Fig. 2F). PDE5 shows an apparently unique feature distinct from other PDE families, although the overall topological folding of PDE5A is similar to those of PDE1B (22Zhang K.Y. Card G.L. Suzuki Y. Artis D.R.

The core catalytic domains of PDE1-4, -7, and -9 (residues 115-411 in PDE4D2), including the H-loop that is composed of two short α-helices (H8 and H9, residues 209-215 and 218-222 in PDE4D2l; see Fig. 2F) have a uniform conformation and are superimposable on one another. In contrast, the H-loop of PDE5A1 presents at least four different conformations, and none of these is comparable with any of the corresponding H-loops in other PDE families. The closest comparable conformation is the H-loop in the PDE5A1-IBMX structure, which also contains two short α-helices. However, these two helices have as much as 7 Å positional difference from those in PDE4D2 (23Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13095-13101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and are in a different three-dimensional arrangement. In addition, the β-strand component of the H-loop in the PDE5A1-icarisid II complex is unique among active sites of known PDE structures. Therefore, the active site of PDE5 appears to belong to a special category of the PDE superfamily. Conformation Variation of Sildenafil—Sildenafil binds to each active site of three PDE5A1 catalytic domains in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with similar conformation and occupancy, as shown by the comparable B-factor and the clean electron density in the omitted map (Fig. 3). The binding of sildenafil causes a dramatic conformational change of the H-loop and a movement as much as 24 Å from that in the unliganded PDE5 structure. A direct consequence of the H-loop movement is the transformation of the open PDE5A1 active site to a closed pocket. Sildenafil is partially buried in the pocket. Solvent-accessible surface of sildenafil after binding to PDE5A1 is reduced to 9.4% of the total surface area. Sildenafil borders the metalbinding pocket but does not directly interact with the metal ions. The pyrazolopyrimidinone group (R1 in Fig. 1 and Table 2) of sildenafil stacks against Phe820 of PDE5A1 and also contacts residues Tyr612, Leu765, Ala767, and Gln817. The O1 and N4 atoms of pyrazolopyrimidinone form two hydrogen bonds with Nϵ2 and Oϵ1ofGln817, respectively. The ethoxyphenyl group (R2, Fig. 1) interacts via van der Waals forces with Val782, Ala783, Phe786, Leu804, Ile813, Gln817, and Phe820. The methylpiperazine group (R, Fig. 1) contacts Asn662, Ser6633, Tyr664, Ile665, Leu804, and Phe820. The oxygen atoms of the sulfone group interact mainly with Phe820.TABLE 2Interactions of sildenafil and icarisid II with PDE5AView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table"
https://openalex.org/W2141275308,"The main role of the plasma membrane Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent ATPase (PMCA) is in the removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol. Recently, we and others have suggested a new function for PMCA as a modulator of signal transduction pathways. This paper shows the physical interaction between PMCA (isoforms 1 and 4) and alpha-1 syntrophin and proposes a ternary complex of interaction between endogenous PMCA, alpha-1 syntrophin, and NOS-1 in cardiac cells. We have identified that the linker region between the pleckstrin homology 2 (PH2) and the syntrophin unique (SU) domains, corresponding to amino acids 399-447 of alpha-1 syntrophin, is crucial for interaction with PMCA1 and -4. The PH2 and the SU domains alone failed to interact with PMCA. The functionality of the interaction was demonstrated by investigating the inhibition of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase-1 (NOS-1); PMCA is a negative regulator of NOS-1-dependent NO production, and overexpression of alpha-1 syntrophin and PMCA4 resulted in strongly increased inhibition of NO production. Analysis of the expression levels of alpha-1 syntrophin protein in the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, uterus, kidney, or liver of PMCA4-/- mice, did not reveal any differences when compared with those found in the same tissues of wild-type mice. These results suggest that PMCA4 is tethered to the syntrophin complex as a regulator of NOS-1, but its absence does not cause collapse of the complex, contrary to what has been reported for other proteins within the complex, such as dystrophin. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate for the first time the localization of PMCA1b and -4b to the syntrophin.dystrophin complex in the heart and provide a specific molecular mechanism of interaction as well as functionality."
https://openalex.org/W1976794024,"Genetic disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis result in accumulation of cholesterol precursors and cause severe disease. We examined whether cholesterol precursors alter the stability and properties of ordered lipid domains (rafts). Tempo quenching of a raft-binding fluorophore was used to measure raft stability in vesicles containing sterol, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, and one of the following ordered domain-forming lipids/lipid mixtures: dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM), a SM/cerebroside mixture or a SM/ceramide (cer) mixture. Relative to cholesterol, early cholesterol precursors containing an 8-9 double bond (lanosterol, dihydrolanosterol, zymosterol, and zymostenol) only weakly stabilized raft formation by SM or DPPC. Desmosterol, a late precursor containing the same 5-6 double bond as cholesterol, but with an additional 24-25 double bond, also stabilized domain formation weakly. In contrast, two late precursors containing 7-8 double bonds (lathosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol) were better raft stabilizers than cholesterol. For vesicles containing SM/cerebroside and SM/cer mixtures the effect of precursor upon raft stability was small, although the relative effects of different precursors were the same. Using both detergent resistance and a novel assay involving fluorescence quenching induced by certain sterols we found cholesterol precursors were displaced from cer-rich rafts, and could displace cer from rafts. Precursor displacement by cer was inversely correlated to precursor raft-stabilizing abilities, whereas precursor displacement of cer was greatest for the most highly raft-stabilizing precursors. These observations support the hypothesis that sterols and cer compete for raft-association (Megha, and London, E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9997-10004). The results of this study have important implications for how precursors might alter raft structure and function in cells, and for the Bloch hypothesis, which postulates that sterol properties are gradually optimized for function along the biosynthetic pathway.

The results of this study have important implications for how precursors might alter raft structure and function in cells, and for the Bloch hypothesis, which postulates that sterol properties are gradually optimized for function along the biosynthetic pathway. De novo cholesterol biosynthesis proceeds through various intermediates. Conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol involves a series of demethylation, double bond isomerization, dehydrogenation, and reduction steps (Fig. 1). In genetic disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis mutations in genes coding for enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway lead to a loss or reduction in enzymatic function, and an accumulation of sterol precursors. Mutations in the 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) 2The abbreviations used are: 7-DHC, 7-dehydrocholesterol; Cer, ceramide (N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine); DOPC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; DPPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; LcT-MADPH, 22-(diphenylhexatrienyl)docosyltrimethylammonium; LW peptide, acetyl-K2W2L8AL8W2K2-amide; SM, porcine brain sphingomyelin; tempo, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; TX-100, Triton X-100; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; MLV, multilamellar vesicles; SLOS, Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome. reductase gene, which catalyzes the conversion of 7-DHC to cholesterol, result in 7-DHC accumulation and Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome (SLOS) (1Irons M.

In addition, mutations in 3β-hydroxysteroid Δ8 sterol isomerase, terminating synthesis at zymosterol, have been implicated in CHILD syndrome and the disorder CDPX2 (4Braverman N. Lin P. Moebius F.F.

All of these genetic disorders manifest themselves as broad malformation diseases with overlapping symptoms that include features such as microcephaly, skeletal abnormalities, and both overall growth and mental retardation (5Porter F.D.

Participation in the formation and function of ordered lipid domains (lipid rafts) is believed to be an important function of sterols in eukaryotic membranes. Lipid rafts are usually defined as sphingolipid and sterol-rich domains that exist in the liquid-ordered phase (Lo). In eukaryotic cell membranes they are thought to co-exist with liquid disordered (Ld) domains that are rich in lipids with unsaturated acyl chains. The Lo phase is an intermediate state with tightly packed lipids, like the solid-like gel phase, and a high lipid lateral diffusion rate, like that found in the Ld phase (7Schroeder R. London E.

We found that cer is a strong promoter of lipid raft formation (13Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and cer has a high affinity for rafts (14Megha London E. J. Biol.

Recently, we found that cholesterol is displaced from cer-rich rafts (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Displacement of cholesterol has now been confirmed by other groups, both in model membranes and cells (23Yu C. Alterman M. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1678-1691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Alanko S.M. Halling K.K. Maunula S. Slotte J.P. Ramstedt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1715: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of cholesterol biosynthesis disorders and lipid rafts we examined the raft-stabilizing properties of combinations of a wide variety of cholesterol precursors and sphingolipids. A novel fluorescence assay (25Bakht O. London E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 202AGoogle Scholar) was employed to assess raft formation and stability in model membranes. This assay monitors the quenching of fluorescent probes bound to lipid bilayers by tempo, a small nitroxide-carrying quencher, which binds strongly to bilayers that are in the Ld state (26Kleemann W. McConnell H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 419: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We find that there is a difference in the raft-stabilizing properties of different precursors, but stabilization does not improve gradually along the biosynthetic pathway. Instead, there is a distinct difference between raft stabilization by the early precursors and certain later precursors. We also show that substitution of precursors for cholesterol affects the sterol content of cer-rich rafts. These results have important implications for how sterol composition could affect raft structure and function in cells. Materials—Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), sphingomyelin (porcine brain, SM), cholesterol, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C16:0 ceramide), total brain cerebrosides, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [3H]C16:0 ceramide was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Lipid (including radiolabeled lipid) purity was confirmed by TLC. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (tempo), 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), lanosterol (“97% pure”), and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) (Fluka brand), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Zymosterol, zymostenol (zymosterol with a saturated 24-25 double bond), dihydrolanosterol, desmosterol, and lathosterol were purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). Desmosterol was also obtained from Research Plus (Manasquan, NJ). 22-(Diphenylhexatrienyl)-docosyltrimethyl ammonium, (LcTMADPH) was a gift of G. Duportail and D. Heissler (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg). Lipids and probes were stored dissolved in ethanol at −20 °C. Concentrations were determined by dry weight or (for LcTMADPH) absorbance using an ϵ of 88,000 cm−1 m−1 at 350 nm in ethanol. Acetyl-K2W2L8AL8W2K2-amide (LW peptide) purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) was used without further purification. Triton X-100 (scintillation grade) was from Yorktown Research (Hackensack, NJ). Sterol purity was confirmed by comparison of sterol melting temperatures to those reported by the manufacturers, and by TLC on HP-TLC plates (Merck & Co). Zymosterol and some desmosterol preparations contained impurities and were repurified by TLC. Approximately 1 mg of sterol was dissolved in ethanol, applied to an HP-TLC plate, and then chromatographed using a sequential solvent system. Solvent chambers were equilibrated with solvents for at least 2 h before chromatography. The first solvent (50:38:3:2 (v:v), chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water) was allowed to migrate halfway up the plate. The plate was then dried, introduced into a second chamber containing the solvent system 1:1 hexane/ethyl acetate (v:v), and chromatographed until the solvent migrated to near the top of the plate. The plate was then dried and sprayed with 5% (w/v) cupric acetate dissolved in 8% (v/v) phosphoric acid in water. To detect sterol, plates were charred at 180 °C for 5 min. To purify sterol, the region of the plate containing the pure sterol (identified from a fragment of the plate in which sterol was charred) was scraped off, dissolved in 1:1 (v:v) chloroform/methanol, centrifuged to remove the silica particles, filtered on 0.22-μ nitrocellulose to remove residual silica, and then dried under nitrogen flow. Purity was confirmed as described above. Commercial desmosterol preparations with no impurities gave experimental results similar to those obtained with purified desmosterol. Vesicle Preparation—Ethanol dilution small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) and multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were prepared as described previously (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Vesicles containing the desired lipid mixtures were dispersed at 70 °C in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7) at a final lipid concentration of 50 μm (for SUV) and 500 μm (for MLV). Fluorescence measurements were made after samples cooled to room temperature. For fluorescence measurements, vesicles also contained 0.1-0.2 mol % LcTMADPH or 0.5 mol % DPH. Background samples lacking fluorescent probe were also prepared. Fluorescence Measurements—A scaled-up stock sample of SUV, prepared as described above, was divided into four 1-ml aliquots. Two samples containing quencher (F samples) were prepared by adding tempo to a concentration of 2 mm (from a 353 mm stock solution of tempo dissolved in ethanol). Two samples lacking quencher (Fo samples) were prepared by adding a volume of pure ethanol equal to that added to the F samples. Both F and Fo samples were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which fluorescence was measured. LcTMADPH or DPH fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 357 nm and emission wavelength 429 nm. Fluorescence was measured on a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter using quartz semimicro cuvettes (excitation path length: 10 mm, emission: 4 mm). Unless otherwise noted, slit bandwidths were 3.2-nm excitation and 6.3-nm emission. Fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of increasing temperature as described previously (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The ratio of fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher to that in its absence (F/Fo) was calculated after subtraction of background values. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed on SUV prepared as described previously, but using vesicles containing 0.5 mol % DPH or LcTMADPH (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Anisotropy measurements were made at room temperature using a SPEX automated Glan-Thompson polarizer accessory with slit bandwidths set at 4.2 nm (excitation) and 8.4 nm (emission). Peptide Quenching by Sterol—SUV containing 50 μm total lipid and 2 mol % LW peptide were prepared by ethanol dilution as described above. Peptide fluorescence was measured at 280-nm excitation and 340-nm emission wavelengths. Excitation and emission bandwidths were both 6.3 nm. Fluorescence from background samples lacking peptide was subtracted from that of peptide-containing samples to determine peptide fluorescence. Quenching of peptide fluorescence by sterol was assessed by calculation of F/Fo, where F samples contained 7-DHC, and Fo samples contained cholesterol in place of 7-DHC. Detergent Insolubility Assay—To MLV samples (500 nmol of total lipid dissolved in 950 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7) 50 μl of 10% (w/v) Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, was added. The samples were incubated for 2 h at 23°C, and then detergent-insoluble lipid was isolated by centrifugation as described previously (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The detergent-insoluble pellet, equivalent to the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction, was then resuspended in 100 μl of water, transferred to a glass vial, and dried under high vacuum for 45 min. The dried pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of 1:1 (v:v) chloroform/methanol. A 5-μl aliquot of this was then applied to a HP-TLC plate. Separate spots containing various amounts of the lipids used (0.25-4 μg) were also applied to the plate as standards. The sequential two-solvent system described above was used to separate lipids. Lipids were detected by charring as described above, and after the plate cooled, it was scanned as an image (CanonScan N124OU). Spot intensity was analyzed using the NIH/Scion Image program. Unknown lipid and sterol amounts were estimated by comparison to the standards, which generally exhibited a non-linear, but monotonic, increase in staining intensity as the amount of lipid applied was increased. The percent of each lipid species in the insoluble fraction was computed from the formula: (amount of lipid species in the pellet in nmol/total amount of lipid in pellet in nmol) × 100%. The total amount of lipid (including sterol) in the insoluble fraction was calculated in nmol, and total % insoluble lipid was computed from the formula: (total amount of insoluble lipid in nmol/total amount of lipid in initial sample (500 nmol)) × 100%. The amount of insoluble cer was determined by measurement of radioactivity in the pelleted lipid fraction as previously described (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Samples contained 0.25 μCi of [3H]C16:0 cer. How Raft Stability Is Assayed by Fluorescence Quenching—A fluorescence quenching assay was used to determine whether ordered domains/rafts were present in vesicles composed of lipid mixtures containing cholesterol precursors. We developed an assay in which the quencher tempo was used (25Bakht O. London E. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 202AGoogle Scholar) instead of the nitroxide-labeled lipids we used previously (13Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 25Bakht O. London E. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Tempo is water soluble, but binds strongly to disordered domains (26Kleemann W. McConnell H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 419: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The fluorescent probe used was LcTMADPH, a derivative of DPH. LcTMADPH has a very high affinity for rafts, and is resistant to displacement from rafts by cer (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To examine the thermal stability of rafts, two sets of vesicles containing LcTMADPH were prepared: vesicles that contain tempo (F samples) and vesicles that lack tempo (Fo samples). In vesicles containing co-existing ordered and disordered domains LcTMADPH and tempo segregate, and F/Fo is high. As temperature increases the rafts melt, and the bilayer becomes progressively more homogenous. This ultimately abolishes segregation of LcTMADPH and tempo, and F/Fo decreases. For samples exhibiting a sigmoidal dependence of quenching upon temperature, melting temperature (Tm) can be defined: the more raft stabilizing the lipid mixture used, the higher the observed Tm (13Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Xu X. London E.

Tm values for rafts measured using tempo quenching were similar to those in analogous mixtures containing nitroxide-labeled lipids (13Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cholesterol Precursors Stabilize Raft Formation to Varying Degrees—The effect of cholesterol precursor structure upon the thermal stability of rafts was assayed using quenching. The sterols studied are shown in the schematic of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). The two missing precursors were not available. Notice that there are two “vertical” branches to the pathway, which only differ in terms of whether the 24-25 double bond in the sterol “tail” is unsaturated (left branch) or reduced (right branch). In addition to sterols, the samples contained 1:1 mol:mol mixtures of a lipid that tend to form disordered domains at 23 °C (DOPC) with lipids that tend to form rafts at 23 °C (DPPC or sphingolipids). Fig. 2A shows the effect of temperature upon quenching of LcTMADPH fluorescence by tempo in vesicles composed of 3:3:2 DPPC/DOPC/sterol. Tm values for these mixtures are summarized in Table 1. Tm values in the presence of precursors and cholesterol are higher than in the absence of sterol. This shows that all precursors increase the thermal stability of rafts, i.e. they promote raft formation at temperatures where rafts are not stable in the absence of sterol. Cholesterol precursors formed during earlier steps in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, lanosterol, dihydrolanosterol, zymosterol, and zymostenol, stabilize ordered domain formation to a significantly lesser degree than cholesterol.TABLE 1Relationship between sterol precursor structure and raft melting temperature (Tm) in model membranes containing various sphingolipids or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine The data are derived from the samples used in the quenching experiments in Fig. 2. Samples contained mixtures of sphingolipid (or DPPC), DOPC and sterol in the proportions given in Figure 2. Tm was defined as the point of maximum slope in the sigmoidal melting curves (see Fig. 2). The average and range of Tm values from duplicate samples is shown.SterolTm (°C) of ordered domainsDPPCSMSM/CERBSM/CERNone25 ± 0.422.3 ± 0.932 ± 0.341.2 ± 0.3Lanosterol28 ± 0.327.7 ± 0.136.2 ± 0.338.3 ± 0.0Dihydrolanosterol26 ± 0.225.6 ± 1.035.3 ± 0.639.5 ± 1.0Zymosterol29.7 ± 0.231.4 ± 0.139.3 ± 0.638.7 ± 0.2Zymostenol31.4 ± 0.230.2 ± 0.336.6 ± 1.138.1 ± 0.5Desmosterol30.2 ± 0.327.6 ± 0.534.1 ± 0.336.7 ± 0.4Lathosterol42.9 ± 0.338.8 ± 1.841.5 ± 0.442.8 ± 0.77-DHC44.4 ± 0.138.5 ± 1.241.7 ± 0.244.8 ± 0.2Cholesterol34.1 ± 034 ± 0.437.6 ± 0.641.8 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Two precursors that occur late in the branch of the biosynthetic pathway lacking a 24-25 double bond, lathosterol and 7-DHC, stabilize ordered domain formation to a greater degree than cholesterol. In contrast, desmosterol, which is the last precursor in the branch in which the 24-25 double bond is present, and has a ring structure identical to that of cholesterol, stabilizes rafts to a much lesser degree than cholesterol. This is somewhat surprising, because Tm values show that the 24-25 double bond does not have a strongly destabilizing effect in the case of lanosterol and zymosterol. Cholesterol Precursors Stabilize Raft Formation to Varying Degrees: Effect of Sphingolipid Structure—Because rafts in cells should contain sphingolipid, whether sterol structure would affect the stability of rafts was also studied in vesicles containing various sphingolipids. First, the stability of rafts was measured in mixtures of mammalian brain SM/DOPC/sterol 3:3:2 (mol: mol). Fig. 2B and Table 1 show that the relative ability of different precursors to stabilize ordered domain formation in these mixtures is very similar to that observed in analogous mixtures containing DPPC. Experiments were then performed in mixtures containing mixed mammalian cerebrosides in place of almost one-third of the SM. This is of interest because glycosphingolipids can form a considerable fraction of total cellular sphingolipid under some conditions (30Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the presence of cerebrosides can lessen the effect of sterol on raft stability (13Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, the thermal stability of rafts in 2.04:0.96:3:2 SM/cerebrosides/DOPC/sterol (mol:mol) is only modestly affected by the presence of sterol or precursor structure (Fig. 2C). The former is illustrated most clearly by a comparison of the difference between Tm values in samples without sterol and those containing the most raft-stabilizing precursors. For the DPPC-containing samples this difference in Tm values is 19 °C, and for SM-containing samples the difference is 17 °C, but for the samples containing SM plus cerebroside the difference is only 10 °C. This behavior is consistent with the possibility that the cerebroside-rich rafts contain only low levels of sterol. If the rafts lack sterol, it could reduce the influence of sterol on their stability. Nevertheless, the overall pattern observed is similar to that in samples lacking cerebrosides, in that all sterols stabilize rafts to some degree, and the most stabilizing sterols are 7-DHC and lathosterol. One interesting difference in cerebroside-containing samples is the relatively strong stabilization of rafts by zymosterol. Finally, the effect of sterol precursor structure was examined in mixtures of 2.04:0.96:3:2 SM/C16:0 cer/DOPC/sterol (i.e. 12 mol % cer). These mixtures were of interest because of reports that cer-rich rafts can be physiologically important (12Bollinger C.R. Teichgraber V. Gulbins E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). (Samples with 12 mol % cer were studied because at higher cer concentrations sterol displacement might be complete (14Megha London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9997-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and thus obscure differences between different cholesterol precursors.) As shown in Fig. 2D and Table 1, sterol presence and structure has only small effects on the stability of rafts in cercontaining samples (the difference between the Tm of samples without sterol and those containing the most raft-stabilizing sterol is 4 °C). This behavior is consistent with the possibility that the cer-rich rafts also contain only low levels of sterol. Fig. 2D shows early cholesterol precursors actually slightly destabilize ordered domain formation in cer-containing vesicles relative to those without sterol. In contrast, some stabilization of rafts in cer-containing samples is observed with lathosterol and 7-DHC, consistent with the grea"

https://openalex.org/W2061619969,"When spinach thylakoids were subjected to moderate heat stress (40 °C for 30 min), oxygen evolution was inhibited, and cleavage of the reaction center-binding protein D1 of photosystem II took place, producing 23-kDa N-terminal fragments. The D1 cleavage was greatly facilitated by the addition of 0.15 mm ZnCl2 and 1 mm ATP and was completely inhibited by 1 mm EDTA, indicating the participation of an ATP-dependent metalloprotease(s) in the D1 cleavage. Herbicides 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea, bromoxynil, and ioxynil, all of which bind to the QB site, inhibited the D1 cleavage, suggesting that the DE-loop of the D1 protein is the heat-sensitive cleavage site. We solubilized the protease by treating the thylakoids with 2 m KSCN and detected a protease activity in the supernatant by gelatin activity gel electrophoresis in the 70–80-kDa region. The antibodies against tobacco FtsH and Arabidopsis FtsH2 reacted with a 70–80-kDa band of the KSCN-solubilized fraction, which suggests the presence of FtsH in the fraction. In accordance with this finding, we identified the homolog to Arabidopsis FtsH8 in the 70–80-kDa region by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis of the thylakoids. The KSCN-solubilized fraction was successively reconstituted with thylakoids to show heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein and production of the D1 fragment. These results strongly suggest that an FtsH protease(s) is involved in the primary cleavage of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress. When spinach thylakoids were subjected to moderate heat stress (40 °C for 30 min), oxygen evolution was inhibited, and cleavage of the reaction center-binding protein D1 of photosystem II took place, producing 23-kDa N-terminal fragments. The D1 cleavage was greatly facilitated by the addition of 0.15 mm ZnCl2 and 1 mm ATP and was completely inhibited by 1 mm EDTA, indicating the participation of an ATP-dependent metalloprotease(s) in the D1 cleavage. Herbicides 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea, bromoxynil, and ioxynil, all of which bind to the QB site, inhibited the D1 cleavage, suggesting that the DE-loop of the D1 protein is the heat-sensitive cleavage site. We solubilized the protease by treating the thylakoids with 2 m KSCN and detected a protease activity in the supernatant by gelatin activity gel electrophoresis in the 70–80-kDa region. The antibodies against tobacco FtsH and Arabidopsis FtsH2 reacted with a 70–80-kDa band of the KSCN-solubilized fraction, which suggests the presence of FtsH in the fraction. In accordance with this finding, we identified the homolog to Arabidopsis FtsH8 in the 70–80-kDa region by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis of the thylakoids. The KSCN-solubilized fraction was successively reconstituted with thylakoids to show heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein and production of the D1 fragment. These results strongly suggest that an FtsH protease(s) is involved in the primary cleavage of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress. Photosystem II (PS II) 2The abbreviations used are: PS II, photosystem II; D1 and D2, the reaction center binding proteins of PS II; P680, the primary electron donor chlorophyll of PS II; LHCII, light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex associated with PS II; MALDI-TOF mass, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; CP43 and CP47, the antenna chlorophyll-binding proteins of PS II with relative molecular masses of 43 and 47 kDa, respectively; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; QB, the binding site of the secondary plastoquinone electron acceptor on the D1 protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is prone to various environmental stresses, the most prominent being strong visible light. Under light stress conditions, the reaction center-binding D1 protein of PS II is damaged and is promptly replaced by a newly synthesized D1 protein (1Kyle D.J. Ohad I. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 270: 14919-14927Google Scholar, 3Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 4Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). This process is referred to as photoinhibition and repair of PS II, and a lot of effort has been made to elucidate the details of the process. Two basic mechanisms have been shown to operate in the photoinhibitory steps (3Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 4Aro E.-M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). In the acceptor side mechanism of photoinhibition, over-reduction of the acceptor side of PS II by excessive light induces charge recombination between the oxidized primary electron donor P680+ and the reduced primary electron acceptor Pheo−, leading to the formation of triplet state P680. The triplet state P680 subsequently reacts with molecular oxygen to form a highly reactive singlet oxygen, which is very destructive to the D1 protein. The site of damage in the D1 protein is the stroma-exposed DE-loop of the D1 protein. In the donor side mechanism of photoinhibition, the D1 protein is damaged by endogenous cationic radicals such as P680+ and chlorophyll+ generated by illumination of PS II that has an impaired oxygen-evolving system. In this case, electron donation from water to the reaction center is inefficient, and photodamage to the D1 protein takes place at the lumen-exposed AB-loop. The photodamaged D1 protein is degraded by proteolytic enzymes and removed from PS II (5Adam Z. Clark A.K. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the acceptor side photoinhibition, 23-kDa N-terminal and 9-kDa C-terminal fragments are formed after cleavage of the D1 protein at the DE-loop (6De Las Rivas J. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the donor side photoinhibition, the D1 protein is damaged at the lumen-exposed AB-loop, whereby 10-kDa N-terminal and 24-kDa C-terminal fragments are produced (6De Las Rivas J. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Identification of the proteases responsible for primary cleavage and secondary degradation of the D1 protein is currently a central topic of research on photoinhibition and repair of PS II. FtsH (filamentation temperature-sensitive) proteases are ATP- and zinc-dependent metallo-type proteases. The proteases mediate degradation of membrane proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (7Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, the FtsH proteases are anchored to thylakoid membranes, with two transmembrane segments at the N terminus and a large C terminus part exposed to the stroma (8Lindahl M. Tabak S. Cseke L. Pichersky E. Andersson B. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The large soluble part has an AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) ATPase domain with chaperone functions and a proteolytic center where the zinc-binding motif HEXXH exists. FtsH forms a hexameric ring, and substrate proteins are translocated through a central cavity in an ATP-dependent manner. The substrates are subsequently digested at the zinc-binding site. From a series of work done with Escherichia coli, the degradation of substrate proteins by FtsH proteases was shown to proceed in a processive manner without release of large intermediate peptides (9Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis, 12 FtsH proteases (FtsH1–FtsH12) are present; in particular, FtsH2 (also designated VAR2) and FtsH5 (also designated VAR1) are shown to participate in the repair of photodamaged PS II by digestion and removal of the damaged D1 protein (10Bailey S. Thompson E. Nixon P.J. Horton P. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2006-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11Sakamoto W. Tamura T. Hanba-Tomita Y. Murata M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, four FtsH proteases were identified (12Mann N. Novac N. Mullineaux C. Newman J. Bailey S. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and one of them, slr0228, which is a close relative to FtsH2 and referred to as Synechocystis FtsH2, was shown to be essential in the degradation of photodamaged D1 protein (13Silva P. Thompson E. Bailey S. Krus O. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. Nixon P.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2152-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The DegP family consists of 14 members (DegP1–DegP14) in Arabidopsis, and they are all serine-type proteases. Among them, DegP2, which is bound to the stromal surface of thylakoids, was indicated to be responsible for the degradation of photodamaged D1 protein (14Haussühl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, recent studies with cyanobacteria and Arabidopsis mutants that lack the FtsH proteases demonstrated participation of FtsH rather than DegP2 in the primary cleavage of the D1 protein under light stress conditions (10Bailey S. Thompson E. Nixon P.J. Horton P. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2006-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Nixon P.J. Baker M.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2843-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Another environmental factor stressful to PS II is heat. Because heat stress significantly influences PS II, many different aspects of PS II have been documented ranging from physiological responses to molecular mechanisms (17Berry J. Bjorkman O. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 491-543Crossref Google Scholar, 18Havaux M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 757-766Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Sharkey T.D. Plant Cell Environ. 2005; 28: 269-277Crossref Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In particular, the so-called heat-shock response, including sensing of elevated temperatures, transduction of the signal, and the subsequent gene expression of heat shock proteins, has attracted much attention (20Vierling E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 579-620Crossref Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). All these mechanisms should function to protect PS II from heat stress or to repair damaged proteins in PS II. However, studies on structural change in PS II and degradation of PS II subunits under heat stress are limited. Most are on the analysis of changes in the organization of PS II complexes, such as dissociation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex (LHCII) from PS II core (21Gounaris K. Brain A.P.R. Quinn P.J. Williams W.P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 47-52Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Sundby C. Melis A. Mäenpää P. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1985; 807: 127-133Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), conformational changes of PS II (25De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8897-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and heat-induced dephosphorylation of PS II subunits (26Rokka A. Aro E.-M. Hermann R.G. Andersson B. Vener A.V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Vener A.V. Harms A. Sussman M.R. Viersta R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6959-6966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A preliminary study was also done on degradation of the D1 protein (28Singh A.K. Singhal G.S. Photosynthetica (Prague). 1999; 36: 433-440Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigate the effects of moderate heat stress on the D1 protein of spinach thylakoids in detail, and we show a specific degradation of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress among the PS II polypeptides. Several experiments, including MALDI-TOF mass analysis of the thylakoids and solubilization and reconstitution of proteases, demonstrated that an FtsH protease(s) is responsible for the primary cleavage of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress conditions. Isolation of Thylakoids—Fresh spinach leaves were purchased from a local market, and intact chloroplasts were isolated as reported previously (29Mullet J.E. Chua N.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 502-509Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were obtained by osmolysis of the intact chloroplasts with a hypotonic solution containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5). The mixture was subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min after which the pellets were suspended in a solution containing 0.1 m sorbitol, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 7.6) (TC solution). After washing twice by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min with TC solution, the thylakoids were suspended in the same buffer solution at 0.4 mg chlorophyll·ml−1. We carried out all the preparation steps at 4 °C in a dark room under a green safe light. Chlorophylls were determined using the absorption coefficient of Mackinney (30Mackinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Heat Treatment—Heat treatment of the thylakoids was conducted by placing the samples in black plastic sample tubes (1 ml volume) and incubating them in a circulating water bath for a given time at 40 °C. Where indicated, either metal salts, ATP, EDTA, or other protease inhibitors were added to the thylakoids before heat treatment at 40 °C for 30 min. Treatment of Thylakoids with Salts and Detergents—To remove the extrinsic proteins, thylakoids adjusted to 0.4 mg of chlorophyll·ml−1 were washed with TC solution containing either 1 m NaCl, 1 m CaCl2, 0.2 m Na2CO3, or 2 m KSCN. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, each suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed once by the same centrifugation and finally suspended in a TC solution at 0.4 mg of chlorophyll·ml−1. For detergent treatment, the thylakoids were incubated with a TC solution containing either 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 30 min. Then the samples were washed and suspended in the TC solution as described above. The salt- or detergent-treated thylakoids were used for the following heat stress experiments. Solubilization and Reconstitution of the Protease Obtained by KSCN Treatment of Thylakoids—Thylakoids adjusted to 1 mg of chlorophyll·ml−1 were incubated with solution A containing 2 m KSCN at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged twice more at 35,000 × g for 10 min to remove small fragments of the thylakoid membrane. The supernatant was dialyzed with a Spectra/Por 7 membrane for 3 h in a cold room with three changes of buffer solution containing 10 mm Tricine-KOH and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5) and subsequently centrifuged twice at 35,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a clean supernatant. The supernatant was concentrated with an Amicon ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter (10,000 Nominal Molecular Weight Limit (NMWL) filter unit). The concentrated supernatant (protein concentration, 2.0 mg· ml−1) was added to either KSCN-treated or nontreated thylakoids adjusted at 0.4 mg of chlorophyll·ml−1, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). SDS/Urea-PAGE, Western Blot Analysis, and Gelatin Activity Gel Electrophoresis—SDS/urea-PAGE and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously (31Yamamoto Y. Sakuma S. Shen J.-R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 274: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yamamoto Y. Akasaka T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9038-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Yamamoto Y. Nishi Y. Yamasaki H. Uchida S. Ohira S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 274: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western blot analysis were as follows: antibodies against the D1 protein (AB-loop and DE-loop), the D2 protein, CP43, CP47, the α-subunit of cytochrome b559, LHCII, DS9 protein (FtsH from tobacco) and VAR2 (FtsH2 from Arabidopsis). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as secondary antibody. Immuno-decorated bands were detected by fluorography with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protease activity was assayed by gelatin activity gel electrophoresis as described previously (33Yamamoto Y. Nishi Y. Yamasaki H. Uchida S. Ohira S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 274: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar). The density of the proteins in the fluorogram was measured by the use of Scion Image software. Measurements of Oxygen Evolution and Chlorophyll Fluorescence—Oxygen evolving activity was measured with an oxygen electrode (Hansatech, UK) connected to a thermo-regulated water bath. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 1 mm phenyl parabenzoquinone, 1 mm potassium ferricyanide, and thylakoids equivalent to 40 μg of chlorophyll·ml−1. Saturating actinic light was given by a slide projector. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands from SDS-gel stained with silver nitrate (34Sinha P. Poland J. Schnölzer M. Rabilloud T. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were manually excised. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed with modified trypsin (Promega, WI), according to Shevchenko et al. (35Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were extracted twice from the gel bands by shaking in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated with a vacuum centrifuge. The resulting peptides were desalted with a Perfect-Pure C-18 Tip (Eppendorf), eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile solution containing saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and finally spotted on the MALDI target plate. MALDI-TOF mass analysis of the peptides was carried out with an Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics). Peptide masses were searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base using Mascot (Matrix Science) and ProFound search engines. Alignment of Arabidopsis protein sequences was performed with a ClustalW 1.82 program. Effect of Moderate Heat Stress on Oxygen Evolution and the D1 Protein—We examined the effects of moderate heat stress on oxygen evolution and degradation of the D1 protein using spinach thylakoids. Oxygen evolution activity was not much affected by the incubation of thylakoids at 20–25 °C for 30 min but was inhibited at temperatures above 30 °C (Fig. 1A). In parallel with that, production of a 23-kDa fragment of the D1 protein was detected at temperatures higher than 30 °C by SDS/urea-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the thylakoids with an antibody against the DE-loop of the D1 protein. The cleavage of the D1 protein reached its maximum at 40 °C (Fig. 1B). The degradation of the D1 protein proceeded with incubation time at 40 °C (Fig. 1C). We detected the same 23-kDa fragment by immunoblotting with an antibody against the AB-loop of the D1 protein, suggesting the fragment to be an N-terminal one (data not shown). On the other hand, a C-terminal 9-kDa fragment was detected using a D1 antibody raised against the C-terminal sequence of the protein (data not shown). Among the various polypeptides in PS II, the D1 protein was the only protein that clearly showed a cleavage product upon heat treatment of the thylakoids; the D2 protein, the α-subunit of cytochrome b559, CP43 and CP47, and LHCII did not cleave under the same heat stress (Fig. 1D). Involvement of an ATP-dependent Metalloprotease in Moderate Heat-induced Cleavage of the D1 Protein—Cleavage of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress (40 °C for 30 min) was significantly stimulated by the addition of 0.05 mm ZnCl2, and the effect of ZnCl2 was maximum at 0.15 mm (Fig. 2A). Other metal cations such as manganese, magnesium, copper, and iron were not as effective as zinc. These results suggest that a zinc-dependent metalloprotease(s) is involved in protein cleavage. Consistently, the addition of 1 mm EDTA completely inhibited cleavage of the D1 protein (Fig. 2B). The cleavage was also enhanced by the addition of 0.05 mm ATP, and the effect of ATP was saturated at 1 mm (Fig. 2C). The serine protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and aprotinin, as well as cysteine protease inhibitors E64 and leupeptin, had no effects on the heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein (data not shown). Effects of Herbicides on the Moderate Heat-induced Cleavage of the D1 Protein—The size of the cleavage product of the D1 protein observed under moderate heat stress (23 kDa) was similar to that detected with the acceptor side photoinhibition of PS II, suggesting the sites of cleavage of the D1 protein under light and heat stress are close to each other or probably the same. The addition of herbicides such as 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), bromoxynil, and ioxynil, which all bind to the QB site on the DE-loop of the D1 protein and inhibit oxygen evolution, also inhibited heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein in the thylakoids (Fig. 3). These features are quite similar to those observed with the cleavage of the D1 protein by excessive illumination. A specific protease(s) probably recognized the heat stress-induced conformational changes in the DE-loop of the D1 protein, and the cleavage site of the D1 protein under heat stress may be the same as that under the acceptor side photoinhibition of PS II. Solubilization of the Metalloprotease from Thylakoid Membranes—To solubilize the protease, thylakoid membranes were first treated with various salts to release the peripheral proteins. Washing thylakoids with either 1 m NaCl, 1 m CaCl2, or 0.2 m Na2CO3 did not eliminate the protease activity, because the D1 protein was cleaved upon heat treatment after these salt treatments (Fig. 4A). By contrast, heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein was not observed after treatment of thylakoids with 2 m KSCN. Washing of thylakoids with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 also prevented the cleavage of the D1 protein (data not shown). Therefore, these detergents and chaotropic anions were effective in removing the protease from the thylakoids. Detection of Protease Activity by Gelatin Activity Gel—We assayed the protease activity in the supernatants obtained by treatment of thylakoids with Triton X-100, SDS, Nonidet P-40, or KSCN using gelatin activity gel electrophoresis. Of the samples examined, only the supernatant of KSCN-treated thylakoids showed protease activity, which was seen as a transparent band on the blue background of the substrate gelatin in the gel (Fig. 4B). The relative molecular mass of the protease was 70–80 kDa. FtsH was suggested to be included in the supernatant by Western blot analysis of the KSCN-treated supernatant with a specific antibody against VAR2, which represents FtsH2 of Arabidopsis (Fig. 4C). The antibody reacted with a single protein band of about 77 kDa. Western blot analysis with an antibody against DS9, which corresponds to FtsH of tobacco, also showed the same profile (data not shown). Mass Spectrometry—We tried to identify the protease in the supernatant of the KSCN-washed thylakoids by silver staining and the following mass spectrometry. However, the amounts of the protein in the 70–80-kDa region in the supernatant are too small to be detected by silver staining. We subsequently determined the proteins in the thylakoids by silver staining (Fig. 5A) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 5, B and C). Peptide mass fingerprinting with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assigned the protein band of 70–80 kDa to Arabidopsis FtsH8 protein with significant possibility. Arabidopsis FtsH2 and tobacco FtsH-like protein Pftf were also shown to be related to the specific band (Fig. 5C). Because the amino acid sequences of spinach FtsH proteases are unknown, this is a tentative assignment. These results suggest that the 70–80-kDa protein band contains both spinach FtsH2/8 orthologs.FIGURE 5Silver staining of thylakoids and the supernatant of KSCN-treated thylakoids (A) and mass spectrometric analysis of thylakoids (B). A, thylakoids and the supernatant of the KSCN treatment were also silver-stained, and the stained bands in the range of 60–80 kDa of both the thylakoids and the supernatant of the KSCN treatment were subjected to an Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify the proteins in the two samples. The identified proteins are shown on the right-hand side of the gel. The relative molecular masses are shown on the left-hand side of each gel. B, MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of tryptic peptides of a putative spinach FtsH band. Peptide masses were searched using Mascot and ProFound programs, both of which assigned the band to the same protein, Arabidopsis FtsH. Peptide mass peaks, the mass/charge ratios (m/z values) of that were assigned to the computed m/z values of the tryptic peptides of Arabidopsis FtsH8, were shown with the measured m/z values, and the residues of Arabidopsis FtsH8 are depicted in B. The sequence coverage of tryptic digestion was 33.1%. C, alignment of Arabidopsis FtsH2, FtsH8, and tobacco FtsH-like protein. Alignment of Arabidopsis FtsH2 (RefSeq accession number NP_850156), FtsH8 (RefSeq accession number NP_563766), and tobacco FtsH-like protein Pftf (GenBank™ accession number AAD17230) sequences was performed with a ClustalW 1.82 program. Peptide sequences assigned to peptide ions obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry are underlined. Some peptide ions were assigned to peptide sequences that have a nonconserved amino acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reconstitution of Protease Activity—We used the supernatant of the thylakoids washed with 2 m KSCN for reconstitution with the thylakoids. The supernatant was added to either KSCN-treated or nontreated thylakoids, after which the effects of heat treatment on the D1 protein were examined (Fig. 6). In the reconstitution with KSCN-treated thylakoids, a slight enhancement of D1 protein degradation was observed by addition of the supernatant, whereas D1 degradation was markedly increased resulting in the reconstitution of the supernatant with native thylakoids. Degradation of the D1 protein in these reconstitution experiments was completely inhibited by EDTA, whereas degradation was not stimulated by addition of ZnCl2. Aprotinin, an inhibitor of serine-type proteases, had no effect on the reconstituted protease activity. In this study, we showed the possibility that FtsH protease is responsible for the degradation of the D1 protein damaged under moderate heat stress. The N-terminal 23-kDa fragment of the D1 protein, detected by Western blot analysis with the antibody against the DE-loop of the D1 protein, increased by raising the temperature from 20 to 40 °C, parallel to the inhibition of oxygen evolution (Fig. 1). The degradation of the D1 protein was stimulated by the addition of ATP and zinc and inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 2). The protease was solubilized by the treatment of the thylakoids with 2 m KSCN (Fig. 4A) and was shown to have a relative molecular mass of 70–80 kDa by gelatin zymography (Fig. 4B). The supernatant of the KSCN-treated thylakoids cross-reacted with the antibody against Arabidopsis VAR2 (FtsH2) (Fig. 4C). In the thylakoids, we detected the homolog of Arabidopsis FtsH8 by mass spectrometry as the sole protease that is present in the 70–80-kDa region (Fig. 5). Finally, the protease activity was reconstituted following the use of thylakoids and the supernatant of KSCN-treated thylakoids (Fig. 6). All these data favor involvement of FtsH in the degradation of the heat-damaged D1 protein. FtsH proteases in the thylakoids have two transmembrane helices on the N-terminal side and a catalytic domain on the C-terminal segment exposed to the stroma. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the FtsH proteases recognize a partially denatured structure of the D1 protein that is exposed to the stroma under the heat stress. The DE-loop of the D1 protein, which comprises the binding site for QB plastoquinone as well as herbicides, may be one of the places where such a conformational change takes place. Quite recently, the protein environment of the QB-binding pocket was elucidated with a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus in 3.0 Å resolution (36Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The QB-binding site opens into a large cavity at the stromal side, defined by the transmembrane helices of several protein subunits, including cytochrome b559, PsbJ, PsbK, and the D1"

https://openalex.org/W2015883486,"Proteasome inhibitors are currently used as chemotherapeutic drugs because of their ability to block NF-κB, a transcription factor constitutively activated in many different types of human cancer. In the present study, we demonstrate that proteasome inhibitors induce cell death in endometrial carcinoma cell lines and primary explants but, instead of blocking NF-κB, they increase its transcriptional activity. Proteasome inhibitors induce phosphorylation of IKKα/β, phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, and phosphorylation of the p65 NF-κB subunit on serine 536. Proteasome inhibitor-induced NF-κB activity can be blocked by a non-degradable form of IκBα or dominant negative forms of either IKKα or IKKβ. Lentiviral delivery of shRNAs to either IKKα or IKKβ cause blockade of NF-κB transcriptional activity and inhibit phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536, but has no effect on IκBa degradation. These results suggest a role for p65 phosphorylation in proteasome inhibitor-induced NF-κB activation. Accordingly, siRNA knockdown of p65 inhibits proteasome inhibitor-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate that proteasome inhibitors, including bortezomib, induce cell death on endometrial carcinoma cells and primary explants. However, they activate NF-κB instead of blocking its transcriptional potential. Therefore, the concept that proteasome inhibitors are blockers of NF-κB activation should be carefully examined in particular cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2144526849,"TLR8-mediated NF-κB and IRF7 activation are abolished in human IRAK-deficient 293 cells and IRAK4-deficient fibroblast cells. Both wild-type and kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK4, respectively, restored TLR8-mediated NF-κB and IRF7 activation in the IRAK- and IRAK4-deficient cells, indicating that the kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is probably redundant for TLR8-mediated signaling. We recently found that TLR8 mediates a unique NF-κB activation pathway in human 293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, accompanied only by IκBα phosphorylation and not IκBα degradation, whereas interleukin (IL)-1 stimulation causes both IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The intermediate signaling events mediated by IL-1 (including IRAK modifications and degradation and TAK1 activation) were not detected in cells stimulated by TLR8 ligands. TLR8 ligands trigger similar levels of IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB and JNK activation in TAK1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) as compared with wild-type MEFs, whereas lack of TAK1 results in reduced IL-1-mediated NF-κB activation and abolished IL-1-induced JNK activation. The above results indicate that although TLR8-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation are IRAK-dependent, they do not require IRAK modification and are TAK1-independent. On the other hand, TLR8-mediated IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB, and JNK activation are completely abolished in MEKK3-/- MEFs, whereas IL-1-mediated signaling was only moderately reduced in these deficient MEFs as compared with wild-type cells. The differences between IL-1R- and TLR8-mediated NF-κB activation are also reflected at the level of IκB kinase (IKK) complex. TLR8 ligands induced IKKγ phosphorylation, whereas IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKγ ubiquitination that can be induced by IL-1 were not detected in cells treated with TLR8 ligands. We postulate that TLR8-mediated MEKK3-dependent IKKγ phosphorylation might play an important role in the activation of IKK complex, leading to IκBα phosphorylation.

The defining feature of members of the superfamily is a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain on the cytoplasmic side of the receptors. The members of the IL-1 receptor subfamily contain three Ig domains in their extracellular regions (1Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K.

The other group in the superfamily is the recently identified pathogen-associated pattern recognition receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 11 members of which contain two major domains characterized by extracellular leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular TIR domain (2Medzhitov R.

Upon IL-1 stimulation, the TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule MyD88 (8Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) is recruited to the TIR domain of the receptor complex, which then recruits serine-threonine kinases IRAK4 (IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4) (9Li S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whereas IRAK4 is the kinase that functions upstream of and phosphorylates IRAK, the phosphorylated IRAK mediates the recruitment of TRAF6 to the receptor complex (13Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). IRAK-TRAF6 then leaves the receptor complex to interact with TAK1, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, and the proteins that bind to it, TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3 on the membrane (14Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 15Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). TAK1 and TAB2 are phosphorylated on the membrane, followed by the formation and translocation of TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2, from the membrane to the cytosol (15Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), where TAK1 is activated. Whereas genetic studies show that IRAK is required for the IL-1-induced activation of TAK1, in vitro biochemical analyses reveal that TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination may also play an important role in TAK1 activation (16Deng L.

The activation of TAK1 eventually leads to the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) by an unknown mechanism. Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB proteins, which are degraded, releasing NF-κB to activate transcription in the nucleus (17Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B.

Activated TAK1 has also been implicated in the IL-1-induced activation of MKK6 and JNK (14Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The definitive evidence for an essential role of TAK1 in IL-1 signaling is from studies with TAK1-deficient cells. Two groups (21Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat.

Recent studies have begun to unravel how a subset of TLRs, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, employ a novel MyD88-dependent pathway to mediate the activation of transcription factors NF-κB, IRF5, and IRF7 and induction of interferon-α. Whereas TLR9 has been shown to recognize bacterial DNA, a synthetic compound (imidazoquinoline compound R848) with antiviral activity and single-stranded RNA have been described as ligands for TLR7 and TLR8. It has been recently reported that the transcription factor IRF7 interacts with MyD88 to form a complex in the cytoplasm, and this interaction resulted in activation of IFNα-dependent promoters (26Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 27Honda K.

IRAK4 and TRAF6 have also been implicated in this pathway, and ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 has been shown to mediate IRF7 activation. The detailed molecular mechanisms for this novel TLR7-, TLR8-, and TLR9-mediated MyD88-dependent pathway are still unclear. In this paper, we report that TLR8 mediate a unique NF-κB activation pathway. The intermediate signaling events mediated by IL-1 (including IRAK modifications and degradation and TAK1 activation) were not detected in cells stimulated by TLR8 ligands. Using IRAK- and TAK1-deficient cells, we found that although TLR8-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation are IRAK-dependent, they do not require IRAK modification and are TAK1-independent. On the other hand, TLR8-mediated IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB and JNK activation are completely abolished in MEKK3-/- MEFs, whereas IL-1-mediated signaling was only moderately reduced in these deficient MEFs as compared with wild-type cells. The differences between IL-1R- and TLR8-mediated NF-κB activation are also reflected at the level of the IKK complex. TLR8 ligands induced IKKγ phosphorylation, whereas IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKγ ubiquitination that can be induced by IL-1 were not detected in cells treated with TLR8 ligands. We postulate that TLR8-mediated MEKK3-dependent IKKγ phosphorylation might play an important role in the activation of IKK complex, leading to IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation.

For preparation of primary kidney cells, kidneys were cut into small pieces and incubated in 0.5% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells from each kidney were plated in a 15-cm plate and grown to confluence for 7-10 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant Plasmids and Transfection—Endothelial cell leukocyteadhesionmolecule-1promoter-derivedluc,anNF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid, was described by Schindler and Baichwal (30Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interferon-α2 (IFNα2) or interferon-α4 (IFNα4)-dependent-luciferase reporter constructs were generated by PCR and inserted into pBasicLuc. The human TLR7/8 and IKKγ expression constructs were created by inserting cDNA fragments, amplified by PCR, into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Wild-type, kinase-inactive (KK213AA, two lysine residues in the ATP binding pocket were mutated to alanine, abbreviated as IRAK4mt) IRAK-4 cDNA was cloned into the retrovirus vector, pBabe-puro. Mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type and kinase-inactive (K293A) IRAK (driven by the thymidine kinase promoter) were described elsewhere (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z.

Transfection of the indicated plasmids by FuGENE 6 transfection reagents was done as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Transfection solution was prepared by mixing 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent in 100 μl of serum-free medium. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the mixture was added to tissue culture wells containing 1 × 106 cells in 2 ml of complete culture medium. MEKK3 siRNA sequence 5′-GATCCCCGCCTTAGGATATTGCTGTTTTCAAGAGAAACAGCAATATCCTAAGGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ was cloned into vector pSUPER, which was obtained from Dr. Reuven Agami's group (Center for Biomedical Genetics, The Netherlands) (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells (2 × 105 were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors plus 100 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmids and 10 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid for normalization, with a 1:3 ratio of DNA/FuGENE 6. Transfection of empty vector was used to ensure that all samples received equal amounts of DNA. At 36 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with ligands for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assessed using reporter lysis buffer and luciferase assay reagent (Promega). All results reported represent duplicate experiments with at least three independent transfections. Western Blot Analysis—Cells that were not treated or treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml), 3M-02 (5 μg/ml), or 3M-03 (5 μg/ml) were harvested, washed in cold PBS buffer, pelleted, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to supported nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), and blocked in a 5% solution of nonfat dry milk prepared in 1× PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibody diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed three or four times for 10 min each with PBS, and then detected with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 in PBS plus 5% nonfat milk and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell were harvested and lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) for 2 h followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (prewashed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting. IκB Kinase Assay—For IκB kinase assays, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα/β and collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. Kinase reactions were performed in 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The substrate was 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-IκB (residues 1-54) (Joseph DiDonato, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells plated in 100-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested with a cell scraper, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 1500 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm Na3VO4,5mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold storage buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1× mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 25% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatant fraction was frozen in aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—An NF-κB oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mmol/liter MgCl2. Nuclear extracts (5 or 10 μg of protein) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, and the end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm). The samples were loaded onto a prerun, 16-cm-long, 1.5-mm-thick 4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1) gel prepared in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). After electrophoresis for 2 h at 200 V (at 4 °C), the gel was dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. films at -80 °C for 3-24 h with intensifying screens. The radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Each gel mobility shift assay was repeated with at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts. TLR8-mediated NF-κB Activation Is Accompanied by IκBα Phosphorylation but Not IκBα Degradation—Although the same upstream signaling components (MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6) are utilized by TLR7/8 and IL-1R, TLR7/8 mediate the activation of IRF7 in addition to the common signaling events (NF-κB and JNK activation) shared with IL-1R, implicating differential usage of the upstream signaling components by these receptors. To compare TLR7- and TLR8-mediated signaling with IL-1R, TLR7 or TLR8 was co-transfected with an NF-κB-dependent E-selectin-luc construct into human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with IL-1R. As shown in Fig. 1a, both TLR7 and TLR8 induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity in 293 cells in response to stimulation with single-stranded poly(U), single-stranded RNA40, and imidazoquinoline compounds (3M-002 and 3M-003). Since TLR8-mediated NF-κB activation is much stronger than TLR7, we stably transfected TLR8 into 293 cells transfected with IL-1R (293-IL-1R-TLR8). Imidazoquinoline compounds (3M-002 and 3M-003) induced similar levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity as compared with that induced by IL-1 stimulation in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, TLR8 ligands also induced p38 and JNK activation, albeit at reduced levels compared with IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 1c). However, whereas IL-1 stimulation led to both IκBα phosphorylation and rapid IκBα degradation, the imidazoquinoline compounds only induced IκBα phosphorylation and not IκBα degradation (Fig. 1c). To determine whether such differential signaling outcomes are only restricted to 293 cells, we isolated primary mouse kidney epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1d, both IL-1 and imidazoquinoline compounds induced the activation of NF-κB, JNK, ERK, and p38 in the primary kidney epithelial cells. However, whereas IL-1 stimulation induced both IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, IκBα was phosphorylated but not degraded upon imidazoquinoline compounds (3M-002 and 3M-003) in these primary cells. Since the murine TLR8 gene is not functional, the imidazoquinoline-induced signaling in mouse kidney cells is probably through TLR7. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR7/8 and IL-1R might mediate differential signaling pathways to lead to NF-κB activation. TLR8 Do Not Lead to IRAK Modification and Degradation—To further compare intermediate signaling events mediated by TLR8 and IL-1R, we employed MyD88-deficient cells (I3A), IRAK-deficient cells (I1A), and IRAK4-deficient cells. Similar to IL-1 signaling (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

We previously showed that IRAK and IRAK4 kinase-inactive mutants had the same ability as the wild-type IRAK and IRAK4 in restoring IL-1-mediated signaling in IRAK- and IRAK4-deficient cells, respectively, indicating that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is not necessary for the IL-1 pathway (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26748-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The fact that only the impairment of the kinase activity of both IRAK and IRAK4 efficiently abolished the IL-1 pathway suggests that the kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is probably redundant for IL-1-mediated signaling (33Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26748-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, c and d, both wild-type and kinase-inactive IRAK and IRAK4 can also restore TLR7/8-mediated activation of NF-κB-dependent (E-selectin) and IRF5/7-dependent (IFNα2) promoters in IRAK- and IRAK4-deficient cells, respectively. These results indicate that whereas IRAK and IRAK4 are necessary for TLR8 signaling, the individual kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is not required, implicating potential redundancy of the kinase activity of these two kinases in TLR8-mediated signaling (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Hallmarks of IRAK activation upon IL-1 stimulation include its phosphorylation and ubiquitination followed by its degradation (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol.

Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase leads to loss of several IL-1-induced shifted IRAK bands, confirming that they are phosphorylated forms (12Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2f). IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-IRAK antibody followed by Western analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (36Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

However, IRAK modification was not detected in response to the imidazoquinoline compounds in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 2e). These results indicate that although IRAK is required for both IL-1R and TLR8-mediated signaling, it might have different signaling roles in these two pathways. TLR8 Does Not Lead to TAK1/TAB1 Phosphorylation—We and others have previously shown that TAK1 is activated upon IL-1 stimulation and is important for IL-1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation (14Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). TAK1 and TAB1 (a TAK1-binding protein and substrate) were clearly modified upon IL-1 stimulation in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 3a). Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase eliminated the IL-1-induced slowly migrating TAK1 and TAB1 bands, confirming that they are phosphorylated forms (38Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, it has been shown that IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1 correlates with TAK1 activity (15Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 38Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, TAK1 and TAB1 were not modified upon imidazoquinoline stimulation in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 3a), suggesting that TAK1 may not be activated by TLR8-mediated signaling. Recently, TAK1-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting using the Cre-loxP system (21Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). TAK1-deficient (Map3k7-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated by in vitro transduction of Cre in MEFs homologous for loxP-flanked (floxed) Map3k7flox/flox), and confirmed by genomic Southern, reverse transcription-PCR, and Western analysis (21Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of TAK1 in TLR7/8-mediated signaling, we transfected human TLR8 into TAK1+/+ (Map3k7flox/flox) and TAK1-/- (Map3k7-/-) MEFs (21Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3b, IL-1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation are greatly reduced in TAK1-/- MEFs as compared with that in TAK+/+ MEFs. However, NF-κB and JNK activation were induced to similar levels by imidazoquinoline compounds in TAK1+/+ and TAK1-/- MEFs (Fig. 3b). These results clearly indicate that TAK1 is not required for TLR8-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation. MEKK3 Is Required for TLR8-mediated NF-κB and JNK Activation—Since MEKK3 has been implicated in TLR-IL-1R signaling, we examined the role of MEKK3 in TLR8-mediated signaling in MEKK3-deficient MEFs (24Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 40Huang Q. Yang J. Lin Y. Walker C. Cheng J. Liu Z.G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We transfected human TLR8 into MEKK3+/+ and MEKK3-/- MEFs. Imidazoquinoline-induced IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 4b), NF-κB and JNK activation (Fig. 3b) were completely abolished in MEKK3-deficient MEFs as compared with that in wild-type control cells. The lack of MEKK3 in MEKK3-deficient MEFs was confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that MEKK3 is required for TLR8-mediated signaling. The TLR8-mediated signaling was diminished in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells where MEKK3 was knocked down by siRNA, confirming the role of MEKK3 in TLR8 signaling (Fig. 3c). We then examined the impact of imidazoquinoline on IKK. Interestingly, we found that whereas IL-1 stimulation led to the phosphorylation of IKKα/β detected with anti-Ser(P)177/181IKKβ antibody in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 4a) and MEFs (Fig. 4b), imidazoquinoline compounds failed to induce such phosphorylation of IKKα/β in these cells (Fig. 4, a and b). Furthermore, whereas IL-1 stimulation induced IKKγ phosphorylation and ubiquitination in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells (Fig. 4, a and c), imidazoquinoline treatment only induced IKKγ phosphorylation but not ubiquitination (Fig. 4, a and c). Imidazoquinoline-induced IKKγ phosphorylation was completely abolished in MEKK3-deficient MEFs as compared with that in wild-type control cells (Fig. 4d). These results clearly indicate that MEKK3 is required for TLR8-mediated IKKγ phosphorylation. The next question is whether the kinase activity of IKK is activated at all upon activation of TLR8. As shown in Fig. 4, e and f, imidazoquinoline compounds can activate IκB kinase in 293-IL-1R-TLR8 cells at similar levels as IL-1 stimulation. Consistent with this finding, imidazoquinoline-induced IκB phosphorylation was abolished in IKKα/β-/- MEFs (29Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas JNK activation was intact in these cells. The lack of IKKα and IKKβ in these IKKα/β-deficient MEFs was confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that imidazoquinoline-induced NF-κB activation is IKK-dependent, although the mechanism of IKK activation by TLR8 might be different from that by IL-1R (Fig. 5). We here report that TLR8 mediates a novel MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation pathway that is significantly different from the classical MyD88-dependent NF-κB pathway mediated by IL-1R. One striking difference between these two pathways is IRAK modification. IL-1 stimulation leads to IRAK phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and modification. IRAK modifications and degradation were not detected in cells stimulated by TLR8 ligands, although TLR8-mediated NF-κB activation is IRAK-dependent. It is possible that additional adaptor molecules are associated with IL-1R and/or TLR8, influencing IRAK modification upon ligand stimulation. Following IRAK modification, TAK1 is activated upon IL-1 stimulation, which is critical for IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Our unpublished data showed that IL-1-induced IRAK modification is required for TAK1 activation. 3J. Yao and X. Li, unpublished data. Consistent with the fact that TLR8 does not lead to IRAK modification, imidazoquinoline treatment failed to activate TAK1. Using TAK1-deficient MEFs, we found that TLR8-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation are TAK1-independent. Taken together, our results indicate that the unmodified IRAK in TLR8 pathway probably does not utilize TAK1 to mediate downstream signaling. On the other hand, TLR8-mediated IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB and JNK activation are completely abolished in MEKK3-/- MEFs, whereas IL-1-mediated signaling was only moderately reduced in these deficient MEFs as compared with wild-type cells. Therefore, instead of TAK1, the unmodified IRAK in the TLR8 pathway probably utilizes MEKK3 to mediate NF-κB and JNK activation. The differences between IL-1R- and TLR8-mediated pathways are also reflected at the level of the IKK complex. TLR8 ligands induced IKKγ phosphorylation, whereas IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKγ ubiquitination that can be induced by IL-1 were not detected in cells treated with TLR8 ligands. Previous studies suggest that ligand-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β plays a critical role in IKK activation (41Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). However, although imidazoquinoline treatment does not lead to IKKα/β phosphorylation, TLR8 ligands still activate the kinase activity of IKK, indicating that IKK is activated through a differential mechanism in TLR8 signaling. Using MEKK3-deficient MEFs, MEKK3 is shown to be required for TLR8-induced IKKγ phosphorylation. We postulate that TLR8-mediated MEKK3-dependent IKKγ phosphorylation might play an important role in the activation of IKK complex, leading to IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. The dogma for NF-κB activation is that signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα targets this inhibitor of NF-κB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thus allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus to turn on the target gene (42Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). One intriguing finding is that whereas IL-1 stimulation leads to IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, imidazoquinoline treatment only causes IκBα phosphorylation but not degradation. By NF-κB DNA binding assay and NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay, it is clear that imidazoquinoline treatment can lead to NF-κB activation. It is possible that the TLR8-mediated IκBα phosphorylation might lead to dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB without IκBα degradation. The dissociated NF-κB migrates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. Alternately, the phosphorylation of IκBα by imidazoquinoline treatment changes the confirmation of the NF-κB-IκBα complex, which exposes the nuclear localization signal on NF-κB, leading to nuclear localization of NF-κB. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of IκBα in the C-terminal PEST region is critical for IκBα degradation (42Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 43Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that imidazoquinoline treatment might miss such specific phosphorylation on IκBα, which leads to a lack of IκBα degradation. Future studies are required to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of TLR8-mediated NF-κB activation. The physiological significance of this novel TLR8-mediated MyD88-dependent pathway still needs to be further investigated. Our unpublished studies showed that this novel MyD88-dependent pathway is predominantly present in primary kidney and intestine/colon epithelial cells. 4M. F. Gulen and X. Li, unpublished data. Therefore, it is possible that this unique pathway plays a critical in maintaining the homeostasis of epithelium. Recent studies showed that the TLR8-MyD88-IRAK4 pathway is required to reverse the suppressive function of Treg cells (44Peng G. Guo Z. Kiniwa Y. Voo K.S. Peng W. Fu T. Wang D.Y. Li Y. Wang H.Y. Wang R.F. Science. 2005; 309: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It should be very interesting to investigate whether this novel MyD88-dependent pathway plays a role in reversing the suppressive function of Treg cells."

The rate-limiting step in the transit of chylomicrons through the enterocyte is the exit of chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum in prechylomicron transport vesicles (PCTV) that transport chylomicrons to the cis-Golgi. Because chylomicrons are 250 nm in average diameter and lipid absorption is intermittent, we postulated that a unique SNARE pairing would be utilized to fuse PCTV with their target membrane, cis-Golgi. PCTV loaded with [3H]triacylglycerol were incubated with cis-Golgi and were separated from the Golgi by a sucrose step gradient. PCTV-chylomicrons acquire apolipoprotein-AI (apoAI) only after fusion with the Golgi. PCTV became isodense with Golgi upon incubation and were considered fused when their cargo chylomicrons acquired apoAI but docked when they did not. PCTV, docked with cis-Golgi, were solubilized in 2% Triton X-100, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using VAMP7 or rBet1 antibodies. In both cases, a 112-kDa complex was identified in nonboiled samples that dissociated upon boiling. The constituents of the complex were VAMP7, syntaxin 5, vti1a, and rBet1. Antibodies to each SNARE component significantly inhibited fusion of PCTV with cis-Golgi. Membrin, Sec22b, and Ykt6 were not found in the 112-kDa complex.

The villus structure and especially the brush border of intestinal absorptive cells provide an expanded surface area for the absorption of lipids and other nutrients. Since control over uptake rates of diet-derived fatty acids is limited, large amounts may flood enterocytes upon ingestion of a fatty meal requiring rapid disposal or risk cellular injury (1Stralfors P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is accomplished either by binding the fatty acids to L-FABP (liver fatty acid-binding protein) (2Hsu K.-T. Storch J. J.

(3Mansbach II, C.M. Dowell R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 605-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TAG is incorporated into the unique lipoprotein of the intestine, the chylomicron, whose diameter averages 250 nm. The exit of chylomicrons from the ER in a specialized vesicle, the prechylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV) (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), is the rate-limiting step in lipid absorption (3Mansbach II, C.M. Dowell R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 605-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After exiting the ER, PCTV travel to the cis-Golgi by an anterograde mechanism (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S.

Apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) becomes associated with chylomicrons in the ER and undergoes glycosylation changes in the Golgi (6Berriot-Varoqueaux N. Dannoura A.H. Moreau A. Verthier N. Sassoias A.

Finally, microsomal triglyceride transport protein is found in the Golgi and may participate in chylomicron biogenesis (8Levy E. Stan S. Delvin E. Menardi D. Shoulders C. Garofalo C. Slight I.

After being modified in the Golgi, chylomicrons subsequently undergo exocytosis at the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte. Because of their large size to accommodate the chylomicron cargo, and the intermittent nature of their production associated with eating, we hypothesized that PCTV generation and its targeting to the cis-Golgi was associated with unique trafficking and targeting protein(s) as compared with nascent protein-transporting vesicles, which are 80 nm in diameter (9Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In support of this thesis, we found that PCTV budding from ER membranes was independent of COPII proteins but that COPII proteins were required for delivery of the chylomicrons to the cis-Golgi (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the proteins that mediate the interactions of PCTV with the Golgi. Vesicles arriving at their target compartment, such as the Golgi, are first tethered and then dock and finally fuse with the membrane, resulting in the mixing of the interior contents of the vesicle with the luminal contents of the target (10Nickel W.

Since we have observed that PCTV fuse only with intestinal cis-Golgi and not liver or kidney cis-Golgi (13Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility arises that in the intestine, there is a unique SNARE pairing for PCTV with cis-Golgi. Further, PCTV generated in the absence of COPII proteins do not become associated with the cis-Golgi (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that COPII proteins or cargo selected by the COPII complex may be required for Golgi targeting or fusion. In the current study, we have sought to define the SNARE complex for PCTV as the vesicle and cis-Golgi as the target membrane. We provide evidence that VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7) (TI-VAMP), a vesicle-associated SNARE, or v-SNARE (R-SNARE), thought to be primarily used in the endosomal system (14Advani R. Prekeris R. Lee K. Klumperman J. Scheller R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) but recently identified in rat intestinal ER (9Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is the v-SNARE for PCTV and forms part of the PCTV-cis-Golgi SNARE complex. Further, we document that PCTV fuses with the Golgi by demonstrating delivery of PCTV content to the cis-Golgi. Materials—[3H]oleic acid (9.2 Ci/mm) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Isolation of ER, Cytosol, and Golgi and Metabolic Labeling of Enterocytes—The surface mucosal cells, enterocytes, from the proximal half of rat small intestine were isolated and radiolabeled with [3H]TAG as described (13Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, enterocytes were stripped from intestinal villi, collected, incubated with albumin-bound [3H]oleate, and washed with albumin to remove excess [3H]oleate. The cells were homogenized, and the ER were isolated using a sucrose step gradient, which was repeated to purify the ER. The [3H]TAG-loaded ER preparation contained no Golgi, endosomes, or lysosomes (9Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). cis-Golgi was isolated from nonradiolabeled rat enterocytes (13Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar) as was cytosol (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The cis-Golgi preparation contained GOS28 but not calnexin (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE, Calculation of Protein Mr, and Immunoblots— Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weights were calculated from a plot of the log Mr of standard molecular weight proteins versus their Rf (relative mobility) on SDS-PAGE. A linear regression line and y intercept were calculated from the data, and the formula was used to determine the log Mr of unknown proteins or protein complexes using their Rf values. For immunoblotting, proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, were transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After incubations with specific primary and then secondary antibodies, labeled proteins were detected using ECL reagents and exposing the developed blots to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). In Vitro PCTV Formation—PCTV, containing chylomicron-[3H]TAG, were formed from [3H]TAG-loaded ER (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In brief, ER was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system in the absence of Golgi acceptor. The incubation mixture was resolved on a continuous sucrose gradient, and PCTV were isolated from the light portions of the gradient. PCTV thus formed were concentrated to 5.0 mg/ml protein using a Centricon-10 filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). In Vitro PCTV Docking and Fusion with the Golgi—In experiments where PCTV docking with Golgi was required, PCTV (150 μg of protein) containing [3H]TAG were incubated with cis-Golgi membranes (300 μg of protein) for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 500 μg of cytosolic protein. Reactions contained 0.5 mm ATPγS, 1 mm EDTA, and buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol; total volume, 500 μl). In experiments where PCTV fusion with the Golgi was required, similar amounts of PCTV, cis-Golgi membrane, and cytosol protein were used, but the incubation (35 °C) contained an ATP-regenerating system, 5 mm MgCl2, and buffer A but no ATPγS or EDTA. Throughout, “ATP” refers to an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 5 units of creatine phosphokinase). Reactions were stopped by adding cold buffer A and placing the tubes on ice. The density of the reaction mix was adjusted to 1.22 m sucrose (total volume 3 ml). This was overlaid with 2.6 ml each of 1.15, 0.86, and 0.25 m sucrose, and the gradient was centrifuged (5Kumar N.S. Mansbach II. C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G378-G386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, PCTV not associated with the Golgi float to the top of the gradient (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Kumar N.S. Mansbach II. C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G378-G386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To release Golgi luminal contents, the cis-Golgi fraction (0.86/1.15 m sucrose interface) was incubated with 100 mm carbonate, pH 11,for1hat4 °C. The incubation mix was diluted with 10 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, the suspension was centrifuged (15Mansbach II, C.M. Arnold A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G263-G269PubMed Google Scholar), and the fraction containing the chylomicrons, which were visible as a white band at the top of the gradient, was isolated (15Mansbach II, C.M. Arnold A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G263-G269PubMed Google Scholar). Chylomicron proteins were delipidated, separated on SDS-PAGE (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and probed for apoAI by immunoblot. Transport of Newly Synthesized TAG to the Golgi—The delivery of PCTV-TAG to the Golgi was determined using PCTV loaded with newly synthesized [3H]TAG (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The PCTV were incubated with Golgi from unlabeled cells in the presence of cytosol, an ATP-regenerating system, Mg2+, and buffer A at 35 °C for 30 min (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Isolation of the SNARE Complex—PCTV were docked (see above, and see “Results”) with cis-Golgi, and the cis-Golgi were isolated on a sucrose step gradient (13Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, undocked PCTV are separated from the Golgi and float to the top of the gradient. Putative PCTV-Golgi membranes were solubilized using 2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either rabbit anti-VAMP7 or anti-rBet1 antibodies bound to agarose beads. The beads were washed thoroughly to remove unbound proteins (as judged by the absence of VAMP7 on immunoblot after six of a total of 10 washes when the anti-VAMP7 antibody was used; data not shown), and the beads were either boiled or not boiled in Laemmli buffer as indicated. These procedures were slightly modified from those described by others in that no N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used (16Castillo-Flores A. Weinberger A. Robinson M. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34033-34041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The same membrane was probed with antibodies to syntaxin 5, VAMP7, rBet1, and vti1a. For reprobing membranes with different antibodies, membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) three times, incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS) for 45 min at 56 °C, and washed three times with PBS-T, which was followed by blocking in 5% blotto (Bio-Rad) in PBS-T overnight. Measurement of TAG Radioactivity—TAG radioactivity was quantitated as described (13Kumar N.S. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G18-G30PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between means were carried out using a statistical package supplied by GraphPad Software (Instat, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using a two-tailed t test. PCTV Associate with the cis-Golgi—To define the components of the fusion complex, it was first necessary to develop conditions whereby PCTV associate with the cis-Golgi but do not fuse (i.e. the PCTV dock with the cis-Golgi) (18Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 19Sollner T. Whitehart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjumont-Bromage G.S. Tempst P. Rothman J.B. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar, 20Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We postulated that the proteins important for docking would be components of the fusion complex and identifiable as a multimeric, SDS-stable complex (21Hag J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which dissociates on boiling. We further postulated that docking would stabilize the components of the fusion complex, which otherwise would quickly dissociate (22Peng R. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a first step toward this goal, the purity of our subcellular organelle preparations was established. The intestinal ER preparations from which PCTV are derived have been shown to be free of Golgi, lysosomal, or endosomal contamination (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Siddiqi S.A. Mahan J.T. Siddiqi S. Gorelick F.S. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but do contain the ER resident protein, calnexin (Fig. 1). The cis-Golgi preparations used have the Golgi protein, GOS28, but do not contain either calnexin or Rab11 (Fig. 1), ruling out significant ER or endosomal/lysosomal contamination, respectively. These results suggest that our PCTV and cis-Golgi preparations were of adequate purity for studies of compartment interactions. The first step in examining PCTV docking and fusion was to determine whether PCTV could associate with the cis-Golgi. For these studies, PCTV were incubated with cis-Golgi and various cofactors and then separated on a sucrose density gradient. An association of PCTV with Golgi was defined as a shift of PCTV from light fractions to heavier fractions containing Golgi. Incubations were performed at 35 °C in the expectation of fusion and 4 °C in the expectation of a potentially stabilized docking complex. The redistribution of PCTV was normalized to the maximal condition with PCTV, Golgi, cytosol, and ATP at 35 °C (Fig. 2A, bar 1). As shown in Fig. 2A, PCTV association with the cis-Golgi at 35 °C was enhanced by the addition of cytosol (bar 1 versus bar 2). However, the enhancing effects of cytosol were eliminated when incubations were performed at 4 °C (bar 1 versus bar 3). These findings demonstrate that the association of PCTV with Golgi is both temperature-andcytosol-dependent. Next, the effects of ATP on this interaction were examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, removal of ATP decreased the cytosol-dependent association of PCTV with Golgi at 35 °C (bar 2 versus bar 4). PCTV also did not interact with cis-Golgi upon incubation at 4 °C with ATP in the absence of cytosol (data not shown) or at 35 °C when both cytosol and ATP were excluded (Fig. 2B, bar 1). However, in the absence of ATP, the association of PCTV with Golgi was enhanced when incubation occurred with cytosol at 4 °C (Fig. 2B, bar 4 versus bar 3). Interestingly, when examined at 4 °C, ATP caused the opposite effect from that observed at 35 °C. At 4 °C, ATP decreases the association of PCTV with Golgi (compare Fig. 2A, bar 3 with Fig. 2B, bar 3), whereas at 35 °C, ATP increases the association of PCTV with Golgi (compare Fig. 2B, bar 2, with Fig. 2B, bar 4). There are several potential explanations for these observations. First, the mechanism of the PCTV shift to the cis-Golgi fraction may not be the same at 4 and 35 °C. For example, whereas fusion events can occur at 35 °C, they cannot at 4 °C. Thus, it is possible that the PCTV association with Golgi at 35 °C is in part due to fusion, whereas at 4 °C the association is due to docking. Whereas the mechanism for the enhanced PCTV-Golgi association with ATP elimination is unclear, one explanation is that ATP destabilizes a docking complex that forms at 4 °C. This conclusion is supported by the work of Söllner et al. (23Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), who suggested that in the presence of ATP, the SNARE complex quickly disassociates even at 4 °C. In summary, these data demonstrate that PCTV can associate with the Golgi but do not discriminate between docking and fusion. Docking and Fusion of PCTV with cis-Golgi—To differentiate between PCTV being docked or fused with the Golgi, we took advantage of the fact that PCTV-chylomicrons do not contain apoAI (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a lipoprotein constituent of mature chylomicrons that is added in the Golgi complex (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, chylomicron acquisition of apoAI can be equated to the delivery of PCTV-chylomicrons to the Golgi lumen, suggesting a fusion event. In contrast, PCTV docked at the Golgi would undergo the density shift to the position of the Golgi, but its cargo chylomicrons would not acquire apoAI, whereas PCTV fused with the Golgi would also undergo the same density shift, but its PCTV-chylomicrons would acquire apoAI. To test the acquisition of apoAI by chylomicrons, the chylomicrons were released from the Golgi membranes by carbonate treatment, and the apoAI content assayed by immunoblot (see “Experimental Procedures”). Apoproteins remain associated with chylomicrons in the presence of carbonate. The ability of PCTV to dock with intestinal cis-Golgi at 4 °C and fuse at 35 °C was next examined. Fig. 3 shows the apoAI content, a marker of PCTV fusion with the Golgi, of released chylomicrons under varying conditions. Chylomicrons released from PCTV contained minimal amounts of apoAI (Fig. 3, PCTV), consistent with our prior data (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chylomicrons released from native cis-Golgi had a modest increase in apoAI content over that found in PCTV (Fig. 3, PCTV versus Golgi). Importantly, chylomicrons released from cis-Golgi incubated at 4 °C with PCTV and cytosol but without ATP (Fig. 3, PDG) contained amounts of apoAI similar to that found in native Golgi. As judged by the [3H]TAG signal, however, under these incubation conditions (PDG), the PCTV become isodense with the cis-Golgi (Fig. 2B, bar 3). Since the chylomicrons in PCTV incubated with Golgi at 4 °C as in Fig. 3 (PDG) or Fig. 2B (bar 3) became associated with the Golgi but did not acquire apoAI (Fig. 3, PDG), we concluded that the PCTV were docked with but not fused with the Golgi. These data suggest that at 4 °C, PCTV docking with the cis-Golgi requires cytosolic factors and is ATP-independent; the requirements are consistent with the conditions for docking described by Wilson et al. (24Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Bunner M. Rothman J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These data suggest that at 4 °C, PCTV dock but do not fuse with the Golgi. Our previous work provided preliminary evidence that PCTV might fuse with Golgi when combined with warm cytosol (4Siddiqi S.A. Gorelick F.S. Mahan J.T. Mansbach II, C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Kumar N.S. Mansbach II. C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G378-G386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate this phenomenon, PCTV were incubated with intestinal cis-Golgi, cytosol, Mg2+, and ATP at 35 °C, and the amount of apoAI associated with postincubation chylomicrons was assayed (Fig. 3, PFG). After incubation in the warm conditions, there was a 6.4-fold increase in the amount of apoAI associated with the released chylomicrons (Fig. 3, PFG) as compared with when the PCTV were incubated with Golgi under conditions that favored docking (Fig. 3, PDG). These data support the conclusion that the PCTV fused with the cis-Golgi under these conditions (Fig. 3, PFG), and their chylomicron cargo acquired apoAI as a consequence. When chylomicrons were released from the postincubation Golgi (as in Fig. 3, PFG) and incubated with proteinase K, the apoAI signal was completely attenuated (Fig. 3, PFG+K). These data support the conclusion that the chylomicrons that acquired apoAI in Fig. 3 (PFG) were within the Golgi lumen and that when released they were free of membrane and could be successfully attacked by proteinase K. The findings demonstrate that at 35 °C, PCTV fuse with the Golgi in an ATP- and cytosol-dependent manner. To determine the specificity of PCTV docking for intestinal Golgi, PCTV were incubated with cis-Golgi from liver and kidney. We tested both liver and kidney Golgi because liver exports a TAG-rich lipoprotein, the very low density lipoprotein, whereas kidney represents a non-TAG-rich lipoprotein-exporting organ. There was minimal association of PCTV-[3H]TAG with the Golgi derived from either organ compared with the intestinal Golgi control (Fig. 4). These data support the thesis that the interaction between PCTV and intestinal Golgi is unique. The combined data are consistent with the interpretation that the luminal contents of PCTV and intestinal Golgi mix upon incubation under warm conditions in the presence of ATP and cytosol, suggesting that the membranes fused and that such a PCTV-Golgi fusion event is specific for intestinal cis-Golgi. Although intestinal cytosol was used for these experiments (Fig. 4), cytosol from either liver or kidney has been pr"
https://openalex.org/W2060267149,"BCL3 is a proto-oncogene affected by chromosomal translocations in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is an IκB family protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation of a number of NF-κB target genes. In this study, interleukin (IL)-6-induced BCL3 expression and its effect on survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells were examined. We demonstrate the upregulation of BCL3 by IL-6 in INA-6 and other MM cell lines. Sequence analysis of the BCL3 gene locus revealed four potential signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) binding sites within two conserved intronic enhancers regions: one located within enhancer HS3 and three within HS4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed increased Stat3 binding to both enhancers upon IL-6 stimulation. Silencing Stat3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated BCL3 expression by IL-6. Using reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that BCL3 transcription depends on HS4. Mutation of the Stat motifs within HS4 abolished IL-6-dependent BCL3 induction. Furthermore, BCL3 transcription was inhibited by its own gene product. This repressive feedback is mediated by NF-κB sites within the promoter and HS3. Finally, we show that overexpression of BCL3 increases apoptosis, whereas BCL3-specific siRNA does not affect the viability of INA-6 cells suggesting that BCL3 is not essential for the survival of these cells."

In particular, phosphorylation of serine 1179 (bovine)/1177 (human) by Akt has been shown to be the central mechanism of eNOS regulation. Here we revealed a novel role of proteasome in controlling eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and function. Rather than affecting eNOS turnover, proteasomal inhibition specifically dephosphorylated eNOS serine 1179, leading to decreased enzymatic activity. Blocking protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by okadaic acid or PP2A knockdown restored eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and activity in proteasome-inhibited cells. Although total PP2A expression and activity in cells were not affected by proteasome inhibitors, proteasomal inhibition induced PP2A ubiquitination and ubiquitinated PP2A translocated from cytosol to membrane. Further biochemical analyses demonstrated that eNOS associated with PP2A on cell membranes. Proteasomal inhibition markedly enhanced PP2A association to eNOS, and this increase of PP2A dephosphorylated eNOS and its upstream kinase Akt. Taken together, these studies identified a novel pathway in which proteasome modulates eNOS phosphorylation by inducing intracellular PP2A translocation.

Because NO is highly diffusible and cannot be stored in intracellular compartments, modulation of NO signaling intensity is primarily achieved by tuning NOS activity. So far, three NOS isoforms have been identified in mammalian cells as neuronal NOS (type I), inducible NOS (type II), and endothelial NOS (eNOS, type III) (4Nathan C. Xie Q.-W.

Previously thought to be solely activated by elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, eNOS function is now known to be critically modulated by protein phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular localization (6Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12PubMed Google Scholar). Several kinases have been identified to phosphorylate eNOS at a number of consensus motifs (5Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar). These include protein kinases A, B (PKB/Akt), and C, calmodulin kinase II, AMP-activated kinase, etc. The predominant one is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway. It was first reported that vascular endothelial growth factor or shear stress activated Akt through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and subsequently Akt phosphorylated the serine 1179/1177 (bovine/human) residue of eNOS (7Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar, 8Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 1179 enhances eNOS function, and remarkably, the catalytic activity of phospho-eNOS does not require the rise of intracellular Ca2+ (9McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Since the original reports that vascular endothelial growth factor and shear stress activated eNOS through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway, there are increasing number of hormones or bioactive substances found to modulate eNOS function via Akt. These include insulin, insulin-like growth factor, angiopoietin-1, estrogen, leptin, sphingosine 1-phosphate, reactive oxygen species, corticosteroids, etc. (10Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of eNOS serine 1179/1177 by Akt has emerged as a central mechanism of eNOS regulation under both physiological and pathological conditions. The phosphorylation status of a protein is determined by the balanced actions of protein kinases and phosphatases that, respectively, add and remove phosphate groups from their target proteins (11Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar, 12Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast to the extensive characterization of the kinases that phosphorylate eNOS, the process of eNOS dephosphorylation is understood in much less detail. Nevertheless, there were reports that serine 1179 of eNOS was distinctively dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (13Greif D.M. Kou R. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15845-15853Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PP2A is a highly conserved and ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase that is often thought to dephosphorylate proteins with poor substrate specificity (14Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). It remains unknown how PP2A is directed to specifically control eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for the majority of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells and, hence, plays important roles in many fundamental cellular processes including signal transduction (15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar, 16Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). The core component of this system is the 26 S proteasome in which proteolysis takes place. In an effort to define the roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in regulating eNOS turnover, we unexpectedly found that proteasome profoundly affected eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and function. Inhibition of proteasome function led to eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation and consequent decrease of enzymatic activity. Further studies demonstrated that the effects of proteasome on eNOS were mediated by the membrane translocation of PP2A. We also provided evidence suggesting that ubiquitination of PP2A regulatory and structural subunits may be required for its membrane translocation.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and grown in the medium provided by the manufacturer. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293, ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells neither contain eNOS mRNA nor express eNOS protein. Wild-type bovine eNOS cDNA in mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was transfected to HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine and PLUS reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instruction. Transfected cells were cultured in selective media (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 500 mg/ml G418). G418-resistant colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders, trypsinized, and proliferated in selective media containing G418 (500 mg/ml). After two cycles of the colony selection process, eight cloned cell lines were obtained, and further characterization showed that they stably expressed eNOS. One of the lines (eNOS.C4) was designated as the eNOS-HEK 293 cell and used in this study. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The siRNA SMARTpools for human PP2A-C and non-targeting control were purchased from (Dharmacon). In 12-well plates, cells were plated the day before transfection and grown to 30–50% confluence. siRNA oligonucleotides (100 nm) were transfected into cells with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) (32Wei Q. Xia Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, Western blotting was carried out to examine the knockdown of targeted proteins. Cellular Fractionation—Cells were harvested and suspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor tablet). After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells and nuclei. The homogenates were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g (4 °C) for 1 h, and the supernatants were recovered and designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellets were resuspended and washed once with homogenization buffer. After another centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h, 4 °C), the pellets were recovered as the membrane fraction. In some experiments the cytosolic and membrane fractions were directly boiled in SDS/PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and analyzed by Western blotting. In other experiments, target proteins in cytosolic and membrane fractions were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor tablet), and immunoprecipitations were carried out with appropriate antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation and Pulldown Assay—Cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor tablet). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were recovered. Supernatants containing equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 2.5 mg of primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were harvested by protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed once with regular washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), twice with high salt washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and another time with regular washing buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then eluted by 5 min boiling of the beads in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and characterized by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. For the eNOS pulldown assay, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B resins (100 ml of 50% slurry) were added to the cell lysates and incubated with a rotator for 2 h at 4°C. The resins were washed similarly as described in the co-immunoprecipitation assay, and pulled down proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor tablet. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were recovered. The total protein concentrations were determined by using the DC-protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by using semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. Membrane-bound primary antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoblots were developed on films using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (SuperSingal West Pico, Pierce). NOS Activity Assay—eNOS activity was measured by the l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline conversion assay (30Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 31Xia Y. Zweier J.L. . 1997; 94: 12705-12710Google Scholar). To measure the activity of phospho-eNOS, the assay was performed in the presence of 10 nm Ca2+ as previously reported (8Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar, 32Wei Q. Xia Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18081-18086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in homogenate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture) and made homogeneous by pulse sonication. After centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), the pellets were recovered, washed, and resuspended in homogenate buffer. Cell lysates (45 mg of protein) was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm NADPH, 10 nm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 5 μm l-[14C]arginine, and 45 μm l-arginine. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by ice-cold stop buffer. l-[14C]Citrulline was separated by passing the reaction mixture through Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Na+ form, Sigma) cation exchange columns and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. In Vitro Phosphatase Activity Assay—Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with phosphatase lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor tablet. PP2A immunoprecipitates or 2,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B pulldown complexes were prepared as describe above. These beads were extensively washed with regular immunoprecipitation washing buffer and high salt (500 mm NaCl) washing buffer. The beads were further washed once with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.0, 100 mm CaCl2). Activities of PP2A in the beads were determined by using a malachite green phosphatase assay protocol with a phosphopeptide (KRpTIRR; pT is phosphorylated Thr) as the substrate (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by the measurement of absorbance at 650 nm with a SPECTRAmax 190 microplate spectrophotometer. Statistics—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student's paired or unpaired t test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Proteasomal Inhibition Induced eNOS Serine 1179 Dephosphorylation—To determine the roles of proteasome in regulating eNOS turnover and phosphorylation, we examined the effects of a proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the levels of total eNOS and phospho-eNOS (serine 1179) in an eNOS stably transfected cell line (eNOS-HEK 293). As shown in Fig. 1A, MG132 treatment time-dependently decreased serine 1179-phosphorylated eNOS, whereas the levels of total eNOS were not significantly affected. MG132-induced serine 1179 dephosphorylation was a highly specific event because the phosphorylation status of other residues in eNOS such as threonine 497 or serine 635 was not altered. Consistent with the loss of serine 1179 dephosphorylation, eNOS activity was reduced in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 1B). The classic NOS inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester completely blocked enzyme activity. To ensure the dephosphorylation of eNOS was a general phenomenon of proteasomal inhibition rather than the unique action of MG132, we examined the effects of lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor whose structure is different from that of MG132 (17Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Similar to the action of MG132, lactacystin treatment also induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation but had no effect on threonine 497 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). To reconfirm that proteasome function was inhibited by MG132 or lactacystin treatment, we monitored the alterations of intracellular cyclin B1, a protein well known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). As expected, both MG132 and lactacystin treatment caused cyclin B1 accumulation in cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data demonstrated that proteasomal inhibition specifically dephosphorylated eNOS serine 1179, leading to decreased enzymatic activity. To ascertain that our findings from eNOS-HEK 293 cells occurred in native endothelial cells, we also determined the effects of proteasome inhibition on eNOS phosphorylation in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). In consistent with the results from eNOS-HEK 293 cells, MG132 selectively reduced eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). These data demonstrated that the eNOS-HEK 293 cell was a valid model to investigate the regulation of eNOS phosphorylation by proteasome in endothelial cells. PP2A Blockade or Knockdown Reversed the eNOS Dephosphorylation Induced by Proteasomal Inhibition—Because eNOS serine 1179 was reported to be dephosphorylated by PP2A (13Greif D.M. Kou R. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15845-15853Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the roles of PP2A in proteasome inhibition-induced eNOS dephosphorylation. Okadaic acid at the range of 1–1000 nm has been demonstrated to only block PP2A (18Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, adding okadaic acid (50 nm) reversed MG132-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation. As a result, phospho-eNOS activity in MG132-treated cells was also restored by okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 3B). To corroborate the results obtained with okadaic acid, we used siRNA to selectively knock down PP2A. As shown in Fig. 4, PP2A knockdown prevented MG132-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation and preserved phospho-eNOS activity. These PP2A siRNA silence data were in accordance with the results from okadaic acid and further confirmed that that proteasome inhibition-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation was mediated by PP2A.FIGURE 4PP2A knockdown prevented proteasome inhibition-induced eNOS dephosphorylation. A, cells were transfected with control and PP2A siRNAs for 48 h and then treated with MG132 (10 μm). After MG132 treatment, the levels of PP2A, eNOS phosphorylation, and eNOS activity were measured. As shown, PP2A siRNA, but not the control siRNA, markedly reduced intracellular PP2A and prevented MG132-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation (p). Representative blots were shown from five independent experiments. B, PP2A knockdown reversed the effect of MG132 on phospho-eNOS activity (**, p < 0.01, versus control, n = 8). This figure was a representative of six separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation by proteasomal inhibition was due to PP2A up-regulation, we investigated the effects of MG132 on PP2A expression and activity. PP2A is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit C, a structural subunit A, and a regulatory subunit B (19Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the intracellular levels of the three PP2A subunits were not significantly affected by MG132 treatment (Fig. 3C). Although PP2A expression was unchanged by proteasomal inhibition, it was possible that PP2A activity might be enhanced. To rule out this possibility, we immunoprecipitated PP2A from cells and measured phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 3D, PP2A immunoprecipitates from control and MG132-treated cells displayed similar activities. Thus, dephosphorylation of eNOS serine 1179 in proteasome-inhibited cells was not due to increased PP2A expression or enhanced catalytic activity. Proteasomal Inhibition Enhanced PP2A Association to eNOS—Because total PP2A expression and activity were not affected by proteasomal inhibition, we then asked whether PP2A subcellular localization was changed and, if so, whether PP2A translocation resulted in eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation. Because eNOS is a membrane-associated enzyme, experiments were conducted to determine the effects of MG132 on the distribution of PP2A in cytosolic and membrane fractions of eNOS-HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the control untreated cells PP2A mainly resided in cytosol. Only small amounts of PP2A were detected in the membrane fractions. After MG132 treatment, a significant increase of PP2A content was seen in the membrane fractions. These results indicated that cytosolic PP2A translocated to membrane after proteasome inhibition. To determine whether PP2A and eNOS can physically associate each other on membrane, PP2A was immunoprecipitated from the cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, immunoprecipitation with the anti-PP2A antibody, but not the control IgG, resulted in a co-precipitation of eNOS. These data demonstrated that eNOS and PP2A were associated each other in cells. To further prove that increased PP2A in the membrane fraction of MG132-treated cells was specifically targeted to eNOS, we used 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity resins to pull down eNOS and characterized the proteins associated with eNOS. As expected, PP2A was found in the eNOS-pulled-down complexes (Fig. 5C). After MG132 treatment, significantly more PP2A was detected to associate with eNOS. Consistent with the elevated protein levels, increased phosphatase activity was measured in the pulled down proteins from MG132-treated cells than from control cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data demonstrated that proteasomal inhibition augmented PP2A association to eNOS, leading to serine 1179 dephosphorylation. Deactivation of eNOS-associated Akt in Proteasome-inhibited Cells—In addition to increased PP2A association, reduction of eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation may also result from loss or deactivation of its upstream kinase Akt. Because Akt was reported to associate with eNOS by the intermediation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (20Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we pulled down eNOS and studied the effects of proteasome inhibition on eNOS-associated Akt. Activation of Akt requires phosphorylation of its threonine 308 and serine 473 residues by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (21Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, MG132 treatment dramatically decreased threonine 308- and serine 473-phosphorylated Akt, indicating that Akt was deactivated by proteasomal inhibition. This Akt deactivation was not due to the loss of eNOS-Akt association because the total amounts of Akt bound to eNOS remained the same. MG132 treatments also did not change the sum levels of Akt or 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) in cells (Fig. 6B). Because proteasome inhibition augmented PP2A association to eNOS and phospho-Akt is known to be a substrate of PP2A (18Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that deactivation of Akt was mediated by PP2A. Indeed, the addition of okadaic acid completely reversed the dephosphorylation of eNOS-associated Akt (threonine 308/serine 473) in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 6C). To ascertain that PP2A-mediated kinase dephosphorylation specifically occurred to eNOS-associated phospho-Akt, we also monitored the effects of MG132 on the phosphorylation status of p38 kinase and JNK, which are also known to be the substrates of PP2A (18Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6D, neither phospho-p38 nor phospho-JNK was affected by MG132 treatment. These data strongly indicated that increased PP2A association to eNOS dephosphorylated phospho-Akt, leading to Akt deactivation in proteasome-inhibited cells. Roles of Ubiquitination in Proteasome Inhibition-induced PP2A Membrane Translocation—Finally, we explored the possible mechanisms underlying the membrane translocation of PP2A after proteasome inhibition. Because the most predominant consequence of proteasome inhibition is the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, we reasoned that ubiquitination of PP2A might involve in the process of its membrane translocation. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated PP2A-A (PR65) and -B subunits (B56) from cellular fractionations and determined their ubiquitination status. In the absence of MG132, no significant ubiquitination was found to occur to the PR65 and B56 in the cytosol (Fig. 7, A and B). However, PR65 and B56 in cellular membrane fractions were weakly ubiquitinated. These data suggested that ubiquitination of PR65 and B56 subunits might be required for its membrane association. If this hypothesis was correct, it would predict that the increased PP2A in the membranes of proteasome-inhibited cells were ubiquitinated. Indeed, dramatic increases of ubiquitinated PR65 and B56 were seen in cellular membrane fractions after MG132 treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). Neither PR65 nor B56 in the cytosol of MG132-treated cells was detected to be ubiquitinated despite the massive accumulation of other ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 7C). These data further supported the notion that ubiquitination of PR65 and B56 might mediate the cytosol-to-membrane translocation of PP2A after proteasomal inhibition. The results described above unveiled a previously uncharacterized role of proteasome in controlling eNOS phosphorylation and function. The cardiovascular system heavily relies on phosphorylation regulation of eNOS to maintain its homeostasis (5Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fleming I. Busse R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: R1-R12PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant eNOS regulation and function have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and stroke (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous biological stimuli ranging from hormones and physical stretch to the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin activate eNOS through the Akt-eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation axis (10Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The present study identified the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a novel modulator of eNOS phosphorylation. As the chief intracellular protein degradation pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been reported to be involved in neuronal NOS and inducible NOS turnover (22Osawa Y. Lowe E.R. Everett A.C. Dunbar A.Y. Billecke S.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no significant eNOS accumulation was seen in cells after proteasomal inhibition in the present study. On the other hand, dephosphorylation of eNOS serine 1179 occurred. Proteasomal inhibition-induced eNOS dephosphorylation was unique to its serine 1179 residue because the phosphorylation status of threonine 497 or serine 635 was unchanged. The functional significance of this dephosphorylation was evidenced by the fact that eNOS activity was markedly reduced in proteasome-inhibited cells. There was a study reporting that MG132 caused a moderate increase of eNOS levels in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (23Stangl V. Lorenz M. Meiners S. Ludwig A. Bartsch C. Moobed M. Vietzke A. Kinkel H. Baumann G. Stangl K. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). With BAECs, we did not observed significant changes in eNOS levels after MG132 treatment. The varied results may be due to different types of endothelial cells used. Govers et al. (24Govers R. Bree P. Rablink T.J. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 2225-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) also reported that neither MG132 nor lactacystin affected eNOS expression in BAECs. Interestingly, they observed that NO productions from BAECs were reduced by MG132 treatment. But the mechanism was unknown. Our findings that proteasome inhibition down-regulated eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and activity may provide a plausible explanation for their observations. Together, our findings demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates eNOS function by modulating its serine 1179 phosphorylation rather than protein turnover. Blockade of PP2A by okadaic acid or PP2A knockdown completely reversed MG132-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation and recovered enzymatic activity. These data indicated that PP2A is involved in the dephosphorylating action of proteasome on eNOS. Interestingly, our studies demonstrated that proteasomal inhibition-induced eNOS serine 1179 dephosphorylation was due to PP2A subcellular redistribution rather than up-regulation of PP2A expression or activity. This is probably because PP2A is already highly abundant in cells. It was estimated that PP2A constitutes near 1% total cellular proteins (14Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). PP2A is constitutively active and accounts for the major portion of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in cells and tissues. Proteasomal inhibition induced a cytosol-to-membrane translocation of PP2A. This subcellular PP2A redistribution rendered enhanced phosphatase activity on membrane, which carried out dephosphorylations of membrane-bound proteins such as eNOS without the need to raise total PP2A expression or activity in cells. In the traditional view, PP2A passively counterbalances the actions of protein kinases by removing phosphate groups from the substrates of these kinases. Recent studies have changed this view and shown that PP2A can actively participate in signal transduction (19Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, unlike the kinases which recognize specific motifs of their target proteins, PP2A dephosphorylates phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues in substrate proteins with no particular sequence specificity. How PP2A engages in a particular signaling pathway remains not fully understood. One way to achieve specific actions is to couple PP2A with its targets through protein-protein interactions (12Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, it was reported that PP2A specifically modulates the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway through the interaction between its B56 subunit and adenomatous polyposis coli protein (25Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that PP2A coupled with eNOS. Proteasomal inhibition induced more PP2A recruited to eNOS, leading to serine 1179 dephosphorylation. The specific recruitment of PP2A to eNOS also provided a plausible explanation why dephosphorylation distinctively occurred at serine 1179 but not threonine 497, because the later was shown to be selectively dephosphorylated by PP1 (26Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The details of eNOS-PP2A association remain to be determined. Future studies are needed to elucidate whether eNOS directly couples with PP2A or they interact with each other via intermediate proteins. Akt has been reported to associate eNOS through the scaffolding of heat shock protein 90 (20Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our current study revealed PP2A as another component of eNOS subproteome. This close assembling of PP2A and Akt to eNOS established a local Yin-Yan mechanism for the precise control of eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation and function. Although most prior studies focused on the action of Akt, the present study highlighted that PP2A may play a dominant role in the overall control of eNOS serine 1179 phosphorylation. Upon proteasomal inhibition, recruitment of PP2A to eNOS dephosphorylated both phospho-eNOS and phospho-Akt. Dephosphorylation of the threonine 308 and serine 473 deactivated Akt. Thus, recruitment of PP2A to eNOS is an extremely effective way to down-regulate eNOS phosphorylation because it not only eliminated existing phospho-eNOS but also prevented de novo phospho-eNOS formation. Furthermore, the recruitment of PP2A to eNOS also ensured that dephosphorylation discriminatingly occurred to eNOS. Indeed, we found that other PP2A kinase substrates such as phopho-p38 and phospho-JNK were not affected in proteasome-inhibited cells. Although proteasome-mediated proteolysis still dominates the function of ubiquitin, it has become to appreciate the important roles of ubiquitination in non-proteolysis processes such as protein trafficking, regulation of protein function, and protein-protein interactions (27Schenell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For example, monoubiquitination has been shown to be a necessary and sufficient signal for internalization of many cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway (28Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination was also found to critically modulate the activity of certain transcriptional factors. Ubiquitination of MEKK1 inhibited MKK1 and MKK4 as well as their downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK activation, and this was not due to proteasome-mediated protein degradation (29Witowsky J.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1403-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A number of ubiquitin-binding proteins have been identified to play important roles in regulating a wide array of protein-protein interactions (27Schenell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The results in the present study suggested that ubiquitination of PP2A PR65 and B56 subunits may be essential for its membrane association and translocation. The diverse B subunits of PP2A have been long implicated in the process of PP2A subcellular localization (14Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 19Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). But exactly how the B subunits position PP2A in cells remains not fully understood. Our findings that membrane-bound but not the cytosolic B56 was ubiquitinated suggested ubiquitination of B56 may be required for its membrane localization. The PP2A-A subunit PR65 in the cell membrane was also ubiquitinated. These data argued that ubiquitination of B56 and PR65 might involve in the process of PP2A membrane association. Indeed, proteasomal inhibition increased ubiquitinated PR65 and B56, and a simultaneous increase of PP2A presence in membrane was detected. Regarding whether ubiquitination is required for PP2A to associate with eNOS, future investigations are still needed. Nevertheless, these results suggested that ubiquitination was another important posttranslational modification mechanism to direct PP2A to a particular protein complex, such as Akt-eNOS, to modulate protein phosphorylation and signal transduction. In summary, the findings of this study suggest the following mechanism for the interaction between proteasome function and eNOS phosphorylation. Normally, small amounts of PP2A were associated with eNOS to counterbalance the action of Akt. Under the condition of proteasomal inhibition, PP2A, likely via ubiquitination of PR65 and B56, translocated to the cell membrane and targeted on eNOS. PP2A subsequently dephosphorylated eNOS serine 1179 and phospho-Akt, leading to reduced enzymatic activity. The physiological and pathological significances of these findings remain to be explored. In light of the increasing evidence that proteasome dysfunction occurred in various diseases, it will be important to investigate if altered eNOS phosphorylation and function participate in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2136370293,"The mechanism of free fatty acid (FFA) transport across membranes is a subject of intense investigation. We have demonstrated recently that flip-flop is the rate-limiting step for transport of oleic acid across phospholipid vesicles (Cupp, D., Kampf, J. P., and Kleinfeld, A. M. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 4473-4481). To better understand the nature of the flip-flop barrier, we measured the temperature dependence of a series of saturated and monounsaturated FFA. We determined the rate constants for flip-flop and dissociation for small (SUV), large (LUV), and giant (GUV) unilamellar vesicles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine. For all FFA and vesicle types, dissociation was faster than flip-flop, and for all FFA, flip-flop and dissociation were faster in SUV than in LUV or GUV. Rate constants for both flip-flop and dissociation decreased exponentially with increasing FFA size. However, only the flip-flop rate constants increased significantly with temperature; the barrier to flip-flop was virtually entirely due to an enthalpic activation free energy. The barrier to dissociation was primarily entropic. Analysis in terms of a simple free volume (Vf) model revealed Vf values for flip-flop that ranged between ∼12 and 15Å3, with larger values for SUV than for LUV or GUV. Vf values increased with temperature, and this temperature dependence generated the enthalpic barrier to flip-flop. The barrier for dissociation and its size dependence primarily reflect the aqueous solubility of FFA. These are the first results to distinguish the energetics of flipflop and dissociation. This should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms governing FFA transport across biological membranes.

Although considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanism of cellular transport, there remains substantial disagreement as to whether transport is facilitated by membrane proteins or occurs by diffusion through the lipid phase (1Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Zakim D. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Kleinfeld A.M. J. Membr.

A protein-mediated mechanism would necessitate slow diffusion across the lipid phase, and therefore, understanding the mechanism of transport across simple lipid membranes has received considerable attention (5Daniels C. Noy N. Zakim D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3286-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently re-examined this issue and found that flipflop is the rate-limiting step for transport of oleate across small (SUV), large (LUV), and giant (GUV) unilamellar vesicles and that dissociation is 5-10-fold faster than flip-flop (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous conclusions (7Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Thomas R.M. Baici A. Werder M. Schulthess G. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that flip-flop was rapid and that dissociation was rate-limiting were based on incorrect interpretations of the results, primarily measurements of oleate influx into vesicles using oleate that was not complexed with serum albumin. We demonstrated previously that such measurements provide information about vesicle binding rather than flip-flop because the lipid bilayer is perturbed by exposure to high concentrations of unbound oleate when using uncomplexed oleate (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, accurate information about flip-flop can be obtained by measuring influx using oleate complexed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and/or measuring oleate efflux and dissociation from the vesicles (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The studies of Cupp et al. (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) revealed that flip-flop represents a major barrier to transport of oleate across the lipid bilayer and that this barrier increases with increasing vesicle diameter from SUV (∼250 Å) to LUV and GUV (>1000 Å). Thus, the lipid phase barrier to FFA flip-flop, at least in certain cell membranes, might be large enough so that the cell's FFA metabolic requirements would necessitate a membrane protein transporter. In fact, we found a highly refractory lipid phase in our recent studies of FFA transport in adipocytes, where FFA transport was best described as mediated by an ATP-dependent transport pump (14Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35775-35780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Kleinfeld A.M. Kampf J.P. Lechene C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). How the lipid phase can generate such large barriers is not known. The expectation of rapid flip-flop is based on the notion that flip-flop occurs by “Stokesian” diffusion through the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayer, a process equivalent to diffusion through an isotropic organic fluid. An isotropic solvent model is unlikely to provide an accurate representation of FFA flip-flop because of the anisotropic nature of the bilayer and the requirement for reorientation of the FFA within the bilayer. Moreover, diffusion of a solute through an isotropic solvent exhibits a relatively weak dependence (V-⅓) on solute size, whereas studies of non-electrolyte solute permeation through lipid and red cell membranes reveal exponential dependences on solute size (16Lieb W.R. Stein W.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Lieb and Stein (16Lieb W.R. Stein W.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have proposed that this steep size dependence reflects the polymer-like characteristics of the bilayer, in which diffusion proceeds by a “non-Stokesian” mechanism. In addition, the temperature dependence of diffusion through a Stokesian fluid should also be smaller than the dependence through a polymer (18Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2658-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, if the polymer-like nature of the bilayer affects FFA flip-flop, both the FFA size and temperature dependence of transport should be significantly different from those expected for a simple organic fluid. A systematic investigation of the FFA size and temperature dependence of transport across lipid vesicles in which the flipflop and dissociation steps were resolved has not been carried out previously. Previous results with selected FFA and temperatures need to be reconsidered because influx measurements were performed with uncomplexed FFA and because dissociation was not accurately separated from flip-flop (5Daniels C. Noy N. Zakim D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3286-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16055-16060Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To develop a better understanding of the molecular basis for the steps involved in FFA transport across lipid membranes, we have, in this study, measured the temperature dependence for transport of a series of saturated and monounsaturated FFA of increasing size. Measurements were carried out in SUV, LUV, and GUV composed of egg phosphatidylcholine. The measurements allowed us to separate the FFA size and temperature dependence of the flip-flop and dissociation steps. The results indicate an exponential dependence of flip-flop and dissociation on FFA size. The barrier for flip-flop was dominated by large (15-20 kcal/mol) activation enthalpies and little or no entropy, whereas the barrier for dissociation was predominantly entropic. These results are inconsistent with a representation of the bilayer as a simple hydrocarbon fluid but suggest a more complex mechanism. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and l-α-dipalmitoyl-[choline,methyl-3H]phosphatidylcholine was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Sodium salts of the FFA were purchased from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN), and stock solutions were prepared in water containing 4 mm NaOH (pH 11) and 50 μm butylated hydroxytoluene. Pyranine (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Acrylodan-labeled rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (ADIFAB) was prepared as described (20Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is available from FFA Sciences LLC (San Diego, CA). Fatty acid-free BSA was purchased from Sigma. The buffer used in FFA transport experiments contained 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl at pH 7.4 (buffer A), and both the FFA·BSA complexes and the vesicles were prepared in this buffer. Vesicle Preparation—Vesicles were prepared as described recently (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SUV, which are ∼250 Å in diameter (21Huang C. Mason J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), were composed of egg phosphatidylcholine and sonicated in the presence of 0.5 or 2 mm pyranine in buffer A. LUV composed of egg phosphatidylcholine with 2 mm trapped pyranine or ADIFAB were prepared by extrusion and are ∼1000 Å in diameter (22Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). GUV were prepared by dialysis of octyl β-glucopyranoside-solubilized egg phosphatidylcholine in which either 400 μm ADIFAB or 20 mm pyranine was also present and have diameters ≥2000 Å (23Nozaki Y. Lasic D.D. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Science. 1982; 217: 366-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The last step for all three vesicle types was chromatography through Sephacryl S-1000 to separate free and trapped pyranine and/or ADIFAB. Vesicle phospholipid concentration was determined using the Elon method for total inorganic phosphate (24Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Vesicle concentrations used in the stopped-flow experiments were between 5 and 200 μm. All stopped-flow concentrations refer to values in the mixing chamber, not in the syringe. FFA·BSA Complexes and Buffering of Unbound FFA—Complexes of FFA and BSA were prepared so that unbound FFA were buffered at defined values (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Complexes of the unsaturated FFA were prepared by mixing aliquots of the sodium salt of the FFA from a 5 mm stock solution in water plus 4 mm NaOH at 37 °C with a 600 μm BSA solution in buffer A, also at 37 °C. For saturated FFA, the stock sodium salt solution was heated to between 55 and 70 °C, higher temperatures for longer chain FFA, before addition to the BSA solution at 37 °C. The concentration of free or unbound FFA was monitored several times during this titration using ADIFAB (25Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 87-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the final unbound FFA concentration ranged from 5 nm to 1.5 μm.A critical feature of the FFA·BSA complexes is that, at sufficiently high BSA concentrations, the unbound FFA concentration will not change upon addition of vesicles. The conditions for a well buffered system depend upon unbound FFA, BSA, and vesicle concentrations and are determined by ensuring equal concentrations of unbound FFA in the complex and complex plus vesicles through direct measurement with ADIFAB. For a well buffered system and sufficiently low unbound FFA concentrations, the influx time courses are well described by a single exponential. However, for a poorly buffered system, the influx time course reveals additional temporal components, both faster and slower than observed with the well buffered system. To measure FFA transfer between vesicles and BSA, SUV, LUV, and GUV were loaded with FFA by titrating a rapidly stirring solution of vesicles with aliquots of the sodium salt of the FFA. Titrating the vesicles with FFA was done by diluting a 50 mm sodium FFA solution in 4 mm NaOH (pH 11); raising the temperature to 37 °C; and distributing equal aliquots, waiting 2 min between aliquots, into a rapidly stirring solution. For efflux and transfer experiments, vesicle concentrations were between 25 and 100 μm, and the fraction of loaded FFA was between 10 and 20 mol %. Acceptor BSA was used at between 2 and 10 μm. Stopped-flow Fluorescence—The kinetics of FFA movement were monitored by stopped-flow mixing with temporal resolution of <2 ms. Stopped-flow fluorescence was performed using a KinTek instrument, which allows two emission wavelengths to be detected simultaneously and in which equal volumes of 0.1-ml reactants were mixed at flow rates of ≥6 ml/s as described previously (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All concentrations refer to the value in the mixing chamber. Tryptophan and pyranine fluorescence intensities were monitored by excitation at 290 and 445 nm, respectively, and observation of emission through 20-nm bandwidth filters at 343 or 505 nm, respectively. ADIFAB fluorescence was excited at 386 nm, and simultaneous emissions were measured at 432 and 505 nm. At least two separate preparations and >20 kinetic traces were generated for most experimental conditions. Analysis of FFA Kinetics—Three different time courses were measured: 1) influx measurements in which the time course of FFA movement from the BSA donor to the vesicles was monitored by the change in fluorescence intensity of pyranine and/or ADIFAB trapped within the vesicle, 2) efflux measurements in which the time course of FFA movement from the vesicles to BSA in the extra-vesicle aqueous phase was monitored by trapped pyranine and/or ADIFAB fluorescence, and 3) transfer measurements in which FFA movement from the vesicles to extra-vesicle BSA was monitored by the change in BSA tryptophan fluorescence. The kinetic traces were fitted with multi-exponential functions to determine empirical rate constants for influx (kin), efflux (kout), and vesicle-to-protein transfer (ktrns). For the transfer measurements, we observed two rates: the ktrns value is the faster (generally ∼5-10-fold) of the two rate constants. We analyzed the transfer time course either allowing both components to vary or fixing the slow component to equal kout. Both fits yielded virtually indistinguishable χ2 values and generally similar rate constants. We therefore used in most of our analyses ktrns obtained with the slow component fixed as kout. To determine the intrinsic rate constants for flip-flop (kff) and dissociation (koff) that govern the time courses and to better understand their dependence on kinetic parameters, we used the analysis and simulation facilities of the programs MLAB (Civilized Software, Silver Spring, MD) and MACSYMA as described (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This analysis accounts for the movement of FFA between BSA and vesicles and the movement of FFA across the bilayer as discussed by Cupp et al. (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Back-transfer from BSA to the vesicles could contribute to the transfer kinetics, and therefore, the ktrns values we report may be less than the koff values; however, in all cases, ktrns > kout. We did not detect any significant change in ktrns at 5-50 μm BSA for oleate (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in the selected cases examined in the present study (data not shown). We therefore conclude that, to a good approximation, kin and kout ≈ kff and ktrns ≈ koff. As discussed by Cupp et al. (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), under conditions in which the FFA·BSA complexes buffer the unbound FFA, so that the unbound FFA concentration is the same in the presence or absence of vesicles, the determination of the inward flip-flop rate constant from the measured kin values is virtually independent of the BSA-bound FFA dissociation rate constant (koff(BSA)). Our simulations (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of the transport time courses demonstrated that this lack of dependence on koff(BSA) results because, under buffered conditions, the fraction of BSA bound FFA that is transferred to the vesicles is small (typically <2%), and therefore, the time needed to transfer is <2% of the koff(BSA). Values for koff(BSA) were obtained from our measurements of the dissociation of palmitate (C16:0), stearate (C18:0), oleate, and linoleate (C18:2Δ9Δ12) at 22 and 37 °C (26Demant E.J.F. Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and indicate that, in addition to oleate, kin should also be virtually independent of koff(BSA) for these other FFA. Dissociation rate constants for the additional FFA used in the present study are not available, nor are values available for any of the FFA at all temperatures studied in this investigation. We have assumed, however, that because the unbound FFA was buffered for all FFA, binding and therefore kin are independent of koff(BSA) for all FFA investigated. Two features of our results provide experimental support for the accuracy of the flip-flop rates obtained from kin. First, for all FFA and temperatures, kin and kout are quite similar, given the caveats concerning kin discussed under “Results.” Second, for the same FFA·BSA complexes, the kin values for SUV are ∼10 times faster than for LUV or GUV. Because koff(BSA) is independent of the vesicle type and kin does not involve BSA-vesicle collisions (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the results indicate that kin is independent of koff(BSA), at least for LUV and GUV. Eyring Transition State Theory—The activation free energy (ΔG‡0), activation entropy (ΔS‡0), and activation enthalpy (ΔH‡0) were calculated using the Eyring rate theory as described previously (27Kleinfeld A.M. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2053-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This analysis assumes that the thermodynamic model provides a reliable representation of the formation of the transition state and that the activation enthalpies and entropies are temperature-independent. Free Volume Model—We have used the approach of Lieb and Stein (16Lieb W.R. Stein W.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to extract free volume parameters that capture the FFA size dependence of our results. At each temperature, we analyzed the FFA molecular species dependence by expressing the rate constants for transport as in Equation 1, k=koexp(−V/Vf)(Eq. 1) where Vf is the average free volume for a given vesicle and temperature and ko is a pre-exponential factor. The molecular volume V (Å 3The derivative of ln(k) with respect to temperature using Equation 1 yields V/V 2f(dVf/dT). In the Eyring model, the derivative of ln(k) equals 1/T + ΔH ‡0/R·T2, and therefore, ΔH ‡0 = R·T2(V/V 2f(dVf/dT)-1/T). Typical ΔH ‡0 values for efflux and influx calculated using the values of Fig. 6 ranged between 15 and 18 kcal/mol. ) was estimated as Mr·1027/(No·d·1000), in which Mr is the molecular weight of the FFA, No is Avogadro's number, and d is the density of neat FFA and was adjusted (d = 1.3) to yield volumes consistent with those of Xiang and Anderson (18Xiang T.X. Anderson B.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2658-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At each temperature, the values of kin and kout as a function of the molecular volume for the saturated and monounsaturated series of FFA were used to determine ko and Vf by leastsquares fitting with Equation 1. Because the ko values generally showed little or no temperature dependence, we then repeated the analysis with the pre-exponential factor fixed to the value averaged over temperature and vesicle type, and the Vf values from this analysis are reported here (see Fig. 6). Stopped-flow measurements were carried out to determine the three rate constants that define FFA transport across lipid vesicles: 1) transfer of FFA from BSA to the vesicle while monitoring trapped pyranine or ADIFAB (kin), 2) transfer of FFA from the vesicle to BSA while monitoring trapped pyranine or ADIFAB (kout), and 3) transfer of FFA from the vesicle to BSA while monitoring BSA tryptophan fluorescence (ktrns and kout). This approach was used in our previous study of oleate at 22 °C (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and has now been extended to determine rate constants for 13 FFA using SUV, LUV, and GUV at temperatures between 15 and 37 °C. A representative example of the measured time courses from which the three rate constants were determined (in this case, for the series of saturated FFA transported across LUV at 20 °C) is shown in Fig. 1. The results reveal a monotonic increase in all three rate constants with decreasing FFA chain length. These results also illustrate a feature common to all FFA studied and to the three types of lipid vesicles. The time course for the change in BSA tryptophan fluorescence resulting from transfer of FFA from the vesicles to BSA is composed of two components (ktrns and kout), and in all cases, ktrns > kout. This indicates that the rate constant for transfer from the vesicle surface to BSA (ktrns) is faster than kout, and therefore, as found previously for oleate (13Cupp D. Kampf J.P. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), flipflop is the rate-limiting step for FFA transport across lipid vesicles. The rate constants determined from the time courses in Fig. 1 as well as from the corresponding time courses for SUV and GUV at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 2 and Tables 1, 2 and 3. For all three vesicle types, the three rate constants decreased exponentially with increasing chain length. The rate constants for SUV were larger by ∼10-fold compared with those for LUV and GUV, whereas LUV and GUV revealed similar rate constants. The results emphasize that ktrns > kout and, in most cases, ktrns > kin for the saturated FFA and all three vesicle types. Therefore, for all saturated FFA, dissociation from the vesicles is faster than flip-flop (kin or kout).TABLE 1Rate constants for SUVFFA15 °C20 °C25 °C30 °C37 °Ckinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnss−1s−1s−1s−1s−1C14:0693114013347200225C15:0238654016727229871054110114159103C16:062933018652291145562372C17:00.70.5101.81.0143.92.1135.73.31811.36.419C18:00.11.50.30.21.40.70.43.41.70.62.73.40.83.1C19:00.10.040.20.060.40.140.80.251.50.46C16:148185678308013245133C17:113319235233572152926911429C18:131.4941.91182.414155.619329.329C19:10.60.361.10.762.11.193.31.8107.83.710C20:10.20.063.60.40.193.10.50.303.81.10.563.42.01.003.5C22:10.040.0090.050.0150.070.0290.150.060.260.12 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Rate constants for LUVFFA15 °C20 °C25 °C30 °C37 °Ckinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnss−1s−1s−1s−1s−1C14:0166.61061910.11503413.41484619.71208229.486C15:041.73862.73574.843136.9522711.458C16:00.90.49.31.40.610.72.41.07.63.61.56.16.82.68.8C17:00.30.070.40.122.30.70.23.51.30.43.22.80.8C18:00.040.020.540.050.040.570.080.070.500.220.140.540.21C16:154461145021118025201095246113C17:11.41.6172.12.4235.75.3388.37.9711810.552C18:10.60.451.40.71.80.843.51.77.5C19:10.050.041.10.060.092.00.270.161.10.480.261.10.900.523.0 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Rate constants for GUVFFA15 °C20 °C25 °C30 °C37 °Ckinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnskinkoutktrnss−1s−1s−1s−1s−1C14:01051610241439196442C15:0214273115229C16:00.70.71.20.61.61.33.226.34C17:00.150.131.70.280.181.60.40.264.90.70.422.71.60.712.6C18:00.030.020.90.050.040.60.090.061.10.180.140.70.450.330.8 Open table in a new tab A similar variation of rate constants was observed for the series of monounsaturated FFA in SUV and LUV, except that the rate constants were ∼10-fold larger for the monounsaturated FFA compared with the saturated FFA of the same chain length (Fig. 3 and Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, for the same chain length (18 carbons), the rate constants increased exponentially with double bond number, from zero for stearate to 2 for linoleate (data not shown). Notably, kout and, in most cases, kin for these unsaturated FFA were significantly slower than dissociation. Taken together with the similar behavior of saturated FFA, these results confirm that flip-flop is the rate-limiting step for all long chain FFA and vesicles investigated in this study. Transport rate constants were measured as a function of temperature and analyzed in terms of the Eyring theory to determine the activation free energies (ΔG‡0), enthalpies (ΔH‡0), and entropies (TΔS‡0) for the saturated FFA in the three vesicle types (Fig. 4). The ΔG‡0 increased linearly with chain length, consistent with a transport barrier that increases by ∼4 kcal/mol with chain length from 14 to 19 carbons. The barriers for the three rate constants were ∼1 kcal/mol larger in LUV and GUV compared with SUV; the larger vesicles revealed slower rate constants t"

https://openalex.org/W2038856161,"Trichomonas vaginalis is an early divergent eukaryote with many unusual biochemical features. It is an anaerobic protozoan parasite of humans that is thought to rely heavily on cysteine as a major redox buffer, because it lacks glutathione. We report here that for synthesis of cysteine from sulfide, T. vaginalis relies upon cysteine synthase. The enzyme (TvCS1) can use either O-acetylserine or O-phosphoserine as substrates. The K(m) values of the enzyme for sulfide are very low (0.02 mm), suggesting that the enzyme may be a means of ensuring that sulfide in the parasite is maintained at a low level. T. vaginalis appears to lack serine acetyltransferase, the source of O-acetylserine in many cells, but has a functional 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and an O-phosphoserine aminotransferase that together result in the production of O-phosphoserine, suggesting that this is the physiological substrate. TvCS1 can also use thiosulfate as substrate. Overall, TvCS1 has substrate specificities similar to those reported for cysteine synthases of Aeropyrum pernix and Escherichia coli, and this is reflected by sequence similarities around the active site. We suggest that these enzymes are classified together as type B cysteine synthases, and we hypothesize that the use of O-phosphoserine is a common characteristic of these cysteine synthases. The level of cysteine synthase in T. vaginalis is regulated according to need, such that parasites growing in an environment rich in cysteine have low activity, whereas exposure to propargylglycine results in elevated cysteine synthase activity. Humans lack cysteine synthase; therefore, this parasite enzyme could be an exploitable drug target."

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a potent Mnb/Dyrk1A inhibitor in vitro, apparently reduced the phosphorylation at Ser-293, whereas PD98059, a potent MAPK/ERK inhibitor, did not. High frequency stimulation of mouse hippocampal slices reduced the phosphorylation at Ser-293, albeit in the midst of MAPK/ERK activation. The endophilin binding in vitro was inhibited by phosphorylating Amph I with Mnb/Dyrk1A. However, phosphorylation at Ser-293 did not appear to alter cellular distribution patterns of the protein.

After exocytosis of neurotransmitters, rapid endocytosis for recycling synaptic vesicle constituents occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Many proteins associated with this endocytosis are phosphoproteins and undergo dephosphorylation-phosphorylation cycles during the exocytosis-endocytosis cycles of synaptic vesicles (1Slepnev V.I.

Mnb/Dyrk1A phosphorylates dynamin 1xa primarily at Ser-857 in the PRD, and phosphorylation at this site reduces its binding affinity to amphiphysin.

Here, we show that Amph I is also phosphorylatable by Mnb/Dyrk1A within the PRD in at least one major and two minor sites. The phosphorylation at the major site occurs in vivo, and the phosphorylated Amph I decreases endophilin binding.

To express green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, cDNAs encoding for full-length Amph I were ligated into pEGFP-C1 between BsrGI and XhoI sites. To express recombinant Amph I with an HA tag, vectors were made by replacing the DNA coding for GFP in pEGFP-C1 with a DNA coding for the HA peptide (MYPYDVPDYA) between the AgeI and BsrGI sites. Creation of site-directed mutations at various Mnb/Dyrk1A phosphorylation sites to either Ala or Asp was carried out by PCR mutagenesis. All vector constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Purification of Recombinant Amph I—Full-length human Amph I was expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21) as N-terminal GST fusion or C-terminal poly-His fusion proteins. With either tag, the proteins were recovered poorly from affinity resins. Therefore, we used conventional purification methods. The E. coli cell pellets from a 250-ml culture were suspended in 25 ml of sonication buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1%Triton X-100) and sonicated for 10 min on ice followed by stirring for 30 min. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant fractions were made to 33% saturation of ammonium sulfate and centrifuged for 10 min. The aqueous fractions were removed carefully, and the fluffy top layer and materials adhering to the tube walls were recovered. These fractions were suspended in 25 ml of buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), dialyzed overnight against the same buffer, and ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatants were then dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) for several hours, and aggregates were recovered by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were then suspended in a small volume of buffer A, dialyzed for at least 36-48 h against the same buffer, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fractions were used as Amph I preparations. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) were included throughout the steps. GST-PRD or PRD-poly-His was purified from E. coli by extracting the cell pellets with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1%Triton X-100, and 0.15 m NaCl followed by purification using either glutathione (GT) or nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resins. Protein concentrations were measured by the Lowry method using BSA as a standard. Phosphorylation of recombinant amphiphysin and its fragments in solution and in solid phase were performed as described previously (19Chen-Hwang M.C. Chen H.R. Elzinga M. Hwang Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17597-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Identification of Phosphorylation Sites—Purified PRD-poly-His was phosphorylated extensively by Mnb/Dyrk1A with [32P]ATP or cold ATP. After precipitation and washing 3 times with 5% trichloroacetic acid, the acid-insoluble fraction was rinsed 3 times with ether to remove trichloroacetic acid and was subjected to tryptic digestion in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C for 16 h. The digests were dried, resuspended twice in a small volume of water, re-dried, and extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for application to HPLC as described previously (24Murakami N. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All peaks from HPLC were collected, and the amount of radioactivity associated with each peak was measured after drying and reconstruction with 0.5 ml of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots of the radioactive fractions were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and to manual Edman degradation (24Murakami N. Chauhan V.P.S. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To identify the phosphopeptides, mass analyses of the peptide peaks were performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite, Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA). The matrix solution contains α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile. Nonionic detergent, n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, was included in the matrix solution to optimize the detection of large or less soluble peptides as described in Cohen and Chait (25Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).Monoclonal Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to the phosphorylated Ser-293 (4A2AF) was generated as follows. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 288-298 of Amph I with an additional cysteine at the C terminus (288PARPRSPSQTRC) (2 mg) was phosphorylated extensively by Mnb/Dyrk1A in a final volume of 0.5 ml with a total of 90 μg of Mnb/Dyrk1A. After reduction of the Cys residue by triethylphosphine (21Huang Y. Chen-Hwang M.C. Dolios G. Murakami N. Padovan J. Wang R. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10173-10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the peptide was conjugated to Super Carrier (Pierce), as instructed by the manufacturer, and used for immunization. mAbs were first screened against the peptide phosphorylated by Mnb/Dyrk1A and HPLC-purified. 4A2AF was selected by further screening against both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GST-PRD as well as GST full-length Amph I. mAb against Amph I (7C6) was raised against the PRD-poly-His. The clone was selected on the basis of its reactivity to recombinant PRD and full-length Amph I as well as native protein expressed in rat brains. Phosphorylation of amphiphysin by Mnb/Dyrk1A did not alter the reactivity of the protein to 7C6.Transfection of Mammalian Cells—Cells (5-10 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) grown overnight in a growth medium were incubated with the premixed LipofectAmine (either PLUS or 2000) with vector DNA (1-6 μg) complexes, as suggested by the manufacturer. The transfected cells were grown for an additional 24-48 h before use. For immunostaining, cells grown on coverslips were fixed by cold methanol (-20 °C) for 15 min, blocked with 5% FBS and 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h followed by Alexa Fluor-488- or -568-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Images were captured by a Nikon PCM2000 dual laser scanning confocal microscope.High Frequency Stimulation of Brain Slices—Mouse hippocampal slices were prepared from 3-5-month-old CD-1 mice (26El-Sherif Y. Tesoriero J. Hogan M.V. Wieraszko A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 72: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The slices were first maintained at low frequency stimulation (0.03 Hz) to establish stable potential and then stimulated at 100 Hz pulse for 1 s three times for every 10 s as described in El-Sherif et al. (26El-Sherif Y. Tesoriero J. Hogan M.V. Wieraszko A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 72: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The control and stimulated slices were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at -70 °C until use for immunoblotting.Immunoblotting—Brain slices or harvested cells were homogenized or sonicated in 50-100 μl of lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm levamisole, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm sodium vanadate, and various protease inhibitors). After micro centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant fractions were recovered. The protein concentrations for each sample were measured by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed using either the Tris-glycine (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) or Tris-Tricine (28Chagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 367-379Google Scholar) buffer system. The proteins transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore; Bedford, MA) were blocked with 5% BSA or nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies. The membranes were then processed for color development or chemiluminescence detection (Phototope-Star reagent, New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) after incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies.Cells—CHO and NIH3T3 wells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and penicillin G sodium, whereas SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 5% horse serum. PC-12 cells were grown over rat collagen-coated culture dishes in F-12K medium containing 12.5% horse serum and 2.5% FBS.RESULTSPhosphorylation of Full-length Human Amph I by Mnb/Dyrk1A—Amph I contains a sequence, 290RPRSP294, that matches the consensus Mnb/Dyrk1A phosphorylation site (RPXS/TP) (10Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.-G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) as well as the dynamin 1xa phosphorylation site (RPESP) (21Huang Y. Chen-Hwang M.C. Dolios G. Murakami N. Padovan J. Wang R. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10173-10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that human Amph I could be phosphorylated by Mnb/Dyrk1A. We first tested whether native Amph I in rat brain is phosphorylatable by the kinase in vitro. Phosphorylation of native Amph I by an unknown kinase(s) in synaptosomes (3Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or by cdc2/cdk5 (5Floyd S.R. Porro E.B. Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.-C. Tsai L.-H. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8104-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) slows electrophoretic mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE. Therefore, we tested the mobility changes of Amph I after incubating rat brain extract with Mg2+-ATP and with exogenous Mnb/Dyrk1A (Fig. 1). The addition of phosphatase inhibitors alone (lane 2) or the kinase without ATP (not shown) did not change the mobility of endogenous Amph I, whereas the addition of ATP and phosphatase inhibitors reduced the mobility (lane 3). The addition of both ATP and Mnb/Dyrk1A with (lane 4) or without (lane 5) phosphatase inhibitors caused a further shift of the mobility, whereas the addition of Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II caused no change (lane 6). These results suggest that Amph I is phosphorylatable by Mnb/Dyrk1A.We then tested whether Mnb/Dyrk1A could phosphorylate recombinant human Amph I purified from E. coli. As shown in Fig. 2A, phosphorylation levels of the protein increased in parallel to the increased amounts of Mnb/Dyrk1A and incubation time. Assuming the amphiphysin preparation to be 100% pure, in Fig. 2A a maximum of 0.5 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol of protein. Based on the apparent purity of the GST-Amph I seen in Fig. 2B, this stoichiometry was likely underestimated. Autoradiography of 32P-labeled Amph I showed that the majority of the radioactivity was associated with Amph I (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled Amph I preparations revealed that both Ser and Thr residues were phosphorylated with serine as the major residue (Fig. 2C). Regardless of its name “dual specificity kinase,” Mnb/Dyrk1A does not phosphorylate Amph I at Tyr. This result is consistent with the earlier findings that Mnb/Dyrk1A is a Ser/Thr kinase (9Kentrup H.

For this purpose we first expressed several deletion mutants of Amph I in E. coli that have GST and poly-His tags at the N- and C-termini, respectively (see Fig. 3A for summary) and used them as substrates for Mnb/Dyrk1A. The E. coli cell homogenates containing these constructs were subjected to a solid-phase kinase assay (19Chen-Hwang M.C. Chen H.R. Elzinga M. Hwang Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17597-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as well as immunoblotting using anti-poly His antibody. As seen in Fig. 3B, Mnb/Dyrk1A phosphorylated full-length, and all three of the C terminus deletion mutants, Amp-ΔSH3, -ΔC254, and -ΔC355, which contain the PRD. In contrast, the kinase did not phosphorylate the N terminus deletions Amp-ΔN321 and -Δ454 or the Amph I lacking the PRD (Amp-ΔPRD). This finding suggests that the kinase sites are located within the PRD.FIGURE 3Phosphorylation of human Amph I deletion mutants. A, structures of various deletion mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2089193589,"Faithful chromosome segregation is essential for maintaining the genomic integrity, which requires coordination among chromosomes, kinetochores, centrosomes and spindles during mitosis. Previously, we discovered a novel coiled-coil protein, highly expressed in cancer 1 (Hec1), which is indispensable for this process. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that Hec1 directly interacts with human ZW10 interacting protein (Zwint-1), a binding partner of Zeste White 10 (ZW10) that is required for chromosome motility and spindle checkpoint control. In mitotic cells, Hec1 transiently forms complexes with Zwint-1 and ZW10 in a temporal and spatial manner. Although the three proteins have variable cell cycle-dependent expression profiles, they can only be co-immunoprecipitated during M phase. Immunofluorescent study showed that Hec1 and Zwint-1 co-localize at kinetochores beginning at prophase and that ZW10 joins them later at prometaphase. Depletion of Hec1 impairs the recruitment of both Zwint-1 and ZW10 to kinetochores, while depletion of Zwint-1 abrogates the kinetochore localization of ZW10 but not Hec1. The results suggest that the localization of Hec1 at kinetochores is required for the sequential recruitment of Zwint-1 and ZW10. Disrupting this recruitment by inhibiting the expression of Hec1 or Zwint-1 causes chromosome missegregation, spindle checkpoint failure, and eventually cell death upon cytokinesis. Taken together, these results, at least in part, provide a molecular basis to explain how Hec1 plays a crucial role for spindle checkpoint control and faithful chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2007211768,"Ring chromosomes and/or giant marker chromosomes have been observed in a variety of human tumor types, but they are particularly common in a subgroup of mesenchymal tumors of low-grade or borderline malignancy. These rings and markers have been shown to contain amplified material predominantly from 12q13-15, but also sequences from other chromosomes. Such amplified sequences were mapped in detail by genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization in ring-containing tumor samples from soft tissue (n = 15) and bone (n = 6), using tiling resolution microarrays, encompassing 32 433 bacterial artificial chromosome clones. The DNA copy number profiles revealed multiple amplification targets, in many cases highly discontinuous, leading to delineation of large numbers of very small amplicons. A total number of 356 (median size: 0.64 Mb) amplicons were seen in the soft tissue tumors and 90 (median size: 1.19 Mb) in the bone tumors. Notably, more than 40% of all amplicons in both soft tissue and bone tumors were mapped to chromosome 12, and at least one of the previously reported recurrent amplifications in 12q13.3-14.1 and 12q15.1, including SAS and CDK4, and MDM2, respectively, were present in 85% of the soft tissue tumors and in all of the bone tumors. Although chromosome 12 was the only chromosome displaying recurrent amplification in the bone tumors, the soft tissue tumors frequently showed recurrent amplicons mapping to other chromosomes, that is, 1p32, 1q23-24, 3p11-12, 6q24-25 and 20q11-12. Of particular interest, amplicons containing genes involved in the c-jun NH2-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, that is, JUN in 1p32 and MAP3K7IP2 (TAB2) in 6q24-25, were found to be independently amplified in eight of 11 cases with 12q amplification, providing strong support for the notion that aberrant expression of this pathway is an important step in the dedifferentiation of liposarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2079864457,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is characterized by specific cytogenetic aberrations that are strong determinants of prognostic outcome and therapeutic response. Because the pathological outcome of AML patients with cytogenetic abnormalities differs considerably, we hypothesized that their proteome may also differ specifically in their expression pattern, protein interaction pathways and post-translational modifications (PTM). We performed this study using 42 AML patients diagnosed for various cytogenetic abnormalities based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MS) and MSMS tandem MS. We could identify significant differences in the proteome and PTM of peptides, later confirmed by other methods, between cytogenetic groups. The interactome analysis based on computational bioinformatics reveals major regulating networks: MAPK8 and MYC for complex aberrant karyotype, TP53 for t(8;21), TP53–MYC–PRKAC for 11q23 and JUN and MYC for Inv(16). Further, we analysed 42 MS spectra representative of hnRNPH1, calreticulin and hnRNPA2/B1 in a peak explorer, which reveals a cytogenetic-specific PTM of β-O-linked N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) of hnRNPH1 in AML patients with 11q23 translocation, an acetylation of calreticulin in t(8;21) translocation and methylation of hnRNPA2/B1 in patients with translocations of t(8;21) and inv(16). This report may lead to a new thinking about AML pathogenesis, as differences at PTM level could be used to distinguish different subtypes of AML."

They have a characteristic Venus flytrap-like structure (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) in their N-terminal extracellular domain, which constitutes the orthosteric site for binding of endogenous agonists (Fig. 1A). A crystal structure of homodimeric mGluR1 Venus flytrap-like domain in agonist-bound form verified this (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H.

Exogenous allosteric modulators bind to sites in the seven transmembranespanning domains of the receptors topographically distinct from the orthosteric sites (Fig. 1A). Allosteric modulators offer advantages over classic orthosteric ligands as therapeutic agents, including the potential for greater GPCR subtype selectivity and safety. A number of allosteric modulators have been identified targeting specifically the CaR, which plays a central role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis (4Nemeth E.F. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Steddon S.J. Cunningham J. Lancet. 2005; 365: 2237-2239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Positive allosteric modulators of the CaR, such as NPS R-568 (Fig. 1B), increase CaR activation, thereby decreasing secretion of parathyroid hormone, and thus may be useful in the treatment of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Cinacalcet is the first-inclass GPCR allosteric modulator approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration recently for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and for treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid cancer. Negative allosteric modulators of the CaR, such as NPS 2143 (Fig. 1B), decrease receptor activation, thereby stimulating endogenous parathyroid hormone secretion. This potentially offers a novel method for treatment of osteoporosis. NPS R-568, cinacalcet, NPS 2143, and several other allosteric modulators of the CaR are structurally related phenylalkylamines with a positively charged central amino group (Fig. 1B). We and others recently reported that the residue Glu837 in transmembrane helix 7 of the CaR is crucial for action of those phenylalkylamines tested (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A.

It is speculated that allosteric binding sites of these phenylalkylamines partially overlap and that a critical salt bridge might form between the negatively charged Glu837 and the positively charged central amine in these compounds.

In the present work, we synthesized and studied Compound 1 analogues and examined the effects of alanine substitutions at some key residues of the CaR, such as Glu767, Glu837, and Ile841, on allosteric modulation of the receptor by these compounds. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the hCaR—The full-length human CaR (hCaR) cDNA cloned in the pCR3.1 expression vector was described previously (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Parental hCaR cDNA in pCR3.1 vector was amplified using pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (sequences available on request) for 16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI for 1 h, the amplified DNA with incorporated nucleotide substitution was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH-5α strain). The sequence of mutant receptors was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI PRISM-373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Transient Transfection of Wild Type and Mutant Receptors in HEK-293 Cells—Transfections were performed using 12 μg of plasmid DNA for each transfection in a 75-cm2 flask of HEK-293 cells. DNA was diluted in serum-free DMEM (BioFluids nc., Rockville, MD) and mixed with diluted Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and then the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was further diluted in 6 ml of serum-free DMEM and was to 80% confluent HEK-293 cells plated in 75-cm2 flasks. After 5 h of incubation, 15 ml of complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioFluids Inc., Rockville, MD) was added. 24 h after transfection, transfected cells were split and cultured in complete DMEM. Phosphoinositide (PI) Hydrolysis Assay—PI hydrolysis assay has been described previously (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, transfected cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask were split and plated in two 12-well plates in complete DMEM medium containing 3.0 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cultured for another 24 h. Culture medium was replaced by 1× PI buffer (60 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.8 mm glucose, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm LiCl in 12.5 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.2) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After removal of PI buffer, cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with different concentrations of Ca2+ in 1× PI buffer with or without treatment of compounds. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of acid:methanol (1:1,000 v/v) per well. Total inositol phosphates were purified by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 columns, and radioactivity for each sample was counted with liquid scintillation counter. Graphs of concentration dependence for stimulation of PI hydrolysis by [Ca2+]o for each transfection were drawn by using GraphPad Prism version 2.0 software. Each value on a curve is the mean of duplicate determinations. Graphs shown in this study were representative ones from at least three independent experiments. Synthetic Chemistry—Compound 1 was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (9Arey B.J. Seethala R. Ma Z. Fura A. Morin J. Swartz J. Vyas V. Yang W. Dickson Jr., J.K. Feyen J.H. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of JKJ05, (S)-(-)-2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol (45 mg, 0.30 mmol) and potassium tert-butoxide (34 mg, 0.30 mmol) were added to a solution of the appropriately substituted 2-chloropyridine (88 mg, 0.20 mmol) (prepared in accordance with known literature methods (20Yang W. Wang Y. Corte J.R. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 3131-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) in toluene (2.5 ml), and the resulting mixture was stirred for 48 h at 90 °C. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Following the careful addition of H2O (10 ml), the resulting mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 ml). The combined organic fractions were dried (MgSO4) and filtered, and solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography (1:10 MeOH:EtOAc) to afford JKJ05 as a colorless solid; 100 mg, 90%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ 2.73 (dd, JHH = 13.5, 8.1 Hz, 1H), 2.93 (dd, JHH = 13.5, 5.7 Hz, 1H), 3.46-3.54 (m, 1H), 3.61 (q, JHH = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 3.819 (s, 3H), 3.824 (s, 6H), 3.87 (t, JHH = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 4.24 (dd, JHH = 10.8, 6.9 Hz, 1H), 4.42 (dd, JHH = 10.8, 4.2 Hz, 1H), 5.86 (t, JHH = 5.7 Hz, 1H), 6.74 (dd, JHH = 7.8, 1.2 Hz, 2H), 6.79 (d, JHH = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 6.85 (s, 2H), 6.96 (tt, JHH = 7.5, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 7.18-7.22 (m, 7H), 7.92 (d, JHH = 8.7 Hz, 1H); (time-of-flight mass spectrometry) m/z 558.2629 (M+H+) (calculated for C32H36N3O6+) 558.2604. For the synthesis of JKJ05-Ac, pyridine (11.0 μl, 0.14 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopurine (0.5 mg, 0.0045 mmol), and Ac2O (13.2 μl, 0.14 mmol) were added to a solution of JKJ-05 (25 mg, 0.045 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 ml) and stirred for a 1-h period. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography (1:1 EtOAc: hexanes) to afford JKJ05-Ac as a colorless solid; 20 mg, 74%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ 1.83 (s, 3H), 2.72-3.40 (m, 2H), 3.62 (q, JHH = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 3.807 (s, 3H), 3.814 (s, 6H), 3.88 (t, JHH = 5.4 Hz, 2H), 4.28-4.41 (m, 2H), 4.49-4.60 (m, 1H), 5.85 (t, JHH = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 6.05 (d, JHH = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 6.74 (dd, JHH = 8.7, 1.2 Hz, 2H), 6.81 (d, JHH = 8.7 Hz, 1H), 6.83 (s, 2H), 6.94 (tt, JHH = 7.5, 1.2 Hz, 1H), 7.18-7.29 (m, 7H), 7.96 (d, JHH = 8.7 Hz, 1H); (time-of-flight mass spectrometry) m/z 600.2700 (M+H+) (calculated for C34H38N3O7+) 600.2710. Negative Allosteric Modulation of the Wild Type and E837A Mutant CaR by Compound 1—Recently, a novel negative allosteric modulator, Compound 1, was identified, and this modulator bears little structural similarity with the phenylalkylamine class in that it lacks a central positively charged amino group (9Arey B.J. Seethala R. Ma Z. Fura A. Morin J. Swartz J. Vyas V. Yang W. Dickson Jr., J.K. Feyen J.H. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of this novel compound with NPS 2143 on the wild type (WT) and mutant CaRs, we measured PI hydrolysis as a function of extracellular Ca2+ concentration in HEK-293 cells transfected with WT and mutant CaR cDNAs with or without treatment of compounds. We and others reported earlier that mutant CaRs with E837A or I841A missense mutations were well expressed and functional (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Hu J. McLarnon S.J. Mora S. Jiang J. Thomas C. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18990-18997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that, similar to NPS 2143, Compound 1 decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ by the WT with an IC50 of 0.51 μm but did not reduce the Ca2+ sensitivity of the I841A mutant CaR. Interestingly, unlike NPS 2143, Compound 1 also right-shifted the response to Ca2+ by the E837A mutant CaR with an IC50 of 0.23 μm (Fig. 2, A and B, data for determination of IC50 not shown). These results indicate that residue Glu837, which is crucial for allosteric modulation by phenylalkylamines, is not crucial for allosteric modulation by Compound 1. This is consistent with the report that Compound 1 did not compete for receptor binding of a radiolabeled analogue of NPS 2143, suggesting that its unique allosteric site is distinct from those of phenylalkylamines (9Arey B.J. Seethala R. Ma Z. Fura A. Morin J. Swartz J. Vyas V. Yang W. Dickson Jr., J.K. Feyen J.H. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, residue Ile841 seems to be crucial for allosteric modulation by both Compound 1 and phenylalkylamines. JKJ05, an Analogue of Compound 1, Is Also a Negative Allosteric Modulator of the Wild Type CaR—To test whether modification of Compound 1 by isomerization to create a positively charged primary amino group alters its negative allosteric modulator action, we synthesized an analogue of Compound 1, JKJ05 (Fig. 1B). The synthetic preparation of JKJ05 involved the treatment of the previously described intermediate B with (S)-(-)-2-aminoe-3-phenyl-propanol in the presence of 1.5 equivalence of potassium tert-butoxide in toluene at 90 °C (Fig. 1C). This permitted the hydroxyl group to serve as the primary nucleophile rather than the amine. Our in vitro functional assay showed that JKJ05 is also a negative allosteric modulator for the WT CaR, albeit a less potent one than Compound 1 (Fig. 3A). We tested a range of concentrations of JKJ05 up to 100 μm in the PI hydrolysis assay at 4 mm [Ca2+]o and found that the effect of JKJ05 reached a maximum at 50 μm with an IC50 of 6.8 μm (Fig. 3C). Similar to Compound 1, JKJ05 exhibited a minimum inhibitory effect on the response to calcium by the I841A mutant CaR (Fig. 2B), indicating that allosteric modulation by all these compounds critically depends on residue Ile841. E837A Mutation in the CaR Converts JKJ 05 into a Positive Allosteric Modulator—We also tested the effects of JKJ05 on the E837A mutant CaR. Surprisingly, JKJ05 significantly increased sensitivity of the E837A mutant to Ca2+ with an EC50 of 2.5 μm (Fig. 3, B and C) rather than inhibiting response to Ca2+ by the receptor. E837A mutation abolished allosteric modulator action by phenylalkylamines tested, whereas this same mutation evidently does not eliminate binding of JKJ05 to the receptor, suggesting that JKJ05, similar to Compound 1, might not share a binding pocket with NPS 2143. On the other hand, different allosteric actions associated with Compound 1 and its analogue JKJ05 indicate distinct interactions between functional group(s) in JKJ05 and surrounding residues(s) in the CaR that did not occur with Compound 1. Positive Modulation of E837A Mutant CaR by JKJ05 Critically Depends on the Primary Amino Group in the Compound—To verify whether positive modulation of the E837A mutant CaR by compound JKJ05 requires the positively charged primary amine in the compound, we synthesized JKJ05-Ac, an acetylated derivative of JKJ05, via treatment with of acetic anhydride, pyridine, and a catalytic amount of dimethylaminopurine (Fig. 1, B and C). We found that JKJ05-Ac remained a weak negative modulator of the wild type CaR, comparable with JKJ05 (Fig. 3A). However, the augmentation of E837A mutant receptor sensitivity to Ca2+ by compound JKJ05 was abolished by acetylation of this compound (Fig. 3B). Thus, JKJ05-Ac could be considered as a “silent” allosteric modulator of the E837A mutant CaR, defined as not altering the response of an orthosteric ligand but binding to an allosteric site of the GPCR. Molecular Modeling of the CaR 7TM Domain and Docking of Compound 1 and JKJ05—In an effort to understand the mechanism of allosteric modulation exerted by Compound 1 and its analogues, we constructed a homology model of the CaR 7TM domain based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (10Edwards P.C. Edwards P.C. Li J. Burghammer M. McDowell J.H. Villa C. Hargrave P.A. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and performed docking experiments with these compounds (see supplemental materials). No external bias was given on the precise location of the potential binding site. Instead, the docking region initially was loosely defined as the whole upper half of the helical bundle. Compound 1 and related analogues could potentially bind to two adjacent pockets (Fig. 4), which here we designate as P1 (enclosed within TM3, TM4, TM5, TM6, and the second extracellular loop (EL2)) and P2 (enclosed within TM1, TM2, TM3, TM6, TM7, and EL2) (Fig. 4). It has been proposed that NPS 2143 and related phenylalkylamines bind to the P2 pocket, with their positively charged amino group engaged in an electrostatic interaction with the side chain of Glu837 (7.39) (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Hu J. McLarnon S.J. Mora S. Jiang J. Thomas C. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Petrel C. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18990-18997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As Compound 1 did not compete with a NPS 2143 analogue for binding to the receptor (9Arey B.J. Seethala R. Ma Z. Fura A. Morin J. Swartz J. Vyas V. Yang W. Dickson Jr., J.K. Feyen J.H. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we speculate that Compound 1 and its analogues JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac bind to the P1 pocket. Our result that the E837A mutation in the P2 pocket blocked negative modulation by NPS 2143 but not by Compound 1 is consistent with our above modeling hypothesis. Our model suggests that the striking positive modulation of the E837A mutant CaR by JKJ05 might result from the combined effects of three distinct factors (Fig. 5): 1) the alanine substitution of residue Glu837 (7.39), which altered the ground state interactions of this residue; 2) the formation of a salt bridge between the positively charged primary amino group of JKJ05 and the acidic residue Glu767 residing in EL2; and 3) the van der Waals interactions of the benzyl moiety adjacent to the amino group of JKJ05 with a critical cluster of hydrophobic amino acids located in the upper half of TM6 (Fig. 5). This TM6 region, Trp818 (6.48)-Tyr825 (6.55), is part of a “hot spot” of the CaR we found recently to be critical for receptor activation (7Hu J. McLarnon S.J. Mora S. Jiang J. Thomas C. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Six out of the 8 residues in this region are potential sites for activating mutations (7Hu J. McLarnon S.J. Mora S. Jiang J. Thomas C. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among them, residue Phe821 (6.51), Ile822 (6.52), and Tyr825 (6.55) reside in the binding pocket for JKJ05 and analogues in our model (Fig. 5). Although alanine substitution of Trp818 (6.48) did not activate the CaR, aromatic residues at position 6.48 have been shown to play a key role in the activation of many other GPCRs, including rhodopsin (11Ruprecht J.J. Mielke T. Vogel R. Villa C. Schertler G.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Costanzi S. Joshi B.V. Maddileti S. Mamedova L. Gonzalez-Moa M.J. Marquez V.E. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 8108-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our model also suggests that besides these residues in TM6, adjacent residues in other TMs, such as Phe688 (3.36), might contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic cluster critical for the action of JKJ05 (Fig. 5). The fact that JKJ05 is able to left-shift the sensitivity of the receptor to Ca2+ only when Glu837 (7.39) is mutated to alanine suggests that the ground state interactions of this residue are sufficient to counteract the activating properties of JKJ05. Both JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac Are Positive Allosteric Modulators of E767A/E837A Double Mutant CaR—To test our model and the hypothesized interaction between the primary amino group of JKJ05 and residue Glu767 (exo-loop 2), we constructed an E767A/E837A double mutant CaR and compared the effects of Compound 1, JKJ05, and JKJ05-Ac on this mutant. We reasoned that upon disruption of the ground state interactions of both residue Glu837 (again by alanine substitution) and Glu767 (this time by alanine substitution to prevent an electrostatic interaction with the charged amino group of JKJ05), a certain van der Waals interaction between compound JKJ05 (and even JKJ05-Ac) and the critical hydrophobic cluster could activate the receptor. Our in vitro assay shows that the function of this double mutant was impaired as seen in a decreased maximal response to extracellular calcium. However, consistent with our hypothesis, both JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac, which interact with the critical hydrophobic cluster in a similar way, dramatically increased the calcium response of the receptor (Fig. 6). Conversely, Compound 1 interacted with the hydrophobic cluster in a different way (Fig. 5), due to its different chemical structure, leading to the slightly right-shifted calcium response of the receptor. These results support our model of the CaR 7TM and speculations on the mechanism of action of JKJ05. GPCRs are the most common targets of drug action. Family 3 of the GPCR superfamily has recently become a focus for the discovery of new allosteric modulators with therapeutic potential. Allosteric modulators offer advantages over classic orthosteric ligands as therapeutic agents, including the potential for greater GPCR subtype selectivity and safety. Novel allosteric modulators of the CaR are being vigorously explored in an effort to identify potential drugs for treatment of disorders of calcium metabolism. In addition to their therapeutic potential, allosteric modulators of the CaR offer unique insights into the mechanisms of receptor activation. How the signal of conformational changes in orthosteric sites upon ligand binding is transmitted to the 7TM, leading to receptor activation, is a major unanswered question. It is speculated that movements of the helices within 7TM and/or between two 7TMs in dimeric CaRs are ultimately responsible for receptor activation and G protein-coupling. Allosteric modulators bound to the allosteric sites in the 7TM domain of the CaR likely facilitate (positive modulators) or impede (negative modulators) these movements. We published earlier that residue Glu837 in TM7 is crucial for positive allosteric modulation by NPS R-568 (6Hu J. Reyes-Cruz G. Chen W. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46622-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and later, it was reported that this same residue is also crucial for allosteric modulation by other phenylalkylamines (8Petrel C. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18990-18997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is speculated that a critical salt bridge is formed between the positively charged central group of these phenylalkylamines and the acidic side chain of residue Glu837. Here we report that Compound 1, a novel negative allosteric modulator of the CaR lacking a central amino group, retains activity against the E837A mutant. This, together with earlier competition assay data, suggests that Compound 1 binds to an allosteric site distinct from those of phenylalkylamines. We also found that JKJ05, an analogue of Compound 1, acts as a negative allosteric modulator on the wild type receptor, but surprisingly, as a positive modulator on the E837A mutant receptor. This positive modulation critically depends on the primary amine in JKJ05. These findings led us to speculate a novel mechanism of allosteric modulation by JKJ05 and its acetylation derivative JKJ05-Ac based on modeling of the CaR 7TM domain and docking of these compounds. Current models for the 7TM domain of family 3 GPCRs including that of mGluR1 (13Malherbe P. Kratochwil N. Knoflach F. Zenner M.T. Kew J.N. Kratzeisen C. Maerki H.P. Adam G. Mutel V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8340-8347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the CaR (8Petrel C. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18990-18997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) are based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (14Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar). 11-cis-Retinal is covalently bound to Lys296 (7.43) in rhodopsin TM7 and is bracketed by residues in TM3 and TM6. 11-cis-Retinal and a series of helix-helix contacts involving primarily TM1-4 keep the 7TM domain in an inactive conformation. How photonmediated retinal isomerization promotes the active rhodopsin conformation has not been clearly defined, but a recent NMR study suggests that “rigid body” motion of TM6 is a key element in the activation mechanism (15Patel A.B. Crocker E. Eilers M. Hirshfeld A. Sheves M. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10048-10053Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the sequence homology between the 7TM domain of rhodopsin and family 3 GPCRs is limited, some preliminary data suggest that they might share similarities in protein folding and ligand binding pockets. We reported recently that residue Pro823 (6.53) in TM6 of the CaR, which is highly conserved in family 3 GPCRs but is in a slightly different location (6.53 rather than 6.50) than the proline in TM6 that is highly conserved in family 1 GPCRs, plays a key role in receptor activation (7Hu J. McLarnon S.J. Mora S. Jiang J. Thomas C. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We also reported that some other residues in the TM6 of the CaR, such as Phe821 (6.51), Ile822 (6.52), and Tyr825 (6.55), when mutated to alanine, increased CaR activation. Interestingly, JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac on the one hand and Compound 1 on the other hand show two distinct modes of interaction with these residues in our model, leading us to speculate that positive modulation of the E837A mutant CaR by JKJ05 and positive modulation of the E767A/E837A double mutant by JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac might be due to enhanced TM6 rotation by these compounds interacting with the TM6 hot spot comprising residues Trp818-Tyr825. Our model offers an interpretation of our findings, and at this stage, we cannot exclude other possible mechanisms. Further studies are necessary to understand why positive modulation of the CaR by JKJ05 and JKJ05-Ac critically depends on alteration of the ground state interactions of Glu767 and Glu837 by either alanine substitution or a salt bridge formation. Moreover, residue Ile841 seems to be crucial for action of all allosteric modulators of the CaR tested so far, including previously published phenylalkylamines and Compound 1 and its analogues. The exact role this residue plays in receptor activation remains to be elucidated. We emphasize that a single missense mutation, E837A, converts a negative allosteric modulator (JKJ05) of the CaR into a positive modulator. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an allosteric modulator whose action, negative versus positive modulation, critically depends on a single residue in a GPCR. There have been reports that mutations in the orthosteric site of GPCRs converted antagonists to agonists (16Bessis A.S. Rondard P. Gaven F. Brabet I. Triballeau N. Prezeau L. Acher F. Pin J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11097-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Ott T.R. Troskie B.E. Roeske R.W. Illing N. Flanagan C.A. Millar R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now show that such a phenomenon can also happen at the allosteric binding site of the CaR, suggesting the need for caution in therapeutic application of allosteric modulator-based agents and the need for identification of possible genetic variation in the allosteric site of therapeutically targeted GPCRs. Genetic variants of many GPCRs have been reported (see Ref. 18Tang C.M. Insel P.A. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2005; 9: 1247-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar for a review), and the CaR genetic locus appears to harbor one of the largest numbers (∼100) of variants with over 20 variations identified in the 7TM domain alone (19Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 143: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Incorporation of studies of genetic variants into strategies for GPCR drug discovery and clinical drug testing has an important potential to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity of drugs (18Tang C.M.

Given the risk of “paradoxical” effects if the receptor targeted carries an unsuspected missense mutation in the 7TM, further delineation of residues comprising allosteric binding sites, elucidation of allosteric modulation mechanism, and appreciation of potential sequence variation in the 7TM of the receptor among populations to be treated appear warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2045880612,"ERK5 is a recently characterized MAPK, which is most similar to the well studied ERK1/2 subfamily but uses distinct mechanisms to elicit responses. To understand the specificity of signaling through ERK5 versus ERK1/2, we examined global gene expression changes in response to each pathway. Microarray measurements in retinal pigment epithelial cells revealed 36 genes regulated by ERK5, all which were novel targets for this pathway. 39 genes were regulated by ERK1/2, which included 11 known genes. Of these genes, 19 were regulated by both pathways. Inspection of the 17 genes uniquely regulated by ERK5 revealed that 14 genes (82%) were previously associated with hypoxia via regulation by HIF-1. In contrast, 16 genes (84%) regulated by either ERK5 or ERK1/2 were implicated in hypoxia, most through mechanisms independent of HIF-1. Of the 20 genes regulated by ERK1/2, only 9 were implicated in hypoxia and were not well characterized hypoxia targets. Thus, unlike ERK5, a mechanistic link between ERK1/2 and HIF-1/HRE could not be established on the basis of gene regulation. Activation of both pathways enhanced transcription from a hypoxia-response element and increased HIF-1α protein expression. In contrast, ERK5 but not ERK1/2 elevated transcription through GAL4-HIF-1. Most interestingly, ERK5 is not significantly activated by hypoxia in retinal pigment epithelial cells, indicating that ERK5 regulation of these genes is relevant in normoxia rather than hypoxia. Thus, ERK5 and ERK1/2 differ in their mechanisms of gene regulation, and indicate that ERK5 may control hypoxia-responsive genes by a mechanism independent of HIF-1α expression control.

Well characterized mammalian MAP kinases include extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways, which are regulated by three-tiered kinase cascades involving MKK kinase → MKK→ MAPK (1Chen Z.

Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 pathway is stimulated in response to growth factors and mitogens via sequential activation of p21 Ras, Raf-1, and MKK1/2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 promotes its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequent regulation of gene expression by phosphorylation and activation of nuclear transcription factors. Known transcription factor substrates for ERK1/2 are numerous and include Elk-1/p62TCF, Ets-1, AP1, GATA, Myc, and NFκB. ERK1/2 signaling commonly regulates gene transcription through individual transcription factor binding sites, such as CREB, as well as composite elements (e.g. Ets-1/AP1 and SRF-Elk). Constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway has been shown to promote cellular transformation and genomic instability, and defects in this pathway have been shown to arrest growth and development.ERK5/BMK1 is a newer member of the MAP kinase family that shows greatest similarity to ERK1/2 among the various MAPKs (3Lee J.

ERK1/2 and ERK5 share 66% sequence identity in their kinase domains, as well as a Thr-Glu-Tyr motif in the activation lip containing sites for dual phosphorylation. Despite this similarity, ERK5 is selectively phosphorylated by MKK5 and is not recognized by the ERK1/2 activator, MKK1/2 (4Zhou G. Bao Z. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). ERK5 is also stimulated in response to cell stress as well as growth factors (6Abe J. Takahashi M.

Like ERK1/2, ERK5 recognizes phosphorylation sites containing Pro at positions -2 and +1 to the phosphorylation site. Substrates shared by ERK5 and ERK1/2 include CREB and Ets-1 (12Watson F. Heerssen H. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M. Segal R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 13Dwivedi P. Hii C. Ferrante A. Tan J. Der C. Omdahl J. Morris H.

Unique to ERK5 is a large C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (18Kasler H. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that physically interacts with MEF2C, further increasing transcriptional activity beyond that achieved by phosphorylation alone (15Yang C. Ornatsky O. McDermott J. Cruz T. Prody C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4771-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ERK5 C-terminal domain also functions as a site of serine phosphorylation whose subsequent interaction with 14-3-3 interferes with binding, phosphorylation, and activation of ERK5 by MKK5 (19Zheng Q. Yin G. Yan C. Cavet M. Berk B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8787-8791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions of ERK5 and ERK1/2 overlap in some aspects and show distinct features in others. ERK1/2 and ERK5 regulate similar processes within the cell, including chemotaxis, cytoskeletal organization, transcription, and proliferation (7Kato Y. Tapping R. Huang C. Watson M. Ulevitch R.

English J. White M. Cobb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms used by each pathway to elicit specific responses may be distinct and may involve differential localization, substrate preferences, or signal strength (12Watson F. Heerssen H. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M. Segal R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 13Dwivedi P. Hii C. Ferrante A. Tan J. Der C. Omdahl J. Morris H. May B. J.

For example, although CREB is a substrate for both ERK1/2 and ERK5, the cellular location of ERK5 activation dictates a preferential role for this pathway in mediating CREB-dependent neuronal survival (12Watson F. Heerssen H. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M. Segal R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). At this point, only a few gene products whose expression is controlled by ERK5 have been identified, and single readout studies examining transcriptional targets for ERK1/2 and ERK5 have shown little overlap. Selective functions of different ERK forms are also revealed in genetic studies, where mice lacking the ERK1 gene are viable but defective in thymocyte maturation (23Pages G. Guerin S. Grall D. Bonino F. Smith A. Anjuere F. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1999; 286: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and mice lacking ERK2 are embryonic lethal at day E11.5 because of defects in placental development (24Hatano M. Mori Y. Oh-hora M. Kosugi A. Fujikawa T. Nakai N. Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Hamaoka T. Ogata M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking ERK5 instead acquire cardiovascular defects, leading to lethality at E9.5-10.5 (25Regan C. Li W. Boucher D. Spatz S. Su M. Kuida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9248-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cardiovascular phenotype of ERK5-/- mice is strikingly similar to that of mice lacking either MEKK3 or MEF2C (26Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27Bi W. Drake C. Schwarz J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), supporting a physiological signaling mechanism involving ERK5, MEKK3, and MEF2C. It is clear that MEF2C is necessary for ERK5-mediated survival in cardiovascular cells (28Hayashi M. Kim S. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Abel E. Eliceiri B. Yang Y. Ulevitch R. Lee J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), although overexpression of MEF2C is only partially sufficient to rescue the ERK5-/- phenotype, suggesting that additional downstream targets of ERK5 are relevant but remain unidentified (28Hayashi M. Kim S. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Abel E. Eliceiri B. Yang Y. Ulevitch R. Lee J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).Details about the mechanisms used by ERK5 versus ERK1/2 pathways to elicit distinct responses remain incomplete. To examine this problem, we took an unbiased approach by studying global gene expression changes in cells, altered in response to each pathway. Groups of genes regulated in common by ERK1/2 and ERK5 as well as genes regulated uniquely by each pathway were examined for common mechanisms of promoter regulation or gene function. The results revealed a majority of targets unique to ERK5 that were also known to be induced in response to hypoxia. Further analysis confirmed that ERK5 induces transcription through an HRE, through mechanisms involving induction of HIF-1 protein expression and transactivation. Thus, ERK5 appears to control a majority of its transcriptional targets via a novel mechanism involving enhanced transcription through HIF-1/HRE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human retinal pigment epithelial cells immortalized with telomerase (hTERT-RPE1; Clontech Laboratories) were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F12 medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% Tet system approved fetal bovine serum (BD Biosciences), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 0.348% sodium bicarbonate (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged at P1 to P10 and transfected at 75-80% confluency.Plasmid Constructs—Vectors for mammalian expression of constitutively active rat MKK5-β (S222D, T226D, pCMV5MKK5β DDHA3), wild-type human ERK5-FLAG, and GAL4-MEF2C-luciferase were kindly provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Plasmids encoding constitutively active human MKK1-ΔN3/S218E/S222D (pMM9MKK1R4F-HA) and wild-type rat ERK2 (pCMV5ERK2) were described previously (29Mansour S. Candia J. Gloor K. Ahn N.

Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). pGAL-HIF-1α-(531-826) was kindly provided by Dr. Greg Semenza through The Johns Hopkins Special Collection of ATCC (MBA-9) (31Jiang B. Zheng J. Leung S. Roe R. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). pGLHif-luciferase containing three copies of the 3′-EPO-HRE was generously provided by Dr. Max Gassmann (the Institute of Veterinary Physiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) (32Wanner R. Spielmann P. Stroka D. Camenisch G. Camenisch I. Scheid A. Houck D. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Wenger R. Blood. 2000; 96: 1558-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other plasmids included pCDNA3.1HisB (Invitrogen) and pRLnull Renilla (Promega, Madison, WI). Human MKK5 MGC clone 14094 was purchased from Invitrogen. The open reading frame (ORF) of splice variant MKKα was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CACCATGCTGTGGCTAGCCCTTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGGCCCCTGCTGGCT-3′, and the splice variant MKK5β ORF was isolated using primers 5′-CACCATGGAACAGCAAGTAAATGGACAGTTAATAGAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGGCCCCTGCTGGCT-3′. The MKKα and -β ORFs were cloned into TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) to generate pCDNA3.2D/V5-MKK5α and -MKK5β. MKK5α and -β activating mutations (CA-MKK5) were generated by incorporating S311D and T315D or S222D and T226D mutations, respectively, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Colorado, Boulder DNA Sequencing Facility).Transient Transfections and Transcription Assays—RPE cells (2 × 104) were transfected with 1.8 μg of DNA in 12-well plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) at a FuGENE:DNA ratio of 6:2, according to the manufacturer's instructions. FuGENE-DNA complexes were incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min followed by dropwise addition to cells. RPE cells were harvested at 24 h post-transfection in passive lysis buffer (PLB) (Promega), and cell lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured using a MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (EG & G Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed in duplicate and assayed in duplicate. Where indicated, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) for 10 min to activate ERK1/2 and ERK5.Hypoxia Treatment—For time course experiments, RPE cells (8 × 105) were plated 16 h prior to incubation in a hypoxia chamber (3% O2). At the indicated times, cells were harvested in EB (described below). Whole cell extracts (50 μg for ERK5 blots and 100 μg for HIF-1α blots) were subjected to Western blot analysis as described below. For transcription assays, RPE cells were plated and transfected as above for luciferase assays and treated with hypoxia 5 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection in 1× PLB and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase as described above.Western Blot Analysis—RPE cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in extraction buffer (EB) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Whole cell extracts (30 μg) were separated on 7.7% low bisacrylamide (7.5: 0.2) SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies to ERK5 or ppERK5 (rabbit polyclonal, Sigma), ERK2 (rabbit polyclonal, C14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), HA.11 (mouse monoclonal, Covance, Princeton, NJ), FLAG tag (mouse monoclonal, Stratagene), ppERK1/2 (mouse monoclonal, Sigma), HIF-1α (mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories) in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween (TBST)) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Nuclear Extract Preparation—RPE cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 15 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6, as described above. Cells were serum-starved at the time of transfection and harvested at 24 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 10 μm U0126 (Promega) or Me2SO for 1 h prior to treatment with 100 μm CoCl2 at the time of transfection. Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce), which allow the stepwise separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts.Microarray Analysis—RPE cells (2 × 105) were transfected with MKK5DD-HA (2.4 μg of cDNA) and ERK5-FLAG (0.3 μg) or MKK1R4F-HA (1 μg) and ERK2 (0.3 μg), as described above, and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini-prep columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Microarray analyses were performed in triplicate using RNA from three separate transfections. First and second strand cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA, and fragmentation were carried out following standard protocols from the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual (105Affymetrix, Inc.GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. 2004; (Revision, 4, November 2004, Santa Clara, CA)Google Scholar). The samples were hybridized onto U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and processed at the University of Colorado Health Science Center, Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility (Denver, CO), following standard protocols. Data were corrected for background using MicroArray Suite 5.0 and normalized using robust multiarray average quantile normalization (RMAExpress, version 0.1) (33Bolstad B. Ra I. Astrand M. Speed T. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6325) Google Scholar). Differentially expressed genes were identified by two-class paired analyses using software for significance analysis of microarrays (SAM, Excel Add-in) (34Tusher V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9705) Google Scholar) and RankProducts (RP software) (35Breitling R. Armengaud P. Amtmann A. Herzyk P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). SAM Delta values were chosen, which produced false discovery rates for MKK5 and MKK1 of 19 and 16%, respectively, without fold change cutoffs. False discovery rate (FDR) cutoffs of 20% were chosen for expression analysis using RP software. Significant genes identified by SAM and RP were combined and further analyzed using the Spotfire DecisionSite Browser, version 8 (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Genes were chosen for further analysis when they were identified as significant (FDR ≤20%) by both SAM and RP, or when they showed FDR ≤5% with a low standard deviation across replicates by either SAM or RP. After passing these filters, a final filter was used which required ≥2-fold change in average intensity.Real Time PCR—RPE cells (2-3 × 106) were transfected with FuGENE 6 as described above, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy midi-prep columns (Qiagen). To avoid contamination by genomic DNA, on-column DNase digestion was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (6 μg) was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) using oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Each reverse transcriptase reaction was diluted 1:20, and 5 μl was used in a 20-μl real time PCR with 0.25 μm of each primer and 1-2 mm final MgCl2. Real time PCRs were carried out using LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics), containing Taq polymerase, SYBR Green dye, and nucleotides, and incorporation of SYBR Green into PCR products was detected using the LightCycler rapid thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics). A typical cycle included a 10-min hot start at 95 °C, 45 cycles with 10 s denaturation at 95 °C, 10 s annealing at 65 °C, and 8 s extension at 72 °C. Fluorescence was detected at the end of each 72 °C extension cycle. Melting curve analysis was carried out at the end of the run to confirm specificity of the PCR products for each primer set. PCR efficiency for each primer pair, calculation of cycle thresh-olds (CT), and relative quantification of PCR products were calculated with standard curves using LightCycler Analysis software, version 4.0 (Roche Diagnostics). PCR analysis was carried out in duplicate or triplicate where indicated. Primers used for SYBR Green PCR are shown in the supplemental Table 1.RESULTSCharacterization of MAP Kinase Signaling in RPE Cells—Microarray studies were undertaken using RPE cells immortalized with telomerase. These cells were chosen because they represent an immortal diploid human cell line that is not transformed, and they show functional signaling through MAP kinase pathways, where MKK1/2-ERK1/2 regulates proliferation, migration, and survival (36Hecquet C.

Thus, RPE cells represent an excellent system to study MAP kinase signaling under nontransformed conditions.To understand the specificity of MKK5/ERK5 versus MKK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling, experiments were carried out in which each pathway was activated individually and in combination. Co-transfection with constitutively active MKK5 (CA-MKK5) and wild-type ERK5 led to gel mobility retardation of ERK5 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) indicating ERK5 phosphorylation and pathway activation (8Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S. Gelfand E. Johnson G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Barros J. Marshall C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The slower migrating ERK5 band is immunoreactive with an anti-ppERK5 antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated forms of the Thr-218 and Tyr-220 required for ERK5 activation, confirming that the slower migrating form represents the phosphorylated and active form of ERK5 (data not shown). Co-transfection with constitutively active MKK1 (CA-MKK1) + wild-type ERK2 resulted in increased anti-ppERK1/2 reactivity, indicating ERK1/2 activation at expression levels comparable with endogenous levels (Fig. 1A, lane 3). A combinatorial experiment transfecting all four constructs together showed gel mobility retardation of ERK5 as well as elevated anti-ppERK1/2 reactivity, indicating that both pathways were activated (Fig. 1A, lane 4). In all experiments, the transfection efficiency of RPE cells as determined by fluorescence of co-transfected green fluorescent protein or immunostaining of HA-MKK1 or MKK5 approached 90% (data not shown). The degree of ERK5 and ERK1/2 activation in response to MKK5 and MKK1, respectively, was comparable or higher than that seen in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of nontransfected cells (Fig. 1B, lane 2). As reported previously, we show here that the cell-permeable MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, blocks ERK1/2 activation with IC50 below 0.3 μm (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas ERK5 phosphorylation and activation are blocked with IC50 values greater than 1 μm (Fig. 1, B and C).To confirm ERK5 signaling responsiveness in RPE cells, GAL4-MEF2C reporter assays were carried out. It has been established that ERK5 phosphorylates and activates GAL4-MEF2C and that MEF2 reporter assays are sensitive and reliable assays for ERK5 activation (8Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S. Gelfand E. Johnson G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Barros J. Marshall C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of MEF2C is specifically enhanced by ERK5 and p38 MAPK but not ERK1/2 (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V. Tapping R. Han J. Ulevitch R. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 41Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V. Kato Y. Gram H. diPadova F. Olson E. Ulevitch R. Han J.

In agreement, although transfection of ERK5 alone had no effect on GAL4-MEF2C luciferase induction, expression of CA-MKK5β activated GAL4-MEF2C by 1.8-fold, whereas co-transfection of CA-MKK5β + WT-ERK5 activated GAL4-MEF2C by 3.8-fold (Fig. 2). As expected, expression of CA-MKK1 with or without ERK2 had no significant effect on GAL4-MEF2C-dependent luciferase induction, although activation of a c-Fos serum"

Using bone marrow (BM) from gadd45a-/-, gadd45b-/- and wild-type (wt) mice, we investigated their role in stress responses of myeloid cells to acute stimulation with differentiating cytokines, myelotoxic agents and inflammatory substances. Bone marrow cells from gadd45a-/- and gadd45b-/- mice displayed compromised myeloid differentiation and higher apoptosis in vitro, following acute stimulation with a variety of differentiating cytokines. Intriguingly, gadd45a-/- and gadd45b-/- colony forming units granulocyte/macrophage progenitors displayed prolonged proliferation capacity compared to wt controls upon re-plating in methylcellulose supplemented with interleukin-3. The recovery of the BM myeloid compartment following 5-Fluorouracil-induced myelo-ablation was much slower in gadd45a-/- and gadd45b-/- mice compared to wt controls. Furthermore, the response of myeloid cells to inflammatory stress, inflicted via intraperitoneal administration of sodium caseinate was impaired in gadd45a-/- and gadd45b-/- mice compared to age-matched wt mice, as indicated by lower percentage of Gr-1-positive cells in the BM and lower number of myeloid cells in peritoneal exudates. Overall, these data indicate that both gadd45a and gadd45b play a role in modulating physiological stress responses of myeloid cells to acute stimulation with differentiating cytokines, myelo-ablation and inflammation. These findings should aid in understanding the response of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells to physiological and chemical stressors including anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2162031198,"In patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and type 2A multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2A), mutations of cysteine residues in the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase cause the formation of covalent receptor dimers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds between unpaired cysteines, followed by oncogenic activation of the RET kinase. The close proximity to the plasma membrane of the affected cysteine residues prompted us to investigate the possible role of the transmembrane (TM) domain of RET (RET-TM) in receptor–receptor interactions underlying dimer formation. Strong self-association of the RET-TM was observed in a biological membrane. Mutagenesis studies indicated the involvement of the evolutionary conserved residues Ser-649 and Ser-653 in RET-TM oligomerization. Unexpectedly, RET-TM interactions were also abrogated in the A639G/A641R double mutant, first identified in a sporadic case of MTC. In agreement with this, no transforming activity could be detected in full-length RET carrying the A639G and A641R mutations, which remained fully responsive to glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulation. When introduced in the context of C634R – a cysteine replacement that is prevalent in MEN2A cases – the A639G/A641R mutations significantly reduced dimer formation and transforming activity in this otherwise highly oncogenic RET variant. These data suggest that a strong propensity to self-association in the RET-TM underlies – and may be required for – dimer formation and oncogenic activation of juxtamembrane cysteine mutants of RET, and explains the close proximity to the plasma membrane of cysteine residues implicated in MEN2A and MTC syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2164999320,"Fer is a nuclear and cytoplasmic intracellular tyrosine kinase. Herein we show that Fer is required for cell-cycle progression in malignant cells. Decreasing the level of Fer using the RNA interference (RNAi) approach impeded the proliferation of prostate and breast carcinoma cells and led to their arrest at the G0/G1 phase. At the molecular level, knockdown of Fer resulted in the activation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), and this was reflected by profound hypo-phosphorylation of pRB on both cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and CDK2 phosphorylation sites. Dephosphorylation of pRB was not seen upon the direct targeting of either CDK4 or CDK2 expression, and was only partially achieved by the simultaneous depletion of these two kinases. Amino-acid sequence analysis revealed two protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding motifs in the kinase domain of Fer and the association of Fer with the pRB phosphatase PP1α was verified using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Downregulation of Fer potentiated the activation of PP1α and overexpression of Fer decreased the enzymatic activity of that phosphatase. Our findings portray Fer as a regulator of cell-cycle progression in malignant cells and as a potential target for cancer intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1975437597,"Many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by two pathological hallmarks: progressive loss of neurons and occurrence of inclusion bodies containing ubiquitinated proteins. Inflammation may be critical to neurodegeneration associated with ubiquitin-protein aggregates. We previously showed that prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), one of the endogenous products of inflammation, induces neuronal death and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins into distinct aggregates. We now report that temporal microarray analysis of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH revealed that PGJ2 triggered a “repair” response including increased expression of heat shock, protein folding, stress response, detoxification and cysteine metabolism genes. PGJ2 also decreased expression of cell growth/maintenance genes and increased expression of apoptotic genes. Over time pro-death responses prevailed over pro-survival responses, leading to cellular demise. Furthermore, PGJ2 increased the expression of proteasome and other ubiquitin-proteasome pathway genes. This increase failed to overcome PGJ2 inhibition of 26 S proteasome activity. Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, shown here to be the most active proteasomal form in SK-N-SH cells. We demonstrate that PGJ2 impairs 26 S proteasome assembly, which is an ATP-dependent process. PGJ2 perturbs mitochondrial function, which could be critical to the observed 26 S proteasome disassembly, suggesting a cross-talk between mitochondrial and proteasomal impairment. In conclusion neurotoxic products of inflammation, such as PGJ2, may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders associated with the aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins by impairing 26 S proteasome activity and inducing a chain of events that culminates in neuronal cell death. Temporal characterization of these events is relevant to understanding the underlying mechanisms and to identifying potential early biomarkers.

Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. J. Neuroinflammation. 2004; 1: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and is characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders (reviewed in Ref. 2McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1035: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Neuroinflammation is induced by a variety of insults, such as neurotoxins including trimethylin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and HIV glycoprotein gp-120 (3Viviani B. Bartesaghi S. Corsini E. Galli C.L. Marinovich M. Toxicol. Lett. 2004; 149: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the initial stage of the reaction, astrocytes, and/or microglia are activated to release pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β), free radicals (nitric oxide, superoxide, perhydroxyl), and/or anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-β1, cyclopentenone prostaglandins) (4Gao H.M. Liu B. Zhang W. Hong J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As a result, several intracellular pathways are affected in neurons as well as glia. For example, TNF-α leads to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and an intracellular increase in calcium (5MacEwan D.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), both TNF-α and IL-1β activate NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways (3Viviani B. Bartesaghi S. Corsini E. Galli C.L. Marinovich M. Toxicol. Lett. 2004; 149: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and free radicals induce inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress (6Djordjevic V.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 237: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, anti-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-β1 and cyclopentenone prostaglandins, induce apoptosis, and inhibit NF-κB (7Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Neuroinflammation may thus be a major contributor to neuronal damage observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has emerged as a major player in inflammation (reviewed in Ref. 8Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenases are bifunctional enzymes that catalyze cyclooxygenation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) followed by the hydroperoxidation of PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) with the generation of free radicals as by-products (9Kulkarni S.K. Jain N.K. Singh A. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 2000; 22: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Specific reductases, isomerases, and synthases then convert PGH2 to other prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (10Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar). The brain expresses cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 under normal physiological conditions, but COX-2 levels are dynamically regulated by pro-inflammatory signals and by physiological neuronal plasticity (11Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The cellular levels of COX-2 are dynamically regulated by pro-inflammatory mediators via transcriptional activation (12Wu K.K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 72: 89-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There seems to be a close correlation between COX-2 up-regulation and neurodegeneration. For instance, COX-2 is up-regulated in neurofibrillary tangle-containing and damaged neurons in the frontal cortex (13Pasinetti G.M. Aisen P.S. Neuroscience. 1998; 87: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and hippocampal pyramidal layer of AD patients (14Ho L. Pieroni C. Winger D. Purohit D.P. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. J Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and the spinal cord of ALS patients (15Yasojima K. Tourtellotte W.W. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurology. 2001; 57: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, increased cyclooxygenase activity indicated by a higher level of PGE2, was detected in the substantia nigra of PD patients (16Mattammal M.B. Strong R. Lakshmi V.M. Chung H.D. Stephenson A.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Teismann P. Tieu K. Choi D.K. Wu D.C. Naini A. Hunot S. Vila M. Jackson-Lewis V. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5473-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) is derived from PGD2, the principle cyclooxygenase product synthesized in the mammalian CNS. PGD2 is produced by PGD2 synthases, which are enzymes that carry out the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2 (18Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGD2 readily undergoes in vivo and in vitro non-enzymatic dehydration to generate PGJ2, which is further converted to Δ12-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) (19Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). J2 prostaglandins regulate gene expression through different transcriptional pathways. For example, 15d-PGJ2 seems to be an endogenous agonist for the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) (reviewed in Ref. 20Nosjean O. Boutin J.A. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). J2 prostaglandins also regulate gene expression through PPARγ-independent transcription, including activation of p38MAPK and JNK pathways (21Wilmer W.A. Dixon C. Lu L. Hilbelink T. Rovin B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Li Z. Jansen M. Ogburn K. Salvatierra L. Hunter L. Mathew S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 824-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway (23Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 24Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Unlike most other classes of eicosanoids, J2 prostaglandins are characterized by the presence of a cyclopentenone ring with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that are able to form Michael adducts with nucleophiles such as free sulfhydryls in cysteine residues of glutathione and cellular proteins (19Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). That J2 prostaglandins may play a role in neurodegeneration is supported by the finding that 15d-PGJ2 is elevated in spinal cord motor neurons of ALS patients (25Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Iwata M. Noguchi N. Uchida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7367-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, these prostaglandins induce apoptosis (26Giri S. Rattan R. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5196-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Mrak R.E. Landreth G.E. J.

Anticancer Drugs. 2004; 15: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the accumulation and aggregation of polyubiquitinated proteins in neuronal cells (29Li Z. Melandri F. Berdo I. Jansen M. Hunter L. Wright S. Valbrun D. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Their chemical properties in conjunction with their pro-oxidant and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway disrupting effects render these cyclopentenone prostaglandins extremely neurotoxic and capable of inducing neuronal cell death (reviewed in Ref. 30Musiek E.S. Milne G.L. McLaughlin B. Morrow J.D. Brain Pathol. 2005; 15: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated by temporal microarray analysis the gene expression profile of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells treated with PGJ2. We identified possible mechanisms by which PGJ2 leads to the accumulation and aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins and to neuronal cell death. Cells—Human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimal essential media (MEM) with Eagle's salts containing 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.4% MEM vitamins, 0.4% MEM nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% normal fetal bovine serum. These cells are derived from peripheral tissue (31Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Treatments—Cells were treated at 37 °C for different times with vehicle (0.5% Me2SO) or different concentrations of PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) in Me2SO. The drug was added dropwise directly into serum-containing medium with a gentle swirl of the culture plate. At the end of the indicated incubation times, the cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested as previously described (32Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cell washes removed unattached cells; hence subsequent assays were performed on adherent cells only. Temporal Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression—The CAG Human 19K arrays were printed at the Center for Applied Genomics (Newark, NJ). The arrays consist of 65-mer oligonucleotides (Human OligoLibrary, Compugen, San Jose, CA) representing 18,664 human genes and 197 controls spotted onto poly-l-lysine coated glass microscope slides. SK-N-SH cells were treated with 20 μm PGJ2 for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. Each time point was repeated two times. For each time point, total RNA from control and PGJ2-treated cells was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was evaluated for quantity and integrity by taking OD measurements at 260/280 nm and agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNAs were generated from 5 μg of total RNA per sample by reverse transcription (RT) for 2 h at42°C using the 3DNA Submicro™ Oligo Expression Array detection kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA) and Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For each microarray two consecutive hybridizations were performed with cDNAs and the fluorescent probes following the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, in the first hybridization reaction the solution containing the mixture of cDNAs obtained from control and treated cells was loaded onto the CAG Human 19K array and incubated overnight at 55 °C in a hybridization chamber (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA). In the second hybridization reaction Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) fluorescent probes were used to label the cDNAs from control and PGJ2-treated cells, respectively. The second hybridization was carried out for 3 h at 65 °C in the hybridization chambers. This cDNA co-hybridization provides a measure of the relative gene expression levels between the two cell populations. The arrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with laser intensities adjusted to bring the brightest spot just below saturation and the data extracted with the Axon GenePix Pro software. Analysis of Microarray Data—Analysis of the microarray data were performed using TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (MEV 3.1). The data were normalized globally so the median log ratios for each experiment were equal to zero. The data were filtered so that only non-flagged spots with a diameter above 70 and with a signal intensity of 2-fold above background in at least one channel were given a relative expression value: PGJ2-treated versus control. In addition, we filtered out the genes with more than 20% of their values missing across the experiments. A one class SAM analysis was performed with the MEV software comparing all the time points to the untreated cells to find genes with changes that occurred consistently in all time points. A median FDR of zero (delta = 2.11, Pi0Hat = 0.44) and an average change of at least 1.8-fold were considered our cut off for significance. A hierarchical clustering was then performed on samples and genes (Fig. 1). To identify biological themes within the gene list we used the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE, Ref. 33Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) algorithm from the MEV software (34Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M.

BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar) with the annotation of the Human OligoLibrary, Fisher exact test, p < 0.01). Data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under the accession number GSE4329. Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from control and PGJ2-treated cells as described above for the microarray analysis. 4 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed with the ReactionReady™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). The PCR primers to amplify the human cDNAs listed in Table 1 were purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, MD, proprietary sequence). Quantitative amplification of the human cDNAs was monitored with SYBR Green using real-time PCR. PCR amplification was carried out in 25 μl of ROX PCR Master Mix (SuperArray) containing 0.2 μm of each primer and 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction in a 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling conditions comprised of an initial step at 95 °C for 15 min for denaturation and for activation of the HotStart TaqDNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. The reaction ended with a 5-min incubation at 72 °C. Expression of the target genes in cells treated with PGJ2 was normalized to expression under control (0.5% Me2SO-treated) conditions by means of the comparative Ct (threshold cycle) method. The Ct is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to exceed the detection threshold. The values are given as the means of two independent determinations.TABLE 1Real time RT-PCR analysis of the expression of genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathwayGenesReal-time PCR (15 μm PGJ2)Real-time PCR (20 μm PGJ2)Microarray (20 μm PGJ2)fold-change20 S Proteasomeα2 (PSMA2)2.222.23NDaND, not determined.α3 (PSMA3)NDND2.67α5 (PSMA5)2.992.625.29α6 (PSMA6)NDND2.49β2 (PSMB2)2.622.34NDβ3 (PSMB3)1.431.71NDβ4 (PSMB4)1.991.78NDβ7 (PSMB7)2.232.415.7326 S ProteasomeATPase 5 (PSMC5)3.323.73NDNon-ATPase 1 (PSMD1)3.534.114.07Non-ATPase 3 (PSMD3)3.013.12.29Non-ATPase 6 (PSMD6)NDND3.34Non-ATPase 8 (PSMD8)1.661.83NDNon-ATPase 12 (PSMD8)NDND3.96Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeUBE2H2.428.78NDControlGAPDH1.1−1.051.28a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Western Blotting—Following the indicated treatments, cell extracts were prepared as described previously (32Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and 20 μg of protein/lane were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting for detection of the proteasome subunits with the respective antibodies (1:1,000) obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The mouse monoclonal anti-sequestosome antibody (1:500) was obtained from BD Transduction Lab (San Diego, CA). Antigens were visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit from Pierce. In-gel Proteasome Activity and Detection—Cells treated for 24 h with vehicle (Me2SO) or PGJ2 (15 μm and 20 μm) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular prostaglandins and were then harvested with the following buffer A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP (grade 1; Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Following homogenization the protein content of the cleared supernatants (determined with the Bradford assay, Bio-Rad) was adjusted to equal concentrations with buffer A. The cleared supernatants were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE using a modification of the method described in Ref. 35Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. We used a four gel layer consisting of equal amounts, from the bottom up, of 6, 5, 4, and 3% polyacrylamide with Rhinohide™ polyacrylamide strengthener (Molecular Probes). Bromphenol blue was added to the protein samples prior to loading. Non-denaturing minigels were run at 125 V for 2.5 h. The gels were then incubated on a rocker for 30 min at 37 °C with 15 ml of 0.4 mm Suc-LLVY-AMC in buffer B (buffer A modified to contain 1 mm ATP only). Proteasome bands were visualized upon exposure to UV light (360 nm) and were photographed with a NIKON Cool Pix 8700 camera with a 3-4219 fluorescent green filter (Peca Products, Inc.). Proteins on the native gels were transferred (110 mA) for 2 h onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blot analyses were then carried out sequentially for detection of the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes with anti-α4-subunit and anti-S8-subunit antibodies obtained from BIOMOL. The anti-α4 antibody reacts with a core particle subunit, therefore detects both the 26 S and 20 S proteasomes. The anti-S8 antibody reacts with a regulatory particle subunit thus only detecting 26 S proteasomes. Antigens were visualized by a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Effect of PGJ2 on Differential Gene Expression in Human Neuroblastoma SK-N-SH Cells—A total of 18,664 genes were evaluated over four time points, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after treatment with 20 μm PGJ2 (Fig. 1). Of these, 5,298 genes remained after filtering for missing data and/or low expression levels. We found that 389 genes expressed in the SK-N-SH cells showed statistical significance (SAM median FDR = 0) and at least a 1.8-fold increase or a 1.8-fold decrease in expression for four time points after acute treatment with 20 μm PGJ2. Up-regulation was dominant over down-regulation at all time points with 334 genes found to be up-regulated and 55 down-regulated. Biological Themes Enriched in Genes Differentially Expressed in Human Neuroblastoma SK-N-SH Cells after Treatment with PGJ2—We performed an EASE analysis on the 334 up- and 55 down-regulated genes differentially expressed after PGJ2-treatment. We found enrichment in 11 functional groups based on the oligonucleotide annotation from the Compugen Source data base (supplemental Table S1). Genes involved in heat shock response, protein folding, stress response, ubiquitin cycle, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, polyubiquitination, apoptosis, cysteine metabolism, and heavy metal response, were up-regulated more than would be expected using a random sampling. Categories corresponding to downregulated genes included cell growth/maintenance and transcription regulation. The percentage and number of genes significantly up- or down-regulated within each of the functional groups is shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that from all the biological themes analyzed, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, heat shock, protein folding, and apoptosis display the largest number of up-regulated genes. Transcription regulation exhibits the largest number of down-regulated genes. A longitudinal study provided a general idea of the levels of expression of the known genes with significantly altered expression over all time points against untreated controls (Fig. 3). PGJ2 treatment significantly induced changes in gene expression that lasted for at least 24 h. Expression of heat shock genes increased sharply by 8 h and then leveled off reaching a maximum of ∼10-fold by 24 h (Fig. 3A). Protein folding gene expression exhibited a modest flat increase throughout the 24-h period (Fig. 3A). Expression of genes involved in polyubiquitination, ubiquitin-dependent degradation, and ubiquitin cycle showed a steady increase from 4 to 24 h, never reaching a plateau (Fig. 3B). Polyubiquitination gene expression was the highest of the three latter functional groups reaching a maximum of ∼5.5-fold by 24 h. Changes in mRNA levels of apoptosis and stress response genes lagged behind, showing a modest and flat increase up to 16 h then steeply rising to a maximum of ∼4-fold by 24 h (Fig. 3C). Down-regulation of transcription regulation genes showed a steady decline throughout the 24-h period (Fig. 3E). The expression of cell growth/maintenance genes decreased steeply by 8 h, then leveling off up to 24 h. Based on these results, it seems that initially the cells try to overcome the deleterious effects of PGJ2 by up-regulating heat shock, protein folding, polyubiquitination, Ub-dependent degradation, and ubiquitin cycle genes. Pro-death responses, such as induction of apoptosis are triggered at a later post-treatment time point. Heat Shock, Protein Folding, and Stress Response—The expression of 14 heat shock genes was up-regulated for all time points (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 3). Notably, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP105 were among the 21 top genes that exhibited the greatest level of up-regulation in SK-N-SH cells treated for 24 h with 20 μm PGJ2. In particular, HSP 70 (HSP70B'/HSPA6) was the most highly expressed gene of all reaching a 69-fold increase in mRNA level upon treatment with 20 μm PGJ2 for 24 h. Expression of genes involved in protein folding (12 genes), including two genes with DnaJ domains, were consistently found to be up-regulated. Stress response genes (four) were steadily up-regulated up to 16 h and then exhibited a sharp increase by 24 h. These data strongly indicate the active involvement of a “repair” response in an attempt to rescue the cells from stress induced by PGJ2, which is a neurotoxic product of inflammation. Moreover, it is consistent with the established role of repair gene products which are sensitive to a large variety of stress-inducing agents. Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway (UPP)—A large number of genes (23 genes) involved in the UPP were affected by PGJ2 treatment (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 3). At least eight genes encoding for 26 S proteasome subunits, including subunits from the 20 S and 19 S particles, were significantly up-regulated over control conditions. Additional microarray data support a requirement for increased levels of ubiquitination and protein degradation by the UPP upon PGJ2 treatment. Accordingly, mRNA levels of the ubiquitin hydrolase UCH-L1 and of at least four ubiquitin ligases, including culin 7 and SMURF2, were significantly up-regulated in cells treated with PGJ2. Moreover, the mRNA levels of the Ub C gene were up-regulated by as much as 13-fold 24 h post PGJ2-treatment. Ub C, which encodes nine tandemly repeated ubiquitins, is one of the members of the human ubiquitin multigene family that is stress-inducible (36Wiborg O. Pedersen M.S. Wind A. Berglund L.E. Marcker K.A. Vuust J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mechanisms Involved in PGJ2 Cytotoxicity—J2 prostaglandins were shown to induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (25Kondo M. Shibata T. Kumagai T. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sasaki S. Iwata M. Noguchi N. Uchida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7367-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our studies established that at least nine genes associated with the induction of apoptosis were up-regulated by PGJ2, strongly supporting that J2 prostaglandins trigger a pro-apoptotic response in neuronal cells. Increased mRNA levels were observed in eight genes related to oxidative stress (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). One of these genes, heme oxygenase 1, was up-regulated 30-fold upon 4-h treatment with 20 μm PGJ2 (supplemental Table S2). Heme oxygenase 1 is thought to be a novel protective factor against inflammation and oxidative stress (reviewed in Ref. 3"
https://openalex.org/W2080011752,"Differentiation therapy is being developed as an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of several forms of cancer, including myeloid leukemia. In model systems, the physiologically active form of vitamin D, 1, α25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), induces monocytic differentiation of human myeloid cells, but the mechanism is not clear. We report here, the first direct connection between the signal provided by 1,25D and the molecular circuitry known to be involved in monocytic differentiation. Specifically, we show that 1,25D selectively increases the expression of the gene encoding kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR-1) in HL60 cells, while other differentiation-inducing agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide do not significantly increase KSR-1 expression. Further, the upregulation of KSR-1 gene by 1,25D is competed by ZK159222, an antagonist of vitamin D receptor (VDR) action, and can occur in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, showing that the effect is direct. Most importantly, we have identified a vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) in the promoter region of the human KSR-1 gene, to which VDR binds in a 1,25D-dependent manner, in vitro and in vivo. This binding is paralleled by increased association of RNA polymerase II with the transcription start site of KSR-1 gene, and the VDRE is functional in reporter assays. Our findings offer a potential mechanism for a signaling pathway that contributes to 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells."

As in all these viruses, the DNA translocation motor of bacteriophage SPP1 is composed of the portal protein (gp6) that provides a tunnel for DNA entry into the procapsid and of the viral ATPase (gp1-gp2 complex) that fuels DNA translocation. Here we studied the cross-talk between the components of the motor to control its ATP consumption and DNA encapsidation. We showed that gp6 embedded in the procapsid structure stimulated more than 10-fold the gp2 ATPase activity. This stimulation, which was significantly higher than the one conferred by isolated gp6, depended on the presence of gp1. Mutations in different regions of gp6 abolished or decreased the gp6-induced stimulation of the ATPase. This effect on gp2 activity was observed both in the presence and in the absence of DNA and showed a strict correlation with the efficiency of DNA packaging into procapsids containing the mutant portals. Our results demonstrated that the portal protein has an active control over the viral ATPase activity that correlates with the performance of the DNA packaging motor.

Our results demonstrated that the portal protein has an active control over the viral ATPase activity that correlates with the performance of the DNA packaging motor. The mechanism by which viral DNA is packaged into a preformed procapsid is a fascinating but still unsolved biological problem. Tailed phages and herpesviruses package DNA to densities as high as 500 mg/ml in the preformed procapsid structure (1Bazinet C. King J. Annu. Rev.

The DNA translocating machine that accomplishes this task is the most powerful biomolecular motor presently described (4Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C.

Cell. 2005; 122: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Like many other molecular motors, this machine converts the chemical energy generated by ATP hydrolysis into mechanical movement of DNA. Intensive research over the past years enabled the identification and characterization of the components of the DNA translocating motor in several bacteriophages, as well as in herpesviruses (reviewed in Ref. 6Catalano C.E. Catalano C.E. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanism. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Group, New York2005: 1-4Google Scholar). Despite some differences that may subsist between individual virus species, numerous biochemical and structural similarities have been found among the motor components, suggesting a common mechanism for DNA translocation. The motor is composed of an ATPase (terminase) and of the portal protein, a turbine-like oligomer localized at the unique vertex of the icosahedral capsid through which DNA movements occur (7Valpuesta J.M.

DNA is then translocated through the central tunnel of the oligomeric portal protein to be packed at high density inside the viral capsid. Translocation of the double helix is fueled by the terminase ATPase activity (12Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Morita M.

Packaging is normally terminated by an endonucleolytic cleavage of the concatemeric DNA used as substrate for encapsidation by most phages (3Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Previous work defined the components of the motor but elucidated neither how the DNA packaging motor assembles nor the role of the portal protein in DNA translocation. The Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPP1 is a well established model system for viruses that package their DNA into procapsids with a portal (16Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Group, New York2005: 1-4Google Scholar). The packaging reaction requires substrate DNA, ATP, the terminase gp1-gp2 complex, and procapsids with the portal protein gp6. The terminase small subunit gp1 provides specificity for binding to the pac sequence in the viral DNA concatemer (18Chai S. Bravo A. Luder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the large subunit gp2 has ATPase and endonuclease activities (20Gual A. Camacho A.C. Alonso J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23251-23259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). gp6, like portals from other phages, is a cyclical homo-oligomer (a 745-kDa 13-mer in solution and a 688-kDa 12-mer when incorporated in the phage structure) (22Lurz R. Orlova E.V. Gunther D. Dube P. Droge A. Weise F. van Heel M. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with a central tunnel for DNA translocation. The purified protein modulates the ATPase activity of the terminase (21Camacho A.C. Gual A. Lurz R. Tavares P. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23251-23259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At the end of genome encapsidation, gp6 is a central component of the sensor system that triggers headful cleavage of substrate DNA after a threshold amount of DNA is reached inside the capsid (8Orlova E.V.

Lencastre H.L. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions in gp6 can block the initiation of DNA packaging, its efficiency, or termination of the process that yields the ∼45.9-kbp long mature viral chromosome (24Isidro A. Santos M. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cross-talk between the SPP1 terminase and the portal protein. gp6 embedded in the procapsid structure caused a strong stimulation of the gp2 ATPase activity that depended on the presence of gp1. Mutations in different regions of the portal protein decreased or abolished this effect irrespective of the presence of DNA. Most interestingly, the capacity of procapsids carrying different gp6 forms to boost ATP hydrolysis by gp2 correlated with their efficiency to encapsidate DNA in vitro. Regulation of the viral ATPase activity by the portal protein in the assembled DNA translocation motor appeared essential for the mechanism of viral genome packaging.

Production and Purification of SPP1 Procapsids Carrying Different gp6 Forms—Wild type SPP1 procapsids were produced by infection of the YB886 B. subtilis strain with SPP1sus70, which has a nonsense mutation in gene 1 that codes for gp1, to an input multiplicity of 5. Procapsids carrying different forms of gp6 (gp6SizX or other gp6 mutants that affect DNA packaging in vivo) were produced by infection of the B. subtilis strains bearing the respective gene 6 alleles with SPP1sus70sus115. This phage has nonsense mutations in both genes 1 and 6. The gene 6 allele coded by the plasmid complements the phage deficiency in trans. Procapsids were purified on 10-30% glycerol gradients followed by an anionic exchange chromatography (16Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The molecular mass estimated for the procapsids was about 1.9 × 107 Da. The purity of the procapsid preparations and the amount of gp6 incorporated in the procapsid structures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting with an anti-gp6 antibody. Blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The quality of the different procapsid preparations was also checked by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. Protein Purification— gp6 was purified with some modifications to the method described previously (33Jekow P. Behlke J. Tichelaar W. Lurz R. Regalla M. Hinrichs W. Tavares P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the E. coli XL-1 overproducing strains bearing the gene 6 different alleles were concentrated in buffer G (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and lysed by passing through a French press, and the protein material was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (70% (w/v) saturation). The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) and dialyzed overnight against buffer A. The protein was purified by ionic exchange chromatography in a fast protein liquid chromatography system using a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. gp6 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography in a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). The pure protein was dialyzed against buffer A, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. gp1 and gp2 were purified as described previously (16Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. gp6, gp1, and gp2 concentrations were expressed as moles of protein 13-mers (35Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), decamers (19Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and monomers (20Gual A. Camacho A.C. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35311-35319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. ATPase Activity Measurement—The ATPase standard reactions were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2, in a final volume of 20 μl. Unless stated otherwise, the concentrations of ATP, gp2, gp1, and procapsids used were 1 mm and 200, 300, and 20 nm, respectively. The reactions were initiated by addition of the substrate after a preincubation of 5 min at 30 °C and were allowed to proceed for 15 min more at the same temperature. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of phosphate set free upon hydrolysis as described previously (36Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μlof 1.5 mm NaH2PO4 in 0.5 m H2SO4, 50 μl of molybdate reagent (200 mm Na2MoO4), and 500 μl of isobutyl alcohol. The mixture was shaken vigorously, and the phases were allowed to separate. After centrifugation for 5 min, radioactivity in the upper isobutyl alcohol layer and in the lower aqueous phase was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The ATPase-specific activity was determined by calculating the amount of Pi* produced per min and expressed in terms of μmol/min/mg gp2. DNA Packaging Analysis in Vivo—B. subtilis strains bearing plasmids coding for the different gene 6 alleles under analysis were infected with SPP1sus115 to an input multiplicity of 10. After 22 min the infected cells were lysed, treated with DNase, and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 3The abbreviation used is: PFGE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. as described (24Isidro A. Santos M. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PFGE gels were stained with ethidium bromide or with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes). DNA Packaging Reaction in Vitro—DNA packaging reactions were performed in vitro with purified terminase proteins and procapsids in a DNase protection assay (16Oliveira L. Alonso J.C. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, a standard 20-μl reaction mixture contained 1 mm ATP, 1 nm DNA, 10% dextran, 20 nm procapsids, and terminase proteins (200 nm gp2 and 300 nm gp1) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, if not stated otherwise. DNase was then added at 20 μg/ml and incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 50 mm EDTA and deproteinized. DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels and stained with Syber Gold (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA packaged was quantified by using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). DNA with known concentrations was loaded into the gel in parallel and was used as standard for quantification. The values used for quantification were within the linear range of the DNA calibration curve. In Vivo Characterization of gp6 DNA Packaging Mutants— Random mutagenesis of gene 6 combined with a screening strategy enabled the previous identification of gp6 mutants that affect SPP1 DNA packaging (24Isidro A. Santos M. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A subset of these mutants was selected according to phenotype (data not shown). Three major groups typified by the amino acid substitutions compiled in Table 1 could be identified. All the mutant gp6 forms tested are normally produced and incorporated into SPP1 procapsids (Table 1). B. subtilis cells producing the different gene 6 alleles linked to mutation sizX (25Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were infected with a phage defective in gp6 production (SPP1sus115), and DNA packaging in vivo was assessed by DNase protection assays followed by PFGE. The sizX mutation leads to packaging of SPP1 chromosomes with a size shorter than wild type but does not affect the efficiency of DNA encapsidation. Its linkage to gene 6 alleles is essential to distinguish between DNA packaged in vivo and background chromosomes with wild type size resulting from infecting phages used in complementation assays (25Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A first set of mutations (group I typified by gp6N290T and gp6E294K) blocked DNA packaging such that no protected DNA inside SPP1 capsids is detected after DNase digestion of extracts of infected cells (Table 1). Other gene 6 alleles were characterized by the protection of a small amount of packaged DNA appearing as a faint band in PFGE. They were classified as “low packaging efficiency” mutations. Within this second type of mutations we distinguish group II (gp6S279G and gp6T319A) characterized by undersizing of the packaged DNA molecule and group III (gp6E352G) whose DNA packaged molecules have the same size as observed for the sizX control allele (Table 1). An additional feature associated to mutation E352G (group III) is that in vivo studies suggested it causes a defect in DNA translocation (25Isidro A. Henriques A.O. Tavares P. Virology. 2004; 322: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These mutants are thus likely candidates to arrest or affect different reactions during the DNA packaging process.TABLE 1In vivo characterization of gp6 mutations that affect DNA packagingAmino acid substitutionaThe gp6 single amino acid substitutions are caused by missense mutations in gene 6 characterized in this workTiterbThe severity of the mutations was estimated in complementation assays by titration of SPP1sus115 phages (gp6−) in strains bearing plasmids coding for gene 6 mutant alleles and estimated as percentage of the titer (plaque-forming units/ml) obtained with the strain coding for SizX.

Catalano C.E. Viral Genome Packaging Machines: Genetics, Structure, and Mechanism. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Group, New York2005: 1-4Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis by the terminase energizes the reaction. In SPP1, the terminase large subunit gp2 displays a low ATPase activity that is stimulated by the small subunit gp1. Purified gp6 (Fig. 1A), a 13-mer protein outside the context of the procapsid structure, also stimulates the activity of gp2, and mixing of the three proteins has a synergistic effect in ATP hydrolysis (20Gual A. Camacho A.C. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35311-35319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Camacho A.C. Gual A. Lurz R. Tavares P. Alonso J.C. J. Biol.

We have thus investigated whether gp6 mutations that caused an absence of DNA packaging or a reduced packaging efficiency phenotype affected the stimulation of terminase (gp2 + gp1) ATPase activity. We first demonstrated that pure wild type gp6 and gp6SizX caused an identical stimulation of gp2 activity both in the presence and in the absence of gp1 (Fig. 2B). Because the mutant proteins characterized in this work carry the mutation sizX, we used gp6SizX as control in all subsequent experiments.FIGURE 2Concentration dependence for purified procapsids and purified gp6 in the stimulation of the terminase ATPase activity.

Cells can release CD46 in an intact form on membrane vesicles and in a truncated form by a metalloproteolytic cleavage. The mechanism of shedding and its relationship to cell physiology has remained unclear. We have found using RNA interference analysis that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 is responsible for the regulated shedding of the ectodomain of CD46 in apoptotic cells. The shedding of CD46 was initiated with staurosporine and UVB. Exposure of cell cultures to either UVB or staurosporine resulted in changes of cell morphology and detachment of cells from their matrices within 8-24 h. During this process CD46 was released both in apoptotic vesicles (vCD46) and proteolytically (sCD46) into the medium. Both the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and RNA interference of ADAM10 completely prevented the release of sCD46 and increased the expression of vCD46 on HaCaT cell vesicles, suggesting that ADAM10 releases sCD46 from the apoptotic vesicles. To explore whether the release of sCD46 is associated with apoptosis we analyzed the effects of caspase inhibitors. As expected, the inhibition of caspase activity attenuated the characteristic features of apoptosis and also decreased the release of sCD46. Our results reveal ADAM10 as an important regulator of CD46 expression during apoptosis. The ADAM10-mediated release of CD46 from apoptotic vesicles may represent a form of strategy to allow restricted complement activation to deal with modified self.

Almost ubiquitously expressed membrane cofactor protein CD46 is a complement regulator that protects cells and tissues from complement damage (1Seya T. Turner J.R. Atkinson J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 837-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). CD46 can also function as a receptor for several pathogens (2Lindahl G. Sjobring U. Johnsson E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of CD46 initiates signaling events in a number of cell types (3Karp C.L. Wysocka M. Wahl L.M. Ahearn J.M.

Recently it was found that CD46 can modulate immune responses by affecting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, CD4+ T cell proliferation, and the production of interleukin-2, -10, and transforming growth factor-β (7Marie J.C. Astier A.L. Rivailler P. Rabourdin-Combe C. Wild T.F. Horvat B. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD46 induces T-regulatory cell 1 phenotype (8Kemper C. Chan A.C. Green J.M. Brett K.A. Murphy K.M. Atkinson J.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Normally membrane-bound CD46 has been detected in a soluble form in the cerebrospinal fluids of multiple sclerosis patients with a human herpesvirus 6 infection, for which CD46 has been reported to be a receptor (9Soldan S.S.

The sera from both normal individuals and cancer patients contain three forms of CD46 with the molecular masses of 56, 47, and 29 kDa. The levels of the 56- and 42-kDa forms are increased in the sera of cancer patients (10Seya T. Hara T. Iwata K. Kuriyama S. Hasegawa T. Nagase Y. Miyagawa S. Matsumoto M. Hatanaka M. Atkinson J.P.

Elevated levels of CD46 have been observed in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (11Kawano M. Seya T. Koni I. Mabuchi H. Clin. Exp.

Rovida E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The shedding is stimulated in most experimental systems by the phorbol ester PMA (13Sbarba P.D. Rovida E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), sphingomyelinase P1, and detachment of cells from the pericellular matrix, but unexpectedly not PMA, enhance the proteolytic release of sCD46 (14Hakulinen J. Junnikkala S. Sorsa T. Meri S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2620-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Van Den Berg C. De Andrade R. Magnoli F. Marchbank K. Tambourgi D. Immunology. 2002; 107: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The biologically active constitutively secreted 55-60-kDa form sCD46 lacks the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence and is produced by constitutive proteolytic cleavage of the intact form on the tumor cell membranes (14Hakulinen J. Junnikkala S. Sorsa T. Meri S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2620-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the metalloproteinase responsible for the shedding has not been identified yet.ROS can activate latent proforms of metalloproteinases as well as induce apoptosis (16Saari H. Suomalainen K. Lindy O. Konttinen Y. Sorsa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

These findings, together with our earlier observations of reactive oxygen species and detachment of cells from the pericellular matrix enhancing the proteolytic release of sCD46, formed the basis for our hypotheses that sCD46 is released during apoptosis beyond the constitutive release. UVB is a potent inducer of ROS-generating oxidative stress and apoptosis in cells (18Ichihashi M. Ueda M. Budiyanto A. Bito T. Oka M. Fukunaga M. Tsuru K. Horikawa T. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the effects of UVB radiation and staurosporine-induced apoptosis on the metalloproteolytic shedding of sCD46.ADAMs are plasma membrane-bound proteases, some of which are associated with vesicular structures (19Gutwein P. Stoeck A. Riedle S. Gast D. Runz S. Condon T.P. Marme A. Phong M.C. Linderkamp O. Skorokhod A. Altevogt P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 2492-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ADAM10, 12, and 17 are activated in response to ROS (20Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5172-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calcium ionophores stimulate ADAM10-mediated ectodomain shedding (21Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. Strooper B.D. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the present work we have identified ADAM10 as the enzyme responsible for the solubilization of the ectodomain of CD46 (sCD46) during apoptosis. The identification of the sCD46-releasing protease opens new views for studies on pathological processes involving overactivation of complement that are related to deficiencies of CD46.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 was from Calbiochem. The pan-caspase inhibitor IV (Z-VAD-fmk) and staurosporine were obtained from Calbiochem. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was obtained from Sigma. The murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) J4.48 against human CD46 was purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Rabbit antibodies against ADAM10 and ADAM17 (TACE) were obtained from Abcam plc (Cambridge, UK). Peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins to rabbit or mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, the Netherlands). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V was from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human keratinocyte HaCaT (22Boukamp P. Petrussevska R. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar) and ovarian adenocarcinoma Caov-3 (23Buick R. Pullano R. Trent J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3668-3676PubMed Google Scholar) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and antibiotics (10 units/ml of penicillin and 10 μg/ml of streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were subcultured twice a week.UVB and Staurosporine Treatment of the Cells—Cells were cultivated in 6-well culture plates or in individual 35-mm diameter plates until 90-95% confluent. For the assays the complete medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after washing the cell layers three times with the serum-free culture medium. Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with bulbs emitting UVB (312 nm) was used for the UV treatment of the cells as described (24Latonen L. Yoichi T. Laiho M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Staurosporine (0.001-1 μm final concentration) in dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) was added into the cell culture medium as indicated (25Solovyan V.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, NAC, or the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 (1-10 μm) for 60 min before the addition of staurosporine or UV treatment. After an incubation of 6-24 h the floating cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. vCD46 in apoptotic blebs and vesicles was sedimented by centrifugation of the supernatant at 200,000 × g for 60 min. Finally, the soluble polypeptides in the 200,000 × g supernatant were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration), and the cleaved sCD46 was immunodetected by specific antibodies as described below.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The trichloroacetic acid precipitates were washed with ice-cold acetone and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitated polypeptides were then separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide monomer concentration). Subsequently, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. After the saturation of the nonspecific protein binding sites of the membranes with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween) the filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with pretested dilution of mAb to CD46 in TBS/Tween supplemented with 5% nonfat milk powder. In the controls the primary antibodies were omitted or replaced with an irrelevant antibody of the same subclass as the specific mAb. After washing with TBS/Tween the bound antibodies were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and an electrochemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal® ULTRA Substrate; Pierce).Detection of Caspase Activation in UVB- and Staurosporine-treated Cells—The Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 luminometric assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to measure the activities of caspases 3 and 7. Briefly, after UVB or staurosporine exposure the cells were harvested from the culture plates into the culture medium with a cell scraper. Aliquots of the medium (25 μl) in triplicate were mixed with equal amount of Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 assay reagent and measured with a luminometer. Unexposed cells served as a negative control. The caspase activation data are expressed as a -fold over negative control.Flow Cytometric Analysis of CD46 Release from Staurosporine-treated Adherent and Floating Cells—Some cells are spontaneously detached from the growth substratum during culture, resulting in the form of apoptotic cell death called anoikis. Significant C3 and C4 deposition can be detected on the apoptotic cells only in the late phase of apoptosis and is mainly focused on small cells and subcellular fragments (26Gaipl U.S. Kuenkele S. Voll R.E. Beyer T.D. Kolowos W. Heyder P. Kalden J.R. Herrmann M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To understand the interrelationships between these events we compared the expression of CD46 between substratum-bound and detached cells. Subconfluent cultures of Caov-3 cells were treated with staurosporine together with the metalloproteinase inhibitor (10 μm GM6001) as indicated. After 8 h of incubation the spontaneously detached floating cells were isolated from their culture medium by low speed centrifugation. The substratum-bound cells were then detached with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were kept on ice during the processing for the flow cytometric analysis. After washing, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to CD46. In the controls the primary antibody was replaced with an irrelevant antibody of the same subclass. The bound antibodies were detected with anti-mouse antibodies labeled with a fluorescent probe. Finally the cells were analyzed by a BD Biosciences FAC-Scan 440 flow cytometer. From similarly treated cultures, equal numbers (1.6 × 106) of adherent or spontaneously detached cells, isolated vesicles, and supernatants were analyzed for the expression of CD46 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunofluorescence microcopy analysis the cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to visualize CD46 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V to stain apoptotic cells. The bound antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 594.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—ADAM10 siRNA (5′-AGACAUUAUGAAGGAUUAU-3′) was synthesized by Qiagen (West Sussex, UK) as described (27Murai T. Miyazaki Y. Nishinakamura H. Sugahara K.N. Miyauchi T. Sako Y. Yanakida T. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4541-4550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were transfected with annealed siRNAs using Lipo-fectamine™2000 (Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with nonsilencing scrambled siRNA. After 48 h, the cells were exposed to 0.1 μm staurosporine and analyzed for sCD46, vCD46, and cellular CD46 from total cell lysates as described above. The expression level of ADAM10 in total cell lysates and in vesicles was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. ADAM17 was detected as a nonsilenced control protein in the immunoblots.RESULTSUVB and Staurosporine Induce the Shedding of sCD46 in a Metalloproteinase-dependent Manner—The origin and the mechanisms of the metalloproteolytically released sCD46 have remained unclear. Recent observations of sCD46 release from injured or dying cells (14Hakulinen J. Junnikkala S. Sorsa T. Meri S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2620-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Van Den Berg C. De Andrade R. Magnoli F. Marchbank K. Tambourgi D. Immunology. 2002; 107: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the down-regulation of complement regulatory proteins (CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59) during apoptosis (28Tsuji S. Kaji K. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Hara T. Matsumoto M. Tsuji S. Nagasawa S. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Kodama K. Horai T. Sakuma T. Seya T.

Immunology. 1995; 86: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar) suggested to us that sCD46 could be released during apoptosis. To study this we induced apoptosis in HaCaT and Caov-3 cells by increasing doses of UVB (500-4000 J/m2) or of staurosporine (0.001-1 μm). GM6001 was used to inhibit metalloproteinase activity where indicated. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated sCD46 was detected by immunoblotting from the serum-free supernatant fluids that were clarified by centrifugation after harvesting, first at 2000 × g and then at 200,000 × g to separate vCD46 and sCD46. The two shed CD46 species differ in their molecular masses; sCD46 is slightly smaller (55-60 kDa) than the membrane-associated vCD46 detected in the vesicles (60-65 kDa) (14Hakulinen J. Junnikkala S. Sorsa T. Meri S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2620-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with UVB (Fig. 1A) resulted in the shrinkage and retraction and finally detachment of some of the cells from the matrix. The keratinocyte cell line HaCaT required higher doses of UVB (4000 J/m2) than Caov-3 carcinoma cells (1000 J/m2) to induce the shedding of sCD46 (Fig. 1B). The untreated cells did not release detectable amounts of sCD46 during the 24-h incubation. Human skin fibroblasts, used as a control, did not shed sCD46 at any of the UV doses tested (data not shown). The metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 (10 μm) completely prevented the cleavage of CD46 in UVB-treated cells (Fig. 1B).Staurosporine is a broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases that induces apoptosis in a number of normal and malignant cell lines (31Gescher A. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2000; 34: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Treatment of both HaCaT and Caov-3 cell cultures by staurosporine resulted in changes of cell morphology resembling those of UVB treatment (Fig. 1A). We found that, in parallel, sCD46 was released into the medium in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 also completely prevented the staurosporine-induced release of sCD46.Both UVB and Staurosporine Result in Increased Caspase Activity and sCD46 Release in Caov-3 and HaCaT Cells—Caspases are major players in the initiation of the apoptotic program leading to cell death. Caspases 3 and 7 belong to the group of effector or executioner caspases that act downstream of the point of no return in the apoptotic cascade to cleave the cells into apoptotic bodies (32Vermes I. Haanen C. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 243: 167-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The increase in caspase activities correlated with the increase of the shedding of sCD46 both in UVB- and staurosporine-treated HaCaT and Caov-3 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Over 5-fold increase in the caspase activity was required to initiate the shedding of sCD46 as judged from the immunoblot. A plateau in caspase activity was reached at 1000 J/m2 exposure of UVB for Caov-3 cells. For HaCaT cells 2000 J/m2 was required to induce approximately the same level of caspase activity. As expected, GM6001 (10 μm) did not have any effect on the caspase activity (data not shown). Accordingly, staurosporine (0.1 μm) stimulated the caspase activities ∼5-fold in Caov-3 and 14-fold in HaCaT cells (Fig. 1C). To measure the time lag for the initiation of the sCD46 release we exposed the cells to UVB and monitored the solubilization of CD46 within 4-24 h. We found that sCD46 became gradually visible in the immunoblots after 8 h (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Time-dependent release of CD46 from UVB-treated cells. The cells were treated with the indicated dose of UVB. To determine the time lag for the initiation of CD46 shedding, soluble CD46 was monitored at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Apoptosis with the Pan-caspase Inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk Reduces the Shedding of sCD46—To further characterize whether the UVB- and staurosporine-stimulated release of sCD46 resulted from the induction of apoptosis, we carried out analyses with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. The inhibitor was added into the serum-free medium of the cells 60 min prior to the treatments. We found that the inhibitor clearly reduced the rounding and other morphological changes both in the staurosporine- and UVB-treated HaCaT (Fig. 3A) and Caov-3 cells (data not shown). The inhibition of caspase activity in the cells was accompanied by decreased release of sCD46 into the medium in a dose-dependent manner, both in the UVB-(Fig. 3B) and staurosporine-(Fig. 3C) treated cultures. Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) completely prevented the release of sCD46 from HaCaT cells (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, Z-VAD-fmk reduced the release of sCD46 from UVB-treated Caov-3 cell cultures in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk decreases UVB-induced shedding of soluble sCD46. Caov-3 and HaCaT cells were grown to 85-95% confluency. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was added into the medium at the indicated concentrations 60 min before exposure of the cells to UVB (4000 J/m2). A, the exposure of HaCaT cells to UVB (4000 J/m2) resulted in detachment and shrinkage of cells during 24 h of incubation. Untreated control cells and cells exposed to Z-VAD-fmk remained firmly attached to the matrix (phase contrast ×40). After 24 h of incubation the cell culture medium was harvested and clarified by centrifugation. B and C, immunoblotting analysis was used to detect sCD46 from the supernatants after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Z-VAD-fmk decreased the UVB-(B) and staurosporine-(C) induced release of sCD46 in a concentration-dependent manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Radical Scavenger NAC Inhibits the Shedding of sCD46—UVB is a potent inducer of ROS-generating oxidative stress in cells (18Ichihashi M. Ueda M. Budiyanto A. Bito T. Oka M. Fukunaga M. Tsuru K. Horikawa T. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). NAC can increase the cellular synthesis on endogenous antioxidant glutathione or protect the cells by directly scavenging ROS. To assess this, we found that the stimulatory effect of UVB irradiation on sCD46 shedding was attenuated dose dependently by NAC in both cell models (Fig. 4), which suggested the involvement of ROS in the signal transduction of staurosporine- and UVB irradiation-enhanced sCD46 shedding.FIGURE 4NAC inhibits the release of soluble sCD46 from UVB- and staurosporine-treated cells. Caov-3 and HaCaT cells were grown to 85-95% confluency. NAC was added at the indicated concentrations 60 min before exposure of the cells to UVB (4000 J/m2) or staurosporine (0.1 μm). After 24 h of incubation the cell culture medium was harvested (see “Experimental Procedures”). The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated sCD46 was detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metalloproteolytic and Nonproteolytic Release of CD46 during Apoptosis—Some of the apoptotic cells are spontaneously detached from the culture substratum during culture. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we did not detect any changes in the CD46 expression on the cells firmly attached to the culture substratum with or without GM6001 (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that the sCD46 could become shed from the detached apoptotic cells. To explore this possibility we used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of CD46 on floating cells and on cells attached on culture matrix. Caov-3 cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine and the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. Because sCD46 was detected by immunoblotting at 8 h (data not shown), we isolated the spontaneously detached floating cells from the medium by low speed centrifugation at this time point. The substratum-bound cells were detached with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to CD46 on ice, and the bound antibodies were detected with anti-mouse antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488.Flow cytometric analysis showed that the level of CD46 on staurosporine-treated attached cells was comparable with that of staurosporine-treated attached cells when metalloproteinase activity was inhibited with GM6001 (Fig. 5A, upper left panel). However, the level of CD46 on floating cells was lower than that on attached cells (upper right and middle left panels). Furthermore, the floating cells isolated from staurosporine-treated cultures had lost CD46 irrespective of the inhibition of the metalloproteinases when compared with cells bound to the substratum. There was a minor increase in CD46 expression on the floating cells that were isolated from cultures treated with staurosporine and GM6001 over cultures where the inhibitor was omitted (middle panel on the right). However, GM6001 did not restore the expression of CD46 on the floating cells to the level of attached cells.FIGURE 5A, flow cytometric analysis of CD46 release from staurosporine-treated Caov-3 cells. The cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine (STS) and the metalloproteinase inhibitor (GM) (10 μm GM6001) as indicated. After 8 h of incubation the spontaneously detached floating and the substratum-bound cells were isolated. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the amount of CD46 on staurosporine-treated attached cells was comparable with similarly treated attached cells when metalloproteinase activity was inhibited with GM6001 (upper left panel). Floating cells isolated from staurosporine-treated cultures had lost CD46 irrespective of the inhibition of the metallo-proteinases (upper right and middle left panels). However, floating cells isolated from staurosporine-treated cultures expressed slightly less CD46 than floating cells isolated from staurosporine- and metalloproteinase inhibitortreated cultures (lower right panel). B, immunoblotting analysis of an assay described above. Detached cells expressed lower levels of CD46 than the attached cells. GM6001 prevented the release of sCD46 (supernatant) and increased vCD46 (vesicles). C, immunofluorescence analysis of the release of CD46 from apoptotic Caov-3 cells. Examination of the staining patterns of the cells with fluorescence microscopy revealed heterogenous expression patterns of CD46 (red fluorescence) on individual Caov-3 cells (left panel). Stain"

In this study, we investigated the functional role of the sumoylation of C/EBPα in the differentiation of hepatocytes. The amount of sumoylated C/EBPα gradually decreased during the differentiation, which suggests that the sumoylation is important for the control of growth/differentiation especially in the fetal liver. To analyze the function of the sumoylation of C/EBPα in liver-specific gene expression, we studied its effects on the expression of the albumin gene. The C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of the albumin gene was reduced by sumoylation of C/EBPα in primary fetal hepatocytes. The enhancement of C/EBPα-mediated transactivation by BRG1, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was hampered by sumoylation in a luciferase reporter assay. In addition, we discovered that sumoylation of C/EBPα blocked its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation by leading to the disruption of a proliferation-inhibitory complex because of a failure of the sumoylated C/EBPα to interact with BRG1. BRG1 was recruited to the dihydrofolate reductase promoter in nonproliferating C33a cells but was not detected in proliferating cells where C/EBPα, BRG1, and SUMO-1 were overexpressed. This result suggests that BRG1 down-regulates the expression of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. These findings provide the insight that SUMO acts as a space regulator, which affects protein-protein interactions.

Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). For example, the attachment of SUMO-1 to promyelocytic leukemia protein, Sp100, and Daxx is involved in the formation of nuclear subdomains such as the promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domain (5Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the modification of SUMO-1 prevents the degradation of IκBα by competing with ubiquitination (6Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). SUMO is a member of a family of ubiquitin-like proteins that can be covalently attached to a large number of proteins. The pathway of sumoylation resembles that of ubiquitination, although the conjugation of SUMO involves a different set of enzymes. SUMO is synthesized as a precursor protein and is processed at the C terminus by a class of cysteine proteases (7Hemelaar J. Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Reverter D. Cook J. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Willkinson K.D. Gill G. Lima C.D. Ploegh H.L. Ovaa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the conjugation of SUMO to proteins involves the ATP-dependent heterodimeric SUMO-activating E1 enzyme (Aos1/Uba2). Once activated, SUMO is transferred to Ubc9, the E2-conjugating enzyme for SUMO, and attached to the ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine residue of a target protein that contains the consensus sequence ψKXE (ψ, large hydrophobic residue) recognized by Ubc9 (8Tatham H.M. Jaffray E. Vaugham O.A. Dessterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hat R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Recently, SUMO E3 ligases have been identified in yeast and mammalian cells. An E3 ligase enhances transfer of the SUMO molecule from E2 to a specific substrate, although E3 ligase is not required for sumoylation in vitro (8Tatham H.M. Jaffray E. Vaugham O.A. Dessterro J.M.P.

To date, three unrelated proteins have been identified as SUMO E3 ligases: RanBP2, PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT proteins), and the polycomb group protein Pc2 (4Gill G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9134-9141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reported that PIASy acts as an E3 ligase to enhance the modification of SUMO by a transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). Six members of the C/EBP family (C/EBPα to C/EBPζ) have been isolated and characterized to date (10Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They all have a highly conserved basic leucine zipper dimerization domain and a DNA-binding domain at the C terminus. Their divergent N-terminal regions contain the transcriptional regulatory domains and specify their activities (3Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 11Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol.

C/EBPα is a central regulator of energy homeostasis as it directly activates the transcription of many metabolically important genes (12Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and also plays central roles in the growth and differentiation of hepatocytes (13Timchenko N.A.

C/EBPα was reported recently to be sumoylated at the lysine residue of a consensus sequence called synergy control motif or regulatory domain motif. The motif resides in a region that causes an inhibitory effect on its transcriptional activity (9Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iñiguez-Lluhí J. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Kim et al. (11Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported that the regulatory domain motif corresponding to the synergy control motif had a negative regulatory effect on transcription and that the disruption of the regulatory domain motif caused release from the repression. Although they speculated that sumoylation of the consensus motif can affect the inhibitory function by influencing protein-protein interactions, the molecular mechanism by which sumoylation regulates the activity of the transcription factor is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the level and functional roles of sumoylated C/EBPα during the differentiation of hepatocytes. Furthermore, we showed that the BRG1-binding site of C/EBPα was masked by SUMO-1, and sumoylation dramatically decreased the stimulation of C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of the liver-specific albumin gene by BRG1, the core subunit of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (16Muchardt C.

This result indicates that modification with SUMO can change the activity of the transcription factor by affecting protein-protein interactions. In addition, C/EBPα is a strong inhibitor of cell proliferation. It is reported that the molecular mechanisms of the C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest depend on several pathways (18Wang H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that a functional SWI/SNF complex is required for C/EBPα-mediated proliferation arrest. Here we also report that sumoylated C/EBPα failed to induce proliferation arrest because its interaction with BRG1 was inhibited. Isolation and Culture of Rat Hepatocytes—Adult rat hepatocytes were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats (6–7 weeks old; Nihon SLC) by collagenase perfusion, and fetal hepatocytes were isolated from fetuses (embryonic days 13–15, 17 and 18). Cells were cultured essentially as described previously (23Dohda T. Kaneoka H. Inayoshi Y. Kamihira M. Miyake K. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reagents and Cells—The anti-C/EBPα (sc-61), anti-SUMO-1 (sc-9060), anti-E2F1 (sc-866), and anti-E2F4 (sc-193) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-SUMO-1 (N-term; 38–1990) rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The mouse monoclonal antibody against HSV tag (NV591) was purchased from Novagen. Affinity-purified anti-BRG1 antibody was raised as described previously (24Machida Y. Murai K. Miyake K. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Human adrenal carcinoma SW13 (ATCC CCL-105) and human cervical carcinoma C33a (ATCC HTB31) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293 adenovirus-immortalized human kidney (ATCC CRL-1573) cells were maintained in a 3:1 mixture of minimal essential medium and Waymouth's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid Construction and Gene Transfection—The full-length cDNAs of SUMO-1, Aos1, Uba2, and Ubc9 were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO/myc-His (pcDNA4) vector (Invitrogen). Primers for PCR were designed based on the following cDNA sequences: SUMO-1 (NCBI accession number NM009460), Aos1 (NM019748), Uba2 (BC054768) and Ubc9 (BC037635). A vector expressing a nonprocessable version of SUMO-1 (SUMO-1GA) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of Gly-97 to Ala. The mammalian expression vector pSPORT6/mPIASy (MGC 35863) was purchased from Invitrogen. A pREP4-based luciferase reporter plasmid in which the luciferase gene is under the control of the albumin promoter, pcDNA4/C/EBPα, pcDNA4/BRG1, pcDNA4/mutBRG1 (ATPase mutant) and pcDNA4/BRM, was described previously (25Inayoshi Y. Machida Y. Kaneoka H. Terajima M. Dohda T. Miyake K. Takahashi M. Kamihira M. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutant C/EBPα expression vectors were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by replacing Lys-159 with Ala or Arg. For the expression of GST-fused proteins, the SUMO-1 and C/EBPα TEi–iii regions (amino acids 1–200) were cloned in-frame into the GST expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences). For the expression of HSV-tagged BRG1, the BRG1 helicase domain (amino acids 757–1262) and BRG1 ΔE7 (amino acids 714–1308) were also cloned in-frame into pETBlue2 (Novagen) (25Inayoshi Y. Machida Y. Kaneoka H. Terajima M. Dohda T. Miyake K. Takahashi M. Kamihira M. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pTS-1, which expresses SUMO-E1 and -E2 ligases and SUMO-1 itself (26Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Sugasawa K. Nakao M. Saitoh H. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 331: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was purchased from Nippon Flour Mills. The inserted DNA sequence of each vector was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. 293, SW13, and C33a cells and primary fetal hepatocytes were cultured to semiconfluence and transfected with expression plasmids by using lipofection reagent (Lipofectamine™ 2000; Invitrogen). The efficiency of gene transfer to fetal hepatocytes was about 80%, and no cytotoxic effects of the reagent were observed. Luciferase Reporter Assay—SW13 and 293 cells seeded in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.03 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 4 ng of Renilla luciferase expression plasmid containing the promoter region of the elongation factor Iα gene with or without 0.1 μg of the expression plasmid for C/EBPα, SUMO-1, or SUMO-1GA and 0.4 μg of the expression plasmid for BRG1. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Luciferase activity was measured with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a luminometer (Luminescencer JNR II; Atto). Inhibition of PIASy Expression by siRNA—For the knockdown of PIASy, siRNAs (siPIASy-1, 5′-AACCTTACCCACCTCATGTATCT-3′, and siPIASy-2, 5′-ACCTACAAATGAATGAGAAGAAG-3′) were synthesized. Cells cultured to semiconfluence were transfected with siRNA (100 pmol/well in a 24-well plate) by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 6 h post-transfection and grown in fresh medium for an additional 42 h. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from rat hepatocytes and C33a cells using an EASYPrep RNA kit (Takara), and 1 μg of total RNA was then reverse-transcribed with a reverse transcriptase (ReverTra Ace®; Toyobo) to generate cDNAs. The detection of albumin, GAPDH, PIASy, human dehydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) cDNAs was performed by PCR using the following as primers: 5′-GCCATTCCAAAGCTTCGTGA-3′ and 5′-CGGCGTTTTGGAATCCATAC-3′ for rat albumin; 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ for GAPDH; 5′-ATGAGACTCGCTATGCCAA-3′ and 5′-GCCCGGCACTGAGC-3′ for PIASy; 5′-ATGAGACTCGCTATGCCAA-3′ and 5′-GCCCGGCACTGAAC-3′ for human DHFR; and 5′-AGGTGTTGGAGGCACTC-3′ and 5′-CATTTCCAAGTTCTCCAC-3′ for human PCNA. Albumin, GAPDH, PIASy, human DHFR, and human PCNA were amplified for 16, 24, 22, 28, and 28 cycles, respectively. These PCRs did not result in saturation. The GAPDH gene served as an internal control in the calculation of the densitometric results. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pulldown Assay—Immunoprecipitation and the GST pulldown assay were performed as described previously (25Inayoshi Y. Machida Y. Kaneoka H. Terajima M. Dohda T. Miyake K. Takahashi M. Kamihira M. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The GST-C/EBPα TEi–iii, sumoylated GST-C/EBPα TEi-iii, or GST-SUMO-1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Sumoylated C/EBPα was obtained by introducing both pGEX-C/EBPα TEi-iii and pTS1 into E. coli BL21. ChIP Assay and Re-precipitation (Re-ChIP)—Immunoprecipitation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin from the transfected SW13, C33a cells, and primary hepatocytes was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications (27Wang L. Brown J.L. Cao R. Zhang Y. Kassis J.A. Jones R.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 28Kinoshita Y. Johnson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35879-35889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated DNAs and input DNA were analyzed by PCR using the following as primers: 5′-CATAACTTTAATGAATTGACAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GAGAAACTCGCTCTAATATACTTCTC-3′ for the rat albumin promoter; 5′-TTTTTGGCAAGGATGGTATG-3′ and GLprimer2 (Promega) for the promoter region of the luciferase reporter plasmid (albumin promoter); 5′-GCACTGTGCAGAAGAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGCGGCGATCAGACCC-3′ for the rat DHFR promoter; and 5′-AGGCTTCCGGCGAGACATGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGTTCTGGGACACAGCGACGATGC-3′ for the human DHFR promoter. For negative controls, the following were used: 5′-TGTGTTTTCAAGGCTACCCTGA-3′ and 5′-GATGAAGGGAGGAAACCGAG-3′ for the rat albumin coding region; 5′-CTGGGCAGAATCAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCATACCACTCCTCATTATTTTAT-3′ for the rat DHFR-coding region; and 5′-TAAGGCCTGAACAAGGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCCACGCCTGAAATTATCCT-3′ for the human DHFR-coding region. Proliferation Assay—The transfected cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. Every 24 h, cells were harvested, and the number of living cells was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Two-dimensional Gel-Western Blotting—The cell lysates were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with immobiline IEF (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (29Toda T. Kimura N. Jpn. J. Electrophor. 1997; 41: 13-20Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to the membrane and detected with anti-C/EBPα rabbit antibody. Sumoylated C/EBPα Levels Decrease during Hepatocyte Differentiation—Primary fetal and adult hepatocytes were used to study the sumoylation of C/EBPα because C/EBPα is known to play important roles in the liver development (13Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darligton G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a shifted band attributable to modified C/EBPα was detected at an early stage in the differentiation of hepatocytes (E13–15), and the intensity of the band decreased in the late stages of the differentiation process. The shifted band seemed to be sumoylated C/EBPα, because the mobility of the band detected in SW13 cells cotransfected with the C/EBPα and SUMO-1 expression vectors was consistent with that of the putative sumoylated C/EBPα in the primary hepatocytes. We then performed an immunoprecipitation assay to confirm whether this shifted band was indeed SUMO-1-modified C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 1B, the putative sumoylated C/EBPα precipitated with the anti-C/EBPα antibody reacted with the anti-SUMO-1 antibody. We therefore concluded that the shifted C/EBPα band was generated by sumoylation. Modification of C/EBPα by SUMO-1 Has a Repressive Effect on the Transactivation of the Albumin Promoter—As indicated above, we demonstrated that the C/EBPα protein was sumoylated in vivo. Thus, a question is raised regarding the function of the sumoylated C/EBPα protein. It is well recognized that the liver-specific expression of several genes such as those for albumin, α-fetoprotein, and tyrosine aminotransferase at least partly depends on C/EBPα (30Herbst R.S. Friedman N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Babiss L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Guertin M. LaRue H. Bernier D. Wrange O. Chevertte M. Gingras M.C. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Schweizer-Groyer G. Groyer A. Cadepond F. Grange T. Baulieu E.E. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because the level of sumoylated C/EBPα protein present in primary hepatocytes decreased during differentiation, we hypothesized that liver-specific gene expression is controlled partly by the sumoylation of C/EBPα. The expression of the albumin gene increased during hepatocyte differentiation (Fig. 2A), and the expression showed a pattern roughly opposite that of sumoylated C/EBPα protein. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of sumoylation of C/EBPα on albumin gene expression by conducting luciferase reporter assays in 293 cells that do not contain endogenous C/EBPα, with the luciferase vector and the expression vectors for C/EBPα and SUMO-1. C/EBPα-mediated expression from the albumin promoter was repressed by SUMO-1 (Fig. 2B). The transcription from the albumin promoter was not affected by the expression of SUMO-1 alone in the absence of C/EBPα. The expression of albumin is facilitated by both C/EBPα and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), and these transcription factors have additive effects on the expression (23Dohda T. Kaneoka H. Inayoshi Y. Kamihira M. Miyake K. Iijima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 136: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm that the modification of C/EBPα by SUMO-1 directly affects C/EBPα-mediated transcription, lysine 159 at the SUMO attachment site was replaced with either alanine or arginine. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, these mutations relieved the repression. Thus, it seems likely that SUMO-1 expression directly repressed C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of the albumin gene, and we can rule out the possibility that other transcription factors such as HNF-1 present in 293 cells are involved in the SUMO-1-mediated repression of the albumin gene. Attachment of SUMO-1 to C/EBPα Represses Liver-specific Albumin Expression in Primary Hepatocytes—To show that the sumoylation represses the transactivation by C/EBPα in primary hepatocytes, the C/EBPα-mediated expression of the albumin gene was monitored by RT-PCR in primary fetal hepatocytes transfected with expression vectors for SUMO-1, E3 ligase PIASy (9Subramanian L. Benson M.D. Iñiguez-Lluhí J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9134-9141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), E1 enzyme Aos1/Uba2, and E2 enzyme Ubc9 (8Tatham H.M. Jaffray E. Vaugham O.A. Dessterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hat R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The simultaneous transfection of SUMO-1 and E1–E3 ligases reduced the expression of the albumin gene in fetal hepatocytes (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–5). A detailed analysis of the expression of albumin following the transfection of several combinations of SUMO E1–E3 ligases showed that exogenously expressed E1 and E2 enzymes had little effect on albumin expression without PIASy (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). On the other hand, exogenously expressed PIASy alone decreased the albumin expression to 70% of the control level, suggesting that the E3 ligase may be a key for sumoylation in fetal liver, although E1–E3 ligases act cooperatively for sufficient sumoylation. In addition to the overexpression of SUMO-1 and its ligases, we also performed siRNA experiments for blocking the expression of PIASy. With siRNA for PIASy (siPIASy-1), albumin expression increased 2-fold compared with that in control E14-hepatocytes (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2). To exclude the off-target effect of siRNA, another siPIASy was designed (siPIASy-2). RT-PCR assay showed that this siPIASy also increased the expression of albumin (supplemental Fig. S1C). Because some C/EBPα was sumoylated in E13–15 hepatocytes, it is possible that the decrease in sumoylation of C/EBPα caused the increase in the expression of albumin. Furthermore, SUMO-1GA, a dominant negative form of SUMO-1, was also tested in the presence of PIASy. Repression of the albumin gene was not observed in the primary fetal hepatocytes cotransfected with the SUMO-1GA and PIASy expression vectors. Furthermore, the level of albumin was higher than that in the nontransfected control (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). This result indicated that PIASy alone did not directly repress the transcription, although it was recently reported that PIASy represses androgen receptor target genes independent of sumoylation (33Gross M. Yang R. Top I. Gasper C. Shuai K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the above results suggest that the sumoylation of unidentified factors that affect albumin expression as well as the endogenous sumoylation of C/EBPα in fetal hepatocytes may be inhibited because PIASy has relatively broad substrate specificity for sumoylation (34Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 35Lee P.S.W. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and SUMO-1GA can affect all cellular sumoylation. To confirm that sumoylation of C/EBPα is indeed important, C/EBPα expression was blocked by siRNA. siRNA for C/EBPα reduced albumin expression in fetal hepatocytes (supplemental Fig. S2). Under conditions where C/EBPα expression was reduced by the siRNA, SUMO-1 and SUMO E1–E3 ligases had no effect on albumin levels, suggesting again that sumoylation of C/EBPα affects albumin expression. Together, the above results suggest that sumoylation of C/EBPα represses the expression of the albumin gene in the chromosomal environment in hepatocytes, although sumoylated C/EBPα was not dominant. The siRNA for PIASy indeed reduced the sumoylation of C/EBPα, and the overexpression of the ligase increased the modification in hepatocytes in vivo as shown in Fig. 3B. This observation indicates the importance of the E3 ligase in the sumoylation. To clarify this point, we transfected the SUMO-1 expression vector alone into primary fetal hepatocytes. Contrary to the experiments performed in Fig. 3A, the transfection of SUMO-1 had no effect on the expression of albumin (Fig. 3C). These results imply that the SUMO E3 ligase is essential for controlling the sumoylation of C/EBPα in hepatocytes. We t"

Surprisingly, however, a direct functional role for TFE3 in the regulation of proliferation has not been reported. By screening retroviral cDNA expression libraries to identify cDNAs that confer resistance to a pRB-induced proliferation arrest, we have found that TFE3 overrides a growth arrest in Rat1 cells induced by pRB and its upstream regulator p16INK4A. In addition, TFE3 expression blocks the anti-mitogenic effects of TGF-β in rodent and human cells. We provide data supporting a role for endogenous TFE3 in the direct regulation of CYCLIN E expression in an E2F3-dependent manner.

During cell cycle progression, the retinoblastoma pocket protein (pRB) 2The abbreviations used are: pRB, retinoblastoma pocket protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast.2The abbreviations used are: pRB, retinoblastoma pocket protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast. is phosphorylated by upstream cyclin-CDK complexes, ultimately leading to activation of genes critical for cell division. Extensive study of pRB has indicated that it serves as a nodal point for the integration of various signaling pathways, including TGF-β and p16INK4A signaling, in controlling cell growth (8Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar, 9Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Numerous mutations in the retinoblastoma gene itself have been reported, and somatic ablation in mouse embryo fibroblasts is sufficient for cell cycle entry (10Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition, in many tumors, the INK4A locus is found inactivated, leading to uninhibited phosphorylation of pRB due to loss of the p16INK4A CDK inhibitor. Alternatively, cancer cells overexpress upstream inhibitors of the growth-suppressive effects of pRB, such as D-type cyclins. Indeed, detailed analysis of the pRB pathway indicates that functional inactivation of pRB is a requirement for the multistep process toward tumorigenesis. Furthermore, it is likely that other genetic aberrations resulting in defects in pRB function remain to be discovered. The activity of the transcription factors E2F1, -2, and -3 is actively repressed by pRB, and this is thought to represent the most important role of pRB in S-phase entry, DNA replication, and apoptosis (11Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 12Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The central part that these E2Fs play in cell cycle regulation is emphasized by the finding that enforced expression of E2F1 alone is sufficient to mediate S-phase entry, whereas genetic ablation of all three pRB-interacting E2Fs leads to a proliferation arrest (13Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. Greenberg M.E. Orkin S. Nevins J.R. Robinson M.L. Leone G.

Nonetheless, no strong evidence supports a direct oncogenic role for E2Fs. Repression of E2F1–3 target genes by pRB is achieved in a number of distinct ways (12Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). First, pRB binds directly to the transactivation domains of the E2Fs, blocking their activity. In addition, pRB promoter binding prevents the assembly of preinitiation factors, thereby inhibiting the action of adjacent transcription factors. Finally, pRB recruits chromatin modification and remodeling factors, such as HDACs, BRG1, and hBRM, which promote heterochromatin formation and promote long term gene silencing (15Zhang H.S. Gavin M.

Analysis of single and compound E2F1–3 knock-out mice has revealed redundant (but also unique) roles for the various E2Fs. For instance, E2F3 appears to play a critical role in maintaining proliferation by repressing p19ARF transcription, a potent activator of p53 (17Aslanian A. Iaquinta P.J. Verona R. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because E2F1–3 regulate overlapping (but also distinct) genes, these functional differences are likely because of differences in target gene specificity. The mechanisms for E2F target specificity are not well understood but may involve recruitment of specific co-factors. For example, E2F1 (but not E2F2/3) binds to the ETS-related transcription factor GABP-γ1, whereas YY1 specifically interacts with E2F2/3 (18Schlisio S. Halperin T. Vidal M. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5775-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Hauck L. Kaba R.G. Lipp M. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2147-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TFE3 and its close family member USF1 were recently found to specifically interact with E2F3, thereby regulating target promoters containing adjacent E2F and TFE3 binding sites (3Giangrande P.H. Zhu W. Rempel R.E. Laakso N. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1336-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Giangrande P.H. Hallstrom T.C. Tunyaplin C. Calame K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3707-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TFE3 was originally identified by its affinity for an E-box in the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer element and later as a co-factor in a number of signal transduction pathways (20Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For instance, TFE3 and its family member, MitF, bind to the Wnt transcription factor LEF-1 and cooperate to induce dopachrome tautomerase transcription (2Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Saito H. Watanabe K. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, TFE3 cooperates with ETS-1, and TFE3 has been found to bind SMAD3 and SMAD4 and synergistically transactivate PAI-1 transcription in response to TGF-β, a feature that may be shared with some of the TFE3 fusions found in cancer (1Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Tian G. Erman B. Ishii H. Gangopadhyay S.S. Sen R. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, these studies have been mostly limited to biochemical and molecular studies and consequently have failed to define a role for TFE3 in proliferation. Indeed, despite the observation that many of the binding partners of TFE3 play a critical role in proliferation, a cellular function of TFE3 has not been determined. In the present study, we set out to find new mechanisms by which cells can become insensitive to the p16-cyclin D-pRB pathway. More specifically, we looked for genes that allow proliferation in the presence of hypophosphorylated pRB by enforcing a strong growth-inhibitory block using a dominant active pRB mutant. We now have established TFE3 as a gene that can uncouple cell cycle progression from pRB phosphorylation and TGF-β signaling and identify a functional role for TFE3 in regulating CYCLIN E expression. Generation of Cells to Screen for cDNAs That Confer Resistance to pRB-induced Growth Arrest—Rat1 fibroblasts were transfected at 32 °C with pcDNA3.1-tsT, expressing tsT antigen (see Fig. 1a) (24Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Drinkwater N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1811-1822PubMed Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were assayed for the expression of the large T antigen by Western blot analysis. Clone C5 was then transfected with the pRB-NPC expression vector or with the p16-GFP expression vector. The pRB-NPC protein harbors an amino-terminal GFP tag to allow continuous monitoring of the presence of the growth-inhibitory RB protein in individual cells. A stable colony of pRB-NPC-transfected cells having the lowest number of spontaneous background colonies at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) was chosen for the functional genetic screens (named Rat1 C5.5). Similarly, a stable colony from the p16-GFP transfection was selected with low spontaneous background (termed Rat1 C5A). Retroviral Rescue Screens—High titer retroviral library supernatants derived from human brain (Clontech) were used to infect 4–5 × 106 Rat1 C5.5 cells at 32 °C as described previously (25Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Koh E. Daley G.Q. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two days post-infection, the cells were split 1 in 12, allowed to attach at 32 °C, and then transferred to 39 °C. Several individual colonies were visible as soon as 8 days after the temperature shift. The colonies were picked and expanded. Recovery of integrated proviruses for the second round selection has been described previously (26Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). After the second round selection, retrovirally encoded cDNAs were recovered by PCR with retrovirus-specific primers and identified by sequence analysis (25Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Koh E. Daley G.Q. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cell extracts were prepared in E1A lysis buffer (ELB), and 40–60 μg of extract was resolved on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies used for Western blotting were M-20 for cyclin E, C15 for pRB, C18 for p107, C19 for cyclin A, PC-10 for PCNA, C19 for CDC2, C19 for MCM3, and C22 for CDK4, all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The p419 antibody was used for the detection of T antigen. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the detection of proteins. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Wild-type or E2F3 knock-out MEFs were immortalized by infection with a retrovirus encoding the SV40 large T antigen (27Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 690-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation and processed essentially as already described (28Fabbrizio E. El Messaoudi S. Polanowska J. Paul C. Cook J.R. Lee J.H. Negre V. Rousset M. Pestka S. Le Cam A. Sardet C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Morrison A.J. Sardet C. Herrera R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 856-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cyclin E and Gapdh primers were as described; CE12 (−47, +46 + 1/start site) (28Fabbrizio E. El Messaoudi S. Polanowska J. Paul C. Cook J.R. Lee J.H. Negre V. Rousset M. Pestka S. Le Cam A. Sardet C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse TFE3 was purchased from Pharmingen. A Screening System for Bypass of a pRB-dependent Growth Arrest—To search for genes that, when overexpressed, confer resistance to the growth suppressing activity of pRB, we used a functional genetic approach. We first transfected the Rat1 fibroblast cell line with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 T antigen (Fig. 1a). The tsT antigen binds and functionally inactivates pRB at the permissive temperature (32 °C) but is inactive and degraded at 39 °C (see Fig. 3a, second panel from top) (24Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Drinkwater N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1811-1822PubMed Google Scholar). A clone stably expressing relatively high levels of tsT was selected (Rat1-C5) and subsequently transfected at the permissive temperature with a constitutively active form of pRB (pRB-NPC) (31Chew Y.P. Ellis M. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This pRB mutant, in which 14 of the 15 conserved CDK phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanines, has strong anti-proliferative effects, even in the presence of high CDK activity, thus imposing a stringent cell cycle block when overexpressed. However, in the Rat1-C5 cells at the permissive temperature (32 °C), pRB-NPC is inactivated due to its binding to the T antigen. Clones stably expressing pRB-NPC were picked and selected for efficient growth arrest at 39 °C. One of the clones tested grew normally at 32 °C but efficiently ceased proliferation at 39 °C (Fig. 1c, clone Rat1-C5.5). The observed decrease in cell proliferation at 39 °C correlated with a marked decrease in protein abundance of the E2F target genes Mcm3 and Cdc2 (Fig. 1b). Retroviral introduction of adenovirus E1A, a viral protein capable of inactivating pRB, allowed some of the cells to continue proliferation at 39 °C (Fig. 1c). The relatively inefficient rescue by E1A of the pRB growth arrest may be due to the induction of apoptosis by E1A. We conclude that, at 39 °C, the Rat1-C5.5 cells enter a robust cell cycle arrest that is dependent on pRB. Next, we infected the Rat1-C5.5 cells at 32 °C with a high complexity retroviral cDNA expression library derived from human brain or a control virus expressing GFP. Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were shifted and selected for colony outgrowth at 39 °C. Several colonies of proliferating cells became visible after 2 weeks in the cDNA library-infected dishes. To determine whether the growing colonies on the library-infected plates were rescued because of a retrovirally encoded cDNA, the colonies were infected with wild-type Moloney virus to recover integrated proviruses (26Jacobs J.J. Keblusek P. Robanus-Maandag E. Kristel P. Lingbeek M. Nederlof P.M. van Welsem T. van de Vijver M.J. Koh E.Y. Daley G.Q. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Two days later, supernatant containing mobilized retroviruses was harvested from the colonies and used to infect fresh Rat1-C5.5 cells. Mobilized virus derived from one of the primary clones yielded a significant number of colonies in second round infection, and these colonies were studied further (not shown). Retrovirally encoded cDNAs were recovered using PCR and identified by DNA sequence analysis (25Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Koh E. Daley G.Q. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All colonies were found to contain a full-length cDNA for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TFE3 (20Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To provide conclusive evidence that TFE3 indeed rescued the pRB-induced proliferation arrest, we recloned the TFE3 cDNA in a retroviral vector and again infected Rat1-C5.5 cells. As shown, TFE3 efficiently rescued the arrest at 39 °C (Fig. 1c). We conclude that TFE3 overexpression renders Rat1 cells insensitive for the growth-inhibitory effects of pRB-NPC. TFE3 Renders Cells Insensitive for p16INK4A and TGF-β— Next, we investigated whether TFE3 could also rescue cells from a growth arrest dependent on endogenous pRB. First, we determined whether TFE3 could prevent growth arrest induced by p16INK4A, as this requires the presence of functional pRB (32Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 33Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To test this, we used a second Rat1-C5 clone that, instead of pRB-NPC, expresses high levels of a p16INK4A-GFP fusion protein. Similar to the Rat1-C5.5 cells, this clone grows normally at 32 °C but ceases proliferation at 39 °C (Fig. 2a). Retroviral transduction of these cells with TFE3 and subsequent selection for colony outgrowth at 39 °C yielded many proliferating colonies expressing p16-GFP, as judged by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2a and data not shown). TFE3 has been implicated in TGF-β signaling by synergizing with SMAD3 and SMAD4 to activate target genes (1Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 34Hua X. Miller Z.A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33205-33208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of this potential TGF-β signal-enhancing role of TFE3 have remained unaddressed. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative action of TGF-β depends on the presence of functional pRB (35Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 36Herrera R.E. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Mal A. Poon R.Y. Howe P.H. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Harter M.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 38Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results also open the possibility that, in addition to enhancing the expression of certain TGF-β target genes, TFE3 might confer resistance to TGF-β signaling. To investigate this, we used MV-1 mink lung epithelial cells, as these cells are exquisitely sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β. MV-1 cells were infected with TFE3-expressing retrovirus or control retrovirus, exposed to TGF-β 2 days post-infection, and proliferation was followed in time. TFE3 conferred strong resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition, whereas proliferation of mock-infected MV-1 cells was efficiently inhibited by TGFβ (Fig. 2, b and c). Similar results were obtained in NMuMG cells and human HaCaT cells, two other TGF-β-sensitive cell lines (data not shown). Together, the results suggest that TFE3 can render cells insensitive to growth-inhibitory signals that depend on endogenous pRB. TFE3 Regulates Cyclin E Expression in an E2F3-dependent Manner—To start to investigate the mechanism whereby TFE3 uncouples cell cycle progression from pRB phosphorylation, we asked whether TFE3 might interfere with the pRB-NPC-mediated repression of specific E2F target genes. We cultured Rat1-C5.5 cells and TFE3-infected derivatives at 32 °C and prepared cell lysates both before and 2 days after shifting to the nonpermissive temperature (39 °C). As expected, temperature shift of control cells caused a significant decrease in the protein abundance of the E2F target genes Cyclin E, Cdc2, and Mcm3, and to a lesser extent Cyclin A (Fig. 3a). Some other targets (PCNA and p107) appeared unaffected under these conditions. Strikingly, in the TFE3-infected cells, Cyclin E levels were significantly increased, even at 32 °C. At 39 °C, expression of Cyclin E was still repressed but remained higher than observed in cycling Rat1-C5.5 cells at 32 °C. This effect was specific for TFE3, because E1A-infected cells did not display elevated levels of Cyclin E (data not shown). Recently, it was shown that TFE3 and E2F3 cooperatively bind to a subset of E2F target genes, thereby synergistically activating transcription (3Giangrande P.H. Zhu W. Rempel R.E. Laakso N. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1336-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Giangrande P.H. Hallstrom T.C. Tunyaplin C. Calame K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3707-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to test whether E2F3 and TFE3 can cooperate to activate the human CYCLIN E promoter. For this purpose, we measured the effects of these two transcription factors on a −363 to +1007 CYCLIN E-promoter-luciferase reporter construct. At the concentrations of expression vector used, TFE3 alone hardly activated the CYCLIN E reporter gene, whereas expression of E2F3 (E2F3A) activated the reporter ∼2-fold (Fig. 3b). Importantly, co-transfection of TFE3 and E2F3 led to a 4-fold activation of the CYCLIN E reporter gene construct, suggesting that TFE3 and E2F3 can indeed cooperate to activate the CYCLIN E promoter. Finally, we investigated whether TFE3 can bind to the Cyclin E promoter in vivo and whether this interaction is dependent on the presence of E2F3. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with TFE3 antibodies, both in cells expressing and lacking E2F3 protein. PCR analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitates from exponentially growing immortalized wild-type MEFs revealed that endogenous TFE3 is bound to the Cyclin E promoter but not to a control promoter (GAPDH). Importantly, the binding of endogenous TFE3 appeared to be dependent on the presence of E2F3, because significantly less TFE3 was bound to the Cyclin E promoter in E2F3−/− cells (Fig. 3c). We conclude that TFE3 enhances Cyclin E expression and that E2F3 is required for endogenous TFE3 binding to the Cyclin E promoter. We have identified here TFE3 as a potent inhibitor of anti-proliferative signals emanating from the p16INK4A-pRB and TGF-β pathways. Although in Rat1 cells, TFE3 conferred resistance to both p16INK4A and pRB-NPC, we were unable to show similar activity in human BJ fibroblasts (data not shown). Nonetheless, TFE3 conferred resistance to TGF-β-induced growth arrest in human and rodent cells, indicating that at least some of the growth-stimulating properties of TFE3 are evolutionarily conserved. Because a TGF-β growth arrest depends on the presence of pRB, it is tempting to speculate that TFE3 confers resistance to TGF-β signaling by interfering with the repression of pRB target genes (35Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 36Herrera R.E.

A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, TFE3 was also shown to synergize with TGF-β in activating certain SMAD target genes, notably the negative feedback protein SMAD7 (34Hua X. Miller Z.A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33205-33208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this suggests that TFE3 can be both an enhancer of TGF-β signaling and an inhibitor of TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest. It was recently found that TFE3 and its close family member, USF1, bind specifically to E2F3, resulting in synergistic activation of certain E2F target promoters (3Giangrande P.H. Zhu W. Rempel R.E. Laakso N. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1336-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Giangrande P.H. Hallstrom T.C. Tunyaplin C. Calame K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3707-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A model was proposed in which adjacent E2F binding sites and E-boxes in a promoter allow the cooperative binding of TFE3/E2F3 dimers, resulting in transcriptional activation. In agreement with a similar role for TFE3 in regulating CYCLIN E transcription, we found that 1) TFE3-overexpressing Rat1 cells express high levels of CYCLIN E, 2) TFE3 and E2F3 synergistically activate a CYCLIN E reporter construct, and 3) endogenous TFE3 binds to the Cyclin E promoter in an E2F3-dependent manner. Possibly, enhanced recruitment of TFE3/E2F3 dimers renders the CYCLIN E promoter relatively resistant to pRB-mediated repression, explaining the resistance to pRB-NPC, p16INK4A, and TGF-β (Fig. 4). Several studies have suggested that CYCLIN E expression can control S-phase entry independently of the pRB phosphorylation status (30Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 39Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of CYCLIN E did not prevent cell cycle arrest by the pRB-NPC mutant used here (31Chew Y.P. Ellis M. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we were unable to override pRB-NPC growth arrest in Rat1-C5.5 cells through ectopic expression of CYCLIN E (data not shown). More likely, TFE3 acts on additional transcriptional targets to render cells insensitive to pRB-dependent inhibitory signals, and some of these targets may be regulated by TFE3/E2F3. Indeed, because TFE3 functions as a co-factor for a number of transcription factors, it is possible that E2F3-independent functions of TFE3 contribute to the bypass of a pRB-induced growth arrest. For instance, TFE3 (but not its close family member USF1) binds to the ETS-1 transcription factor, suggesting a USF1-independent role of TFE3 in the cell cycle (21Tian G. Erman B. Ishii H. Gangopadhyay S.S. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In agreement with a non-redundant function of TFE3 in regulating proliferation, TFE3−/− MEFs display a delay in S-phase entry after serum stimulation. 3P. H. Giangrande and J. R. Nevins, personal communication. The exact mechanisms whereby TFE3 bypasses a pRB-dependent cell cycle arrest are undoubtedly complex and require further investigation (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, this study establishes TFE3 as a protein that can uncouple cell cycle progression from pRB phosphorylation and provides a potential mechanism for its role in tumorigenesis.

The protein comprises four LD domains in its N-terminal half and four LIM domains in its C-terminal half with a nuclear export signal in LD3 and is shuttled between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.

Strikingly, paxillin, the protein most homologous to Hic-5, did not show this capability. Gel filtration analysis also revealed that Hic-5 differs from paxillin in that it has multiple forms in the cellular environment, and Hic-5 but not paxillin was capable of hetero-oligomerization with a LIM-only protein, PINCH, another molecular scaffold at focal adhesions.

Of note, Hic-5 marginally affected the subcellular distribution of PINCH but directed its shuttling between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in the presence of integrin-linked kinase. Uncoupling of the two signaling platforms of Hic-5 and PINCH through interference with the hetero-oligomerization resulted in impairment of cellular growth.

According to genome-wide analyses, it is likely that biological networks make use of a restricted number of modular protein-binding domains, such as Src homology 2 (SH2) 2The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; NES, nuclear export signal; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; aa, amino acids; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; LMB, leptomycin B.2The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; SH3, Src homology 3; NES, nuclear export signal; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; aa, amino acids; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; LMB, leptomycin B., SH3, WD, PDZ, and the ankyrin repeat in a cassette-like fashion to generate complexity. In such biological systems, the so-called scaffolding protein, which possesses multiple modular protein-binding domains, is thought to play an essential role in integrating diverse cellular pathways. Like a hub, it mediates multiple protein-protein interactions simultaneously, thereby assembling multicomponent complexes as well as directing targets to discrete subcellular locations and modulating their activities.The LIM domain, whose designation is derived from the first letter of the founders LIN-11, Isl1, and MEC-3, is one of the modular protein-binding domains found in numerous eukaryotic proteins, consisting of a conserved cysteine/histidine-rich sequence coordinating two zinc ions that organize a double zinc finger structure essential for LIM domain function. As described in the extensive review by Kadrmas et al. (1Kadrmas J.L. Beckerle M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), 135 LIM-encoding sequences are predicted to exist within as many as 58 genes in the human genome. In comparison, sequences for two other protein-binding domains, SH2 and -3, number 115 and 253, respectively. The LIM sequences are often connected with sequences encoding heterologous domains including the homeodomain, catalytic domains, and cytoskeletal-binding domains or other protein-binding modules, such as SH3, PDZ, and LD motifs. The combinations of LIM domains with a variety of these heterologous domains, characterizing individual families of LIM proteins, are the molecular basis for their roles in processes ranging from gene expression and cell adhesion to signal transduction. Among the LIM families, there are some consisting of LIM domains and other modular protein-binding domains and known to function as scaffolding proteins for cellular signaling.Hic (hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone)-5 is one such scaffolding LIM protein belonging to the paxillin family, consisting of four LD domains at its N terminus and four LIM domains at its C terminus (2Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 181-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is primarily located at focal adhesions, serving as a scaffold of integrin signaling through interaction with multiple structural and signaling molecules, such as focal adhesion kinase, PYK2/Cakβ, protein-tyrosine phosphatase PEST, vinculin, the Arf-Gap family protein GIT1, Csk, and PKL (4Thomas S.M. Hagel M. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 181-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nishiya N. Shirai T. Suzuki W. Nose K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, we recently found that Hic-5 shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and identified the nuclear export signal (NES) overlapping with one of the LD motifs at its N terminus (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Besides Hic-5, an increasing number of the LIM domain proteins have been shown to shuttle between the two compartments through a NES, and these proteins are expected to have a role in coordinating cellular activities in both compartments (e.g. the cell adhesion status sensed at focal adhesions with gene transcription in the nucleus) (see Ref. 1Kadrmas J.L. Beckerle M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar and references therein). The NES of Hic-5 is unique in demonstrating oxidant-sensitivity dependent on two particular cysteine residues, which causes the protein to be distributed in the nucleus under oxidative conditions. Thus, another function of Hic-5 has now emerged, that of a molecular scaffold specialized for mediating the redox signaling to the nucleus (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we found that Hic-5 was capable of homo- and hetero-oligomerization, depending on its particular LIM domain, which potentially extends its role as a molecular scaffold quantitatively or qualitatively. Previously, we found that a LIM protein, CRP (cysteine-rich protein), bound Hic-5 (7Kim-Kaneyama J. Suzuki W. Ichikawa K. Ohki T. Kohno Y. Sata M. Nose K. Shibanuma M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 937-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a new partner in the hetero-oligomerization, PINCH (particularly interesting new cysteine and histidine-rich protein), which is another focal adhesion LIM protein that serves as a scaffold coupling integrin signals with those of growth factors (8Wu C. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was identified here. In addition, the hetero-oligomer that formed between Hic-5 and PINCH was suggested to include integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and implicated in the growth control of cells. Most interestingly, the interaction with Hic-5 directed PINCH and CRP, which are primarily located at actin-based structures in the cytoplasm, to move in and out of the nucleus, dependent on the NES of Hic-5. These findings provided evidence of a protein-protein interaction through the LIM module organizing a mobile unit for proteins with dual functions in the cytoplasm and the nucleus to shuttle between the two compartments.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (COS-7, 293FT, MC3T3, and NIH3T3) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.Primary embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from pregnant mice on day 15 of gestation as described previously (9Ishino K. Kim-Kaneyama J. Shibanuma M. Nose K. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 76: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml kanamycin under the same conditions as above. Once confluent, they were passaged at a dilution of 1:8 and used prior to the 10th passage. Leptomycin B was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).Expression Vectors and Transfection—Mammalian expression vectors were all based on pCG-N-BL (HA-tagged) (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3 (FLAG-tagged) (Invitrogen) and are prefixed with pCG- and FLAG-, respectively. The vectors for HA-tagged wild-type proteins (Hic-5, paxillin, PINCH-1, and ILK) used in this study were pCG-LD1mhic-5(Hic-5) (10Nishiya N. Tachibana K. Shibanuma M. Mashimo J.I. Nose K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5332-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), pCG-pax (paxillin) (10Nishiya N. Tachibana K. Shibanuma M. Mashimo J.I. Nose K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5332-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and pCG-PINCH and -ILK generated with a PCR-based method by amplifying the coding sequences using Marathon-ready cDNA of mouse 17-day embryos (BD Biosciences Clontech) as a template and inserting them into the vector. Those for FLAG-tagged versions were FLAG-LD1mhic-5 (Hic-5), FLAG-pax (paxillin) (11Shibanuma M. Mori K. Kim-Kaneyama J. Nose K. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and FLAG-PINCH and -ILK constructed by the same PCR-based method using the pCG-based constructs as templates. FLAG-CRP1, -2, and -3 were created by the PCR-based method with Marathon-ready cDNA of mouse 17-day embryos as a template.The expression vectors for a set of N-terminal truncated mutants of Hic-5 were as follows (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar): pCG-hhic-5 (WT), pCG-delLD1-2hhic-5 (ΔLD1,2), pCG-delLD3-4hhic-5 (ΔLD3,4), pCG-delLD3hhic-5 (ΔLD3), and pCG-hhicLIM (LIM). Those for LIM domain mutants of Hic-5 (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were pCG-LD1mhic-5 (WT), pCG-LD1mhic/mL1/mL2/mL3 (mLIM1, -2, and -3, respectively), pCG-LD1mhic/delL4 (ΔLIM4), and pCG-LD1mhic/delL2,3,4 (ΔLIM2-4). The vector for the NES mutant (HmLD3) of pCG-mhic-5 in which an amino acid in LD3 was substituted to disrupt the NES was described previously (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the nuclear targeted Hic-5, the PCR-amplified nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the SV40 large T antigen was inserted into the vectors for the wild type (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). pCG-only LIM4 (only LIM4) was created by inserting the PCR-amplified LIM4 portion from amino acid 397 to 461 of LD1mhic-5 (10Nishiya N. Tachibana K. Shibanuma M. Mashimo J.I. Nose K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5332-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) into the vector.The LIM-truncated mutants of PINCH-1 were expressed from the vectors on the basis of FLAG-PINCH, including cDNA fragments for the respective portions of PICNCH-1 amplified by PCR instead of the full-length version. The amplified fragments were LIM1-2 (amino acids (aa) 2-140), LIM2-4 (aa 81-262), LIM4-5 (aa 203-337), LIM1-3 (aa 1-207), and ΔLIM5 (aa 2-262).For a series of FLAG-tagged mutants of ILK, the PCR-amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the vector. The fragments for each mutant encoded amino acid residues as follows: Δ kinase (aa 1-167), Δ paxillin-binding subdomain (aa 1-375), and Δ ANK (aa 167-452). ILK273 was created by cutting out enzymatically residues 274-452 of the full-length ILK from FLAG-ILK. To generate E359K, a point mutation was introduced into FLAG-ILK using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with mutated primers according to the manufacturer's instructions.Retroviral expression vectors were based on the vector pMXs-IG (12Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The coding region containing the FLAG tag at the N terminus was excised from the FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 constructs and inserted into the vector. Infection was carried out as described before (7Kim-Kaneyama J. Suzuki W. Ichikawa K. Ohki T. Kohno Y. Sata M. Nose K. Shibanuma M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 937-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).All PCR amplifications were carried out with pfu grade polymerase, and the products were verified by DNA sequencing.The expression vectors were introduced into cells using the conventional calcium phosphate precipitation method (293FT) or with TransIT-LT1 (PanVera, Madison, WI) in the case of COS-7.Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Immunocytochemistry—The monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (12CA5 and Y-11) and the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) were described previously (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to Hic-5, paxillin, PINCH, and ILK were purchased from BD Biosciences. The procedures used for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry were essentially the same as described before (11Shibanuma M. Mori K. Kim-Kaneyama J. Nose K. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Preparation of Recombinant Protein—The procedure used to prepare proteins was essentially the same as described previously (13Nishiya N. Sabe H. Nose K. Shibanuma M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4267-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For full-length Hic-5, the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli transformed with the pET16b vector (Novagen), including the coding sequence of an LD1-null form of mouse hic-5 (2Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pET16b-mhic-5, was induced to produce the protein by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were lysed, and the insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation followed by washing. After solubilizing in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 8 m urea, the fraction was affinity-purified with a HisTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein was renatured by successive dialysis against lysis buffer containing 4, 2, 1, and finally 0 m urea for several hours at 4 °C. The renatured condition was compatible with the DNA binding assay (13Nishiya N. Sabe H. Nose K. Shibanuma M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4267-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the protein was used for cross-linking analysis.For expression of GST-Hic-5 LIM domain fusion proteins, GST-LIM1-4 (containing all four LIM domains) and GST-ΔLIM4 (containing LIM1 to -3 domains), E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with the pGEX-5X-1-based expression vectors described previously (13Nishiya N. Sabe H. Nose K. Shibanuma M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4267-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 h at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm ZnCl2. Extracts were prepared using BugBuster (Novagen) supplemented with 1 mm ZnCl2 and protease inhibitor mixture (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and used as sources of the fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used for pull-down assays or eluted from the beads in elution buffer (20 mm GSH, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and used for cross-linking analyses.Cross-linking Analysis—The protein was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.001-0.01% glutaraldehyde in the lysis buffer (full-length) or the elution buffer (GST fusion) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and further analyzed by Western blotting.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Cells were solubilized in buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and protease inhibitor mixture (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan)) and, after centrifugation, fractionated by gel filtration through a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl HR (fraction range, 1 × 104 to 4 × 106) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated beforehand with loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Elution was carried out at 8 ml/h, and samples were collected in 0.33-ml fractions. The collected fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Molecular weight standards of protein (MW-GF1000; Sigma) were analyzed under the same chromatographic conditions.Immunoelectron Microscopy—Portions of mouse aorta tissue were incubated for more then 3 days in cold 1.84 m sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone. After being cut into small pieces, they were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen at −196 °C. Frozen ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut with a Lica Ultracut R (Vienna, Austria). The sections were picked up on a Formvar-carbon-coated nickel grid, incubated with 2% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm glycin, and allowed to react with 1:500 diluted anti-Hic-5 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) overnight. The sections were washed five times with glycine/phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin and then incubated for 2 h with 10-nm colloidal gold-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (EY Laboratories, Inc.). After being washed again, the sections were postfixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, embedded in polyvinyl socohol, and observed with a Joel JEM-1200 EX II electron microscope (Joel, Tokyo, Japan).In Vitro Translation and Pull-down Assay—In vitro translation was performed from the pcDNA3 plasmids carrying a full-length PINCH and ILK preceded by a T7 promoter with a TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of Transcend biotinylated tRNA (Promega, Madison, WI) in a final volume of 50 μl. For the pull-down assay, 15 μl of in vitro translated product was incubated with GST or GST-LIM1-4 beads (∼2 μg of protein) in 500 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 90 min at 4 °C. After a wash with the binding buffer and then with phosphate-buffered saline, bound PINCH and ILK proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted on a membrane, and detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Growth and BrdUrd Incorporation—The retrovirally infected cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells in 35-mm dishes. The total cell number was counted every day with a hematocytometer until 5 days after seeding. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining.For the incorporation of BrdUrd, the infected cells were serum-starved for 36 h and then stimulated by replacing the medium with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and BrdUrd (1 μg/ml). At 16 h after the stimulation, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature and then processed for immunocytochemistry with a Cell Proliferation Kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSSelf-association of Hic-5—We first addressed the self-association of Hic-5 proteins labeled with two different tags in immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 1A, we co-expressed HA- and FLAG-tagged Hic-5 in COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged Hic-5 with the antibody to the tag and then analyzed the precipitates by Western blotting with the antibody to FLAG. The results clearly showed the presence of FLAG-tagged Hic-5 in the immunocomplex precipitated with the antibody to HA, indicating the ability of Hic-5 to self-associate in cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2H). The population making the complex was estimated to account for less than 10% of the total population based on the intensity of bands. However, this value appeared to be underestimated, since the population in complexes with the same tagged proteins was not represented. Surprisingly, a similar experiment with paxillin, the protein most homologous to Hic-5, revealed neither self-association nor an association with Hic-5 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3H and 4H), underlining the specificity of the self-association of Hic-5 and making it unlikely that the association resulted from overexpression of the protein. We also carried out the experiment with proteins engineered to be localized to the nucleus by adding a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Given that Hic-5 shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleus in cells, a fraction of Hic-5 was expected to be present in the nucleus (6Shibanuma M. Kim-Kaneyama J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, the NLS plus form of Hic-5 self-associated efficiently, even more than the wild type, suggesting the self-association of Hic-5 both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts, a similar self-association was observed (data not shown).Determination of the Domains Responsible for Self-association—To determine the domain mediating the self-association, a set of mutated and deleted forms of Hic-5 was tested for their association with full-length Hic-5 using the same experimental procedure as in Fig. 1. The results shown in Fig. 2, A and B, suggested that the most C-terminal LIM domain, LIM4, was critically involved in the self-association of Hic-5. Furthermore, when isolated, the LIM4 domain had the ability to bind the full-length Hic-5, indicating that LIM4 was not only necessary but also sufficient for the association (Fig. 2C). N-terminal LD domains 1 and 2 also appeared to play a role, although not an essential one, in the association, since their deletion lessened the degree of association (Fig. 1A, lane 1F versus lane 2F). As summarized in Fig. 2D, including observations that are not described here, the results demonstrated the capability of Hic-5 to self-associate through LIM4 in cultured mammalian cells. Of note, despite its overall structural similarity to Hic-5 and high homology in the LIM4 domain at the amino acid level with Hic-5 (4Thomas S.M. Hagel M. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 181-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), paxillin showed no ability to self-associate.FIGURE 2Critical role for LIM4 in the self-association of Hic-5. A-C, the expression vector for FLAG-tagged wild-type Hic-5 was introduced into COS-7 cells with that for HA-tagged mutant Hic-5 and analyzed as in Fig. 1. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (lanes F) or control IgG (lanes C). Then the immunocomplex was analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. The protein structure of the Hic-5 mutants and interaction with the wild-type Hic-5 are schematically represented in D. A, the HA-tagged N-terminal truncated mutants of Hic-5 were expressed as follows. Lane 1, wild-type Hic; lane 2, ΔLD1,2; lane 3, LIM. B, the HA-tagged LIM mutants of Hic-5 were expressed as follows. Lane 1; wild-type Hic; lane 2, mLIM1; lane 3, mLIM2; lane 4, mLIM3; lane 5, ΔLIM4. C, the FLAG-tagged wild-type Hic-5 was expressed with (lane 2) or without (lane 1) the LIM4 domain (only LIM4). Details on the expression vectors are included under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vitro and in Vivo Analysis of Self-association—In further experiments, we investigated the self-association of Hic-5 in vitro. First, to test whether Hic-5 can bind itself directly or not, we carried out cross-linking experiments with affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Full-length (Fig. 3A) and GST-Hic-5 LIM domain fusion proteins (Fig. 3B) produced in E. coli were subjected to cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, and the cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting or silver staining. As seen in Fig. 3A, along with a monomer of about 50 kDa, multimeric species with the molecular masses expected for the dimer, trimer, tetramer, and higher multimeric forms were detected with an increase in the concentration of glutaraldehyde, suggesting that the Hic-5 protein is capable of homo-oligomerization by itself in vitro. Similarly, consistent with the result of domain mapping (Fig. 2), wild-type LIM domains consisting of LIM1-4 fused with GST (GST-LIM1-4) oligomerized, but not those lacking LIM4 (GST-ΔLIM4), even at a more than 6-fold higher concentration than the wild type, supporting homo-oligomerization of Hic-5 mediated through LIM4.FIGURE 3In vitro protein cross-linking, gel filtration, and in vivo immunoelectron microscopic analyses of the oligomeric forms of Hic-5. A and B, the purified recombinant full-length Hic-5 (A) or GST-Hic-5 LIM domain fusion proteins, GST-LIM1-4 (containing all four LIM domains) and GST-ΔLIM4 (containing LIM1-3) (B), were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde as described under “Materials and Methods” and detected by Western blotting (WB) with the anti-Hic-5 antibody (A) or with silver stain (B). The closed arrowheads indicate the monomers (Hic-5 and GST-LIM1-4, ∼50 kDa; GST-ΔLIM4, ∼45 kDa), and the arrows indicate their cross-linked products with molecular weights corresponding to the dimer, trimer, and higher multimers. The open arrowheads show an unrelated E. coli protein. The amount of the protein cross-linked was 2.5 μg/50-μl reaction (A). B, 2 μg (lanes 1 and 2), 7 μg (lanes 3 and 4), and 13 μg (lane 5) of protein/50-μl reaction were cross-linked. C, cells were solubilized in the buffer, and after being cleared by centrifugation, the lysate was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed by Western blotting with the antibodies to HA tag, Hic-5, and paxillin as described under “Materials and Methods.” For exogenous Hic-5, MEF/Tet-Off cells that were induced to express HA-tagged LD1 mhic-5 by removal of doxycyclin for 24 h were used, and for endogenous Hic-5, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used. The arrowheads show the four peaks identifiable in the elution profile. D, an ultrathin section of a mouse aorta was incubated with the anti-Hic-5 (Hic-5) or anti-vinculin (vinculin) monoclonal antibody, labeled with the 10-nm gold-la"
https://openalex.org/W1978453956,"The human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), with three types of subunits present in the ratio of 2α:1β:1γ, requires a divalent metal ion to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate. With the aim of identifying ligands of the enzyme-bound Mn2+, we mutated aspartates on the α, β, or γ subunits. Mutagenesis target sites were based on crystal structures of metal-isocitrate complexes of Escherichia coli and pig mitochondrial NADP-IDH and sequence alignments. Aspartates replaced by asparagine or cysteine were 206, 230, and 234 of the α subunit and those corresponding to α-Asp-206: 217 of the β subunit and 215 of the γ subunit. Each expressed, purified mutant enzyme has two wild-type subunits and one subunit with a single mutation. Specific activities of WT, α-D206N, α-D230C, α-D234C, β-D217N, and γ-D215N enzymes are 22, 29, 1.4, 0.2, 7.3 and 3.7 μmol of NADH/min/mg, respectively, whereas α-D230N and α-D234N enzymes showed no activity. The Km,Mn2+ for α-D230C and γ-D215N are increased 32- and 100-fold, respectively, along with elevations in Km,isocitrate. The Km,NAD of α-D230C is increased 16-fold, whereas that of β-D217N is elevated 10-fold. For all the mutants Km,isocitrate is decreased by ADP, indicating that these aspartates are not needed for normal ADP activation. This study demonstrates that α-Asp-230 and α-Asp-234 are critical for catalytic activity, but α-Asp-206 is not needed; α-Asp-230 and γ-Asp-215 may interact directly with the Mn2+; and α-Asp-230 and β-Asp-217 contribute to the affinity of the enzyme for NAD. These results suggest that the active sites of the human NAD-IDH are shared between α and γ subunits and between α and β subunits. The human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), with three types of subunits present in the ratio of 2α:1β:1γ, requires a divalent metal ion to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate. With the aim of identifying ligands of the enzyme-bound Mn2+, we mutated aspartates on the α, β, or γ subunits. Mutagenesis target sites were based on crystal structures of metal-isocitrate complexes of Escherichia coli and pig mitochondrial NADP-IDH and sequence alignments. Aspartates replaced by asparagine or cysteine were 206, 230, and 234 of the α subunit and those corresponding to α-Asp-206: 217 of the β subunit and 215 of the γ subunit. Each expressed, purified mutant enzyme has two wild-type subunits and one subunit with a single mutation. Specific activities of WT, α-D206N, α-D230C, α-D234C, β-D217N, and γ-D215N enzymes are 22, 29, 1.4, 0.2, 7.3 and 3.7 μmol of NADH/min/mg, respectively, whereas α-D230N and α-D234N enzymes showed no activity. The Km,Mn2+ for α-D230C and γ-D215N are increased 32- and 100-fold, respectively, along with elevations in Km,isocitrate. The Km,NAD of α-D230C is increased 16-fold, whereas that of β-D217N is elevated 10-fold. For all the mutants Km,isocitrate is decreased by ADP, indicating that these aspartates are not needed for normal ADP activation. This study demonstrates that α-Asp-230 and α-Asp-234 are critical for catalytic activity, but α-Asp-206 is not needed; α-Asp-230 and γ-Asp-215 may interact directly with the Mn2+; and α-Asp-230 and β-Asp-217 contribute to the affinity of the enzyme for NAD. These results suggest that the active sites of the human NAD-IDH are shared between α and γ subunits and between α and β subunits. Mammalian NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (threo-Ds-isocitrate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.41) is a citric acid cycle enzyme that catalyzes the metal-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to form α-ketoglutarate and CO2. This allosteric mitochondrial enzyme is regulated by ADP (1Cohen P.F. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1501-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a hetero-oligomeric structure with subunits, present in the ratio 2α:1β: 1γ, of molecular masses 37,000, 39,000, and 39,000 Da, respectively, and distinctive isoelectric points (2Ehrlich R.S.

Chem. 1980; 255: 8859-8864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work on pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase showed that this enzyme has two binding sites per tetramer for each of its ligands: isocitrate, Mn2+, NAD, ADP, NADH, and NADPH (4Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4769-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These binding studies either indicate that these distinctive subunits have specialized functions for particular ligand sites or that the binding site for each ligand is shared between two subunits (4Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4769-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three types of subunits of the pig heart enzyme can be separated by chromato-focusing in the presence of urea (6Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7079-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated α, β, and γ subunits are either inactive or exhibit very low activity, but recombination of isolated α with either β or γ results in formation of either αβ or αγ, which have substantial catalytic activity (6Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7079-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that dimers may be the minimal functional subunits. The active site may be either within the α-subunits or shared between α and β or between α and γ subunits. No structure of an NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase has yet been determined. However, the crystal structure of NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli (7Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M.

Asp-252, -275, and -279 are either direct ligands of the Mn2+ or interact through a water molecule (10Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas in the E. coli enzyme, Asp-283, -307, and -311 are similarly located (7Hurley J.H. Dean A.M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9310-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison of the three subunits of the human NAD-IDH enzyme with the subunits of the pig mitochondrial and E. coli NADP enzymes using ClustalW indicates relatively low sequence identity. However, certain amino acids in the E. coli and pig mitochondrial NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenases that are known to interact with Mn2+ and isocitrate are conserved among the three subunits of the human NAD-IDH. We have previously reported on the roles of three conserved arginines of the NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment in the region of the metal ligands of the pig mitochondrial and E. coli NADP-IDHs. Although there is relatively low homology among these enzymes, the α-subunit Asp-206, -230, and -234 of the human NAD-IDH can be aligned with Asp-252, -275, and -279 of the pig mitochondrial NADP-IDH as well as with Asp-283, -307, and -311 of the E. coli NADP-IDH. In addition, the β subunit Asp-217 and γ subunit Asp-215 are comparable with Asp-252 of the pig NADP-IDH and Asp-283 of the E. coli enzyme. In the present study, in order to evaluate their roles in the human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in the binding of metal ion, in catalytic activity, and in ADP activation, we have mutated Asp-206, -230, and -234 of the α subunit, Asp-217 of the β subunit, and Asp-215 of the γ subunit. Each aspartate was separately replaced by neutral asparagine and/or cysteine. Enzyme containing one mutant subunit and two wild-type subunits was expressed in E. coli to yield complete enzyme with subunits in the ratio 2α:1β:1γ. Here, we describe the characteristics of these complete enzymes that harbor a single mutation in one subunit. Materials—Ammonium sulfate, citric acid, rotenone, adenosine-5′-diphosphate, β-NAD, dl-isocitrate (trisodium salt), triethanolamine chloride, Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R, dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), ampicillin (monosodium salt), MES, and PIPES were obtained from Sigma. Cadmium sulfate, cobalt nitrate, magnesium sulfate, manganese sulfate, SDS, acrylamide/bisacrylamide, yeast extract, tryptone, isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, Tris base, and other high grade chemicals were purchased from Fisher. Ultrafiltration membranes (YM-10; 25- and 62-mm diameter), as well as large centrifugal devices (Ultra-15 and YM-10) were from Millipore Corp. Glycine was obtained from Bio-Rad. DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) and cellulose phosphate were bought from Whatman International. Ultragel (ACA 34) gel filtration resin was from LKB Co. The QuikChangeXL site-directed mutagenesis kit and E. coli XL 10 Gold ultracompetent cells were purchased from Stratagene Inc. Low molecular weight standard proteins were from Amersham Biosciences and QIA Prep Spin miniprep kits were purchased from Qiagen Co. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The complete recombinant human NAD-dependent IDH was expressed in E. coli XL Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene) using the plasmid pHIDHαβ2γ (7.0 kbp) (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using a PCR-based protocol in accordance with the XL QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), point mutations were introduced into a single subunit, while maintaining the other two subunits as wild type in the plasmid (pHIDHαβ2γ). Appropriate changes in time and temperature for denaturation, annealing, and polymerization were made to the standard PCR protocol for low melting point primers in order to maximize the product yield. The oligonucleotide primers (and their complements) used to generate mutant enzymes were as follows: αD206N-F (5′-GAGATGTACCTTAATACAGTATGTTTG), αD230N-F (5′-CCAAATTTGTATGGAAACATCCTTAGTGACTTG), αD230C-F (5′-CCAAATTTGTATGGATGCATCCTTAGTGACTTG), αD234N-F (5′-GGAGACATCCTTAGTAACTTGTGTGCAGGATTG), αD234C-F (5′-GGAGACATCCTTAGTTGCTTGTGTGCAGGATTG), βD217N-F (5′-GACAATGATCATAAACAACTGCTGCATGCAGC), and γD215N-F (5′-CGAGAACATGATTGTGAATAACACCACCATGC). The underlined codons are those mutated from aspartate to asparagine or cysteine. The primer, βT4S-F (5′-GCATCGCGGAGCCAGGCCGAGGACG), and its complement were used to change the amino acid threonine to serine at the 4th position from the N terminus in the β subunit of the plasmid, pHIDHαβ2γ. This change was made to correct the amino acid sequence of the wild-type enzyme, since threonine had mistakenly been substituted in that position in the β subunit during plasmid construction (13Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In each case, the occurrence of the desired mutation or change in the subunit sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing in both directions (DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Center, University of Delaware). DNA sequencing of the other two subunits in the plasmid was also conducted to ensure that undesired mutations were not introduced into those subunits intended to be wild type. This precaution was followed because of the similarity in the α, β, and γ subunit amino acid sequences. Transformation and Expression of Recombinant Human IDH Proteins in E. coli—Wild type or mutant plasmid DNA from the PCR was used to transform E. coli XL 10 Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). The colonies with positive inserts were subcultured by growing overnight at 37 °C in LB medium (250 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). These E. coli XL 10 Gold cell transformants harboring pHIDHαβ2γ plasmid were used to express human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase instead of the IDH-deficient E. coli EB 106 (DE 3) cells used in our previous work (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), because the yield of the pure recombinant IDH was greater. (In our earlier study, each point mutation was introduced into the cDNA encoding a single subunit, and the plasmid encoding the complete enzyme was subsequently and laboriously assembled from the separate DNA plasmids encoding one mutant subunit and two wild-type subunits (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).) To express the enzyme, five 6-liter flasks, each containing 2 liters of LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, were inoculated with freshly grown E. coli XL cells (2% v/v) and were grown at 37 °C while being shaken at 200-220 rpm for 4 h or until the growth reached a midlog phase or cell density of A600 nm = 0.4-0.6. The flasks were then placed temporarily in chilled water to lower the culture temperature to room temperature. Protein expression was induced in cells by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the flasks were shaken at the lower speed of 100-140 rpm with minimal aeration at 23-25 °C for 20-22 h. (Incubation at the lower temperatures of 15 and 20 °C did not improve the yield of expressed proteins.) The 10 liters of cell culture was then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min to separate the cells from media and suspended in a total volume of 250 ml of cold 11 mm citrate-Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. These suspensions were stored at -80 °C. Frozen cells, ∼80-100 ml at a time, were partially thawed and lysed, using sonication conditions described previously, while keeping the preparation in ice (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the clear supernatant (crude extract) was separated. The protein concentration and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity were determined in this crude extract. Purification of Recombinant IDHs from the Crude Extract— The isolation and purification of enzymes from the crude extract was modified from the previous procedure (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike IDH-deficient E. coli EB 106 cells, the E. coli XL cells used in this study possess constitutive NADP-dependent IDH enzyme in addition to the recombinant human NAD-dependent IDH enzyme. Since the human NAD-IDH and the E. coli NADP-IDH exhibit very different isoelectric points and have different molecular sizes under native conditions, they can be differentially precipitated from the crude extract by ammonium sulfate fractionation; in addition, they are bound and eluted from ion exchange resins under different conditions. The human NAD-IDH was further purified to homogeneity by gel filtration. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was followed as described previously (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to isolate NAD-IDH from the crude extract. The NAD-IDH precipitates predominantly between 30 and 50% saturated ammonium sulfate; this fraction was pooled and further purified. The protein precipitate was dissolved in 12 mm citrate-Tris buffer, pH 7.7, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer A) and dialyzed against 6 liters of Buffer A with three changes, for 6 h each. The enzyme was applied to a DE-52 column (3 × 13 cm), which had previously been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was eluted with the same buffer until the A280 nm reached the base line. A linear gradient was then started from 200 ml of buffer A to 200 ml of 50 mm citrate-Tris buffer, pH 7.7, containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT. The NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase typically elutes between 150 and 230 ml of the gradient. In contrast, the E. coli NADP-dependent IDH elutes later, from about 230 ml to the end of the gradient. Fractions (5 ml each) exhibiting specific activities more than 5-6.0 units/mg (wild type) were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 ml by ultrafiltration. The pool was dialyzed with three changes, against 6 liters of 12 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.7, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer B). To facilitate NAD-IDH binding to the cation exchange resin, MnSO4 was not added to the dialysis or to the elution buffers. Some loss of IDH activity occurred at this step. The dialyzed enzyme was applied to a cellulose phosphate cation exchange column (2.5 × 11.0 cm). The column was washed with ∼125 ml of Buffer B until the A280 nm reached the base line. The traces of NADP-IDH carried over from the DE-52 column eluted in the wash, since E. coli IDH does not bind to cellulose phosphate under these conditions. A linear gradient, consisting of 100 ml of Buffer B and 100 ml of 0.15 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.7, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm DTT, was used to elute the NAD-IDH. The enzyme elutes between 75 and 150 ml of the gradient. Fractions of 5.0 ml were collected in tubes containing MnSO4 (final concentration, 2 mm) to maintain enzyme stability. Aliquots of fractions showing high specific activity were screened by SDS-PAGE. Generally, the fractions containing the NAD-IDH exhibit the presence of two minor impurities with subunit molecular sizes of 90 and 45 kDa. These were pooled and concentrated to a 1-1.5-ml volume. After dialyzing this pool against 4 liters of 50 mm citrate-Tris, pH 7.2, buffer containing 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm DTT (Buffer C) for 6 h, the enzyme was separated from the other proteins by elution through an Ultragel ACA 34 (molecular mass cut-off 350 kDa) gel filtration column (1.0 × 124 cm). The proteins were eluted using Buffer C at the rate of 7.0-7.5 ml/h, and ∼1.0-ml volume fractions were collected. Three distinct proteins were observed, with the NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase being eluted as the middle peak. Protein fractions that were homogenous on SDS-PAGE and exhibited high specific activity for NAD-IDH were pooled and used for characterization and kinetic studies. Pure mammalian NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase was recognized by the appearance of two close bands in approximately equal intensity, with an upper band (β and γ subunits) of 39,000 Da and a lower band of 37,000 Da (α subunits) (3Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8859-8864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein Determination and Assay for NAD and NADP-dependent IDH Activity—In the early stages of protein purification from the crude extract, the protein concentration was determined from the A280 nm after correcting for the ratio of A280/A260 (15Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1941; 310: 384-387Google Scholar). In the pure preparations, the protein concentrations in mg/ml were calculated using E280 nm1&percent; = 6.45 (4Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring at 340 nm the time-dependent increase in UV absorbance of NADH produced by reduction of NAD at 25 °C in a 1-ml standard assay mixture containing 33 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mm dl-isocitrate, 1 mm MnSO4,and1 mm NAD as the final concentrations. The specific activity was expressed as μmol/min/mg of protein. To minimize interference from NADH oxidase while assaying for IDH activity in crude preparations or ammonium sulfate fractions containing lower amounts of expressed mutant enzymes, the NADH oxidase inhibitor, 10 μl of rotenone (dissolved in 100% ethanol), was added to the 1 ml of standard assay solution to give a final concentration of 2.5 μm rotenone. Since the normal E. coli cells have NADP-dependent IDH at the early steps of purification (ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography), enzyme samples were also assayed for NADP-dependent IDH. The NADP-IDH activity was determined at 25 °C by monitoring the increase in UV absorption of NADPH at A340 nm in a 1-ml assay mixture containing 30 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 7.4, buffer, 0.1 mm NADP+, 4 mm dl-isocitrate, and 2 mm MnSO4. SDS-PAGE—Aliquots of fractions containing 10 μg of protein were analyzed in 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS in a discontinuous pH electrophoresis system (16Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) to evaluate the purity of the protein samples during purification. The solutions for preparing the stacking and resolving gel, protein staining and destaining, and other electrophoresis conditions were described previously (17Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD of Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—To evaluate the secondary structure of wild-type and mutant enzymes, the ellipticity was measured as a function of wavelength between 250 and 200 nm in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell using a Jasco model J-710 spectropolarimeter. The wild-type and mutant proteins were dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and 0.2 mm MnSO4, and the same buffer was used to dilute the enzymes to 0.1 mg/ml. The mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (degrees cm2 dmol-1), and molar concentrations of proteins were determined using average subunit molecular weights and number of residues per subunit, as described before (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Determination of Amino Acid Sequence and Subunit Composition of Enzymes—The α, β, and γ subunits of recombinant NAD-IDH enzymes were identified by comparing their N-terminal sequences with those of the known sequences of the enzyme subunits (13Kim Y.O. Koh H.J. Kim S.H. Jo S.H. Huh J.W. Jeong K.S. Lee I.J. Song B.J. Huh T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36866-36875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Kim Y.O. Park H.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of wild type and mutant enzymes were determined using an Applied Biosystems protein/peptide sequencer (model Procise) equipped with an online Microgradient Delivery System (model 140 C) and a Macintosh computer (model 610). Since the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the α, β, and γ subunits are different, the subunit composition of wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined from the molar ratios of amino acids at positions 1, 6, and 7 upon sequencing the whole protein. Alternatively, to confirm the mutant subunit ratios of the enzymes, they were also determined from the SDS denatured subunits separated by a reverse phase column in HPLC and compared with those of wild-type enzyme, as described before (11Soundar S. Park J.H. Huh T.L. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52146-52153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten Constants for Isocitrate, Metal Ions, and Coenzyme of Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—To determine the Km, the concentration of coenzyme, dl-isocitrate, or metal ion was varied while the other substrates were maintained at the standard assay concentration. To determine the Km,Mn2+, 1.0-20.0 mm MnSO4 for αD230C, up to 25 mm Mn2+ for αD215N, and 0.1-7.0 mm MnSO4 for all other enzymes were used, whereas to measure the Km,Cd2+, 0.05-20 mm CdSO4 was used. The Km,NAD was determined for αD230C by using 1.0-10.0 mm NAD with 60 mm isocitrate and 20 mm MnSO4, whereas for other enzymes, 0.01-1.0 mm NAD was used under the standard conditions. For the Km determination for isocitrate, under the standard conditions, the dl-isocitrate concentration varied between 0.05 and 20 mm. For the Km,isocitrate determination of αD230C and γD215N, concentrations up to 50 or 60 mm isocitrate and 20 or 25 mm Mn2+, respectively, were included in the standard assay mixture. In general for ADP activation studies, 1 mm ADP was included while varying the isocitrate concentration under the standard conditions. For αD230C, 3.0 mm ADP and 20.0 mm MnSO4, whereas for γD215N, 5 mm ADP and 25 mm Mn2+, were included in the standard assay mixture with various isocitrate concentrations up to 20 and 60 mm, respectively. Effect of Various Metal Ions on the pKa of the Wild-type Human NAD-IDH—For determination of the pH-Vmax profile, the enzyme activity of the wild type was measured at various pH values using the following buffers: sodium acetate, pH 4.4-5.8; MES, pH 5.4-6.6; PIPES, pH 6.2-7.4; and triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 6.8-7.6. The final buffer concentration was 30 mm in 1 ml of standard assay solution. The metal ions were present at the following concentrations: MnSO4 (1 or 2 mm), Co(NO3)2 (5 or 10 mm), and MgSO4 (5 and 10 mm) in the 1-ml assay solutions in order to saturate the enzyme with metal ion over the entire pH range. At the lower metal ion concentrations, 20 mm isocitrate and 1 mm NAD were used in the assay, whereas 40 mm isocitrate and 2 mm NAD were used with the higher metal ion concentration. The results were the same with the two sets of substrate concentrations, indicating that the enzyme was saturated with respect to substrates. The dependence of the observed Vmax on pH was analyzed in accordance with the equation, Vmax.obs=Vmax.int/[1+H+/Kaes](Eq. 1) Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Human NAD-IDHs—Here, for the first time, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the complete plasmid harboring human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase using the PCR-based QuikChange mutagenesis method. We have successfully replaced aspartates with asparagine or cysteine at positions 206, 230, and 234 in the α subunit, 217 in β subunit, or 215 in γ subunit. Each point mutation was accomplished in the target subunit without affecting the other subunits, as demonstrated by DNA sequencing of all subunits. The wild type or mutant plasmid DNA resulting from PCR was transformed into E. coli XL Gold competent cells (Stratagene), and cells with positive inserts were used to express the recombinant enzymes.

We have provided here an example showing that the presence of the TMD is compulsory for the productive folding pathway of a membrane-anchored glycoprotein.

They recruit calnexin to monitor their productive folding pathway characterized by the post-translational formation of buried disulfides. Lacking calnexin assistance, the truncated mutant is arrested in an unstable conformation bearing exposed disulfides.

Properly folded proteins achieve an export-competent conformation by folding and refolding in the presence of the chaper-one lectins calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) and exit the ER (1Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Not only the ectodomain of a polypeptide is regulated by this ER quality control but also the folding and assembly of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the lipid bilayer (2Swanton E. High S. Woodman P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2948-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Cannon K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, little is known of the role of the TMD in the folding process of the protein ectodomain. Is the TMD only a structural element required simply to anchor the protein to the membrane or does it also play an active role in the early events during folding within the ER?To answer this question we took as a model tyrosinase a type I membrane glycoprotein whose maturation in the presence of the ER quality control has been well documented (4Petrescu S.M.

Tyrosinase has 533 amino acids, 7 occupied N-glycosylation sites, 17 cysteine residues grouped in 2 cysteine-rich domains, 2 copper binding domains, and 1 C-terminal TMD (8Hearing V.J. Vieira W.D. Law L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase folds in the ER and is transported to the trans Golgi network where two copper ions are incorporated (4Petrescu S.M. Branza-Nichita N. Negroiu G. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5229-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). From here it continues its journey to the melanosomes where it initiates the melanin synthesis. This protein is a melanoma antigen and an important target for anti-melanoma vaccine therapies. Hence, understanding the role of the molecular determinants of tyrosinase for its processing is important for the design of therapeutic approaches based on tyrosinase mutants that are good candidates for the efficient production of antigenic peptides. It has been reported that a truncated tyrosinase mutant, lacking the TMD and cytoplasmic tail, is retained in the ER by calreticulin and BiP and degraded by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (9Berson J.F.

We found that unlike soluble tyrosinase, tyrosinase chimeras tethered to the membrane either by a GPI anchor or by a variety of other TMDs acquire a transport-competent state and exit the ER. Productive folding is associated with calnexin binding, which is restored for all membrane-anchored tyrosinases. The role of the TMD is to enable a proper calnexin interaction that determines a productive folding pathway of tyrosinase.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, UK). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 mg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Rabbit anti-calnexin antiserum was a kind gift from Dr. J. J. Bergeron (McGill University, Canada).

The framework for all tyrosinase chimeras was the pTriEx-1.1-ST construct obtained as previously described (10Popescu C.I. Paduraru C. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13833-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by cloning soluble tyrosinase in-frame with the 8 histidines of pTriEx-1.1(Novagen EMD Biosciences). The different transmembrane domains were amplified by PCR (High Expand Polymerase kit; Roche Applied Science) using the primers and templates listed in Table 1. A XhoI restriction site was introduced at the 5′-end and BglII and XhoI restriction sites at the 3′-end (New England Biolabs). The PCR products were cloned in pGem-T-Easy vector (Promega), digested with XhoI, and cloned in the XhoI site of pTriex-1.1_ST. BglII digestion was used to determine the orientation of the cloned fragment. This resulted in the creation of three constructs, pTriEx-1.1-ST_Mu (Table 1, P5, P6), pTriEx-1.1-ST_E2 (Table 1, P7, P8) and pTriEx-1.1-ST_GPI (Table 1, P3, P4).TABLE 1List of primers used in this reportNameSequence 5′ −3′P1.

The mutagenic primer (Table 1, P1) mutates Cys-500 to a STOP codon. The selection primer mutates the unique restriction site SfuI (ATTTAAAT) to SwaI (TTCGAA) restriction site. ST_405 was cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His A (Invitrogen) in BamHI/XhoI restriction sites using the primers P9 and P10. All primers are listed in Table 1.Transfection of Cells and Metabolic Labeling—Constructs were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. Semiconfluent cells (50–60% confluency) 24 h post-seeding in 6-well dishes were used to transiently express tyrosinase cDNAs (3 mg of DNA/well) using polyethylenimine (PEI) solution (1 mg/ml, pH 8) (6 μl of PEI/well). Cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection. For metabolic labeling, transfected cells (∼3 × 106 cells) were starved in the cysteine-/methionine-free medium for 1 h, pulse labeled with 100–150 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5 or 20 min, and chased for the times specified. Immediately after the chase, cells were harvested in cold PBS. Cells were then lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2% CHAPS, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5% protease inhibitor mixture containing leupeptin, aprotinin, sodium EDTA, bestatin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, and E-64) for 1 h on ice. In some experiments, 5 mm DTT was added to the cell culture medium at the end of the chase period. After 5 min cells were harvested in PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to alkylate the free SH groups and then lysed as described above.Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—35S-labeled cell lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were incubated with T311 antibodies (1:50) overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose and further incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was washed three times with 0.5% CHAPS in HEPES buffer. Tyrosinase was eluted by boiling the slurry for 5 min in SDS sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. In some experiments, tyrosinase was eluted from protein A with 1% SDS and the protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, i.e. in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Chaperone co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (10Popescu C.I. Paduraru C. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13833-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin, and the washed slurry was eluted with 1% SDS, diluted ten times with lysis buffer, and reprecipitated with T311 antibodies. The bound proteins were eluted in reducing conditions and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were visualized by autoradiography. Relevant bands were quantified by scanning densitometry.Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were plated on cover-slips and transfected with different constructs using the methods specified above. After 24 h the cells were rinsed with PBS and either fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature or fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. After washing three times in PBS, cells were incubated with the primary antibody, T311 (1:250), diluted in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS they were further incubated with the appropriate Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells washed three times with PBS were mounted on coverslips in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E 600 fluorescent microscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software.RESULTSConstructs—To address the requirements for membrane tethering in the folding and maturation of soluble tyrosinase, tyrosinase chimeras in which the ectodomain is attached to the membrane were designed. A number of hydrophobic membrane insertion sequences and a GPI anchor were used (Fig. 1). The first construct, pTriEx-1.1-ST_TM, was a tyrosinase mutant including the ectodomain and the tyrosinase TMD but lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Two soluble tyrosinases were designed, pTriEx-1.1-ST, truncated at the 474 codon (10Popescu C.I. Paduraru C. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13833-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and pcDNA3.1-ST_405, truncated upstream at codon 405. In the next construct, pTriEx-1.1-ST_Mu, the tyrosinase TMD was replaced with the TMD of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase Mu (RPTPaseMu), which is known to localize to the plasma membrane (11Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1603-1612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another construct (pTriEx-1.1-ST_E2) was designed in which the ectodomain was attached to the TMD of the HCV E2 protein, which was reported to contain ER retention signals (12Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-21891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a GPI-anchored construct (pTriEx1.1-ST_GPI) was designed in which the ectodomain was fused with a GPI anchor.The TMD Is Sufficient to Restore Calnexin Interaction and ER Export of Truncated Tyrosinase—To determine whether the TMD alone is sufficient to maintain tyrosinase in a transport-competent state, we constructed a tyrosinase truncation mutant, ST_TM, consisting of the ectodomain and the TMD and lacking the cytoplasmic domain. HEK293 cells were transfected with the pTriEX1.1-ST_TM construct and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2A). Wild-type tyrosinase and soluble tyrosinase transfected in the same cell line were used as controls. As seen in Fig. 2A, complex or hybrid N-glycans were identified in the Endo H digests, indicating that the ST_TM tyrosinase mutant exits the ER and travels through the Golgi. Complex N-glycans were found in the control wild-type tyrosinase and were absent in soluble tyrosinase (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2The cytosolic tail of tyrosinase is not required for its ER export. A, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pTriEx_WT, pTriEx_ST, pTriexST_TM. Cell lysates were divided in half, and the two pools were digested (+) or not (–) with Endo H and subjected to reducing 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-tyrosinase antibodies. Shown is one of at least three representative experiments. res, the Endo H-resistant, secreted form; sens, the high mannose ER-retained form. B, transfected cells (as in panel A) were either fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) or fixed and permeabilized with methanol and processed for anti-tyrosinase immunofluorescence as described under “Materials and Methods.” ST_TM is exported out of the ER and reaches the plasma membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm their passage through the secretory pathway, the localization of the mutant and wild-type tyrosinases was compared in an immunofluorescence experiment. Transfected HEK293 cells were either fixed with PFA or permeabilized with methanol and stained with anti-tyrosinase antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2B, ST_TM localized to the plasma membrane in nonpermeabilized cells. This is a consequence of the signal deletion in the cytoplasmic tail that normally targets WT tyrosinase to late endosomal compartments (13Sprong H. Degroote S. Claessens T. van Drunen J. Oorschot V. Westerink B.H. Hirabayashi Y. Klumperman J. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. . 2001; 155: 369-380Google Scholar). In contrast, WT staining in PFA-fixed cells was less pronounced, in agreement with its predominant intracellular localization (Fig. 2B). ST was considered a negative control for plasma membrane localization due to its predominant ER localization.To analyze whether the absence of the cytoplasmic tail would have an adverse effect on the interaction of ST_TM with calnexin, the association of ST_TM, WT, and ST with the ER chaperone calnexin in transfected cells was investigated by pulsechase and co-immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin and anti-tyrosinase antibodies (Fig. 3A). Although soluble tyrosinase interacts very poorly with calnexin, both wild-type and ST_TM tyrosinase associated with the lectin chaperone (Fig. 3A). The interactions had similar kinetics with a half-life of 30 min and a gradual decrease during the chase (Fig. 3B). Further, we checked whether the association with calnexin was due to the specific binding to the monoglucosylated N-glycans by performing a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in the presence of N-butyl-deoxinojirimycin, which abolishes the interaction of CNX with the N-glycans. As seen in Fig. 3C, a 95% decrease in the association of calnexin with WT and ST_TM was noticed under these conditions. As expected, ST did not bind calnexin in the presence of NB-DNJ either.FIGURE 3The TMD restores calnexin interaction of truncated tyrosinase. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pTriEx_WT, pTriEx_ST, pTriex_ST_TM. A, to determine the association of WT, ST, and ST_TM with chaperones, pulse-chased transfected cells were sequentially immunoprecipitated with antibodies to calnexin and tyrosinase. The chaperone-associated tyrosinases were re-immunoprecipitated from the first immunoprecipitation complexes with anti-tyrosinase antibody. To determine the total amount of tyrosinases, the unbound proteins were precipitated from the final supernatant with anti-tyrosinase antibodies. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. B, levels of the chaperone associated with WT and ST_TM (WT-CNX and ST_TM-CNX) were determined by densitometry and expressed as percentage of the total tyrosinase value/chase point. Values indicate the mean of two independent experiments. C, the double immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated in the presence of 5 mm N-butyl-deoxinojirimycin as in panel A for the 0 chase point only. The ST_TM interaction with calnexin was used as a positive control. D, HEK293 cells transfected with ST_405 were analyzed as in Fig. 2A for Endo H sensitivity and as in Fig. 3A for calnexin association. ST-sens, the high mannose ER-retained ST. Whereas WT and ST_TM associate with calnexin, ST and ST_405 show very faint co-immunoprecipitation bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the location of the truncation site could affect the properties of the tyrosinase ectodomain, another soluble mutant, ST_405, truncated at the codon 405, situated downstream the second copper domain, was analyzed. We found that similar to the ST that was truncated in the vicinity of the TMD, ST_405 was expressed as a high mannose polypeptide chain unable to associate with calnexin (Fig. 3D). Although ST_405 was expressed using a different vector, pcDNA3.1, there was no difference in the expression levels of the two soluble constructs. Because both soluble tyrosinases do not interact with calnexin and are retained in the ER, the position of the truncation site is not responsible for the tyrosinase ectodomain folding.Taken together, these data show that the calnexin interaction is unaltered by the C-terminal deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of tyrosinase. This indicates that the addition of the tyrosinase TMD to the soluble ectodomain restores the association with calnexin. The lack of the calnexin interaction in the presence of a glucosidase I and II inhibitor (N-butyldeoxinojirimycin) suggests that the interaction is entirely lectin based. Moreover, the cytoplasmic tail is required not for tyrosinase secretion from the ER but for correct targeting to late endosomal compartments.Kinetics of Disulfide Bond Formation Differ between Wild-type and Soluble Tyrosinase—Next, we studied the effects of preventing the interaction with calnexin on the conformation of the ectodomain. The differences between the folding pathways of membrane-bound and soluble tyrosinase were examined by assessing the accessibility of disulfide bonds to DTT. HEK cells were transfected with either pTriEx-1.1-WT or pTriEx-1.1-ST. The transfected cells were pulsed for 8 min, chased for 1 and 12 min, and incubated or not with 5 mm DTT before harvesting (Fig. 4). This DTT concentration has been shown before to cleave only exposed disulfide bridges found on incompletely folded chains, whereas folded polypeptides were unaffected (26Negroiu G. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32200-32207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Pelleted cells were alkylated with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to prevent further oxidation and folding, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with the T311 antibody. As seen in Fig. 4A, at 0 min chase, both WT and ST run as a main band (WT-ox and ST-ox) with a slightly faster migration in non-reducing than in reducing conditions (WT-red and ST-red). This migration velocity does not change for either of the two tyrosinases during the chase, indicating that folding occurs in the first 8 min of pulse. Interestingly, in non-reducing conditions we could identify aggregates and possibly oligomers of WT and ST that are linked by interchain disulfide bridges, because they disappear in reducing conditions.FIGURE 4WT and ST disulfide bond formation follows different kinetics. A, HEK cells were transfected with pTriEx_WT, pTriEx_ST. 24 h post-transfection, HEK293 cells were pulsed for 5 min and chased for 0, 1, and 12 min. Cell lysates were precipitated with T311 antibody and resolved by non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The presence of aggregates is marked at the top of the gel. Red, reduced forms; ox, oxidized forms. B, same as described for panel A except that at the end of the chase cells were incubated for 5 min with 5 mm DTT. Immunoprecipitated samples were run in non-reducing conditions. C, same as described for panel B except that reducing and non-reducing samples were run on the same gel. DTT-sens, DTT-sensitive form; DTT-res, DTT-resistant form. Shown is one of at least three independent experiments. WT folding pathway occurs through at least two intermediates, whereas ST folding is arrested in a DTT-sensitive conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As seen in Fig. 4B, a different pattern is observed when the WT samples were treated with DTT. Whereas a slower migrating band (DTT-sensitive) predominates at 0 and 1 min chase, a faster migrating band (DTT-resistant) prevails at 12 min chase. There is a gradual increase in the appearance of the DTT-resistant intermediate in the first 20 min of synthesis, which indicates the formation of inaccessible, buried disulfide bridges. The conformation of the DTT-resistant tyrosinase is more compact than the one of the DTT-sensitive form, hence it migrates faster in non-reducing gels. In contrast to WT migrating with a mobility that increases during the chase period, the same migration pattern is maintained throughout the chase period of the ST (Fig. 4B).To determine whether these ST intermediates are sensitive to DTT, we have run the treated samples in reducing and non-reducing conditions on the same gel (Fig. 4C). Because at 0 min chase point the DTT-treated sample migrates with a similar velocity in non-reducing and in reducing conditions, ST intermediates appear to be DTT sensitive. WT tyrosinase treated with DTT migrates with the same velocity as the reduced tyrosinase at 0 chase time and with faster mobility at 12 min chase (Fig. 4C), confirming the data from Fig. 4B. Unlike WT tyrosinase, the soluble form follows a different folding pathway characterized by the formation of intermediates in which the S–S bonds are always solvent accessible. In the absence of calnexin, the protein is driven into an unproductive folding pathway characterized by disturbed kinetics of S–S bond formation.Based on the assumption that folded proteins are stabilized by disulfide bridges that are buried once the protein folds into the native structure, soluble tyrosinase is a protein with a nonnative conformation characterized by disulfide bridges susceptible to low concentrations of reducing agents. Hence, the experiments characterizing the in vivo DTT sensitivity of WT and ST have shown that in the absence of the TM domain, the ectodomain of tyrosinase is unable to acquire a stable conformation.The Productive Maturation of Tyrosinase Is Independent of the TMD Amino Acid Sequence—The results obtained so far established that in the absence of the TMD the ectodomain is unable to interact with calnexin, leading to unproductive folding that results in an incompletely folded protein. Next, the potential impact of the composition and length of the transmembrane anchor on the maturation of the tyrosinase ectodomain was investigated. As described above, tyrosinase chimeras with the lumenal domain of tyrosinase and the TM domain of RPTPaseMu (ST_Mu) or of the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (ST_E2) were constructed (Fig. 1). Because the cytoplasmic tail is not involved in the ER maturation process, the constructs are devoided of this domain. Endo H digestion of transfected cells showed that ST_Mu acquired Endo H-resistant glycans consistent with the exit of ST_Mu from the ER (Fig. 5A). Because the TMD of the E2 protein contains ER retention signals, the ST_E2 chimera was kept within the ER, as shown by its Endo H pattern. The subcellular localization investigated by immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that ST_Mu reached the plasma membrane whereas ST_E2 was retained in intracellular membranes (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5The TMD composition is not relevant for tyrosinase maturation and calnexin interaction. A, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pTriExST_Mu, pTriExST_E2. Cell lysates were divided in half; the two pools were digested (+) or not (–) with Endo H, run in reducing 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-tyrosinase antibodies. Shown is one of at least three representative experiments. B, 24 h post-transfection, the cells were prepared for anti-tyrosinase immunofluorescence. PFA-treated cells show the plasma membrane and perinuclear localization of ST_Mu and the perinuclear localization of ST_E2. C, to determine the association of ST_Mu and ST_E2 with chaperones, pulse-chased transfected cells were sequentially immunoprecipitated with antibodies to CNX and tyrosinase. The chaperone-associated tyrosinases were re-immunoprecipitated from the first immunoprecipitation complexes with anti-tyrosinase antibody. To determine the total amount of tyrosinase, the unbound proteins were precipitated from the final supernatant with anti-tyrosinase antibodies. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). D, levels of the chaperone associated with ST_Mu and ST_E2 (ST_Mu-CNX and ST_E2-CNX) were determined by densitometry and expressed as a percentage of the total tyrosinase value/chase point. Values indicate the mean of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The calnexin co-immunoprecipitation of the two mutants in pulse-chased cells revealed patterns of association similar to those of WT and ST_TM (Fig. 5C).

https://openalex.org/W2101156268,"Phosphorylation of both small molecules and proteins plays a central role in many biological processes. In proteins, phosphorylation most commonly targets the oxygen atoms of Ser, Thr, and Tyr. In contrast, stably phosphorylated His residues are rarely found, due to the lability of the N-P bond, and histidine phosphorylation features most often in transient processes. Here we present the crystal structure of a protein of previously unknown function, which proves to contain a stably phosphorylated histidine residue. The protein is the product of open reading frame PAE2307, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, and is representative of a highly conserved protein family found in archaea and bacteria. The crystal structure of PAE2307, solved at 1.45-Å resolution (R = 0.208, Rfree = 0.227), forms a remarkably tightly associated hexamer. The phosphorylated histidine at the proposed active site, pHis85, occupies a cavity that is at the interface between two subunits and contains a number of fully conserved residues. Stable phosphorylation is attributed to favorable hydrogen bonding of the phosphoryl group and a salt bridge with pHis85 that provides electronic stabilization. In silico modeling suggested that the protein may function as an adenosine kinase, a conclusion that is supported by in vitro assays of adenosine binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy, and crystallographic visualization of an adenosine complex of PAE2307 at 2.25-Å resolution.

Phosphorylation of appropriate functional groups provides one of the key mechanistic devices in biology. Thus, phosphoryl transfer reactions involving molecules such as ATP and GTP, and the phosphorylation state of small molecule substrates, are critical to many enzyme reactions. Likewise, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of amino acid side chains in proteins forms the basis of many signaling and regulatory processes. The most common targets are the -OH groups of amino acid side chains such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine and small molecules such as sugars. In part this reflects the ubiquitous occurrence of such groups, but it also depends on the relative stability of the O-P bond to hydrolysis, which gives long-lived phosphorylation.In contrast, the phosphorylation of nitrogen atoms, with the formation of N-P bonds, is not often observed (1Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In proteins, the phosphorylation of histidine residues produces a phosphoramidate bond that has a large standard free energy of hydrolysis. This makes phosphohistidines the most unstable of any known phosphoamino acid (2Matthews H.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and favors the utilization of histidine in rapid processes involving transient phosphorylation. Examples include the use of phosphohistidines as enzyme intermediates, as in the mechanisms of succinyl-CoA synthetase (3Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (4Morera S. Chiadmi M. LeBras G. Lascu I. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or for rapid signaling processes such as the two-component systems of bacteria (5Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In the latter, a sensor is connected to a regulator through histidine phosphorylation and a subsequent phosphotransfer to an aspartate residue.Another well characterized system, the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), 4The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; PAE2307, protein product of open reading frame 2307 from the P. aerophilum genome; ORF, open reading frame; pHis, phosphorylated histidine; EI and EII, Enzymes I and II; r.m.s., root mean square.4The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; PAE2307, protein product of open reading frame 2307 from the P. aerophilum genome; ORF, open reading frame; pHis, phosphorylated histidine; EI and EII, Enzymes I and II; r.m.s., root mean square. consists of proteins that carry out four successive phosphoryl transfers until the final phosphorylation of the sugar, concomitant with transport into the cell across the bacterial cell membrane (7Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the PTS, Enzyme I (EI) first autophosphorylates, using phosphoenolpyruvate as a substrate, and then transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine-containing protein. Subsequently the phosphoryl group is transferred to the sugar-specific Enzymes II (EIIA and EIIB), which can consist of multisubunit enzymes or separate proteins. Each of four proteins, EI, histidine-containing protein, EIIA, and EIIB, is transiently phosphorylated at a histidine residue, except certain EIIBs, which instead can be phosphorylated at a cysteine residue. During the phosphotransfer in the PTS, the phosphoryl group, commencing with the Nϵ2 atom on EI, alternates between being bound on the Nϵ2 atom of a histidine residue of one component and the Nδ1 atom of a histidine of the next component (8Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The characteristic instability of phosphorylated histidines means that only a few examples have been defined structurally. The structure of the phosphohistidine form of histidine-containing protein has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (9van Nuland N.A. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but none of the phosphohistidine forms of the PTS proteins have been elucidated by x-ray crystallography. The structures of phosphohistidine intermediates have been determined crystallographically for three enzymes, succinyl-CoA synthetase (3Fraser M.E. James M.N. Bridger W.A. Wolodko W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1325-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), nucleoside diphosphate kinase (4Morera S. Chiadmi M. LeBras G. Lascu I. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and a cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (10Bond C.S. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3247-3253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From these, it is clear that phosphohistidine residues can be stabilized in certain environments. Indeed, in histone H4, a phosphohistidine (at residue 75) has been shown to have a half-life of 12 days at room temperature and pH 7.6 (11Kim Y. Pesis K.H. Matthews H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1268: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Here we describe the crystal structure of a functionally uncharacterized protein, PAE2307, which has been discovered to contain a stably phosphorylated histidine residue. This protein was selected as a target in a pilot structural genomics enterprise, focused on open reading frames (ORFs) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (12Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which were annotated as unknowns and for which no functional or structural predictions could be made based on amino acid sequence. PAE2307 is a representative of a conserved family of proteins found in both archaeal and bacterial species, which has been described as an “ancient conserved domain” (13Tatusov R.L. Natale D.A. Garkavtsev I.V. Tatusova T.A. Shankavaram U.T. Rao B.S. Kiryutin B. Galperin M.Y. Fedorova N.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) and presumably has an evolutionarily distant origin, prior to the divergence of the bacteria and the archaea. The high level of conservation in this family suggests some important but previously uncharacterized biological function (14Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mulder N.J. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The discovery of a phosphorylated histidine strongly suggests that PAE2307 is involved in a phosphotransfer reaction common to both bacteria and archaea and enables us to analyze the structural features that contribute to stable histidine phosphorylation. Additionally, bioinformatic evidence coupled with weak structural similarity to a thermostable DNA polymerase suggests that nucleotides or nucleosides are the most likely substrate for the phosphorylation reaction thought to be catalyzed by PAE2307. In silico modeling identified a binding site for adenosine that places the C5′-hydroxyl group of ribose adjacent to the phosphorylated histidine, suggesting that the protein may function as a nucleoside kinase. This model is supported by in vitro measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy and the visualization by x-ray crystallography of the adenosine-bound form of the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESORF Selection—ORFs that were annotated as “unknown” in the preliminary annotation of the P. aerophilum genome (12Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) were selected as an initial target set. These ORFs were then screened for putative trans-membrane helices using DAS (16Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TMHMM (17Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8882) Google Scholar). PSI-BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) searches using the ORFs that lacked predicted transmembrane helices were manually inspected, and those with any significant similarity to characterized genes were removed. Finally, the remaining ORFs were passed through a fold prediction algorithm (19Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11929-11934Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and those that gave a Z-score of >5 were removed. The remaining ORFs were considered ‘true’ unknowns and were selected for further study.Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—PAE2307 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, using the expression vector pET28, and was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography as described (20Lott J.S. Banfield M.J. Sigrell J. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2242-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The expression vector adds an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, which was used for purification, but was not cleaved, and therefore remained on the protein during subsequent studies. Native PAE2307 crystals were initially obtained in two crystal forms, only one of which was suitable for x-ray analysis (20Lott J.S. Banfield M.J. Sigrell J. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2242-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This crystal form was grown from an unbuffered solution of 50 mm KH2PO4 containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, and proved to be tetragonal, space group I4122, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 120.0, c = 156.5 Å and three copies of the protein monomer in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffracted to 1.45-Å resolution, and they were used for the native structure determination but were not reproducible. For subsequent ligand soaking experiments, a third crystal form (Type III) was obtained by mixing protein solution (6.8 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) in a 1:1 ratio with mother liquor (21% (w/v) methoxypolyethylene glycol 5000, 0.2 m N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-3-amino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid/KOH, pH 8.3) and incubating in a sitting-drop experiment at 18 °C. Thick, plate-like crystals appeared after 3 days and reached their maximum size after 14 days. These crystals proved to be orthorhombic, space group P212121, a = 76.9, b = 109.8, c = 112.5 Å, with six molecules in the asymmetric unit.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement— The structure of native apoPAE2307 was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing from a platinum derivative, as described previously (20Lott J.S. Banfield M.J. Sigrell J. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2242-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Manual building using O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) into a map calculated from experimental phases to 2.1 Å yielded a partial model, which was refined against a 1.45-Å resolution native data set, collected at 110 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (beamline 9-2, Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum 4 detector, wavelength 0.9792 Å). The data statistics are in Table 1. A single round of simulated annealing using CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) reduced the Rfree from 53.3% to 43.4%, and subsequent automatic model building using ARP/wARP (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) resulted in an almost complete amino acid chain for all protomers. Two further rounds of model building using O, interspersed with simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual atomic B-factor refinement using CNS, resulted in a final model comprising residues 5-167 of monomers A and B, and residues 6-167 of monomer C, with Rcryst = 20.8% and Rfree = 22.1%. No density was found for the N-terminal His tag on any of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit. Full refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK (24Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 90.8% of all residues fall in the most favored regions, and only two residues per monomer, Ala26 and Phe28, are in disallowed regions; both are adjacent to the active site, and both have unambiguous electron density.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsApoPAE2307Adenosine complexData collectionSpace groupI4122P212121Cell dimensions (Å)a = b = 120.0, c = 156.5a = 76.9, b = 109.8, c = 112.5Resolution range (Å)50–1.45 (1.50–1.45)56.25–2.25 (2.37–2.25)No. measured reflections785,088182,021No. unique reflections100,41445,062Data completeness (%)100.0 (99.9)98.4 (94.6)Mean I/σ(I)43.0 (5.7)15.5 (4.6)Rmerge (%)4.2 (34.7)7.1 (23.8)RefinementResolution range (Å)38.0–1.4545.4–2.25No. reflections89,112/9,90042,785/2,273Rcryst/Rfree (%)20.8/22.118.2/24.1Non-hydrogen atoms refinedProtein (average B)3,856 (14.7)7,688 (24.3)Adenosine (average B)124 (32.7)Phosphate (average B)5 (10.1)10 (43.6)Water (average B)278 (21.9)407 (31.2)r.m.s. deviations from idealityBonds (Å)0.0060.014Angles (°)1.51.5 Open table in a new tab The complex with adenosine was obtained by soaking a Type III native crystal in a series of cryoprotectant solutions, which consisted of mother liquor containing 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% glycerol, and which were all saturated with adenosine. Adenosine was poorly soluble in the mother liquor, but its concentration was estimated to be at least 250 μm. The crystal was then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data were collected at 110 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble (beamline ID-29, wavelength 0.9793 Å). The data were processed with MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (25CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project No. 4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar), giving a full data set to 2.25 Å (Table 1). The structure of the adenosine complex was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar), using the 1.45-Å native structure as search model. Refinement was with REF-MAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Vagin A.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar), with manual rebuilding achieved by using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). Clear electron density for a bound adenosine molecule was found in the putative active sites of each of the six molecules in the asymmetric unit; these were modeled in and refined with full occupancy. The final structure comprises residues 5-167 of molecules A, B, D, and E, and 6-167 of molecules C and F; six adenosine molecules; two phosphate ions; and 407 water molecules. Final values of Rcryst and Rfree were 18.2% and 24.1%, respectively (see Table 1 for full details).Crystallographic Verification of His85 Phosphorylation in ApoPAE2307—The first electron density maps of the I4122 crystal form strongly suggested that His85 was phosphorylated in each of the three protomers. The initial refinement, in which this residue was modeled as an unmodified histidine, returned B-factors for His85 and the associated Asp139 that were consistent and similar: 10-14 Å2 and 13-15 Å2, respectively, for protomer A, 12-15 Å2 and 11-13 Å2 for protomer B, and 11-13 Å2 and 14-15 Å2 for protomer C. Difference maps after this refinement showed unequivocal electron density for phosphoryl groups attached to each histidine, at levels of 4σ,2σ, and 4σ, respectively, for monomers A, B, and C, and with P-Nϵ2 (His) distances of 1.7-1.8 Å. Phosphoryl groups were then added to each His85 side chain, at full occupancy, and a further round of refinement was carried out. The B-factors for the three phosphoryl groups were all in the range 20-23 Å2, slightly higher than the values for the non-hydrogen atoms of the side chains, which remained at 12-17 Å2. However, difference maps showed some negative density around the phosphorus atoms, so a round of grouped occupancy refinement was performed for the histidine phosphate groups, which lowered the occupancy of the phosphate groups to 0.74 for protomer A, 0.60 for protomer B, and 0.67 for protomer C. These values were retained in further rounds of refinement.In Silico Docking Experiments—The structures of potential ligands at the highest resolution available were obtained from the HIC-Up data base (29Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and were energy-minimized and converted to MOL2 format using the PRODRG server (30Schuettelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). In silico ligand binding was performed using the program GOLD (31Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Spectroscopic experiments were performed on an Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, with excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm, and a scan speed of 240 nm/min. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 nm and 347 nm, respectively, were used for all samples, using a quartz cuvette with 0.5-cm path length. Analysis by mass spectrometry gave a mass of 20,674 Da, compared with 20,675 Da expected for the full-length His-tagged protein minus its N-terminal Met residue. This showed that the protein used in these assays was homogeneous and not phosphorylated. Protein (5 μm) and ligands (0.5-500 μm) were each dissolved in a buffer solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl at pH 8.0. The data were corrected for inner filter effects using a correction factor as described by Eftink (32Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The true protein fluorescence intensity was determined by subtracting the buffer fluorescence intensity from the sample fluorescence intensity, and multiplying by the correction factor (C) for that particular sample, where C = 10((ΔAex/2)+(ΔAem/2)), ΔAex is the absorbance change due to substrate at the excitation wavelength, and ΔAem is the absorbance change due to substrate at the emission wavelength. Ligand binding data were fitted using SigmaPlot v9.01 (Systat Software Inc.) using a one-site saturation model: ΔF = ((ΔFmax·[Ligand])/(KD + [Ligand])), where ΔF is the normalized change in fluorescence compared with a solution of 5 μm protein alone, ΔFmax is the maximum normalized change in fluorescence at saturation, KD is the dissociation constant, and [Ligand] is the concentration of ligand.RESULTSProtein Sequence Analysis—A PSI-BLAST query of the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base (release date: December 15, 2005), with the PAE2307 sequence, shows convergence after three iterations (using an E-value cutoff of 0.05) to produce a set of protein sequences derived from 42 distinct species. The proteins form a discrete family of well conserved sequences, all of which are at least 35% identical to each other in amino acid sequence. The members of this protein family are drawn equally from archaeal species (18 examples) and bacterial species (24 examples). They cover a broad phylogenetic range, including representatives from the crenarchaeota, euryarchaeota, α, β, and δ proteobacteria, thermotogae, actinobacteria, Deinococci, and cyanobacteria. However, the family contains no eukaryotic members. A multiple sequence alignment of a phylogenetically diverse selection of these protein sequences is shown in Fig. 1. The multiple sequence alignment reveals 24 residues that are absolutely conserved, including the phosphorylated histidine and several other residues that surround the putative active site. This protein family is classified in the Pfam and Interpro databases as protein of unknown function DUF355 (Pfam accession number PF04008; Interpro accession number IPR007153) and is annotated with the comment that “The high level of conservation in this family suggests some as yet unknown important biological function.” The genomic context of the PAE2307 gene is uninformative, because it does not sit in an obvious operon and is flanked in the genome by poorly characterized ORFs, which are annotated as a putative resistance protein and putative transcriptional regulator. There is also no clear synteny, as the context of orthologs in other species is variable.Overall Fold of PAE2307—The PAE2307 monomer (Fig. 2a) is folded into a single domain with an extended C-terminal arm, culminating in an α-helix, residues 148-162, that plays a major role in oligomerization. The monomer folds around a central five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, comprising (in order) strands β6-β2-β5-β3-β4 (Fig. 2b). On one face of this sheet are packed two α-helices, α1 (residues 28-42) and α3 (residues 99-105). The other face is covered by a third helix α2 (residues 67-82) and a second, three-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet, comprising strands β1, β7, and β8. The phosphorylated histidine, pHis85, described later, is found at the start of β5, the central strand of the main β-sheet, in a cavity bounded by loops from two adjacent monomers. A striking feature of the structure, possibly related to protein thermostability, given that it is derived from a hyperthermophilic organism, is the large number of charged side chains (7 Asp, 13 Glu, 13 Lys, 10 Arg in 167 residues; 25% overall), which give rise to many salt bridges (Table 2). Eleven intramolecular salt bridges are found, and a further eight help to stabilize the quaternary structure (see below). Also notable are two internal cysteine residues that are close enough to form a disulfide bond (inter-sulfur distance = 3.8 Å) but in the present structure do not do so.FIGURE 2Structure of PAE2307. a, ribbon diagram of the PAE2307 monomer colored blue to red from N to C termini, with secondary structure elements labeled.

Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that PAE2307 has a particle size of 123 ± 10 kDa in solution, consistent with a hexameric species. The trimer is formed by the three monomers of the crystal asymmetric unit, with the hexamer being completed by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry. At the center of the trimer, the outer strands (β8; residues 131-140) of the small β-sheet from each of the three monomers face each other around the 3-fold axis. Taking molecule A as the reference, residues 131-135 run antiparallel to 136-140 of molecule B and residues 136-140 run antiparallel to 131-135 of molecule C. Many hydrophobic side chains pack between these three small β-sheets to give stability to the trimer.Residues 139-144 of molecule A continue on to make extensive inter-subunit contacts, passing through a cleft made by the β3-β4 and the β7-β8 loops from subunit C, with a salt bridge (Arg59-Glu130) completing the encirclement of the peptide as it passes between them. Residues 144-147 from molecule A then run parallel to residues 59-63 of molecule C, making a number of hydrogen bonds, both main chain and side chain; Arg62 and Gl"

Subunit RIC1 of the inner membrane RNA import complex is a bi-functional protein that is identical to the α-subunit of F1F0 ATP synthase and specifically binds to a subset (Type I) of importable tRNAs. We show that recombinant, purified RIC1 is a Type I tRNA-dependent ATP hydrolase. The activity was insensitive to oligomycin, sensitive to mutations within the import signal of the tRNA, and required the cooperative interaction between the ATP-binding and C-terminal domains of RIC1. The ATPase activity of the intact complex was inhibited by anti-RIC1 antibody, while knockdown of RIC1 in Leishmania tropica resulted in deficiency of the tRNA-dependent ATPase activity of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, RIC1 knockdown extracts failed to generate a membrane potential across reconstituted proteoliposomes, as shown by a rhodamine 123 uptake assay, but activity was restored by adding back purified RIC1. These observations identify RIC1 as a novel form of the F1 ATP synthase α-subunit that acts as the major energy transducer for tRNA import.

A unique feature of kinetoplastid protozoa such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma is that their mitochondrial genome does not contain any tRNA genes; to carry out mitochondrial translation, nucleus-encoded tRNAs are imported from the cytoplasm (1Simpson A.M.

Studies using RIC-reconstituted phospholipid vesicles have shown that tRNA specifically stimulates a RIC-associated ATPase and the generation of an electrochemical potential across the membrane (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The molecular identities of the factors mediating these bioenergetic transactions are unknown. Recently, we have identified an essential subunit of the complex, RIC1, to be a bi-functional form of the α-subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In common with the ubiquitously conserved F1α-subunit, RIC1 has a three-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal β-barrel, a central ATP-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain but differs from the canonical structure in having an extension at the C terminus. Moreover, it specifically binds to a subset of importable tRNAs (Type I) and positively regulates the import of a second subset (Type II) (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G.

In the present study, we present evidence demonstrating that RIC1/F1α is a novel tRNA-dependent ATPase that is responsible for generating the trans-membrane potential that drives import.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Mitochondria and Purificaton of RIC—Mitochondria were prepared from L. tropica strain UR6 and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were obtained by digitonin treatment and inner membrane fractions by repeated freeze-thaw of mitoplasts, as described previously (10Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RIC was purified by RNA affinity chromatography from mitochondrial inner membrane extracts (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction, depleted of RIC but retaining Complex V, was used as the source of F1 ATPase.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of RIC1—RIC1 gene fragments were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, excised with thrombin, and gel-eluted in SDS-containing buffer, as described (14Goswami S.

Prior to enzymatic or other assays, the recombinant protein was refolded by diluting 20-fold into TETN250 buffer (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol.

Liposomes (50 μg lipid) were reconstituted with RIC (100 ng) or concentrated mitochondrial extract (derived from ∼100 μg of mitochondrial fraction) in the absence or presence of 8 ng of recombinant RIC1, in 20 μl of liposome suspension buffer (12Bhattacharyya S.N.

After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 1 μl of each reaction was analyzed by polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC as described previously (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol.

Wherever indicated, liposomes were preincubated with inhibitors at 4 °C for 15 min. The proteoliposome suspension was mixed with an equal volume of isotonic sucrose (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) containing 20% glycerol and observed and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S.

The mean fluorescence intensity per particle was calculated as the product of the average intensity in stained particles times the fraction of particles staining above background.RESULTSRIC1 Is a tRNA-dependent ATPase—To test the ATPase activity of RIC1, the purified recombinant protein, containing the ATP-binding and C-terminal domains (RIC1 (109–574); see Fig. 1F) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of a tRNA co-factor and hydrolysis monitored by thin layer chromatography. In the presence of three of the six tRNAs tested (tRNATyr, tRNATrp, and tRNAArg) ATP was hydrolyzed, but the other three tRNAs (tRNAIle, tRNAVal, tRNAMet-e) were ineffective (Fig. 1A). The former group is classified as Type I and the latter group as Type II (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, RIC1 is a Type I tRNA-dependent ATPase, in keeping with its known ability to bind this group of tRNAs (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Rate curves (Fig. 1B) indicated that the apparent KtRNA(Tyr)m for ATP hydrolysis by purified RIC1 was 0.25 nm. This is somewhat less than the corresponding value 0.98 nm for ATP hydrolysis by intact RIC (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), implying the presence of inhibitory influences on the RIC1-tRNA interaction within the complex. On the other hand, KATPm of RIC1 was 1.275 mm, similar to the corresponding value of 1.32 mm for the complex (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The tRNATyr-stimulated ATPase activity of RIC was completely inhibited by preincubating the complex with anti-RIC1 antibody but not with non-immune serum (Fig. 1C), indicating that RIC1 is the sole tRNA-dependent ATP hydrolyzing subunit of the complex.The D-arm of tRNATyr (Fig. 1D) contains an import signal (11Bhattacharyya S.N. Mukherjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7410-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and interacts directly with RIC1 (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An oligoribonucleotide containing the wild-type D-arm sequence could efficiently stimulate the ATPase activity (Fig. 1E), with an apparent Km of 0.45 nm, 4S. Goswami and S. Adhya, unpublished data. close to the value of 0.25 nm (see above) for the intact tRNA. A G22→ C mutation at the loop-closing position (Fig. 1D) resulted in loss of co-factor activity (Fig. 1E), while restoration of the base pair in the double mutant G22→ C, C13→ G led to recovery of activity (Fig. 1E). Since the single mutant is defective for import through the inner membrane, while the double mutant is imported (11Bhattacharyya S.N. Mukherjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7410-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this result suggests a direct link between ATP hydrolysis and interaction of RIC1 with the import signal.The tRNA binding activity of RIC1 involves the cooperative interaction of the ATP-binding and the C-terminal domains (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When the individual domains were expressed and tested for ATPase activity, both were found to be inactive, whereas in combination, activity was restored (Fig. 1F). The N-terminal domain did not have any effect on the activity.4Oligomycin is a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase (or ATPase), and Leishmania mitochondria contain such an oligomycin-sensitive activity (17Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Das A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The RIC1 ATPase activity was resistant to oligomycin (Fig. 1G). In contrast, a mitochondrial extract depleted of RIC, but retaining the F1F0 ATPase, had oligomycin-sensitive activity (Fig. 1G). RIC1 is thus distinct from the F1F0 ATPase.ATPase Activity in RIC1 Knockdown Cells—Inducible antisense-mediated knockdown of RIC1 in transgenic Leishmania promastigotes renders the cells non-viable by shutting down mitochondrial translation through impairment of tRNA import into the mitochondria (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of RIC1 deficiency on the tRNA dependent ATPase, inner mitochondrial membrane fractions were assayed in presence of oligomycin to block the activity of the F1F0 enzyme. While inner membranes from uninduced (i.e. normal) cells had tRNATyr-dependent ATPase (∼50 pmol min–1 μg–1) no significant activity was detectable in knockdown cells (Fig. 2) indicating that RIC1 is the major, if not the sole, such enzyme in the inner membrane.FIGURE 2ATPase activity in RIC1 knockdown cells.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Rhodamine 123 was previously shown to be taken up by isolated Leishmania mitochondria in presence of ATP (10Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and into RIC-reconstituted liposomes in presence of tRNA and ATP (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of RIC1 in the generation of membrane potential, liposomes were reconstituted with mitochondrial extracts from RIC1 knockdown cells and assayed for uptake of rhodamine 123. In control experiments, about 81% of the vesicles reconstituted with extracts from un-induced (normal) cells were stained with rhodamine 123 (Fig. 3B). There was virtually no uptake by liposomes reconstituted with RIC1-deficient extracts (Fig. 3C), but uptake occurred if the knockdown extracts were supplemented with purified RIC1 (Fig. 3D). RIC1 could not be replaced by unrelated proteins such as bovine serum albumin, and RIC1 in the absence of mitochondrial extract had no activity.4 Uptake required tRNA and ATP; ATP could not be replaced by AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolysable analogue (Fig. 3, E and F). Moreover, uptake of rhodamine 123 was abolished by the protonophore uncoupler m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone and by oligomycin (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that RIC1, through hydrolysis of ATP, is required for the pumping of protons and generation of membrane potential. Since the ATPase is resistant to oligomycin, whereas rhodamine uptake is sensitive, the generation of the proton gradient must follow ATP hydrolysis and may involve other RIC components.FIGURE 3Role of RIC1 in uptake of rhodamine 123 by proteoliposomes.

RIC1/F1α contains the conserved Walker A (P loop) and Walker B motifs that constitute ATP-binding sites in the α- and β-subunits of the F1 sector (20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). However, in common with α-subunits from other species, RIC1 lacks a second motif, GERXXE, that is present on β-subunits and contributes to ATP hydrolysis (20Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). For this reason, the canonical α-subunit has ATP binding but no hydrolytic activity; it is believed to play a regulatory role during ATP synthesis. Thus, the enzymatic activity of RIC1/F1α may be brought about by conformation changes resulting from the cooperative interaction between the ATP-binding domain, the C-terminal domain, and the D domain of tRNA. The situation is reminiscent of the bacterial transcription terminator protein rho, an RNA-dependent ATPase that has the α-type ATP-binding domain (21Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).RIC1/F1α is the product of a single gene and is shared between the RNA import complex and respiratory F1F0 ATP synthase (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), implying a bi-functional role in ATP synthesis and tRNA import. The evolution of the new import function in this ancient protein may have been brought about by the incorporation of tRNA-binding sites, ATP hydrolytic activity, and novel protein-protein interaction motifs, enabling the alternative assembly of the same protein into two different macromolecular complexes without disruption of either function. A unique feature of kinetoplastid protozoa such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma is that their mitochondrial genome does not contain any tRNA genes; to carry out mitochondrial translation, nucleus-encoded tRNAs are imported from the cytoplasm (1Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19203-19215Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In other organisms such as higher plants and yeast, variable numbers of tRNAs are imported (reviewed in Ref. 3Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous in vitro studies using isolated mitochondria from Leishmania, Trypanosoma, yeast, and higher plants showed that tRNA import is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (4Tarrasov I. Entelis N.S.

Investigations into the role of ATP have been facilitated by the isolation of a functional multiprotein RNA import complex (RIC) 3The abbreviation used is: RIC, RNA import complex. 3The abbreviation used is: RIC, RNA import complex. from the inner membrane of Leishmania tropica mitochondria (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies using RIC-reconstituted phospholipid vesicles have shown that tRNA specifically stimulates a RIC-associated ATPase and the generation of an electrochemical potential across the membrane (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The molecular identities of the factors mediating these bioenergetic transactions are unknown. Recently, we have identified an essential subunit of the complex, RIC1, to be a bi-functional form of the α-subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In common with the ubiquitously conserved F1α-subunit, RIC1 has a three-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal β-barrel, a central ATP-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain but differs from the canonical structure in having an extension at the C terminus. Moreover, it specifically binds to a subset of importable tRNAs (Type I) and positively regulates the import of a second subset (Type II) (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The tRNA binding activity of the protein requires both the ATP-binding domain and the C-terminal domain (14Goswami S. Dhar G. Mukherjee S. Mahata B. Chatterjee S. Home P. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence demonstrating that RIC1/F1α is a novel tRNA-dependent ATPase that is responsible for generating the trans-membrane potential that drives import. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Mitochondria and Purificaton of RIC—Mitochondria were prepared from L. tropica strain UR6 and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (15Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were obtained by digitonin treatment and inner membrane fractions by repeated freeze-thaw of mitoplasts, as described previously (10Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RIC was purified by RNA affinity chromatography from mitochondrial inner membrane extracts (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction, depleted of RIC but retaining Complex V, was used as the source of F1 ATPase.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of RIC1—RIC1 gene fragments were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, excised with thrombin, and gel-eluted in SDS-containing buffer, as described (14Goswami S.

We recently reported that BRCA1 inhibits RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation by TFIIH and decreases serine 5 phosphorylation levels when introduced into a BRCA1-/- cell line. Regulation of CTD phosphorylation is crucial for proper gene expression and response to cellular stresses, such as DNA damage and transcription arrest. A key player in this process, P-TEFb, phosphorylates the CTD on serine 2 of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II, and its kinase activity was shown to be up-regulated when cells are exposed to transcriptional stress such as UV irradiation. Here, we investigate the effect of BRCA1 on serine 2 phosphorylation and UV-activated P-TEFb kinase activity. We now show that BRCA1 inhibits immunoprecipitated P-TEFb kinase activity from UV-irradiated cells and preferentially decreases UV-induced serine 2 phosphorylation of soluble, rather than chromatin-bound, RNAPII. We further show that BRCA1 rescues the UV-mediated inhibition of transcriptional activity from nuclear extracts and stimulates endogenous p21 gene expression upon UV irradiation, a function that is dependent of the inhibition of CTD kinase activity. Our results suggest that BRCA1 could act as a CTD kinase inhibitor and, as such, contribute to the regulation of p21 gene expression.

Mutations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) account for ∼45% of reported cases of hereditary breast cancer. The BRCA1 protein acts as a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. BRCA1 achieves this function by integrating important cellular processes, such as regulation of gene expression, the DNA damage response, and cell cycle control (1Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1107-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, BRCA1 can positively modulate the expression of the p21 (2Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Wu G.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25647-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BRCA1 has also been shown to down-regulate the transcriptional activity elicited by the c-Myc proto-oncogene (7Li H. Lee T.H. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20965-20973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), as well as by ER-α (8Zheng L. Annab L.A. Afshari C.A. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9587-9592Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Importantly, BRCA1 co-purifies with a form of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) holoenzyme by interacting with RNA helicase A (9Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Nakajima T. Wolpin E.S. Parvin J.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) or by directly contacting the RPB2 and RPB10α subunits of core RNAPII (10Schlegel B.P. Green V.J. Ladias J.A. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a biochemical study proposed that following replication blockage by hydroxyurea treatment, a fraction of RNAPII holoenzyme-bound BRCA1 shifts to a new complex that contains BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1) (11Chiba N. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38549-38554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a previous finding that showed that BRCA1 is phosphorylated and relocalized from its nuclear foci to sites of DNA damage after treatment with UV light, hydroxyurea, or γ-irradiations (12Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report revealed that the association of BRCA1 with processive RNAPII is abrogated when cells are subjected to various DNA-damaging agents (13Krum S.A. Miranda G.A. Lin C. Lane T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52012-52020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The RNAPII carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) 3The abbreviations used are: CTD, COOH-terminal region; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; shRNA, short-hairpin RNA. 3The abbreviations used are: CTD, COOH-terminal region; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; RT, reverse transcription; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; shRNA, short-hairpin RNA. constitutes an important integrator of gene expression regulation, DNA damage response, and cell cycle control. Indeed, the CTD becomes highly phosphorylated during progression through the transcription cycle, after exposure to certain genotoxic agents, or when cells undergo mitosis (14Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The CTD is highly conserved in all eukaryotes and consists, in mammals, of 52 repeats bearing the consensus heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS. RNAPII can be found in two different forms relative to its CTD phosphorylation status and electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE, which are the hypophosphorylated (IIa) and the hyperphosphorylated (IIo) forms. RNAPIIa is mainly found in solution and is the polymerase form that is preferentially recruited to promoters, whereas RNAPIIo is generally associated with the coding region of transcriptionally active genes (for a review, see Ref. 15Dahmus M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon formation of a stable preinitiation complex by RNAPIIa and transcription factors on a promoter, TFIIH phosphorylates serine 5 of the CTD heptapeptide, an event that allows promoter clearance by RNAPII (16Akoulitchev S. Makela T.P. Weinberg R.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1995; 377: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the recruitment of mRNA capping enzymes (17Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Serine 2 is then phosphorylated by P-TEFb, which renders RNAPII more processive during elongation of the transcript (18Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar).Two forms of the P-TEFb complex predominate in HeLa cell extracts: first, core P-TEFb, which consists of the binary Cdk9-cyclin T complex and possesses efficient CTD kinase activity, and second, a much less active complex composed of the 7SK small nuclear RNA, HEXIM1 (HMBA-inducible protein 1), and HEXIM2 proteins in addition to Cdk9-cyclin T (19Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16360-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, once subjected to a transcription insult, caused either by UV irradiation or treatment with 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or actinomycin D, the 7SK small nuclear RNA dissociates from core P-TEFb, which results in induction of the P-TEFb CTD kinase activity in vitro (21Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 22Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This positive modulation of P-TEFb kinase activity has been proposed to be involved in up-regulation of stress-responsive genes. However, it has been shown that serine 2 phosphorylation by P-TEFb is not required for proper induction of the stress-responsive gene p21 following a transcriptional stress engendered by treatment with DRB (23Gomes N.P. Bjerke G. Llorente B. Szostek S.A. Emerson B.M. Espinosa J.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extensive CTD phosphorylation in response to UV exposure has been proposed to reduce transcription initiation on an undamaged target gene in vitro, possibly by decreasing the pool of RNAPII competent for preinitiation complex assembly (24Rockx D.A. Mason R. van Hoffen A. Barton M.C. Citterio E. Bregman D.B. van Zeeland A.A. Vrieling H. Mullenders L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10503-10508Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The later observation may reflect the proposed dual role of CTD kinases, which is to act either as a specific positive transcription factor or in some circumstances as a general negative factor (25Lin P.S. Tremeau-Bravard A. Dahmus M.E. Chem. Rec. 2003; 3: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).We have recently discovered an inhibitory effect of the BRCA1 COOH-terminal region (BRCA1-C) on CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH in vitro and reported the decrease of serine 5 phosphorylation levels when BRCA1 is overexpressed in transfected cells (26Moisan A. Larochelle C. Guillemette B. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6947-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the effect of BRCA1 on serine 2 phosphorylation and study its involvement in the P-TEFb regulation pathway upon UV irradiation. We first show that BRCA1-C can inhibit immunoprecipitated P-TEFb kinase activity and that overexpressed BRCA1 decreases serine 2 phosphorylation levels in MCF7 cells. We show that in UV-irradiated cells, BRCA1 no longer affects CTD phosphorylation of chromatin-bound RNAPII but rather decreases serine 2 phosphorylation of soluble RNAPII. Finally, we show that wild type BRCA1-C, but not a mutated version unable to inhibit CTD phosphorylation, rescues the reduced transcriptional activity of nuclear extracts prepared from UV-irradiated cells, and stimulates endogenous p21 gene expression upon UV irradiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Transfections, and UV Irradiation for Protein Analyses—MCF7 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 70% confluent 100-mm dishes of MCF7 cells were transfected with 0, 5, or 8 μg of full-length BRCA1-, BRCA1-C-, or Cdk9dn-expressing vectors (27Majello B. Napolitano G. Giordano A. Lania L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and 8, 3, or 0 μg of pcDNA3 using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (from Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h following transfection, the medium was removed, cells were exposed to 25 J/m2 of UVC, and fresh medium was added. Cells were harvested 0.5-6 h later, as described in the figure legends. Details of plasmid constructions are available upon request.Nuclear Extract Preparation and Immunoblotting—HeLa nuclear extract preparation has been described earlier (28Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). MCF7 small scale nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (29Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For nuclear fractionation, the small scale nuclear extracts method was modified as follows. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in saponin buffer in which ATP had been changed for 0.2 mm EDTA (30Kimura H. Tao Y. Roeder R.G. Cook P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), allowed to swell on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were kept and represented the soluble nuclear fraction. Saponin pellets were resuspended in buffer C supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, stirred with magnetic bars for 45 min on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants contained chromatin-bound proteins. 50 μg of total nuclear extract, soluble or chromatin fractions, were run on 6/15% SDS-PAGE and revealed by immunoblotting using antibodies against phosphorylated serine 2 (H5 from Babco), N-terminal region of RNAPII subunit Rpb1 (N20), Cdk9, TFIIB (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and H3 (from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The same membrane was stripped (30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7), blocked, and reblotted for a maximum of four times.shRNA-mediated Knockdown of BRCA1 Expression—The shRNA sequence specific for BRCA1 (AATGCCAAAGTAGCTAATGTA) and the scrambled sequence (GTCACGATAAGACAATGATAT) were chosen according to previously published small interfering RNA sequences (31Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8668-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These sequences were annealed with their complementary sequences and cloned in the pSUPER.retro.puro vector according to the manufacturer's recommendations (OligoEngine). MCF7 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes at 60% confluence as described above and transfected with 6 μg of shRNA-expressing vector using the FuGENE transfection reagent (from Roche Applied Science). Puromycin was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml 24 h post-transfection. After 7 days in the presence of puromycin, survival cells were diluted to 0.5 cells/ml and plated to obtain stable clonal cell lines.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins from Escherichia coli—BRCA1-C derivatives were expressed in E. coli with the pET30a-expressing vector (Novagen), purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (from Qiagen), and chromatographed by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) as described earlier (26Moisan A. Larochelle C. Guillemette B. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6947-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The GST-CTD-expressing vector was a gift of A. Barberis. GST-CTD was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Biosciences) according to standard procedures. Details on plasmid constructions are available upon request.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (32Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80% confluent MCF7 cells (100-mm dishes) were lysed with 1 ml of TLB buffer. 5 μg of anti-Cdk9 were prebound to a 50-μl bed volume of protein A-agarose beads (from Roche Applied Science) and added to 1 ml of cell lysate. Immunocomplexes were washed as described (33Ramanathan Y. Rajpara S.M. Reza S.M. Lees E. Shuman S. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10913-10920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A 10-μl bed volume of immunoprecipitated Cdk9 was used for kinase assays. Kinase assays were performed in 25 μl of kinase buffer (32Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 30 min after the addition of 10 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μm ATP. 0, 12, or 24 pmol of BRCA1-C derivatives were added along with 0.5 pmol of GST-CTD 5 min prior to ATP addition. Reactions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, colored with Coomassie Blue, detected with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated material was migrated on 10% SDS-PAGE until the 25-kDa marker was run out of the gel to accurately separate Cdk8 (56 kDa), rabbit IgG (52 kDa), Cdk9 (43 kDa), and Cdk7 (40 kDa) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Cdk9, anti-Cdk8, and anti-Cdk7 antibodies (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Fig. 1C, 25 μg of HeLa nuclear extract were incubated with 5 μm ATP and 24 pmol of bovine serum albumin or 0, 6, 12, or 24 pmol of recombinant BRCA1-C for 30 min in 25 μl of kinase buffer and then migrated on 6% PAGE and revealed by immunoblotting with H5 and N20 antibodies.In Vitro Transcription Assays—MCF7 cells were transfected with BRCA1 constructs, exposed to UV irradiation, and submitted to small scale nuclear extract preparation as described above.

Preinitiation complexes were allowed to form for 20 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of 25 mm NTPs. 5 min following NTPs addition, Sarkosyl was added at 0.08% final concentration, and RNA synthesis was allowed to proceed for an additional 25 min. Reactions were stopped, and RNA was isolated and subjected to primer extension using a specific radiolabeled probe (34Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 39Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 40Nadeau G. Boufaied N. Moisan A. Lemieux K.M. Cayanan C. Monteiro A.N. Gaudreau L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and we previously described that this region could inhibit TFIIH kinase activity in vitro (26Moisan A. Larochelle C. Guillemette B. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6947-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In an attempt to better understand the role of BRCA1 in transcription regulation, it is of interest to define the effect of BRCA1 on other important CTD kinases, such as the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. P-TEFb kinase activity is ensured by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk9 in association with cyclin T. We first performed an in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated Cdk9 as a kinase source and the fusion protein GST-CTD as a substrate. Purified BRCA1-C protein was then added to the mixture, followed by the addition of radiolabeled ATP to allow the detection of CTD phosphorylation. Fig. 1A first shows that GST-CTD phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated Cdk9 leads to two differentially migrating forms, namely the hypophosphorylated (IIa) and hyperphosphorylated (IIo) forms, which is typical of efficient CTD phosphorylation (see lane 2) (41Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The figure further shows that BRCA1-C strongly impedes P-TEFb kinase activity on the GST-CTD substrate (lanes 2-4). We also tested a BRCA1-C derivative bearing a point mutation at residue 1572 (S1572E), which we have previously shown to have a strongly reduced effect on serine 5 phosphorylation inhibition when compared with wild type BRCA1-C (26Moisan A. Larochelle C. Guillemette B. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6947-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BRCA1-C S1572E also shows reduced inhibitory effect on P-TEFb kinase activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). Lane 1 shows that in the absence of anti-Cdk9, no CTD kinase activity could be observed. Furthermore, the gel has been stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that equal amounts of immunoprecipitated material, GST-CTD, and BRCA1-C proteins were distributed in each reaction (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows an immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated material used in the kinase assay to ensure that Cdk7 (40 kDa) and Cdk8 (56 kDa), the two other major CTD kinases, have not been precipitated along with Cdk9. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that other kinases are present in our immunoprecipitation, we can ascertain that Cdk9 is the principal CTD kinase present in our assay.P-TEFb specifically phosphorylates RNAPII CTD on serine 2 of the consensus heptapeptide YSPTSPS (14Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In order to verify the effect of BRCA1 on this target residue, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using a HeLa nuclear extract as a kinase and substrate source, which contains endogenous P-TEFb and RNAPII. We added purified BRCA1-C protein to the nuclear extract preparation and incubated the mixture in the presence of ATP. Serine 2 phosphorylation and total RNAPII were monitored by immunoblotting using appropriate antibodies. Fig. 1C shows that the addition of purified BRCA1-C efficiently inhibits serine 2 phosphorylation of RNAPII from a HeLa nuclear extract. Bovine serum albumin has been used here as a negative control (lane 1)."
