https://openalex.org/W1983113873,"In the western tropical Pacific, the interannual migration of the Indonesian Low convective system causes changes in rainfall that dominate the regional signature of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system. A 96-year oxygen isotope record from a Tarawa Atoll coral (1 degrees N, 172 degrees E) reflects regional convective activity through rainfall-induced salinity changes. This monthly resolution record spans twice the length of the local climatological record and provides a history of ENSO variability comparable in quality with those derived from instrumental climate data. Comparison of this coral record with a historical chronology of EI Niño events indicates that climate anomalies in coastal South America are occasionally decoupled from Pacific-wide ENSO extremes. Spectral analysis suggests that the distribution of variance in this record has shifted among annual to interannual periods during the present century, concurrent with observed changes in the strength of the Southern Oscillation."
https://openalex.org/W1969860780,"The racemic and meso diastereomers of an electron-rich binucleating tetraphosphine ligand have been used to prepare homobimetallic rhodium norbornadiene complexes. The racemic bimetallic Rh complex is an excellent hydroformylation catalyst for 1-alkenes, giving both a high rate of reaction and high regioselectivity for linear aldehydes, whereas the meso complex is considerably slower and less selective. A mechanism involving bimetallic cooperativity between the two rhodium centers in the form of an intramolecular hydride transfer is proposed. Mono- and bimetallic model complexes in which the possibility for bimetallic cooperativity has been reduced or eliminated are very poor catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W1671530604,An increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration results in a decrease in the number of leaf stomata. This relation is known both from historical observations of vegetation over the past 200 years and from experimental manipulations of microenvironments. Evidence from stomatal frequencies of fossil Quercus petraea leaves indicates that this relation can be applied as a bioindicator for changes in paleoatmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last 10 million years. The data suggest that late Neogene CO2 concentrations fluctuated between about 280 and 370 parts per million by volume.
https://openalex.org/W2030328808,"Catastrophic volcanic collapse, without precursory magmatic activity, is characteristic of many volcanic disasters. The extent and locations of hydrothermal discharges at Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, suggest that at many volcanoes collapse may result from the interactions between hydrothermal fluids and the volcanic edifice. Rock dissolution and hydrothermal mineral alteration, combined with physical triggers such as earth-quakes, can produce volcanic collapse. Hot spring water compositions, residence times, and flow paths through faults were used to model potential collapse at Ruiz. Caldera dimensions, deposits, and alteration mineral volumes are consistent with parameters observed at other volcanoes."

https://openalex.org/W1975163121,"Solid friction between a charged polymer and fixed gel points can dramatically affect polymer mobility in gel electrophoresis. The effect is present when a polymer chain is entangled over many gel points along a portion of its length, leading to significantly different behavior than predicted by conventional theory: the mobility of the chain decreases and exhibits a stronger length dependence, which separates long linear charged polymers of different molecular weights."
https://openalex.org/W2094471082,"Observations of solar p-mode frequency splittings obtained at Big Bear Solar Observatory in 1986 and during 1988-90 reveal small ( approximately 1 percent) changes in the sun's subsurface angular velocity with solar cycle. An asymptotic inversion of the splitting data yields the latitude dependence of the rotation rate and shows that the largest changes in the angular velocity, approximately 4 nanohertz, occurred between 1986 and the later years, at high ( approximately 60 degrees ) solar latitudes. Earlier helioseismic observations suggest that solar cycle changes in the ratio of magnetic to turbulent pressure in the solar convection zone are large enough to account for the magnitude of the observed angular velocity variations but a detailed model of the phenomenon does not exist."
