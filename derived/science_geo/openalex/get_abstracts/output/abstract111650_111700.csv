https://openalex.org/W1983066351,"Mechanistic information and structure-based design methods have been used to design a series of nonpeptide cyclic ureas that are potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease and HIV replication. A fundamental feature of these inhibitors is the cyclic urea carbonyl oxygen that mimics the hydrogen-bonding features of a key structural water molecule. The success of the design in both displacing and mimicking the structural water molecule was confirmed by x-ray crystallographic studies. Highly selective, preorganized inhibitors with relatively low molecular weight and high oral bioavailability were synthesized."

In contrast, the intracellular transport of free heavy chains or peptide-deficient heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin heterodimers is impaired. A 90-kilodalton membrane-bound chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), termed calnexin, associates quantitatively with newly synthesized class I heavy chains, but the functions of calnexin in this interaction are unknown. Class I subunits were expressed alone or in combination with calnexin in Drosophila melanogaster cells. Calnexin retarded the intracellular transport of both peptide-deficient heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin heterodimers and free heavy chains. Calnexin also impeded the rapid intracellular degradation of free heavy chains. The ability of calnexin to protect and retain class I assembly intermediates is likely to contribute to the efficient intracellular formation of class I-peptide complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2159692814,"Collagenase is a zinc-dependent endoproteinase and is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes. The MMPs participate in connective tissue remodeling events and aberrant regulation has been associated with several pathologies. The 2.4 angstrom resolution structure of the inhibited enzyme revealed that, in addition to the catalytic zinc, there is a second zinc ion and a calcium ion which play a major role in stabilizing the tertiary structure of collagenase. Despite scant sequence homology, collagenase shares structural homology with two other endoproteinases, bacterial thermolysin and crayfish astacin. The detailed description of protein-inhibitor interactions present in the structure will aid in the design of compounds that selectively inhibit individual members of the MMP family. Such inhibitors will be useful in examining the function of MMPs in pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1583486328,"The dbl oncogene product contains a 238-amino acid domain, which is shared by an expanding family of growth regulatory proteins. These include the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle protein, CDC24, the breakpoint cluster region protein, the ect2 and vav oncogene products, and the brain GDP-releasing factor for Ras. Previous studies have provided evidence that oncogenic Dbl or an associated protein stimulates GDP dissociation from the human species (Hs) homolog of CDC42. We show here that Dbl specifically complexes with the GDP-bound forms of CDC42Hs and RhoA, but not Rac1 or TC10, and that this specificity correlates with the ability of Dbl to act as a GDP-releasing factor. Small deletions throughout the Dbl domain, which inactivate transformation, eliminated the ability of Dbl to stimulate GDP dissociation, whereas deletions outside of this domain did not impair either function. Finally, the Dbl domain itself, when expressed and purified as a recombinant protein, was shown to stimulate GDP dissociation from purified, recombinant CDC42Hs. These findings establish that a minimal unit on Dbl that is critical to its transforming function directly regulates GDP-GTP exchange activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607808276,"In the present study, we have identified several proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells that are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and exhibit an unusual bell-shaped dose-response curve with a maximum at 5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These proteins include two that are associated with focal adhesions, namely the focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), a novel cytosolic tyrosine kinase, and paxillin. At low concentrations of PDGF (1-5 ng/ml), these proteins are the predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated species. At 30 ng/ml PDGF, however, there was no stimulation of their phosphorylation over control levels. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of previously described substrates of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase, namely the p21ras GTPase-activating protein, p120, phosphatidyl inositol 3' kinase, and phospholipase C gamma exhibited sigmoidal dose-response curves with PDGF and were all efficiently phosphorylated on tyrosine at 30 ng/ml PDGF. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, completely inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin by PDGF. Examination of the actin cytoskeleton after stimulation of cells with different concentrations of PDGF revealed that at 5 ng/ml PDGF, actin appears in stress fibers and in membrane ruffles, while at 30 ng/ml, PDGF disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. Bombesin stimulates actin stress fiber formation with no evidence of disruption of stress fibers at high concentrations. When cells were stimulated with bombesin (10 nM) in the presence of 30 ng/ml PDGF, however, the actin cytoskeleton was completely disrupted. Further, the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p125FAK and paxillin induced by bombesin (10 nM) was completely prevented when cells were stimulated with bombesin in the presence of 30 ng/ml PDGF. We propose that the inhibitory limb in the bell-shaped dose-response curve of PDGF and the novel cross-talk between PDGF and bombesin on tyrosine phosphorylation may be explained by the ability of PDGF at 30 ng/ml to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2038903590,"Female gynogens reproduce clonally but rely on sperm from heterospecific males to initiate embryogenesis. It has been assumed that males gain no benefit from such matings; thus, selection should favor males that avoid them. Here it is shown that males gain a benefit by mating with female gynogens in an asexual-sexual complex of fish. The sexual females increase their preference for males whom they observe consorting with female gynogens. Thus, gynogenetic species might persist because selection favors males to be sexually parasitized."
https://openalex.org/W1969887716,"Frogs must generate a high level of mechanical power when they jump. The muscular system of frogs that jump is presumably designed to deliver these high powers. The length changes and activation pattern that muscles undergo during jumping were measured, and isolated muscle bundles were driven through this in vivo pattern. During jumping, muscles generated maximum power. Specifically, the muscle fibers (i) operated at optimal sarcomere lengths, (ii) operated at optimal shortening velocities, and (iii) were maximally activated during power generation. Thus, many different parameters must have evolved in concert to produce a system capable of this explosive jumping movement."
https://openalex.org/W1530507460,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a platelet-derived phospholipid that serves as a mitogen for fibroblasts. LPA activates its own G protein-coupled receptor(s) leading to stimulation of phospholipase C and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Furthermore, LPA rapidly activates p21ras through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. In this study, we have examined LPA-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in Rat-1 fibroblasts. LPA action was compared with that of endothelin, which is a stronger activator of phospholipase C than LPA but fails to activate p21ras and to stimulate DNA synthesis in these cells. LPA and, more effectively, endothelin rapidly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 110-130, 95, and 65-75 kDa. The effect of LPA is dose- and time-dependent, being half-maximal at 3-30 nM and peaking after 2-5 min. Among the 110-130-kDa group of phosphotyrosyl proteins is the 125-kDa focal adhesion (p125FAK) but not the 120-kDa p21ras GTPase-activating protein. Furthermore, LPA, like epidermal growth factor, causes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, paralleling p21ras activation. In contrast, endothelin fails to phosphorylate MAP kinase. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin blocks LPA-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation without affecting the other tyrosine phosphorylations. The kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 microM) blocks LPA-induced, but not epidermal growth factor-induced, activation of p21ras and MAP kinase, consistent with an intermediate protein kinase linking the LPA receptor to p21ras activation. The results support a model in which LPA-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase is mediated by p21ras, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the other substrates, including p125FAK, is associated with phospholipase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W2034755896,"The structure of the 52-amino acid DNA-binding domain of the prokaryotic Hin recombinase, complexed with a DNA recombination half-site, has been solved by x-ray crystallography at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The Hin domain consists of a three-alpha-helix bundle, with the carboxyl-terminal helix inserted into the major groove of DNA, and two flanking extended polypeptide chains that contact bases in the minor groove. The overall structure displays features resembling both a prototypical bacterial helix-turn-helix and the eukaryotic homeodomain, and in many respects is an intermediate between these two DNA-binding motifs. In addition, a new structural motif is seen: the six-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of the Hin domain runs along the minor groove at the edge of the recombination site, with the peptide backbone facing the floor of the groove and side chains extending away toward the exterior. The x-ray structure provides an almost complete explanation for DNA mutant binding studies in the Hin system and for DNA specificity observed in the Hin-related family of DNA invertases."
https://openalex.org/W2122887823,"We compared the effect of lipid composition and particle size of triglyceride-rich low density lipoprotein (LDL) upon apoprotein B conformation and binding to the LDL receptor. Three groups of triglyceride-rich LDL were studied: (a) LDL isolated from chronic hypertriglyceridemic individuals (HTG-LDL); (b) normal LDL made triglyceride-rich by in vitro incubation with triglyceride emulsion and the neutral lipid transfer protein (R-LDL); and (c) LDL from normolipidemic individuals made acutely hypertriglyceridemic by intravenous infusion of 10% Intralipid (IV-LDL). HTG-LDL was small and dense, whereas R-LDL and IV-LDL had normal size. HTG-LDL, but not R-LDL or IV-LDL, exhibited decreased binding to the LDL receptor on human skin fibroblasts in studies at 4 degrees C and reduced degradation at 37 degrees C. Apoprotein B conformation was assessed by circular dichroism and by analyzing the immunoreactivity of different monoclonal antibodies. HTG-LDL but not R-LDL or IV-LDL showed a change in the CD spectra and a consistent decrease in the immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibody 3F5 (2.5-fold) which recognizes an epitope adjacent to the receptor binding domain of apoprotein B. These findings suggest that in triglyceride-rich LDL, the relative content of neutral lipid in the core of LDL in the absence of changes in the size of the particle does not significantly affect apoprotein B conformation or its affinity for the LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1979486400,"During assembly of complex polyketide antibiotics like erythromycin A, molecular recognition by the multienzyme polyketide synthase controls the stereochemical outcome as each successive methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) extender unit is added. Acylation of the purified erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase has shown that all six acyltransferase domains have identical stereospecificity for their normal substrate, (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. In contrast, the configuration of the methyl-branched centers in the product, that are derived from (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, is different. Stereoselection during the chain building process must, therefore, involve additional epimerization steps."
https://openalex.org/W1607113137,"Erythropoietin (Epo) regulates the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursors. The Epo receptor (EpoR) belongs to the cytokine receptor family and lacks a tyrosine kinase domain. However, Epo induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates including the EpoR. To explore the functional significance of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the possible interaction of the receptor with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. After Epo stimulation, p85 was found to associate with the tyrosine-phosphorylated 72-kDa form of EpoR as well as a 92-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein, and PI 3-kinase activity was detectable in anti-EpoR immunoprecipitates. Anti-EpoR blotting of anti-p85 immunoprecipitates revealed that p85 binds specifically to the 72-kDa form of the EpoR and not to unphosphorylated 66- and 64-kDa forms. Association of p85 with the EpoR was Epo dose- and time-dependent and correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. Consistent with a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of the EpoR, PI 3-kinase did not associate with a mitogenically active receptor mutant that lacked tyrosine-phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal region. A recombinant fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal SH-2 domain of p85 was shown to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated EpoR in vitro. Taken together, these results indicate that, following Epo stimulation, the EpoR recruits PI 3-kinase to the cell membrane by binding between the carboxyl-terminal SH-2 domain of p85 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal region of the receptor. The association with PI 3-kinase is, however, not required for the growth signal transduction from the EpoR."
https://openalex.org/W1534986377,"Insect diuretic hormones and their receptors regulate fluid and ion secretion and thus are attractive targets for the design of novel insect control agents. A complementary DNA clone encoding a corticotropin-releasing factor-related diuretic hormone receptor from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta was isolated by expression cloning in COS-7 cells. The receptor consists of 395 amino acids and contains seven putative transmembrane domains. The expressed receptor binds M. sexta diuretic hormone, as well as several related insect diuretic peptides with high affinity. Furthermore, each of these peptides stimulate adenylate cyclase in COS-7 cells transfected with the receptor. The M. sexta diuretic hormone receptor is homologous to the receptors for calcitonin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, parathyroid hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1, growth hormone-releasing hormone, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and glucagon. The M. sexta diuretic hormone receptor is the first nonmammalian member of this family to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1529741033,"The poliovirus-specific polypeptide 3AB (B = VPg) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. Corresponding to its known association with membranes in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells, 3AB expressed in E. coli was also membrane-associated, and it could be solubilized only in detergent-containing buffers. In soluble form, 3AB was resistant to digestion with the virus-specific proteinases 3Cpro and 3CDpro. However, it was cleaved by these enzymes to 3A and VPg when bound to the bacterial membranes, an observation suggesting that 3AB may deliver the genome-linked protein VPg to the membrane-associated poliovirus replication complex. The specific activity of 3CDpro in processing 3AB was significantly higher than that of 3Cpro. Soluble 3AB was found to stimulate nearly 100-fold poly (A)-dependent, primer-dependent poly(U) synthesis, catalyzed by purified poliovirus RNA polymerase 3Dpol. We propose that 3AB has a dual function in poliovirus genome replication: as a precursor for VPg, and as a co-factor for 3Dpol."
https://openalex.org/W1648936948,"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for human interleukin-6 (IL-6) bind two distinct sites on the IL-6 protein (sites I and II). Their interference with IL-6 receptor binding suggested that site I is a receptor-binding site of IL-6, whereas site II is important for signal transduction. Mutagenesis of site II could therefore result in the isolation of IL-6 receptor antagonists. To test this hypothesis, a panel of IL-6 mutant proteins was constructed that did not bind to a site II-specific monoclonal antibody. One such site II mutant protein (with double substitution of Gln-160 with Glu and Thr-163 with Pro) was found to be an antagonist of human IL-6. It was inactive on human CESS cells, weakly active on human HepG2 cells, but active on mouse B9 cells. It could specifically antagonize the activity of wild-type IL-6 on CESS and HepG2 cells. The binding affinity of this variant for the 80-kDa IL-6 receptor was similar to that of wild-type IL-6. High affinity binding to CESS cells, however, was abolished, suggesting that the mutant protein is inactive because the complex of the 80-kDa IL-6 receptor and the mutant protein cannot associate with the signal transducer gp130. The human IL-6 antagonist protein may be potentially useful as a therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W1578840576,"Chronic exposure of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 50 microM arachidonic acid (AA) resulted in an inhibition (approximately 91%) in cellular GLUT4 mRNA content after a 48-h exposure, without similarly affecting the mRNA content of the ubiquitous glucose transporter, GLUT1. Subsequent investigations revealed that transcription of the GLUT4 gene was reduced by approximately 50% in response to AA treatment and the half-life of GLUT4 mRNA decreased from 8.0 to 4.6 h. By contrast, AA increased the accumulation of GLUT1 mRNA by 65%, by a mechanism that also involved regulation at both transcriptional and mRNA stability levels. Western blot analysis revealed that AA was specifically reducing the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) in both plasma and intracellular membranes. Subsequently, AA was observed to alter the ability of the GLUT4 transporter to respond to insulin and mediate a significant enhancement of glucose uptake. The results presented in this study indicate that AA can partially mimic the effects of both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and insulin which, when chronically supplied to 3T3-L1 adipocytes, also down-regulate GLUT4 gene expression. Therefore, these data may have relevance to the insulin-resistance associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1564011208,"The phosphorylation of myosin light chains and heavy chains by protein kinase C is known to be temporally correlated with Ca(2+)-dependent secretion of granules from RBL-2H3 cells (Ludowyke, R. I., Peleg, I., Beaven, M. A., and Adelstein, R. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12492-12501). We now report that whereas myosin light chains are predominantly monophosphorylated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase at serine 19 in unstimulated cells, stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells with antigen or other stimulants causes additional phosphorylation of myosin light chains by myosin light chain kinase at threonine 18, as well as by protein kinase C at serine 1 or serine 2. This diphosphorylation at serine 19 and threonine 18 by myosin light chain kinase and the monophosphorylation by protein kinase C is correlated with the rate and extent of degranulation. Secretion occurs whenever phosphorylation by both enzymes is stimulated by antigen or by the combination of low concentrations of A23187 (50 nM) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 nM). These phosphorylations appear to be closely associated with exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells. Thus, phosphorylation, as well as secretion, can be blocked by the kinase inhibitors KT5926 and ML-7. More specifically, phorbol ester alone induces phosphorylation of myosin light chains by protein kinase C exclusively, but fails to induce secretion until accompanied by low concentrations of A23187, which activates myosin light chain kinase. Conversely, selective suppression of phosphorylation by protein kinase C (with Ro31-7549 in antigen-stimulated cells) suppresses degranulation, thereby indicating a requirement for protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1594372105,"The hormone, auxin, plays an important role in the differentiation and growth of plant cells. A number of auxin-responsive genes have been characterized but until now minimal auxin-responsive cis-elements within these promoter regions have not been identified. Here we show that two related DNA sequences of 21 base pairs can respond to auxin treatment in transgenic tobacco. In contrast, treatments with cytokinin or abscisic acid do not cause any apparent increase in promoter activity of these cis-acting elements. These sequences are present in the promoter regions of the nopaline synthase gene from the T-DNA of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the 35 S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus. Both sequences have been shown to be binding sites for the tobacco transcription factor ASF-1. Pretreatment of leaves with cycloheximide does not inhibit the response to auxin treatment, suggesting that hormone sensitivity of these promoter elements does not involve de novo synthesis of ASF-1. In addition, promoter elements from some auxin-responsive plant genes can bind ASF-1 in vitro. Based on these results, we propose that transcriptional activation by ASF-1 may be modulated by auxin through modification of pre-existing factors. Our results also suggest a role for ASF-1 in mediating some of the effects of auxin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1595262590,"Decorin is a leucine-rich, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan which binds collagen and growth factors. We have recently completed the genomic organization of human decorin and discovered two alternatively spliced leader exons, designated exon Ia and Ib, in the 5'-untranslated region. Initial analysis of the sequences upstream to these two exons showed that promoter Ia contained only two GC boxes while promoter Ib contained a CAAT and two TATA boxes in close proximity to the transcription start site. To determine if these 5'-flanking sequences exhibited promoter activity, chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression plasmids containing the promoter region of either exon Ia or Ib were transfected into HeLa and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. The results showed that only the region flanking exon Ib was functional. In vitro transcription assay generated two transcripts of 92 and 82 base pairs (bp) indicating that both TATA boxes could be used. Using stepwise 5' deletion analysis we found that the minimum promoter region at -140 bp from the transcription start site, which contained only the CAAT and the two TATA boxes, exhibited strong promoter activity. When a larger construct containing an additional 800 bp of upstream region was tested, a significant increase in transcriptional activity was observed. Interestingly, this promoter region contained several putative binding sites for ubiquitous factors (AP1, AP5, and NF-kappa B) and for transforming growth factor-beta and a 150-bp homopurine/homopyrimidine element with several mirror repeats. When contained in a supercoiled plasmid, this sequence exhibited sensitivity to endonuclease S1, an enzyme that preferentially digests single-stranded DNA. Precise S1 mapping, obtained by direct sequencing of nine distinct S1-generated clones, revealed that in all cases the borders of the sensitive sequence resided within the pur/pyr segment. We propose that this region of the promoter could adopt an intramolecular hairpin triplex structure in vivo and may play a role in the chromatin organization at the decorin gene locus. In addition, this region was able to up-regulate a minimal heterologous promoter in transient transfection assays. The results show that the structure of the decorin gene promoter is different from that of any other proteoglycan promoter characterized so far and indicate that the pur/pyr segment plays a role in the regulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1496078232,"Interleukin (IL)-8 is a macrophage-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor that plays an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory loci. Hence, expression of IL-8 by alveolar macrophages may be a significant factor in host defense in the lung and in the pathogenesis of pneumonia in swine. To initiate molecular studies of IL-8 regulation in pigs, we cloned IL-8 cDNA and examined the regulation of its mRNA in alveolar macrophages. The porcine IL-8 cDNA consists of 1491 base pairs including a coding region of 309 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence was 75 and 81% similar to human and rabbit IL-8, respectively. Resting macrophages contained low levels of IL-8 mRNA, which increased markedly after exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induction of IL-8 was direct, not mediated through elevation of tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1. The effect of LPS on IL-8 expression was dose dependent, and induction was observed at a concentration of 10 pg/ml. IL-8 mRNA expression was detectable within 0.5 h after stimulation with LPS, peaked at 3-6 h at about 30-fold higher levels than in resting cells, and was maintained for 24 h. Secreted IL-8, measured by neutrophil chemotaxis, was induced within 4 h by LPS, and accumulated in the media throughout the 24-h period. The mechanism of induction of IL-8 mRNA appeared to involve transcription and RNA processing. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that the IL-8 gene was actively transcribed in noninduced cells; upon stimulation with LPS, the rate of IL-8 transcription was increased about 4-fold. A single mature mRNA species was detected by primer extension analysis. The half-life of IL-8 mRNA transcripts in aveolar macrophages was approximately 2 h and did not change after LPS stimulation. The ability of LPS to induce IL-8 expression was suppressed by recombinant human IL-4 and dexamethasone in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the expression of IL-8 is an early event in the sequelae to bacterial infection in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1484765959,"A Limulus intracellular coagulation inhibitor, designated LICI, was isolated from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus), using three steps of chromatography, including dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephacryl S-200, and Mono S. LICI is a single-chain glycoprotein with an apparent M(r) = 48,000 estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It blocks the amidolytic activities of Limulus lipopolysaccharide-sensitive serine protease, factor C, by forming a covalent 1:1 complex with the protease. The second-order rate constant for inhibition of factor C was 2.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 at 37 degrees C. LICI also inhibited human alpha-thrombin, rat salivary kallikrein, bovine plasmin, and trypsin but not Limulus clotting enzyme, Limulus factor B, bovine factor Xa, human factor XIa, human tissue plasminogen activator, human urokinase, chymotrypsin, elastase, and papain. Glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate had no effect on the inhibitory activity. A cDNA coding for LICI was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library. The open reading frame of the 1,257-base pair cDNA codes for the mature protein of 394 amino acids, of which 223 residues were confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis. LICI shows significant sequence identities to members of the serpin superfamily, such as human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (40%) and human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (39%). LICI contains a putative reactive site, -Arg-Ser-, at the corresponding position present in several inhibitors of the serpin superfamily. The subcellular localization, determined using an anti-LICI polyclonal antibody, indicated that LICI colocates with the Limulus serine protease zymogens in large granules in the hemocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1547719503,"The microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is subject to rapid degradation when cells are incubated with sterols or mevalonic acid (MVA). It has been shown that this rapid degradation is dependent upon both a sterol and another MVA-derived metabolite (Nakanishi, M., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8929-8937). In the current study, inhibitors of the isoprene biosynthetic pathway were used to define further this mevalonic acid derivative involved in the accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. The accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in met-18b-2 cells, which is induced by the addition of MVA, was inhibited by the presence of the squalene synthase inhibitor, zaragozic acid/squalestatin, or the squalene epoxidase inhibitor, NB-598. Accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase was observed when NB-598-treated cells were incubated with both MVA and sterols. In contrast, the addition of MVA and sterols to zaragozic acid/squalestatin-treated cells did not result in rapid enzyme degradation. This MVA- and sterol-dependent degradation of HMG-CoA reductase persisted in cells permeabilized with reduced streptolysin O. Finally, the selective degradation of HMG-CoA reductase was also observed in rat hepatic microsomes incubated in vitro in the absence of ATP and cytosol. We conclude that the MVA-derived component that is required for the accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is derived from farnesyl disphosphate and/or squalene in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. We propose that this component has a permissive effect and does not, by itself, induce the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. We also conclude that the degradation of HMG-CoA occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and, once the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase has been initiated by MVA and sterols, all necessary components for the continued degradation of HMG-CoA reductase reside in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1535256268,"The lysosomal proprotease procathepsin L binds to mouse fibroblast microsomal membranes at pH 5, but mature active cathepsin L does not (McIntyre, G.F., and Erickson, A. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15438-15445). This binding is not dependent on N-linked carbohydrate as procathepsin L synthesized in cells treated with tunicamycin still shows pH-dependent membrane association. These results suggest that the propeptide (Thr18-Lys113) of the cysteine protease mediates its pH-dependent membrane association. Synthetic peptides containing either 24 or 9 residues from the N-terminal portion of the mouse procathepsin L propeptide inhibited the binding of mouse procathepsin L to microsomal membranes at pH 5. In contrast, the pH-dependent membrane association was not inhibited either by a scrambled version of the 24-residue peptide, in which 3 adjacent residues likely to be positively charged at pH 5 were dispersed, or by a second control peptide containing the 11 N-terminal residues from mature mouse cathepsin L. The 24-residue peptide chemically coupled to horseradish peroxidase bound to microsomes at pH 5, but not at pH 7. On ligand blots, the same conjugate bound specifically to a 43-kDa integral membrane protein, identifying the microsomal protein that mediates the proenzyme binding. The 9-residue propeptide sequence that inhibits the membrane association of procathepsin L at pH 5 resembles the vacuolar sorting sequences in the propeptides of yeast proteinase A and carboxypeptidase Y. This suggests that the membrane association of procathepsin L may play a role in the transport of the proenzyme to lysosomes, the vacuolar equivalent in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1504320357,"A major histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease is deposits of a approximately 4-kDa beta-amyloid peptide derived by proteolytic processing from a precursor, the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). Proteolytic cleavage of beta-APP within the approximately 4-kDa beta-amyloid domain permits the secretion of the amino-terminal portion of beta-APP while concomitantly producing a membrane bound approximately 9-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment. We have characterized the proteolytic cleavage site for beta-APP secretion by amino acid sequence analysis of the approximately 9-kDa beta-APP carboxyl-terminal cleavage product produced by recombinant and native expression systems. Recombinant beta-APP was generated by a vaccinia virus expression system in CV-1 monkey fibroblasts; endogenous beta-APP was obtained using a fibroblast line derived from an individual with Down's syndrome. The sequences of both unlabeled and metabolically radiolabeled approximately 9-kDa fragment from CV-1 cells reveal that the major (60%) secretory cleavage site is after Lys16 of the beta-amyloid domain as reported previously; however, an additional cleavage site is seen after Phe19 (40%). Radiosequence analysis of the carboxyl-terminal fragment purified from Down's syndrome fibroblasts indicates cleavage sites after Phe19, Glu22, and Gly25 and not after Lys16. CV-1 cells expressing beta-APP mutants lacking 4 and 6 amino acids adjacent to Lys16 yielded approximately 9-kDa fragments with two identical cleavage sites, neither of which occurred after the retained Lys16 but were after Glu11 and His13. These data suggest that secretion of beta-APP involves multiple proteinases and that the composition of these proteinases may vary within different cell backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W1567048655,"PAY genes are required for peroxisome assembly in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Here we characterize one mutant, pay4, and describe the cloning and sequencing of the PAY4 gene. The pay4 mutant shows no identifiable peroxisomes by biochemical and morphological criteria. The complementing PAY4 gene encodes a polypeptide, Pay4p, 1025 amino acids in length and having a predicted molecular mass of 112,258 Da. The predicted Pay4p sequence contains two putative ATP-binding domains and shows structural relationships to other potential ATP-binding proteins involved in biological processes as diverse as peroxisome biogenesis, vesicle-mediated protein transport, cell cycle control, and transcriptional regulation. These proteins all share a highly conserved stretch of approximately 175 amino acids that contains a consensus sequence for ATP binding. Pay4p shows sequence conservation with Pas1p and Pas5p, putative ATPases required for peroxisomal assembly in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, respectively. Pay4p, Pas1p, and Pas5p are presumably related members of a family of putative ATPases involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Pay4p is synthesized in low amounts in Y. lipolytica cells grown in glucose, and there is a rapid and pronounced increase in the levels of Pay4p upon transfer of the cells to a medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source."
https://openalex.org/W1517315396,"PC2 is a member of the eukaryotic family of subtilisin-like proteases, which is thought to participate in the processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides in neuroendocrine cells. PC2 is synthesized as a 69-kDa prepropolypeptide. The NH2-terminal signal sequence is removed during segregation within the endoplasmic reticulum, where glycosylation occurs to generate a 75-kDa propolypeptide. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis and a cell-free translation/translocation system from Xenopus eggs was used to investigate the processing of the pro-PC2 precursor. The 75-kDa polypeptide underwent slow cleavage after the sequence Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg84 to generate a 68-kDa mature enzyme. Cleavage was blocked when the tetrabasic sequence was deleted (PC2M3) or when the active site Asp142 was changed to Asn (PC2M4). This latter observation suggested that cleavage of the 75-kDa propolypeptide to the mature 68-kDa enzyme was autocatalytic. Incubation of the PC2M4 mutant with the wild type PC2 precursor resulted in cleavage of both the wild type polypeptide and the catalytically inactive PC2M4 mutant. This indicates that cleavage could occur through an intermolecular reaction. The results also demonstrate that the novel Xenopus egg extract translation/translocation system represents a powerful cell-free method for studying proteolytic processing of propolypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1553626787,"We have isolated 38 cDNA clones for serpins from a lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, and have found that they are identical in sequence, except for a region encoding the carboxyl-terminal 40-45 residues, which includes the reactive center. Among these clones, there are 11 variants of the reactive center region, each encoded by a different version of the ninth exon in the serpin gene. Thus, evolution of this insect serpin gene has resulted from duplication and sequence divergence of only the exon encoding the reactive site. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing then generates inhibitor diversity and the potential to regulate a variety of proteinases, using the same protein framework joined to different reactive site region cassettes."
https://openalex.org/W1572019842,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily plays a role in embryogenesis and regeneration. We have reported that osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) promotes cell aggregation and induces the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecules N-CAM and L1 in proliferating neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells (Perides, G., Safran, R. M., Rueger, D. C., and Charness, M. E. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 10326-10330; Perides, G., Hu, G., Rueger, D. C., and Charness, M. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 25197-25205). Here we show that the structurally homologous bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) BMP-2 and BMP-4 are 10-50-fold more potent in these actions than the subfamily comprising BMP-5, BMP-6, and OP-1 (BMP-7). In contrast, members of the TGF-beta subfamily, activin-A, inhibin-A, and 29 additional growth factors and cytokines did not induce N-CAM. The addition of serum to cells growing in serum-free medium caused a concentration-dependent increase in N-CAM and L1 expression; however, serum did not potentiate the induction of N-CAM and L1 by 40 ng/ml OP-1. These findings suggest the presence in NG108-15 cells of a BMP-2/BMP-4 receptor that discriminates subtle differences in structure among homologous members of the TGF-beta superfamily. An endogenous ligand for this receptor may be present in serum."
https://openalex.org/W1489040991,"The capacity of eukaryotic topoisomerase I to catalyze intra- and intermolecular DNA strand transfer via a two-step cleavage/ligation reaction was investigated by use of purified enzyme and defined DNA substrates. Topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage requires separate interaction with a duplex region encompassing the cleavage site (region A) and a duplex region located on the side holding the 5'-OH end generated by cleavage (region B). Cleaved topoisomerase I-DNA complexes containing enzyme covalently attached at internal and terminal positions were employed to characterize the intra- and intermolecular ligation reactions. Enzyme attached covalently at an internal position of a partially single-stranded DNA molecule is able to catalyze ligation of a complementary dinucleotide within region A in the absence of interaction with region B. Moreover, the dinucleotide confines the minimal DNA acceptor for intramolecular ligation. Topoisomerase I attached covalently to DNA at a terminal position can ligate the cleaved strand to heterologous duplex DNA regardless of sequence, whereas ligation does not proceed with single-stranded DNA. When these features are considered together with the observation that intermolecular ligation is inhibited by 1 M NaCl, it suggests that the reaction requires bipartite DNA interaction. A model is proposed that relates the bipartite DNA binding of eukaryotic topoisomerase I to the catalytic functions."
https://openalex.org/W1492931340,"A monoclonal antibody to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was reduced and alkylated and its light and heavy chains were purified by denaturing gel filtration. Following renaturation, the light chain displayed sequence-specific binding of VIP. The specific VIP binding activity of several fractions spanning the light chain peak recovered from the gel filtration column was constant, the light chain was electrophoretically homogeneous, the VIP binding activity was precipitated by anti-light chain antibody but not anti-heavy chain antibody and the activity remained associated with a light chain fraction recovered by resolutive chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the light and heavy chain fractions confirmed the purity of these proteins and suggested that the VL and VH regions belonged to kappa-family II and gamma-family III, respectively. The VIP-binding affinity of the light chain was only 5-fold lower than that of the parent antibody and the light chain did not bind unrelated peptides. These observations suggest that light chains display structural characteristics necessary for high affinity antigen binding."
https://openalex.org/W1621777818,"Mutation in the REC1 gene of Ustilago maydis is known to lead to a complex phenotype with alterations in DNA repair, recombination, mutagenesis, meiosis, and cell division. The predicted product of the REC1 gene is a polypeptide of 522 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 56,866 daltons, with no overall sequence homology to any other known protein. The open reading frame of the REC1 gene placed by itself in a U. maydis expression vector was found to be sufficient to complement the rec1 mutant. Overexpression of REC1 in Escherichia coli gave rise to the anticipated 57-kDa product together with a 3'-->5' exonuclease activity. This activity was only present in cells overexpressing REC1 and its characteristics were distinguishable from the major bacterial nucleases, but it had certain enzymatic features in common with epsilon, the proofreading exonuclease subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. To facilitate isolation of the protein product from bacteria, the REC1 gene was overexpressed from a vector that fused a hexa-histidine-leader sequence onto the amino terminus, enabling the isolation of the HisREC1 product on an immobilized metal ion affinity column. The His-REC1 protein co-eluted with the novel exonuclease activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the REC1 gene product with the conserved proofreading exonuclease motifs of DNA polymerases indicated significant homology."
https://openalex.org/W1520889194,"In order to compare the ability of the human and rat O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferases (transferases) to repair in vitro O6-methylguanine (O6-MeGua) and O4-methylthymine (O4-MeThy) residues, which are two mutagenic DNA adducts formed by alkylating agents, we have purified both proteins to homogeneity. Gel electrophoresis of the proteins shows that the O4-MeThy repair is due to the transfer of the methyl group from the alkylated base to the transferase molecules. However, both proteins repair with different efficiencies the O6-MeGua and O4-MeThy residues present in alkylated DNA, poly[d(G.C)], poly(dG.dC), or in alkylated poly[d(A.T)] and poly(dA.dT), respectively. Reaction of both proteins with either methylated residues follows a second-order kinetics. The rate constants are 1 x 10(9) M-1 min-1 for both proteins acting on O6-MeGua and 4.8 x 10(6) or 1.8 x 10(5) M-1 min-1 for the rat or human protein acting on O4-MeThy, respectively. The activity of the mammalian transferases on O4-MeThy present in a poly(dA.dT) substrate is inhibited by double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1599794366,"The BcgI restriction enzyme from Bacillus coagulans is unusual in that it cleaves on both sides of its recognition site, CGAN6TGC, releasing a fragment that includes the site and several bases on each side. We report the organization and nucleotide sequences of the genes for the BcgI restriction-modification system and the properties of the proteins that they encode. The system comprises two adjacent, similarly oriented genes. The proximal gene, bcgIA, codes for a 637-amino acid protein (molecular mass = 71.6 kDa) that resembles certain m6A-specific DNA-methyltransferases, particularly those that constitute the modification subunits of type I restriction-modification systems. The distal gene, bcgIB, codes for a 341-amino acid protein (molecular mass = 39.2 kDa) that resembles none of the sequences in the sequence data bases. The two genes overlap by several nucleotides. Alone, neither protein restricts or modifies DNA, but, together, they form a complex in the proportion A2B that does both. DNA binding assays showed that the DNA-protein complex can be formed only in the presence of both subunits, suggesting that the association of inactive subunits generates the active BcgI enzyme that can bind DNA and then either cleaves or methylates at target site."
https://openalex.org/W1603693479,"The cysteines involved in joining the 2 half-molecules of fibrinogen and also those located on either side of the alpha-helical coiled-coil region, were substituted, by site-directed mutagenesis, with serine. Fibrinogen assembly and secretion were determined in transiently transfected COS cells. Our studies indicate that in order to assemble the 2 half-molecules into a dimer, it is not sufficient to only have the disulfide linkages which keep the 2 half-molecules intact. The disulfide rings which flank the coil-coiled region also play important roles in dimer assembly. Intact interchain disulfide linkages at the NH2-terminal end of the coiled-coil region are essential for assembly of the 2 half-molecules. Disruption of these disulfide rings leads to the formation and secretion of half-molecules. Disruption of the interchain disulfide rings at the COOH-terminal end of the coiled-coil region allows dimer formation, but the 6-chain molecule which is assembled is not secreted. Disruption of both disulfide rings at either end of the coiled-coil region disallows assembly of half-molecules and of dimeric fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1488870670,"Earlier studies showed that overexpression of B beta fibrinogen chains, by transfection of Hep G2 cells with B beta cDNA, specifically enhanced the synthesis of all three fibrinogen chains (Roy, S. N., Mukhopadhyay, G., and Redman, C. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6389-6393). To determine whether overexpression of any of the three component chains of fibrinogen affects the synthesis of the other two chains, we developed stable Hep G2 cell lines transfected with individual fibrinogen chain cDNAs. As a control, cells were also transfected with expression vector, which did not contain fibrinogen cDNA. Transfection with any fibrinogen cDNA increased the synthesis of all three fibrinogen chains but not of other plasma proteins. Hep G2 cells transfected with B beta cDNA produced 3-4-fold more fibrinogen than control cells, and cells transfected with A alpha or gamma cDNA made about 2-fold more fibrinogen. Northern blot analyses showed that levels of all 3 fibrinogen mRNAs were increased and were highest in Hep G2-B beta cells. Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrated that increased expression of the chains was due to increased transcriptional activity. These studies show that transcription of the three fibrinogen chains is tightly linked, and increased expression of any chain specifically leads to increased synthesis of the other two chains."

Both preparations were characterized and determined to be indistinguishable according to several biochemical criteria. Recombinant NT-4 from E. coli was crystallized in a form suitable for x-ray analysis, and characterization of these crystals indicated that NT-4 was present as a dimer within the asymmetric unit. NT-4 was active in promoting the survival of rat TrkB receptor-expressing fibroblasts, but was inactive on embryonic chicken sensory neurons, unlike the other members of the neurotrophin family and in contrast to the reported activities of partially purified NT-4."
https://openalex.org/W1534162154,"N-Acetyl-L-cysteine serves as an efficient substrate for the rat liver microsomal glutathione transferase with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as second substrate (8.8 +/- 0.37 mumol/min mg). The activity is actually higher than that obtained with glutathione (2-4 mumol/min mg). In examining the activity of liver subcellular fractions, no activity with N-acetyl-L-Cys could be detected in dialyzed or N-ethylmaleimide-treated (in order to remove endogenous glutathione) cytosol. The activity in rat liver microsomes was 0.11 +/- 0.007 mumol/min mg, which is accounted for by the content of microsomal glutathione transferase. Thus, N-acetyl-L-Cys can be used as a specific substrate for determining the conjugating activity of microsomal glutathione transferase. N-Acetyl-L-Cys was also shown to function as a substrate for the enzyme when other second substrates than 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (with varying electrophilicity) are used. The pH dependence of microsomal glutathione transferase was studied. The kcat/Km(1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) was dependent on pH with an apparent pKa of 6, > or = 9, and > or = 8 with saturating glutathione, gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys, and N-acetyl-L- cysteine, respectively. Apparently the enzyme has the ability to lower the pKa of glutathione by 3 orders of magnitude. The kcat/Km(thiol) did not vary appreciably with pH (except for N-acetyl-L-cysteine), indicating that no rate-determining deprotonation occurs on the enzyme itself between pH 5.5 and 9. The abilities of histidine-, lysine-, and arginine-selective reagents to inactivate the enzyme when N-acetyl-L-cysteine and gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys were used as substrates were investigated. The activity toward N-acetyl-L-cysteine was decreased considerably less after treatment with the arginine-selective reagent phenylglyoxal, as compared to the activity toward GSH and gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys. This indicates that an arginine makes contact with gamma-L-Glu residue in GSH. With the other reagent/substrate combinations tested the enzyme was inactivated almost completely. The ability of microsomal glutathione transferase to stabilize the Meisenheimer complex formation between 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and various glutathione analogues, including non-substrate thiols, has been examined. It is shown that, in general, substrates exhibited higher formation constants (approaching 50 mM-1) than non-substrates (4.5 +/- 1.7 mM-1, n = 7), whereas simpler thiols did not yield enzyme-bound complexes. The fact that the enzyme can stabilize Meisenheimer complexes from non-substrate thiol analogues of glutathione offers new possibilities for examining the substrate interactions of glutathione transferases."
https://openalex.org/W1561276947,"We have cloned and determined the genomic organization of the core protein of the chicken transmembrane proteoglycan, syndecan-4. Identification of the initial cDNA was accomplished using polyclonal antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic domain of murine syndecan-1 core protein. The cDNA for chicken syndecan-4 encodes a putative core protein of 197 amino acids which consists of a 19-amino acid signal peptide, a 125-amino acid ectodomain, a 25-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 28-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The predicted molecular mass of the mature core protein is 19,639 daltons. The ectodomain of chicken syndecan-4 core protein contains three potential sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two sites for N-glycosylation, and lacks a dibasic protease cleavage site proximal to the membrane-spanning region found in other syndecan family members. Comparison of the complete amino acid sequence with human syndecan-4 (amphlican (David, G., van der Schueren, B., Marynen, P., Cassiman, J. J., and van den Berghe, H. (1992) J.

Chem. 267, 4870-4877)) indicates an overall identity of 58 and 56%, respectively, with a 91 and 92% identity in the highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The core protein of chicken syndecan-4 synthesized by chicken cells is modified with heparan sulfate side chains yielding a proteoglycan with a molecular mass of > 200 kDa in LMH cells (immortalized male leghorn LM strain hepatocytes) and primary skin fibroblasts. Syndecan-4 isolated from chondrocyte cultures runs as a diffuse band between 100 and 200 kDa. Northern analysis of chicken syndecan-4 indicates three messages with distinct sizes of 0.9, 1.3, and 2.9 kb and a wide mRNA tissue distribution. The chicken syndecan-4 gene is divided into 5 exons encoding distinct regions which contain the signal peptide, the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, a small spacer of unknown function, the glycosylation sites and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains."

Our previous report on the purification of the N-type VDCC (McEnery, M. W., Snowman, A. M., Sharp, A. H., Adams, M. E., and Snyder, S. H. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 11095-11099), has led us to investigate a possible association of CTXR with an endogenous G alpha subunit. The addition of the G-protein activator AIF4- modulated the 125I-CTX binding characteristics of the solubilized CTXR. Further immunological analyses employing G alpha subunit-specific antibodies to monitor the cofractionation of G alpha with 125I-CTX binding activity throughout the purification procedure indicate the selective recovery of Go alpha in the purified CTXR preparation, as neither Gs alpha, Gi alpha, nor G beta gamma could be detected. Furthermore, Go alpha associated with CTXR acted as a substrate for pertussis toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation only upon the addition of exogenous G beta gamma subunits. These results strongly indicate a high affinity complex between an activated Go alpha and CTXR maintained throughout biochemical purification of the 125I-CTX receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1482452342,"The activation of factor VIII (fVIII) by thrombin is associated with heavy chain cleavages at Arg372 and Arg740 and light chain cleavage at Arg1689. In a defined, plasma-free assay of fVIII activation and at physiological ionic strength and pH, heparin inhibited the rate of activation of either human or porcine fVIII by thrombin in either the presence or absence of von Willebrand factor (vWf). The inhibitory effect of heparin was associated with inhibition of all three thrombin-catalyzed bond cleavages. At plasma concentrations of fVIII (approximately 1 nM) and vWf (approximately 35 nM), the rate of fVIII activation was inhibited by 50% at approximately 0.1 unit/ml heparin, which is below the normal range of heparin concentrations in plasma during therapeutic anticoagulation (0.2-0.7 unit/ml). We propose that, in addition to catalyzing the inhibition of thrombin and other intrinsic pathway coagulation proteases by antithrombin, heparin functions as an anticoagulant by direct inhibition of the activation of the fVIII-vWf complex by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1917960874,"Yeast U14 small nuclear (sn) RNA is required for normal processing of rRNA. The sequence and folding properties of U14 were analyzed in the present study, with the aim of defining the structures of natural U14 subspecies and characterizing the folding properties of free U14 RNA. Natural U14 was determined to consist of four subspecies of 125-128 nucleotides, none containing a 5'-cap structure. Length heterogeneity occurs at both ends and is presumed to reflect post-transcriptional processing of U14 precursors. Results from nuclease and chemical probing revealed that U14 has surprisingly little secondary structure overall. Three essential sequence elements conserved among all U14 RNAs occur in regions that are largely single-stranded, i.e. box C, box D, and a 13-nucleotide segment complementary to 18 S rRNA; a non-essential 14-nucleotide sequence complementary to 18 S rRNA is also unpaired. Two non-conserved segments required for activity are part of a stably folded 32-base domain that is unique to yeast U14. Finally, a 5'-, 3'-stem shown earlier to be required for U14 accumulation appears to exist only in precursors to U14 and not in protein-free mature RNA. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of U14 synthesis and function."
https://openalex.org/W1608293413,"To investigate the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cAMP levels in ATP-dependent mitogenesis, Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with an expression vector coding for (i) a mutated regulatory subunit of PKA (PKA mutant) or (ii) a yeast low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase gene (PDE mutant). The PKA mutant showed 70% reduced PKA activity. Phosphodiesterase activity increased 2.5-fold in the PDE mutant, leading to a great reduction of cAMP levels stimulated by ATP and other cAMP-increasing agents. The mitogenic responses of PKA and PDE mutants to insulin, epidermal growth factor, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate were not significantly changed. However, the further stimulation by ATP, ADP, and adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate in the presence of these growth factors was reduced by > 80%. Mitogenic effect of prostaglandin E2, forskolin, cholera toxin, or adenosine was inhibited in both mutants. The mitogenic stimulation by dibutyryl cAMP, which is resistant to phosphodiesterase, was inhibited in the PKA mutant, but not in the PDE mutant. A partial reduction of platelet-derived growth factor- or bombesin-stimulated mitogenesis, which involves protein kinase C as well as the cAMP signal, was observed in the mutants. These genetic results confirm pharmacological data on the role of PKA and cAMP levels in mitogenesis due to ATP and other growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1556868655,"Abstract A calorimetric endotherm occurring at 68 degrees C (the C-transition) has been assigned previously to the integral domain of band 3 and was shown to be shifted to 78 degrees C after covalent binding of 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS). In this study, we correlate the fractional appearance of the shifted C-transition with the fraction of DIDS bound to the band 3 monomer population. Our results show a distinctly nonlinear correlation plot with the appearance of the shifted C-transition lagging behind DIDS labeling of the band 3 monomer population. The lag suggests that both monomers of a band 3 dimer must be labeled by DIDS in order for the shifted C-transition to appear at 78 degrees C, implying that the thermal unfolding of the integral domain of band 3 is modulated by allosteric interactions between subunits. This is the first in situ structural evidence supporting ligand-mediated subunit interactions within a carrier-type transporter protein oligomer."

(1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8553-8557). This gene, now named VCS-alpha 1, belongs to a multigene family (Rosinski-Chupin, I., and Rougeon, F. (1990) DNA Cell Biol. 9, 553-559). We now describe the structure and the expression of a second member (VCS-beta 1) of this family. The two genes differ principally in the protein-coding region, therefore we have named these related genes VCS (variable coding sequence). Genomic clones containing the VCS-beta 1 gene were obtained by screening a lambda EMBL3 library with a probe corresponding to the VCS-alpha 1 cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of VCS-beta 1 predicted a structure containing three exons. This structure, confirmed by sequencing a VCS-beta 1 cDNA obtained by reverse polymerase chain reaction, is identical to the organization of the VCS-alpha 1 gene. Comparison of the VCS-beta 1 and VCS-alpha 1 genomic sequences indicates regions of homology which are unevenly distributed, suggesting a differential evolution of some areas (particularly the third exon) of the VCS genes. The VCS-beta 1 cDNA codes for a proline-rich protein precursor named PR-V beta 1 (148 amino acids, 39.2% proline, 10.8% glycine) and characterized by a secretory signal-peptide and three repeats of a unit rich in proline residues surrounded by two clusters of potential endoprotease cleavage sites. mrNA coding for PR-V beta 1 was detected in the submandibular-sublingual gland complex of male and female rats. PR-V beta 1 is homologous to the proline-rich peptide B isolated from human saliva (Isemura, S., Saitoh, E., and Sanada, K. (1979) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 86, 79-86) and to the submandibular proline-rich protein precursor MSG1 of the mouse (D. Tronik-Le Roux, M. Senorale-Pose, and F. Rougeon, manuscript in preparation). Our observations provide evidence that in addition to the known proline-rich protein genes, there is, in rodent and probably human genomes, another class of genes coding for salivary proline-rich proteins. The high conservation of various sites for bacterial collagenases localized in the repeat region of PR-V beta 1, MSG1, and PRP-B suggest a protective function of these proteins in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W1616611460,"Transcription of the J6 gene (a member of the serpin family) is induced in murine F9 teratocarcinoma cells 24-48 h after retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Previously, we have identified a region of the J6 5'-flanking region (-1050 to -738) that is involved in regulating transcription of this gene. In this report, we show that a RA-induced nuclear protein in the F9 cell extract recognizes the GAGATAG sequence which is repeated four times in this regulatory region of the J6 gene. The kinetics of RA induction of the GAGATAG-binding protein correlates with that of J6 mRNA, suggesting that the GAGATAG-binding protein may be involved in the transactivation of the J6 gene in RA-treated F9 cells. Competition experiments demonstrate further that the RA- induced GAGATAG-binding protein is related to the transcription factors GATA-1 and GATA-2. Furthermore, insertion of the RA regulatory region of the J6 gene into a thymidine kinase promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector causes an increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression by 5-8-fold in human HeLa cells when co-transfected with human GATA-2 or GATA-3 expression vectors. This suggests that the J6 gene is likely to be transactivated by the GATA-2, GATA-3, or related transcription factor, which is activated by retinoic acid during F9 cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1531218445,"The presence of intramolecular disulfides in different functional states of the native glucocorticoid receptor in the absence of added oxidants has been examined on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Possible disulfides were trapped by the reaction of thiols in crude receptor solutions with methyl methanethiolsulfonate or iodoacetamide. The presence of diffuse bands at lower molecular weights than either the fully reduced or the thiol-blocked species for both the intact 98-kDa receptor and the 42-kDa chymotryptic fragment was diagnostic of an intramolecular disulfide(s) that had undergone thiol-disulfide rearrangements. However, both the rearrangements and the formation of intramolecular disulfides were found to occur only with denatured receptors during gel analysis. It appears that the thiols normally complexed with zinc in the zinc fingers may be recruited for disulfide bond formation. Finally, even when a documented intramolecular disulfide was formed in solutions of the native protein, thiol-disulfide rearrangements did not occur. The tertiary structure of the receptor is thus constituted in a manner that not only limits the formation of disulfides but also prevents the usually facile rearrangements of disulfide bond-containing structures to receptor forms that may have greatly reduced activity. Therefore, although intramolecular disulfide bonds may be of transitory importance, the structural or functional changes of native glucocorticoid receptors that are associated with steroid binding, activation, and dissociation of heat shock protein 90 neither involve nor require the formation or reduction of stable intramolecular disulfides."
https://openalex.org/W1600385513,"Two mutations in vaccinia virus topoisomerase I, K167D and G226N, have been characterized. SOS induction was observed in Escherichia coli expressing vaccinia topoisomerase I with either one of these mutations. The mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneity and compared with the wild type enzyme for relaxation activity and the partial activities of substrate binding, site-specific DNA cleavage and DNA religation to determine the mechanism of SOS induction. The K167D mutant enzyme had reduced binding affinity for the DNA substrate with a Kapp that was 10-fold higher than wild type. Nevertheless, in reactions with high enzyme concentration, its substrate cleavage activity was 90% that of wild type. The G226N mutant enzyme had virtually wild type binding and cleavage activities. However, intermolecular religation by these two mutants were observed to be significantly reduced. The cleavage complexes formed with the K167D and G226N mutants were more stable to high salt than the wild type cleavable complex. We propose that these mutants in vivo induce the SOS response in E. coli due to the shift of topoisomerase cleavage-religation equilibrium towards cleavage and increased stability of the cleavage complex. The mutation thus has a similar effect as the topoisomerase-targeting inhibitors that turn topoisomerases into DNA damaging agents."

The open reading frame encodes a protein of 320 amino acids with a molecular mass of 32,752 Da; the protein includes hydrophobic segments at both a NH2- and a COOH-terminal ends. By an Edman degradation analysis of S-pyridylethylated gp64 and its COOH-terminal peptide, it was found that the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments are both removed from the precursor protein of gp64. The COOH-terminal segment was isolated from a lysyl endopeptidase digest of gp64 by an affinity method. The COOH-terminal segment was identified at positions 266-279 in the primary sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence. The mature gp64 consisted of 279 amino acid residues and extremely rich in Cys residues (36 Cys/279 amino acids = 12.9%). Although there was already maximal accumulation of gp64 mRNA in vegetative cells, the protein reached a maximal level during aggregation stage, decreased, and then leveled off through the developmental cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1503244293,"The eukaryotic multicatalytic proteinase complex (proteasome) is a high molecular mass enzyme which contains 13-15 nonidentical subunits of similar size (molecular masses of 21-31 kDa), but differing widely in net charge (isoelectric points ranging from 3 to 10). At least four catalytic components termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing, and caseinolytic are associated with the proteinase. The catalytic nature of the components is unknown, since sequences of cloned subunits bear no homology to known proteinases and proteolytically active subunits have not been isolated. Analysis of the relationship between structure and catalytic function would be greatly facilitated if a means for reversibly dissociating and reassociating the proteinase were available. We provide the first evidence of reassembly of dissociated multicatalytic proteinase complex into a functional molecule. Incubation with the organic mercurial, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid disrupts in a concentration-dependent manner the quaternary structure of the enzyme, leading to formation of a heterogeneous population of subunits. Dissociation of the complex coincides with progressive loss of chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities. The caseinolytic activity of the residual undissociated enzyme is markedly activated. Exposure of the dissociated enzyme to dithiothreitol restores the catalytic profile and reassociates the enzyme. Evidence for catalytically active subcomplexes was not obtained indicating that structural integrity may be necessary for expression of all defined activities."
https://openalex.org/W1588935987,"Triacylglycerol is synthesized from the precursors sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and and palmitoyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20). Isolated 3T3-L1 adipocyte microsomal vesicles from cells pulse-labeled with L-[35S]methionine were found to release microsomal proteins into a low density form during the synthesis of triacylglycerol. The proteins released, which represent a subset of those present in the labeled microsomes, include a 62-kDa protein found in high concentration in mature fat droplets. The formation of the triacylglycerol-protein complexes was dependent on time and temperature, was not stimulated by cytosol, and required ATP as well as diacylglycerol and palmitoyl-CoA. Only nucleoside triphosphates and not non-hydrolyzable analogues could replace ATP in the reaction. Unlike the enzyme reaction that measures the synthesis of triacylglycerol, the formation of low density membrane is thus dependent on ATP hydrolysis as well as enzyme substrates. The newly formed, low density particles are selectively enriched in triacylglycerol synthesized during the reaction as well as that synthesized prior to the reaction. The cell-free system described thus appears to represent an early adipogenic event leading to the lipid vacuoles found in mature adipocytes."
