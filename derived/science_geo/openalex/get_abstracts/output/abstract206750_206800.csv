https://openalex.org/W2058640589,Five inbred strains of mice differed significantly in serum cholesterol level. Cholesterol levels ranged from 128 mg/100 ml in C57B1/6 mice to 208 mg/100 ml in C3H mice. Cholesterol level was significantly higher in males than in females. The cholesterol level of 2-month-old mice did not differ from that of 1-year-old mice.

During the hours preceding onset of large seizures, ""antidromic"" inhibition of evoked cortical activity is reduced. The similarity of these effects to those observed in spinal cord suggests operation of similar inhibitory transmitters in the two parts of the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2067178339,"Novobiocin affects a wide variety of biochemical and biological processes in bacteria, whereas most other antibiotics seem to affect one specific process. All of the processes known to be affected by novobiocin require magnesium ions, and in a number of cases magnesium deficiency mimics the action of the antibiotic. Evidence is presented that novobiocin complexes with magnesium ions."

https://openalex.org/W2089755040,Discrete lesion of the genual portion of the anterior cingulate gyrus in three dogs produced temporary disinhibition of preoperatively trained inhibitory food conditioned responses. This disinhibition was accompanied by increase in general behavior motivated by food reinforcement. Lesion of the posterior cingulate gyrus in three other dogs did not produce such impairment.
https://openalex.org/W2031434881,"Coumarin and herniarin are formed in lavender from labeled o- and p-coumaric acids, respectively. At least part of the herniarin exists in lavender as a glycoside, presumably a 4-methoxycoumarinic acid glycoside, which yields free herniarin on hydrolysis. Biosynthesis of herniarin by successive para- and ortho- hydroxylation of cinnamic acid is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2035492958,"WE wish to report anthelmintic activity of a novel class of chemical compounds (patent pending) for which compound I, (R = ClC2H4−), will serve as an example. This compound, bearing our code number 96H60, is O, O di-(2-chlorethyl) O-(3-chloro-4-methylcoumarin-7-yl) phosphate, for which the common name ‘Haloxon’ is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2080971175,"ALTHOUGH numerous methods are available for assessing the potency of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in vivo, these almost invariably rely either on the direct measurement of tissue levels of catecholamine, serotonin or some metabolite thereof1, or on the ability of the inhibitor to potentiate or nullify the effects of some other drug such as 5-hydroxytryptophan, tryptamine or reserpine2. Direct behavioural effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors at low doses are usually slight or detectable only by use of conditioned response techniques3."
https://openalex.org/W2007445504,"POLARIZED light studies1,2 have indicated that most or all lipid moieties of the myelin sheath are radially arranged. Finean3,4 correlated the X-ray diffraction patterns of fresh and lipid-solvent extracted myelin with known data about the form and size of lipid molecules and suggested that a phospholipid-cholesterol complex forms a part of myelin. According to this notion the long chain of the phospholipid moiety is lying radially with curling of the polar end group, so that the phosphate might serve to bind the lipid to protein, whereas the positively charged part of the molecule is closely associated with the hydroxyl group of cholesterol. The complex would have, therefore, the form of a U, with the cholesterol and the hydrocarbon chain of the phospholipid situated in a parallel fashion and in a radial direction."

Since similar effects were produced in rats housed in stainless steel cages by increasing the zinc in their diets, it was concluded that zinc consumed by chewing on zinc-coated cages was responsible for the abnormalities noted."
https://openalex.org/W2079420285,"IT has previously been shown that the alkoxyglycerol esters to a certain extent prevent leuco- and thrombo-cytopenia1. During 1955–56 about 300 patients, suffering from cancer of the uterine cervix, were given alkoxyglycerol esters for the whole period of treatment with radium and X-rays. The white cell and the thrombocyte counts were higher for the ‘prophylactic group’, that is, patients treated with alkoxyglycerol esters, than for the controls, that is, the group treated with irradiation only, both during the treatment and after its termination."

https://openalex.org/W1997940198,Data which represent the relation between modulation amplitude and frequency of a sinusoidally modulated light stimulus for constant flicker appearance have been employed to predict characteristics of rectangular waveforms which will be of the same flicker appearance. Predictions are compared with the results of an experiment in which such rectangular waveforms were employed.

It was found that the A antigen in epithelial tissues was not soluble in ethanol and thus differed from the A antigen found in the vascular endothelium, which was removed by ethanol treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2057140237,"IT has been shown by Cox1 that pregnane-3α,17α,-20α-triol (pregnanetriol) and related compounds react with 70 per cent ortho-phosphoric acid to produce a brilliant fluorescence. Herman and Bruton2,3 have shown that pregnanetriol and related compounds and digitalis compounds react intensely with antimony pentachloride, which thus can be used as a paper chromatographic detecting agent. Since pregnanetriol reacts with both phosphoric acid and antimony pentachloride, by analogy, those steroids which react strongly with antimony pentachloride could be expected to react with 70 per cent ortho-phosphoric acid. Heftmann et al.4 have noted briefly that aniline-phosphoric acid is useful as a detecting agent for cardiac glycosides."
