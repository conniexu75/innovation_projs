https://openalex.org/W2154945114,"Several families have been reported with autosomal-dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), genetically linked to chromosome 9p21. Here, we report an expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (23.5%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2150523249,"The chromosome 9p21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) locus contains one of the last major unidentified autosomal-dominant genes underlying these common neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date."
https://openalex.org/W2040574649,"A key obstacle to understanding neural circuits in the cerebral cortex is that of unraveling the diversity of GABAergic interneurons. This diversity poses general questions for neural circuit analysis: how are these interneuron cell types generated and assembled into stereotyped local circuits and how do they differentially contribute to circuit operations that underlie cortical functions ranging from perception to cognition? Using genetic engineering in mice, we have generated and characterized approximately 20 Cre and inducible CreER knockin driver lines that reliably target major classes and lineages of GABAergic neurons. More select populations are captured by intersection of Cre and Flp drivers. Genetic targeting allows reliable identification, monitoring, and manipulation of cortical GABAergic neurons, thereby enabling a systematic and comprehensive analysis from cell fate specification, migration, and connectivity, to their functions in network dynamics and behavior. As such, this approach will accelerate the study of GABAergic circuits throughout the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W2041345682,"Cyclic dinucleotides, used as signalling molecules in bacteria but not in mammalian cells, are recognized by the mammalian innate immune system, triggering the production of type I interferon. Here the mammalian protein STING (stimulator of IFN genes) is identified as the direct molecular sensor for cyclic diguanylate monophosphate and other cyclic dinucleotides. Previously, STING was thought to act solely as a downstream signalling adaptor. Cyclic dinucleotides are potent immunostimulants, and may prove useful therapeutically. The innate immune system detects infection by using germline-encoded receptors that are specific for conserved microbial molecules. The recognition of microbial ligands leads to the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), that are essential for successful pathogen elimination. Cytosolic detection of pathogen-derived DNA is one major mechanism of inducing IFN production1,2, and this process requires signalling through TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its downstream transcription factor, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In addition, a transmembrane protein called STING (stimulator of IFN genes; also known as MITA, ERIS, MPYS and TMEM173) functions as an essential signalling adaptor, linking the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1–IRF3 signalling axis3,4,5,6,7. Recently, unique nucleic acids called cyclic dinucleotides, which function as conserved signalling molecules in bacteria8, have also been shown to induce a STING-dependent type I IFN response9,10,11,12. However, a mammalian sensor of cyclic dinucleotides has not been identified. Here we report evidence that STING itself is an innate immune sensor of cyclic dinucleotides. We demonstrate that STING binds directly to radiolabelled cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and we show that unlabelled cyclic dinucleotides, but not other nucleotides or nucleic acids, compete with c-di-GMP for binding to STING. Furthermore, we identify mutations in STING that selectively affect the response to cyclic dinucleotides without affecting the response to DNA. Thus, STING seems to function as a direct sensor of cyclic dinucleotides, in addition to its established role as a signalling adaptor in the IFN response to cytosolic DNA. Cyclic dinucleotides have shown promise as novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutics9,13, and our results provide insight into the mechanism by which cyclic dinucleotides are sensed by the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2060141463,"John Doebley and colleagues have identified a transposon insertion in the maize domestication gene, tb1, that acts as a regulatory enhancer. The transposon insertion appears to be a causative variant that partially explains major changes in plant architecture during maize domestication. Genetic diversity created by transposable elements is an important source of functional variation upon which selection acts during evolution1,2,3,4,5,6. Transposable elements are associated with adaptation to temperate climates in Drosophila7, a SINE element is associated with the domestication of small dog breeds from the gray wolf8 and there is evidence that transposable elements were targets of selection during human evolution9. Although the list of examples of transposable elements associated with host gene function continues to grow, proof that transposable elements are causative and not just correlated with functional variation is limited. Here we show that a transposable element (Hopscotch) inserted in a regulatory region of the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1 (tb1), acts as an enhancer of gene expression and partially explains the increased apical dominance in maize compared to its progenitor, teosinte. Molecular dating indicates that the Hopscotch insertion predates maize domestication by at least 10,000 years, indicating that selection acted on standing variation rather than new mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2156743548,"It takes effort and time to tame one's impulses. Although medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is broadly implicated in effortful control over behavior, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is specifically thought to contribute by acting as a brake on cortico-striatal function during decision conflict, buying time until the right decision can be made. Using the drift diffusion model of decision making, we found that trial-to-trial increases in mPFC activity (EEG theta power, 4-8 Hz) were related to an increased threshold for evidence accumulation (decision threshold) as a function of conflict. Deep brain stimulation of the STN in individuals with Parkinson's disease reversed this relationship, resulting in impulsive choice. In addition, intracranial recordings of the STN area revealed increased activity (2.5-5 Hz) during these same high-conflict decisions. Activity in these slow frequency bands may reflect a neural substrate for cortico-basal ganglia communication regulating decision processes."

https://openalex.org/W2099598799,"Martin Tobin and colleagues report a meta-analysis of 23 genome-wide association studies for pulmonary function. They identify 16 loci newly associated with variation in two cross-sectional measures of lung function, used to define airway obstruction and to grade the severity of obstruction. Pulmonary function measures reflect respiratory health and are used in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We tested genome-wide association with forced expiratory volume in 1 second and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity in 48,201 individuals of European ancestry with follow up of the top associations in up to an additional 46,411 individuals. We identified new regions showing association (combined P < 5 × 10−8) with pulmonary function in or near MFAP2, TGFB2, HDAC4, RARB, MECOM (also known as EVI1), SPATA9, ARMC2, NCR3, ZKSCAN3, CDC123, C10orf11, LRP1, CCDC38, MMP15, CFDP1 and KCNE2. Identification of these 16 new loci may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating pulmonary function and into molecular targets for future therapy to alleviate reduced lung function."
https://openalex.org/W2053665358,"The binding of helicase to viral RNA and the resulting activation of the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) are central to the innate immune response to viral infection. The structure of the RIG-I helicase domain with its repressor domain, in complex with double-stranded RNA, has now been determined. The structure suggests a mechanism of dsRNA translocation. Because RIG-I is homologous to many other helicases, such as Dicer of the RNAi machinery and the FANCM helicases involved in DNA repair, the structure should prove relevant to helicases in these other biological processes. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I; also known as DDX58) is a cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptor that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs to differentiate between viral and cellular RNAs. RIG-I is activated by blunt-ended double-stranded (ds)RNA with or without a 5′-triphosphate (ppp), by single-stranded RNA marked by a 5′-ppp1 and by polyuridine sequences2,3. Upon binding to such PAMP motifs, RIG-I initiates a signalling cascade that induces innate immune defences and inflammatory cytokines to establish an antiviral state. The RIG-I pathway is highly regulated and aberrant signalling leads to apoptosis, altered cell differentiation, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and cancer4,5. The helicase and repressor domains (RD) of RIG-I recognize dsRNA and 5′-ppp RNA to activate the two amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) for signalling. Here, to understand the synergy between the helicase and the RD for RNA binding, and the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to RIG-I activation, we determined the structure of human RIG-I helicase-RD in complex with dsRNA and an ATP analogue. The helicase-RD organizes into a ring around dsRNA, capping one end, while contacting both strands using previously uncharacterized motifs to recognize dsRNA. Small-angle X-ray scattering, limited proteolysis and differential scanning fluorimetry indicate that RIG-I is in an extended and flexible conformation that compacts upon binding RNA. These results provide a detailed view of the role of helicase in dsRNA recognition, the synergy between the RD and the helicase for RNA binding and the organization of full-length RIG-I bound to dsRNA, and provide evidence of a conformational change upon RNA binding. The RIG-I helicase-RD structure is consistent with dsRNA translocation without unwinding and cooperative binding to RNA. The structure yields unprecedented insight into innate immunity and has a broader impact on other areas of biology, including RNA interference and DNA repair, which utilize homologous helicase domains within DICER and FANCM."
https://openalex.org/W2038125044,"Adipose tissue mass is determined by the storage and removal of triglycerides in adipocytes. Little is known, however, about adipose lipid turnover in humans in health and pathology. To study this in vivo, here we determined lipid age by measuring (14)C derived from above ground nuclear bomb tests in adipocyte lipids. We report that during the average ten-year lifespan of human adipocytes, triglycerides are renewed six times. Lipid age is independent of adipocyte size, is very stable across a wide range of adult ages and does not differ between genders. Adipocyte lipid turnover, however, is strongly related to conditions with disturbed lipid metabolism. In obesity, triglyceride removal rate (lipolysis followed by oxidation) is decreased and the amount of triglycerides stored each year is increased. In contrast, both lipid removal and storage rates are decreased in non-obese patients diagnosed with the most common hereditary form of dyslipidaemia, familial combined hyperlipidaemia. Lipid removal rate is positively correlated with the capacity of adipocytes to break down triglycerides, as assessed through lipolysis, and is inversely related to insulin resistance. Our data support a mechanism in which adipocyte lipid storage and removal have different roles in health and pathology. High storage but low triglyceride removal promotes fat tissue accumulation and obesity. Reduction of both triglyceride storage and removal decreases lipid shunting through adipose tissue and thus promotes dyslipidaemia. We identify adipocyte lipid turnover as a novel target for prevention and treatment of metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2050991123,"Backbone N-methylation is common among peptide natural products and has a substantial impact on both the physical properties and the conformational states of cyclic peptides. However, the specific impact of N-methylation on passive membrane diffusion in cyclic peptides has not been investigated systematically. Here we report a method for the selective, on-resin N-methylation of cyclic peptides to generate compounds with drug-like membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. The selectivity and degree of N-methylation of the cyclic peptide was dependent on backbone stereochemistry, suggesting that conformation dictates the regiochemistry of the N-methylation reaction. The permeabilities of the N-methyl variants were corroborated by computational studies on a 1,024-member virtual library of N-methyl cyclic peptides. One of the most permeable compounds, a cyclic hexapeptide (molecular mass = 755 Da) with three N-methyl groups, showed an oral bioavailability of 28% in rat."
https://openalex.org/W2108888559,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) mazEF is a stress-induced toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. The toxin MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences. Here, we show that MazF cleaves at ACA sites at or closely upstream of the AUG start codon of some specific mRNAs and thereby generates leaderless mRNAs. Moreover, we provide evidence that MazF also targets 16S rRNA within 30S ribosomal subunits at the decoding center, thereby removing 43 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus. As this region comprises the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) sequence that is required for translation initiation on canonical mRNAs, a subpopulation of ribosomes is formed that selectively translates the described leaderless mRNAs both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we have discovered a modified translation machinery that is generated in response to MazF induction and that probably serves for stress adaptation in Escherichia coli.

Among these, one of the most studied is the chromosomal toxin-antitoxin system mazEF, which was the first to be described as regulatable and responsible for bacterial programmed cell death (Aizenman et al., 1996Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. An Escherichia coli chromosomal “addiction module” regulated by guanosine [corrected] 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate: a model for programmed bacterial cell death.Proc. Natl.

Bacterial programmed cell death and multicellular behavior in bacteria.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). E. coli mazEF encodes the labile antitoxin MazE and the stable toxin MazF. Both mazE and mazF are coexpressed and negatively autoregulated at transcriptional level (Marianovsky et al., 2001Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. The regulation of the Escherichia coli mazEF promoter involves an unusual alternating palindrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). E. coli mazEF is triggered by various stressful conditions, as treatment with antibiotics affecting transcription or translation (Hazan et al., 2004Hazan R. Sat B. Engelberg-Kulka H. Escherichia coli mazEF-mediated cell death is triggered by various stressful conditions.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3663-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), or by an increase of ppGpp upon severe amino acid starvation (Aizenman et al., 1996Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. An Escherichia coli chromosomal “addiction module” regulated by guanosine [corrected] 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate: a model for programmed bacterial cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Such stressful conditions prevent mazEF expression; thereby, the short-lived antitoxin MazE is degraded by the ATP-dependent ClpAP serine protease (Aizenman et al., 1996Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. An Escherichia coli chromosomal “addiction module” regulated by guanosine [corrected] 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate: a model for programmed bacterial cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), permitting the stable MazF to exert its toxic effect (Engelberg-Kulka et al., 2006Engelberg-Kulka H. Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. Bacterial programmed cell death and multicellular behavior in bacteria.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e135Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). mazEF-mediated cell death was also reported as a population phenomenon requiring a quorum-sensing factor called extracellular death factor (EDF) (Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. Gaathon A. Carmeli S. Engelberg-Kulka H. A linear pentapeptide is a quorum-sensing factor required for mazEF-mediated cell death in Escherichia coli.Science. 2007; 318: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). MazF is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J.J. Zhang Y.L. Inouye M.

As previously reported (Christensen et al., 2003Christensen S.K. Pedersen K. Hansen F.G. Gerdes K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32300-32306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), MazF induction causes inhibition of protein synthesis. However, we have recently shown that, surprisingly, this inhibition was not complete; though MazF led to inhibition of synthesis of most proteins (about 90%), it selectively enabled specific synthesis of about 10% of proteins (Amitai et al., 2009Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hananya-Meltabashi M. Sacher A. Engelberg-Kulka H. Escherichia coli MazF leads to the simultaneous selective synthesis of both “death proteins” and “survival proteins”.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000390Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Some of those proteins were required for death of most cells within a population. However, we also found that MazF enabled the synthesis of proteins that permitted survival of a small subpopulation under stressful conditions that cause mazEF-mediated cell death for the majority of the population. Among the proteins involved in cell death were: (1) YfiD, a glycine radical protein known to be able to replace the oxidatively damaged pyruvate formate-lyase subunit (Wagner et al., 2001Wagner A.F. Schultz S. Bomke J. Pils T. Lehmann W.D. Knappe J. YfiD of Escherichia coli and Y06I of bacteriophage T4 as autonomous glycyl radical cofactors reconstituting the catalytic center of oxygen-fragmented pyruvate formate-lyase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and (2) YfbU, a protein of unknown function (Amitai et al., 2009Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hananya-Meltabashi M. Sacher A. Engelberg-Kulka H. Escherichia coli MazF leads to the simultaneous selective synthesis of both “death proteins” and “survival proteins”.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000390Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among the proteins involved in cell survival were: (1) DeoC, a deoxy ribose-phosphate aldolase known to participate in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleosides (Hammer-Jespersen et al., 1971Hammer-Jespersen K. Munch-Petersen A. Schwartz M. Nygaard P. Induction of enzymes involed in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides in Escherichia coli K 12.Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and RsuA, a protein known to catalyze the pseudouridylation at position 516 in the 16S RNA (Wrzesinski et al., 1995Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Nurse K. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Purification, cloning, and properties of the 16S RNA pseudouridine 516 synthase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8904-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because several ACA sites—the potential MazF cleavage sites—are located in the corresponding mRNAs, we were intrigued by the mechanism that is responsible for selective synthesis of these proteins. Here, we have elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism leading to selective translation of a particular set of mRNAs upon MazF induction in E. coli. We found that, due to its endoribonucleolytic activity, MazF cleaves at ACA sites at or closely upstream of the AUG start codon of specific mRNAs. Thereby, short-leadered and leaderless mRNAs (lmRNAs) are generated, respectively. Surprisingly, the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit is another target of MazF endoribonuclease. Specifically, the toxin cleaves at an ACA triplet in the 16S rRNA located 5′ of helix 45. Thus, this cleavage leads to loss of 43 nucleotides (nts) at the 3′ terminus of 16S rRNA, including helix 45 and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (aSD) sequence. As the SD-aSD interaction is required for translation initiation on canonical ribosome-binding sites, truncation of 16S rRNA yields a specialized protein synthesis machinery designated as “stress-ribosome,” which selectively translates lmRNAs generated by MazF. Because MazF is triggered under stressful conditions, our results uncovered a hitherto uncharacterized stress adaptation mechanism in E. coli, which is based on generation of a heterogeneous ribosome population that provides a means for selective synthesis of a subclass of proteins. Recent studies revealed that several mRNAs are translated upon induction of mazF in vivo (Amitai et al., 2009Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hananya-Meltabashi M. Sacher A. Engelberg-Kulka H. Escherichia coli MazF leads to the simultaneous selective synthesis of both “death proteins” and “survival proteins”.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000390Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the presence of potential MazF cleavage sites within these mRNAs would imply their immediate degradation following MazF cleavage. As several lines of evidence indicate that MazF cleaves only at ACA sequences located within unstructured regions and that stable secondary structures can shield the sites of cleavage (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang J.J.

Microbiol. 2008; 69: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we first examined whether some candidate mRNAs are protected from mRNA cleavage. Therefore, we performed primer extension analysis on total RNA prepared upon mazF overexpression in vivo using the same conditions that determined the synthesis of the respective proteins (Amitai et al., 2009Amitai S.

In brief, mazF expression was induced in E. coli strain MC4100relA+ harboring plasmid pSA1 that bears an IPTG-inducible mazF gene. Fifteen minutes thereafter, total RNA was purified and primer extension analysis was performed employing specific primers for yfiD (R48) (Table S1 available online and Figure 1A , lanes 5 and 6), rpsU (Y50) (Table S1 and Figure 1C, lanes 5 and 6), and yfbU (B6) (Table S1 and Figures S1C and S1D) mRNAs. In absence of mazF overexpression, primer extension reactions for yfiD mRNA (Figures 1A, lane 5, and 1B) and rpsU mRNA (Figures 1C, lane 5, and 1D) generate signals that correspond to the 5′ termini of the transcripts synthesized from the annotated promoters (PyfiD1 and PrpsU) (Green et al., 1998Green J.

In addition, we determined a second transcriptional start point for yfiD mRNA, giving rise to an mRNA harboring a 57 nt long 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) (PyfiD2) (Figures 1A, lane 5, and 1B). Surprisingly, upon induction of mazF expression, primer extension resulted in generation of cDNAs of 128 and 97 nts in length, which correspond to cleavage of yfiD mRNA at two ACA triplets 30 nts and directly upstream of the AUG start codon (Figures 1A, lane 6, and 1B). In contrast, we did not observe cleavage at two additional ACA sequences located 39 nts upstream and 3 nts downstream of the start codon (Figures 1A, lane 6, and 1B). We obtained similar results when primer extension was performed with the rpsU-specific primer (Figure 1C, lane 6). Again, MazF activity resulted in cleavage of rpsU mRNA at the ACA located directly upstream of the start codon (Figures 1C, lane 6, and 1D). Corresponding to absence of ACAs in the coding sequence of rpsU mRNA, we did not observe MazF cleavage within this region (Figures 1C, lane 6). To verify MazF cleavage at the sites determined in vivo, in addition, in vitro cleavage assays have been performed on yfiD and rpsU mRNAs. In vitro-transcribed mRNAs were incubated with purified MazF protein at 37°C. Subsequent primer extension analyses revealed MazF cleavage at the same positions as observed in vivo (Figures S1A and S1B, lane 7).Figure S1In Vitro MazF Cleavage on Canonical yfiD and rpsU mRNAs, Determination of the 5′ Terminus, and Depiction of the Genomic Organization and Proximal Coding Region of the yfbU mRNA, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Canonical yfiD (A) and rpsU (B) mRNAs containing 5′-UTRs of 74 nucleotides and 135 nucleotides in length, respectively, were in vitro transcribed employing the T7-RNA polymerase and incubated with purified protein MazF as described in Experimental Procedures.

(D) A schematic depiction of the genomic organization, the transcriptional start point and the upstream sequence (in gray) and the proximal coding region (in black) of yfbU mRNA is shown. Potential ACA-sites directly upstream of the AUG start codon are underlined. Surprisingly, primer extension using total RNA purified from cells with and without mazF overexpression employing a yfbU specific primer (B6) (Table S1) yielded a stop signal that corresponds to the A of the AUG start codon in both cases (Figure S1C, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that, in vivo, the yfbU mRNA might be transcribed as lmRNA. To entirely exclude MazF cleavage at the ACA present in the yfbU mRNA just upstream of the start codon (Figure S1D), primer extension analysis was repeated on total RNA purified from strain MC4100relA+ΔmazEF (Figure S1C, lane 7). Likewise, the extension signal indicates the presence of a leaderless yfbU mRNA (Figure S1C, lane 7). This result was verified by primer extension analysis at 55°C employing the heat stable reverse transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen) using a second yfbU specific primer (I6) (Table S1). As shown in Figure S1C, primer extension reactions generated cDNAs of 88 nts in length, again corresponding to transcription starting directly at the AUG codon (Figure S1C, lanes 8 and 9). Taken together, these results tempted us to speculate that mazF induction results in selective translation of lmRNAs, which are either generally present, like yfbU mRNA, or generated by MazF, as shown for yfiD and rpsU mRNAs. lmRNAs are selectively translated in the absence of ribosomal proteins S1 and/or S2 (Moll et al., 2002Moll I. Grill S. Gründling A. Bläsi U. Effects of ribosomal proteins S1, S2 and the DeaD/CsdA DEAD-box helicase on translation of leaderless and canonical mRNAs in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that lmRNAs are selectively translated by protein-depleted ribosomes, which are formed upon treatment of E. coli cells with the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin (Ksg) in vivo (Kaberdina et al., 2009Kaberdina A.C. Szaflarski W. Nierhaus K.H. Moll I. An unexpected type of ribosomes induced by kasugamycin: a look into ancestral times of protein synthesis?.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that the mazEF module can be triggered by antibiotics targeting the ribosome (Sat et al., 2001Sat B. Hazan R. Fisher T. Khaner H. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Programmed cell death in Escherichia coli: some antibiotics can trigger mazEF lethality.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and that MazF activity results in formation of lmRNAs, we hypothesized that MazF could likewise affect the protein synthesis machinery, thus rendering it selective for lmRNAs. To verify this notion, pulse labeling was performed employing E. coli strain MC4100relA+ harboring plasmid pSA1, which encodes the inducible mazF gene, and plasmid pKTplaccI. Plasmid pKTplaccI encodes the leaderless cI-lacZ fusion gene, giving rise to the 122.4 kD CI-LacZ fusion protein (Grill et al., 2000Grill S. Gualerzi C.O. Londei P. Bläsi U. Selective stimulation of translation of leaderless mRNA by initiation factor 2: evolutionary implications for translation.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The strain was grown in M9 minimal medium as specified in the Experimental Procedures. At OD600 of 0.5, the culture was divided and IPTG was added to one half to induce mazF expression. Before and 15 and 30 min after induction, pulse labeling was performed. Upon precipitation and separation of labeled proteins by SDS-PAGE, the autoradiography shown in Figure 2 reveals selective translation of the leaderless cI-lacZ mRNA upon overexpression of mazF. In contrast, translation of bulk mRNA is severely inhibited (Figure 2, lanes 5 and 6). It has to be noted that, despite induction of mazF overexpression, the protein cannot be detected (Figure 2, lanes 5 and 6) (Amitai et al., 2009Amitai S. Kolodkin-Gal I. Hananya-Meltabashi M. Sacher A. Engelberg-Kulka H. Escherichia coli MazF leads to the simultaneous selective synthesis of both “death proteins” and “survival proteins”.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000390Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Taken together, MazF-mediated generation and selective translation of lmRNAs suggest that the endoribonuclease might directly affect ribosomes, as rRNA could represent a potential target. As indicated in the structure of the 30S ribosomal subunit (Figure 3A ), several ACA triplets are present in the 16S rRNA, most of which are located within structured regions or are protected by ribosomal proteins. However, as shown in the secondary structure of the 3′-terminal 16S rRNA, two accessible ACA sites are located at positions 1500–1502 and 1396–1398 (Figure 3B). Cleavage at the latter site would be detrimental for ribosome activity, as it would result in loss of helix 44, which provides most intersubunit bridges (Gabashvili et al., 2000Gabashvili I.S. Agrawal R.K. Spahn C.M. Grassucci R.A. Svergun D.I. Frank J. Penczek P. Solution structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome at 11.5 A resolution.Cell. 2000; 100: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, given that this region is enclosed by tRNA and mRNA (Woodcock et al., 1991Woodcock J. Moazed D. Cannon M. Davies J. Noller H.F.

Rees B. Moras D. Yusupov M. Structural basis for messenger RNA movement on the ribosome.Nature. 2006; 444: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that translationally active ribosomes might be protected at this position. In contrast, cleavage at position 1500–1502 in close proximity to the site for colicin E3 cleavage (between nts A1493 and G1494) (Figure 3B; Senior and Holland, 1971Senior B.W. Holland I.B. Effect of colicin E3 upon the 30S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) would result in loss of the 3′ terminus of 16S rRNA containing helix 45 and the aSD sequence. The SD-aSD interaction is important for translation initiation complex formation on canonical mRNAs comprising structured 5′"

To identify new risk variants for cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, we performed a genome-wide association study of 16 million SNPs identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders. We imputed genotypes for 41,675 Illumina SNP chip-typed Icelanders and their relatives. In the discovery phase, the strongest signal came from rs78378222[C] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36, P = 5.2 × 10−17), which has a frequency of 0.0192 in the Icelandic population. We then confirmed this association in non-Icelandic samples (OR = 1.75, P = 0.0060; overall OR = 2.16, P = 2.2 × 10−20). rs78378222 is in the 3′ untranslated region of TP53 and changes the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, resulting in impaired 3′-end processing of TP53 mRNA. Investigation of other tumor types identified associations of this SNP with prostate cancer (OR = 1.44, P = 2.4 × 10−6), glioma (OR = 2.35, P = 1.0 × 10−5) and colorectal adenoma (OR = 1.39, P = 1.6 × 10−4). However, we observed no effect for breast cancer, a common Li-Fraumeni syndrome tumor (OR = 1.06, P = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.88–1.27)."
https://openalex.org/W2029431941,"Most cancers are characterized by multiple molecular alterations, but identification of the key proteins involved in these signaling pathways is currently beyond reach. We show that the inhibitor PU-H71 preferentially targets tumor-enriched Hsp90 complexes and affinity captures Hsp90-dependent oncogenic client proteins. We have used PU-H71 affinity capture to design a proteomic approach that, when combined with bioinformatic pathway analysis, identifies dysregulated signaling networks and key oncoproteins in chronic myeloid leukemia. The identified interactome overlaps with the well-characterized altered proteome in this cancer, indicating that this method can provide global insights into the biology of individual tumors, including primary patient specimens. In addition, we show that this approach can be used to identify previously uncharacterized oncoproteins and mechanisms, potentially leading to new targeted therapies. We further show that the abundance of the PU-H71-enriched Hsp90 species, which is not dictated by Hsp90 expression alone, is predictive of the cell's sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition."

Similar to GluN1, GluN2B deletion increases the number of functional synapses, while GluN2A deletion increases the strength of unitary connections without affecting the number of functional synapses. We propose a model of excitatory synapse maturation in which baseline activation of GluN2B-containing receptors prevents premature synapse maturation until correlated activity allows induction of functional synapses.

A central feature characterizing the maturation of glutamatergic synapses is a shift from predominantly N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated neurotransmission during the first few postnatal weeks in rodents (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C.

Experience-driven activity through NMDA receptors promotes the maturation of excitatory circuitry during brain development (Durand et al., 1996Durand G.M. Kovalchuk Y. Konnerth A.

Ehlers M.D. Huganir R.L. Regulation of morphological postsynaptic silent synapses in developing hippocampal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play well-known roles in the bidirectional regulation of synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) content at mature hippocampal synapses through the processes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. LTP and LTD: an embarrassment of riches.Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate synaptic AMPAR content at developing synapses are likely distinct from those mediating LTP and LTD at mature synapses (Groc et al., 2006Groc L.

Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that AMPARs can be recruited to nascent synapses in the absence of NMDAR signaling (Adesnik et al., 2008Adesnik H. Li G. During M.J. Pleasure S.J. Nicoll R.A.

Thus, while the incorporation of AMPARs into mature synapses is widely associated with the activation of NMDARs, NMDAR signaling at nascent synapses actually restricts AMPAR currents. Functional NMDARs are heteromeric assemblies containing two obligatory GluN1 subunits and two regulatory subunits, usually GluN2 subunits of which there are four isoforms (GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D). These GluN2 subunits confer distinct functional properties to the NMDARs by influencing current kinetics and the complement of associated intracellular signaling proteins (Cull-Candy and Leszkiewicz, 2004Cull-Candy S.G.

In addition, at most forebrain excitatory synapses, the NMDAR subunit composition changes during development with predominantly GluN2B-containing NMDARs early in development gradually replaced or supplemented by “mature” GluN2A-containing NMDARs (Flint et al., 1997Flint A.C.

This shift in the ratio of GluN2A/GluN2B is thought to alter the threshold for inducing NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity (Yashiro and Philpot, 2008Yashiro K. Philpot B.D. Regulation of NMDA receptor subunit expression and its implications for LTD, LTP, and metaplasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Moreover, the switch from GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs is bidirectionally regulated by experience and activity (Bellone and Nicoll, 2007Bellone C. Nicoll R.A.

Given the developmental and activity-dependent regulation of the relative expression and distribution of GluN2 subunits, an increased understanding of the developmental impact of this subunit switch will yield insight into multiple aspects of synaptic function. Many studies have aimed at ascertaining the precise role of NMDARs and GluN2 subunits in the development of cortical circuitry; however, most have relied on widespread pharmacological inhibition or broad genetic deletions (Colonnese et al., 2003Colonnese M.T.

Furthermore, germline deletion of an NMDAR allele has the potential to disrupt developing circuits, leading to altered or compensatory pathways that result in a false readout of the cell autonomous effects of subunit deletion. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition and traditional KOs cannot separate the cell-autonomous role of NMDARs and GluN2 subunits from indirect effects on network activity associated with a broad loss of NMDAR function (Turrigiano et al., 1998Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Activity-dependent scaling of quantal amplitude in neocortical neurons.Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Indeed, NMDAR antagonists potently alter afferent patterning in visual areas (Colonnese et al., 2005Colonnese M.T. Zhao J.P. Constantine-Paton M. NMDA receptor currents suppress synapse formation on sprouting axons in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1291-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and can promote remodeling of thalamic neurons (Hahm et al., 1991Hahm J.O. Langdon R.B. Sur M. Disruption of retinogeniculate afferent segregation by antagonists to NMDA receptors.Nature. 1991; 351: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pharmacologic blockade has been reported to massively reorganize and cluster NMDARs in neurons, which could have various downstream effects (Rao and Craig, 1997Rao A. Craig A.M. Activity regulates the synaptic localization of the NMDA receptor in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 1997; 19: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and interpretation of GluN2 subunit-specific inhibition is problematic (Neyton and Paoletti, 2006Neyton J. Paoletti P. Relating NMDA receptor function to receptor subunit composition: limitations of the pharmacological approach.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Due to the lethality of germline GluN2B deletion, RNA interference in cultured neurons has been used recently to examine the effects of GluN2B at single cells (Foster et al., 2010Foster K.A. McLaughlin N. Edbauer D. Phillips M. Bolton A. Constantine-Paton M. Sheng M. Distinct roles of NR2A and NR2B cytoplasmic tails in long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2676-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Hall et al., 2007Hall B.J. Ripley B. Ghosh A. NR2B signaling regulates the development of synaptic AMPA receptor current.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13446-13456Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, these results are accompanied by a large reduction in GluN2A expression. To minimize potential indirect effects on developing network activity, we abolished NMDAR subunits in sparsely distributed cells in the hippocampus by introducing Cre recombinase into neurons in conditional KO mice for GluN2A and GluN2B. This mosaic deletion allows for simultaneous paired whole-cell recordings from Cre-expressing and untransfected neighboring cells, providing a rigorous, quantitative, and internally controlled comparison of the cell-autonomous effects of GluN2 subunit deletion. By deleting GluN2A or GluN2B during early postnatal development, a period of rapid synaptogenesis, we found that both subunits negatively regulate synaptic AMPAR expression, but by distinct means. We show that, similar to GluN1 deletion (Adesnik et al., 2008Adesnik H. Li G. During M.J. Pleasure S.J. Nicoll R.A. NMDA receptors inhibit synapse unsilencing during brain development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5597-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), deletion of GluN2B increases the number of functional synapses, suggesting a basal role for GluN2B-containing NMDARs in maintaining silent synapses in early development. Conversely, deletion of GluN2A increases synaptic strength without affecting the number of unitary connections. These results suggest that when significant bursts of activity drive the synaptic insertion of AMPARs and the recruitment of GluN2A-containing receptors, GluN2A functions to dampen further synapse potentiation. The hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapse is a model excitatory synapse that has been used to delineate the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Using conditional KO alleles for GluN2A (Grin2afl/fl; see Figure S1A available online) and GluN2B (Grin2bfl/fl) (Akashi et al., 2009Akashi K. Kakizaki T. Kamiya H. Fukaya M. Yamasaki M. Abe M. Natsume R. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. NMDA receptor GluN2B (GluR epsilon 2/NR2B) subunit is crucial for channel function, postsynaptic macromolecular organization, and actin cytoskeleton at hippocampal CA3 synapses.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10869-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we eliminated the target gene in a small subset of hippocampal neurons by transcranial stereotactic injection of P0-P1 mice with a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing a Cre-GFP fusion protein (rAAV1-Cre-GFP) (Kaspar et al., 2002Kaspar B.K.

Figure 1A shows a typical acute slice made from a P18 mouse after P0 injection demonstrating sparse infection of CA1 pyramidal neurons. It has long been suspected from in situ hybridization, single-cell reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and pharmacologic studies that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons express primarily GluN2A and GluN2B subunits (Garaschuk et al., 1996Garaschuk O. Schneggenburger R. Schirra C. Tempia F. Konnerth A. Fractional Ca2+ currents through somatic and dendritic glutamate receptor channels of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones.J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 757-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 1992Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). By cross-breeding the Grin2afl/fl (ΔGluN2A) and Grin2bfl/fl (ΔGluN2B) mice, we generated Grin2afl/flGrin2bfl/fl (ΔGluN2AΔGluN2B) mice and simultaneous whole-cell recording from a Cre-expressing cell (green trace in inset), and a control cell in the presence of NBQX revealed a complete loss of NMDAR-EPSCs (Figure 1B, inset). We followed the time course of subunit depletion by measuring the ratio of NMDAR-EPSCs from Cre-expressing cells to control cells after P0 injection, and demonstrated a gradual decrease in NMDAR-EPSCs and complete loss consistently by P15 (Figure 1B), similar to the rate of loss of NMDAR-EPSCs in Grin1fl/fl mice (ΔGluN1). These data indicate that, in addition to obligatory GluN1 subunits, synaptic NMDA receptors in CA1 pyramidal neurons contain only GluN2A and GluN2B. Since the NMDA-EPSCs were entirely gone by P15 in the double conditional KO mice, we performed all subsequent analyses of ΔGluN2A and ΔGluN2B mice after P17 unless indicated. In Figure 1C, NMDAR-EPSCs were obtained, averaged, and peak-aligned from Cre-expressing or control cells in ΔGluN2A and ΔGluN2B mice in the presence of NBQX. As expected, the average NMDAR-EPSC decay times (τw) recorded from Cre-expressing cells from ΔGluN2A mice were significantly slower than cells from ΔGluN2B mice and control cells. Importantly, decay rate was not affected by the amplitude of the NMDAR-EPSC, indicating effective space clamp (Figure S1B). Normalizing and aligning the traces at the stimulus onset (Figure 1D) shows that NMDAR-EPSCs from ΔGluN2B cells have a significantly faster rise than ΔGluN2A cells, with control cells intermediate. These results are consistent with rise times and decays previously described for diheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B receptors in heterologous systems (Vicini et al., 1998Vicini S. Wang J.F. Li J.H. Zhu W.J. Wang Y.H. Luo J.H. Wolfe B.B. Grayson D.R. Functional and pharmacological differences between recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and suggest that the Cre-expressing cells have pure diheteromeric populations of synaptic NMDARs. Since GluN2C and GluN2D subunits have lower sensitivity to Mg2+ blockade compared with GluN2A and GluN2B subunits (Monyer et al., 1992Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Heteromeric NMDA receptors: molecular and functional distinction of subtypes.Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar), we examined the voltage-dependent Mg2+ sensitivity of the NMDAR-EPSCs in Cre-expressing ΔGluN2A and ΔGluN2B cells. As shown in Figure 1E, there is a high level of voltage-dependent Mg2+ block in Cre-expressing ΔGluN2A and ΔGluN2B cells that was indistinguishable from control cells, further excluding a measurable contribution of diheteromeric GluN2C- or GluN2D-containing NMDARs. Previous studies have shown that the decay rate of NMDAR-EPSCs is voltage-dependent in the absence of Mg2+ (Hestrin, 1992Hestrin S. Developmental regulation of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents at a central synapse.Nature. 1992; 357: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Keller B.U. Ballanyi K. Yaari Y. Voltage sensitivity of NMDA-receptor mediated postsynaptic currents.Exp. Brain Res. 1990; 81: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that early in development (<5 weeks) the decay is slower at positive potentials while in older mice the decay is faster at positive potentials (Kirson and Yaari, 1996Kirson E.D. Yaari Y. Synaptic NMDA receptors in developing mouse hippocampal neurones: functional properties and sensitivity to ifenprodil.J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This developmental switch in the direction of voltage-dependent decay rate may be related to GluN2 subunit composition. However, as shown in Figure 1F, NMDAR-EPSC decay kinetics are slower at positive holding potentials regardless of subunit composition. Studies in heterologous systems have suggested that the probability of NMDAR opening in response to glutamate is dependent on the GluN2 subunit composition, with GluN2A imparting a higher open probability (PO) than GluN2B (Chen et al., 1999Chen N. Luo T. Raymond L.A. Subtype-dependence of NMDA receptor channel open probability.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6844-6854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Erreger et al., 2005Erreger K. Dravid S.M. Banke T.G. Wyllie D.J. Traynelis S.F. Subunit-specific gating controls rat NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B NMDA channel kinetics and synaptic signalling profiles.J. Physiol. 2005; 563: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, the differential effect of GluN2 subunits on NMDAR open probability has been challenged by previous work in neurons (Chavis and Westbrook, 2001Chavis P. Westbrook G. Integrins mediate functional pre- and postsynaptic maturation at a hippocampal synapse.Nature. 2001; 411: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, Prybylowski et al., 2002Prybylowski K.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8902-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the pure diheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B synaptic populations, we assessed NMDAR open probability using MK801, an open channel blocker that is effectively irreversible and has been used to estimate PO (Huettner and Bean, 1988Huettner J.E. Bean B.P. Block of N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated current by the anticonvulsant MK-801: selective binding to open channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Jahr, 1992Jahr C.E. High probability opening of NMDA receptor channels by L-glutamate.Science. 1992; 255: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For each recording, a stable NMDAR-EPSC was obtained, stimulation was stopped for 10 min as 40 μM MK801 was perfused onto the slice, and then stimulation was restarted (Figure 2A ). A greater rate of MK801 block was seen with ΔGluN2B than with ΔGluN2A (Figure 2B), suggesting a higher PO in the absence of differences in the presynaptic release probability (see Figure 5D). To obtain an estimate of PO, the baseline NMDAR-EPSC and the first EPSC after perfusion of MK801 were fitted to a simplified 5-state NMDAR gating model (Figure 2C; Figure S2) (Clements and Westbrook, 1991Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Activation kinetics reveal the number of glutamate and glycine binding sites on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The PO of GluN1/GluN2A (0.39) was significantly higher than GluN1/GluN2B (0.21), while NMDARs from control cells had an intermediate PO (0.26). Ifenprodil and its derivatives are the only sufficiently subtype-selective NMDAR antagonists (Neyton and Paoletti, 2006Neyton J. Paoletti P. Relating NMDA receptor function to receptor subunit composition: limitations of the pharmacological approach.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Ifenprodil is a negative allosteric modulator of GluN1/GluN2B receptors with >200-fold selectivity over other GluN2 subunits (Williams, 1993Williams K. Ifenprodil discriminates subtypes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor: selectivity and mechanisms at recombinant heteromeric receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar) and has frequently been used to differentiate the roles of GluN2 subtypes in multiple synaptic and cellular processes. Ifenprodil binds to the N-terminal domain of GluN2B in a use-dependent and voltage-independent manner (Perin-Dureau et al., 2002Perin-Dureau F. Rachline J. Neyton J. Paoletti P. Mapping the binding site of the neuroprotectant ifenprodil on NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Williams, 1993Williams K. Ifenprodil discriminates subtypes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor: selectivity and mechanisms at recombinant heteromeric receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar) and produces approximately 80% inhibition of GluN1/GluN2B receptors in heterologous systems (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. The incorporation of NMDA receptors with a distinct subunit composition at nascent hippocampal synapses in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to examine the effects of ifenprodil on pure synaptic populations of GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B. In Figure 3A , we show that 3 μM ifenprodil maximally inhibits NMDAR-EPSCs as predicted for pure diheteromeric GluN1/GluN2B but has no significant effect on a pure population of GluN1/GluN2A and an intermediate effect on wild-type (WT) receptors. Notably, many studies have used 10 μM ifenprodil for selective inhibition of GluN2B, but we found that 10 μM ifenprodil produces approximately 15% inhibition of GluN1/GluN2A receptors (Figure S3A) with no increase in the block of GluN1/GluN2B receptors. Interestingly, we also observed that ifenprodil treatment significantly slows the decay kinetics of the NMDAR-EPSC in a pure GluN1/GluN2B population (Figure 3B and Figure S3B), consistent with the reported ifenprodil-induced decrease in glutamate dissociation rate (Kew et al., 1996Kew J.N. Trube G. Kemp J.A. A novel mechanism of activity-dependent NMDA receptor antagonism describes the effect of ifenprodil in rat cultured cortical neurones.J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). While the longer decay lengthens the envelope of charge transfer, the 70%–80% decrease in peak NMDAR-EPSC amplitude (Figure 3A) has a greater impact on the total charge transfer (Figure 3B; Figure S3B). In the forebrain, NMDAR-EPSC decay time becomes more rapid during early postnatal development, reflecting an increased contribution of GluN2A subunits with an accompanying reduction of synaptic GluN2B (Flint et al., 1997Flint A.C. Maisch U.S. Weishaupt J.H. Kriegstein A.R. Monyer H. NR2A subunit expression shortens NMDA receptor synaptic currents in developing neocortex.J.

Pierre-Louis Tharaux and colleagues report that HB-EGF is upregulated in RPGN, resulting in activation of EGFR in podocytes and their dysfunction. They further show that genetic loss of expression of HB-EGF or EGFR in a mouse model is protective, whereas pharmacological inhibition of EGFR, even after disease onset, is therapeutic. These results suggest a possible avenue of treatment for this potentially devastating condition. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome and a morphological manifestation of severe glomerular injury that is marked by a proliferative histological pattern ('crescents') with accumulation of T cells and macrophages and proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells. We show de novo induction of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor–like growth factor (HB-EGF) in intrinsic glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) from both mice and humans with RPGN. HB-EGF induction increases phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB1) in mice with RPGN. In HB-EGF–deficient mice, EGFR activation in glomeruli is absent and the course of RPGN is improved. Autocrine HB-EGF induces a phenotypic switch in podocytes in vitro. Conditional deletion of the Egfr gene from podocytes of mice alleviates the severity of RPGN. Likewise, pharmacological blockade of EGFR also improves the course of RPGN, even when started 4 d after the induction of experimental RPGN. This suggests that targeting the HB-EGF–EGFR pathway could also be beneficial in treatment of human RPGN."
https://openalex.org/W2146753265,"BRCA1 loss of function is considered to promote tumorigenesis through impairment of the protein's role in DNA damage repair. By studying BRCA1 mutations that do not affect this function but still confer cancer predisposition, this report identifies a new function of BRCA1, the repression of miR-155 through modulation of HDAC activity. miR-155 increase correlates with BRCA1 loss or mutation in humans, and it likely to mediate some of the oncogenic effects of BRCA1 deficiency. BRCA1, a well-known tumor suppressor with multiple interacting partners, is predicted to have diverse biological functions. However, so far its only well-established role is in the repair of damaged DNA and cell cycle regulation. In this regard, the etiopathological study of low-penetrant variants of BRCA1 provides an opportunity to uncover its other physiologically important functions. Using this rationale, we studied the R1699Q variant of BRCA1, a potentially moderate-risk variant, and found that it does not impair DNA damage repair but abrogates the repression of microRNA-155 (miR-155), a bona fide oncomir. Mechanistically, we found that BRCA1 epigenetically represses miR-155 expression via its association with HDAC2, which deacetylates histones H2A and H3 on the miR-155 promoter. We show that overexpression of miR-155 accelerates but the knockdown of miR-155 attenuates the growth of tumor cell lines in vivo. Our findings demonstrate a new mode of tumor suppression by BRCA1 and suggest that miR-155 is a potential therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient tumors."

Sim et al. show that sorting based on PDGFRα expression yields a purer population of myelinogenic cells free of neuronal and committed astrocyte cells. Experimental animals with myelin disorders can be treated by transplanting oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into the affected brain or spinal cord. OPCs have been isolated by their expression of gangliosides recognized by mAb A2B5, but this marker also identifies lineage-restricted astrocytes and immature neurons. To establish a more efficient means of isolating myelinogenic OPCs, we sorted fetal human forebrain cells for CD140a, an epitope of platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)α, which is differentially expressed by OPCs. CD140a+ cells were isolated as mitotic bipotential progenitors that initially expressed neither mature neuronal nor astrocytic phenotypic markers, yet could be instructed to either oligodendrocyte or astrocyte fate in vitro. Transplanted CD140a+ cells were highly migratory and robustly myelinated the hypomyelinated shiverer mouse brain more rapidly and efficiently than did A2B5+cells. Microarray analysis of CD140a+ cells revealed overexpression of the oligodendroglial marker CD9, suggesting that CD9+/CD140a+ cells may constitute an even more highly enriched population of myelinogenic progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007323926,"The transcription of the mitochondrial genome is carried out by a single-subunit RNA polymerase (mtRNAP), which is distantly related to the RNAP of bacteriophage T7. Unlike T7 RNAP, the mtRNAP requires additional transcription factors (TFAM and TFB2M) for transcription initiation. The crystal structure of human mtRNAP has now been determined, revealing novel domains and mechanistic adaptations that explain the requirement for TFAM and TFB2M. These findings provide insights into the evolution of polymerases from simple self-sufficient enzymes to large multi-subunit complexes. Transcription of the mitochondrial genome is performed by a single-subunit RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) that is distantly related to the RNAP of bacteriophage T7, the pol I family of DNA polymerases, and single-subunit RNAPs from chloroplasts1,2,3,4. Whereas T7 RNAP can initiate transcription by itself, mtRNAP requires the factors TFAM and TFB2M for binding and melting promoter DNA5,6,7. TFAM is an abundant protein that binds and bends promoter DNA 15–40 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, and stimulates the recruitment of mtRNAP and TFB2M to the promoter8,9. TFB2M assists mtRNAP in promoter melting and reaches the active site of mtRNAP to interact with the first base pair of the RNA–DNA hybrid10. Here we report the X-ray structure of human mtRNAP at 2.5 Å resolution, which reveals a T7-like catalytic carboxy-terminal domain, an amino-terminal domain that remotely resembles the T7 promoter-binding domain, a novel pentatricopeptide repeat domain, and a flexible N-terminal extension. The pentatricopeptide repeat domain sequesters an AT-rich recognition loop, which binds promoter DNA in T7 RNAP, probably explaining the need for TFAM during promoter binding. Consistent with this, substitution of a conserved arginine residue in the AT-rich recognition loop, or release of this loop by deletion of the N-terminal part of mtRNAP, had no effect on transcription. The fingers domain and the intercalating hairpin, which melts DNA in phage RNAPs, are repositioned, explaining the need for TFB2M during promoter melting. Our results provide a new venue for the mechanistic analysis of mitochondrial transcription. They also indicate how an early phage-like mtRNAP lost functions in promoter binding and melting, which were provided by initiation factors in trans during evolution, to enable mitochondrial gene regulation and the adaptation of mitochondrial function to changes in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1977018102,"Regulated activation of integrins is critical for cell adhesion, motility and tissue homeostasis. Talin and kindlins activate β1-integrins, but the counteracting inhibiting mechanisms are poorly defined. We identified SHARPIN as an important inactivator of β1-integrins in an RNAi screen. SHARPIN inhibited β1-integrin functions in human cancer cells and primary leukocytes. Fibroblasts, leukocytes and keratinocytes from SHARPIN-deficient mice exhibited increased β1-integrin activity, which was fully rescued by re-expression of SHARPIN. We found that SHARPIN directly binds to a conserved cytoplasmic region of integrin α-subunits and inhibits recruitment of talin and kindlin to the integrin. Therefore, SHARPIN inhibits the critical switching of β1-integrins from inactive to active conformations. Ivaska and colleagues identify SHARPIN as an inhibitor of integrin activity in an RNAi screen for integrin regulators. They show that SHARPIN acts by binding to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α-subunits and reduces the recruitment of talin and kindlin to the β-subunits."

Functions of Nogo proteins and their receptors in the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, the roles of specific myelin components in vivo remain a matter of debate (Cafferty et al., 2010Cafferty W.B. Duffy P. Huebner E. Strittmatter S.M.

Compared to the effects of extrinsic cues, less is known about intrinsic mechanisms affecting regrowth competence. Experimental paradigms such as the conditioning lesion show that neuronal sensitivity to extrinsic influences in regeneration is under the control of intrinsic pathways (Enes et al., 2010Enes J. Langwieser N. Ruschel J. Carballosa-Gonzalez M.M. Klug A. Traut M.H. Ylera B. Tahirovic S. Hofmann F.

Biol. 2009; 19: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Intrinsic triggers of regrowth include positive injury signaling pathways such as the MAP kinases Erk and JNK, which are activated by injury and retrogradely transported from sites of damage (Perlson et al., 2005Perlson E. Hanz S. Ben-Yaakov K. Segal-Ruder Y. Seger R. Fainzilber M. Vimentin-dependent spatial translocation of an activated MAP kinase in injured nerve.Neuron. 2005; 45: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Differences in regenerative ability at different stages also reflect alterations in intrinsic growth capacity (Moore et al., 2009Moore D.L. Blackmore M.G. Hu Y. Kaestner K.H. Bixby J.L. Lemmon V.P. Goldberg J.L. KLF family members regulate intrinsic axon regeneration ability.Science. 2009; 326: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Analysis of regeneration-competent neurons in the vertebrate PNS and in model organisms has given insight into pathways that promote axon regrowth after injury (Ambron et al., 1996Ambron R.T. Zhang X.P. Gunstream J.D. Povelones M. Walters E.T. Intrinsic injury signals enhance growth, survival, and excitability of Aplysia neurons.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7469-7477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2007Chen Z.L. Yu W.M. Strickland S. Peripheral regeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 209-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Several studies have used genomic or proteomic approaches to identify regeneration-associated genes (Michaelevski et al., 2010Michaelevski I. Segal-Ruder Y. Rozenbaum M. Medzihradszky K.F. Shalem O. Coppola G. Horn-Saban S. Ben-Yaakov K. Dagan S.Y. Rishal I. et al.Signaling to transcription networks in the neuronal retrograde injury response.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra53Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As yet, a limited number of such genes have been tested for function in vivo. An important goal is to exploit new models for large-scale screening and gene discovery that will open up additional therapeutic avenues. The nematode C. elegans is an emerging model for genetic and chemical screens for factors affecting axon regeneration after injury (Ghosh-Roy and Chisholm, 2010Ghosh-Roy A. Chisholm A.D. Caenorhabditis elegans: a new model organism for studies of axon regeneration.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 1460-1464PubMed Google Scholar, Samara et al., 2010Samara C. Rohde C.B. Gilleland C.L. Norton S. Haggarty S.J. Yanik M.F. Large-scale in vivo femtosecond laser neurosurgery screen reveals small-molecule enhancer of regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Axons labeled with GFP transgenes can be severed precisely with ultrafast laser irradiation (Yanik et al., 2004Yanik M.F. Cinar H. Cinar H.N. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Ben-Yakar A. Neurosurgery: functional regeneration after laser axotomy.Nature. 2004; 432: 822Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Although laser axotomy of single axons differs in the precise mechanism of damage from mechanical severing or crush injuries of vertebrate nerves, at least some regrowth mechanisms are conserved. In C. elegans, as in vertebrate neurons, the second messengers Ca2+ and cAMP are rate limiting for axonal regrowth (Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010Ghosh-Roy A. Wu Z. Goncharov A. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D.

Pharmacological screening in C. elegans revealed a conserved role for protein kinase C in regenerative growth (Samara et al., 2010Samara C. Rohde C.B. Gilleland C.L. Norton S. Haggarty S.J. Yanik M.F. Large-scale in vivo femtosecond laser neurosurgery screen reveals small-molecule enhancer of regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 18342-18347Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, the Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase/DLK-1 cascade was first demonstrated in C. elegans as essential for axonal regrowth (Hammarlund et al., 2009Hammarlund M. Nix P. Hauth L. Jorgensen E.M. Bastiani M. Axon regeneration requires a conserved MAP kinase pathway.Science. 2009; 323: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Yan et al., 2009Yan D. Wu Z. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. The DLK-1 kinase promotes mRNA stability and local translation in C. elegans synapses and axon regeneration.Cell. 2009; 138: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and is required for axon regeneration in Drosophila (Xiong et al., 2010Xiong X. Wang X. Ewanek R. Bhat P. Diantonio A. Collins C.A. Protein turnover of the Wallenda/DLK kinase regulates a retrograde response to axonal injury.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and likely in mouse (Itoh et al., 2009Itoh A. Horiuchi M. Bannerman P. Pleasure D. Itoh T. Impaired regenerative response of primary sensory neurons in ZPK/DLK gene-trap mice.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggest that axon regrowth after laser surgery involves pathways required in other models of regeneration. Here, we exploit the rich genetic resources of C. elegans to perform a large-scale mutation-based screen for genes with roles in adult axon regrowth. We identify many genes required for axonal regrowth, most of which are not required for developmental axon outgrowth and have not previously been implicated in axon regeneration. By analyzing regeneration at multiple time points and in double mutants, we order the activity of newly characterized genes relative to each other and to the DLK-1 cascade. Manipulation of the conserved pathways identified here could significantly expand current strategies to augment the regenerative abilities of damaged neurons. To identify conserved genetic pathways affecting axon regrowth we selected >650 C. elegans genes based on their orthology to human genes and potential neuronal function or known biochemical role (Figure 1A ; see Experimental Procedures). We focused on genes not essential for overall health or growth rate; for >90% of the genes, we examined genetic null mutants (see Table S1 available online). To assay axon regrowth in vivo, we used mechanosensory PLM neurons, which consistently regrow after laser axotomy (Wu et al., 2007Wu Z. Ghosh-Roy A. Yanik M.F. Zhang J.Z. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D. Caenorhabditis elegans neuronal regeneration is influenced by life stage, ephrin signaling, and synaptic branching.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15132-15137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Over 95% of mutants displayed normal PLM axon development; mutants with aberrant development are summarized in Table 3. In the primary screen, we severed the PLM axon using femtosecond laser surgery in 10–20 animals per genotype. Under our conditions >95% of PLM neurons survive surgery (Wu et al., 2007Wu Z. Ghosh-Roy A. Yanik M.F. Zhang J.Z. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D. Caenorhabditis elegans neuronal regeneration is influenced by life stage, ephrin signaling, and synaptic branching.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15132-15137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After 2–4 hr, the proximal axon stump swells and forms a growth cone-like structure that extends over the next 24–48 hr. Wild-type PLM axons regrow in an error-prone manner and can reestablish synaptic connections in certain genetic backgrounds (Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010Ghosh-Roy A. Wu Z. Goncharov A. Jin Y. Chisholm A.D. Calcium and cyclic AMP promote axonal regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans and require DLK-1 kinase.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3175-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mutants showing altered regrowth at 24 hr (Figures 1B and 1C and Table 1, Table 2) were retested in a secondary screen (∼200 genes). As we sever axons in the mid-L4 stage when animals are growing, reduced regrowth could also reflect developmental delay or arrest in response to our axotomy procedure. We measured the growth of intact neurons in selected strains and found no significant effects on organismal growth rate (Figure S1A).Table 1Selected Mutants Displaying Reduced PLM RegrowthGene NameMutationsNormalized Regrowth (24 hr)p ValuePLM DevelopmentaPLM development is scored in at least 20 worms per genotype; defects in other touch neurons are not indicated here; OS, overshooting axon.Molecular FunctionClosest Human GenebClosest human gene based on BLASTP score in Wormbase WS213; Ensembl/HGNC gene symbol.A.

Altered regrowth 24 hr postaxotomy could reflect defects in growth cone formation or in later processes of axon extension. We analyzed 60 mutants with altered regrowth at 24 hr for their effects at 6 hr postaxotomy, when wild-type axons have just begun to extend (Figure S1B). Most mutants with reduced regrowth at 24 hr displayed proportional effects at 6 hr (Figure 1D), suggesting these genes act throughout regrowth. However, some mutants displaying increased regrowth at 24 hr (e.g., slt-1, sax-3; see Figures 3E and 3F) did not significantly affect regrowth at 6 hr, suggesting these genes affect later axon extension. Conversely, a few mutants (efa-6; see Figure 4C) displayed larger increases in regrowth at 6 hr than at 24 hr, suggesting a preferential effect on early stages of regrowth. We wished to determine the extent to which genes required for initial regrowth were involved in growth cone formation. By 6 hr postaxotomy, between 40% and 60% of wild-type PLM axon stumps form growth cones; on average, axons with growth cones at 6 hr extend further than those without growth cones (Figure S1C), suggesting growth cones reflect growth rather than stalling. Among 50 mutants tested at 6 hr the fraction of growth cones positively correlated with regrowth (R2 = 0.11, p = 0.01, Figure S1D), suggesting many genes required for regrowth affect growth cone formation. At 24 hr, the fraction of growth cones did not correlate with regrowth (data not shown), possibly reflecting a more stochastic presence of growth cones in axon extension. However, mutants displaying increased regrowth at 6 hr (e.g., efa-6) did not display a higher fraction of growth cones than wild-type (Figure S1D), suggesting the wild-type level of growth cone formation is a phenotypic ceiling. We conclude that growth cones correlate with early regrowth but not with overall regrowth at later time points. We found genes affecting PLM regrowth among all structural and functional classes tested (Figures 1B and 1C and Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4). When analyzed as nine gene classes (Figure 1C), genes promoting regrowth (i.e., those displaying reduced growth in loss-of-function mutants) were more frequent in the “cytoskeleton and motors” and “neurotransmission” classes. Genes inhibiting regrowth (i.e., increased regrowth in loss-of-function mutants) were concentrated in the “cell adhesion/extracellular matrix” class (Figure 1C). Here, for reasons of space limitations, we describe our findings on selected genes among channels and transporters, neurotransmitters, and gene expression.Table 3Roles of Axon Outgrowth and Branching Genes in PLM RegrowthGene NameMutationsNormalized Regrowthp ValuePLM DevelopmentMolecular FunctionClosest Human GeneA.

In C. elegans, neuronal excitability is generally influenced by the opposing action of voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels (Goodman et al., 1998Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R.

https://openalex.org/W1969543864,"The presence of zinc in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles of excitatory neurons of mammalian cerebral cortex suggests that zinc might regulate plasticity of synapses formed by these neurons. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of synaptic plasticity that may underlie learning and memory. We tested the hypothesis that zinc within vesicles of mossy fibers (mf) contributes to mf-LTP, a classical form of presynaptic LTP. We synthesized an extracellular zinc chelator with selectivity and kinetic properties suitable for study of the large transient of zinc in the synaptic cleft induced by mf stimulation. We found that vesicular zinc is required for presynaptic mf-LTP. Unexpectedly, vesicular zinc also inhibits a form of postsynaptic mf-LTP. Because the mf-CA3 synapse provides a major source of excitatory input to the hippocampus, regulating its efficacy by these dual actions, vesicular zinc is critical to proper function of hippocampal circuitry in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2118217667,"Linking the molecular aberrations of cancer to drug responses could guide treatment choice and identify new therapeutic applications. However, there has been no systematic approach for analyzing gene-drug interactions in human cells. Here we establish a multiplexed assay to study the cellular fitness of a panel of engineered isogenic cancer cells in response to a collection of drugs, enabling the systematic analysis of thousands of gene-drug interactions. Applying this approach to breast cancer revealed various synthetic-lethal interactions and drug-resistance mechanisms, some of which were known, thereby validating the method. NOTCH pathway activation, which occurs frequently in breast cancer, unexpectedly conferred resistance to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, which are currently undergoing clinical trials in breast cancer patients. NOTCH1 and downstream induction of c-MYC over-rode the dependency of cells on the PI3K-mTOR pathway for proliferation. These data reveal a new mechanism of resistance to PI3K inhibitors with direct clinical implications."

https://openalex.org/W2157833274,"Yardena Samuels and colleagues sequenced G protein-coupled receptors in 11 melanoma samples and report a comprehensive map of somatic variants in the GPCR gene family. They find frequent mutations in GRM3, which promote proliferation and migration of melanoma cells. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest human gene family, are important regulators of signaling pathways. However, knowledge of their genetic alterations is limited. In this study, we used exon capture and massively parallel sequencing methods to analyze the mutational status of 734 GPCRs in melanoma. This investigation revealed that one family member, GRM3, was frequently mutated and that one of its mutations clustered within one position. Biochemical analysis of GRM3 alterations revealed that mutant GRM3 selectively regulated the phosphorylation of MEK, leading to increased anchorage-independent growth and migration. Melanoma cells expressing mutant GRM3 had reduced cell growth and cellular migration after short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of GRM3 or treatment with a selective MEK inhibitor, AZD-6244, which is currently being used in phase 2 clinical trials. Our study yields the most comprehensive map of genetic alterations in the GPCR gene family."

https://openalex.org/W2085596648,"KIBRA has recently been identified as a gene associated with human memory performance. Despite the elucidation of the role of KIBRA in several diverse processes in nonneuronal cells, the molecular function of KIBRA in neurons is unknown. We found that KIBRA directly binds to the protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) and forms a complex with α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors (AMPARs), the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. KIBRA knockdown accelerates the rate of AMPAR recycling following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-induced internalization. Genetic deletion of KIBRA in mice impairs both long-term depression and long-term potentiation at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Moreover, KIBRA knockout mice have severe deficits in contextual fear learning and memory. These results indicate that KIBRA regulates higher brain function by regulating AMPAR trafficking and synaptic plasticity."

However, current theories disagree on whether OFC directs reversal learning in the amygdala. Here, we show that during reversal of cues' associations with rewarding and aversive outcomes, neurons that respond preferentially to stimuli predicting aversive events update more quickly in amygdala than OFC; meanwhile, OFC neurons that respond preferentially to reward-predicting stimuli update more quickly than those in the amygdala. After learning, however, OFC consistently differentiates between impending reinforcements with a shorter latency than the amygdala. Finally, analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) reveals a disproportionate influence of OFC on amygdala that emerges after learning.

Salzman C.D. The convergence of information about rewarding and aversive stimuli in single neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11471-11483Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both the OFC and the amygdala are important for a variety of behavioral tasks that require the flexible reassignment of values to stimuli (Murray and Izquierdo, 2007Murray E.A. Izquierdo A. Orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala contributions to affect and action in primates.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1121: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Murray and Wise, 2010Murray E.A. Wise S.P. Interactions between orbital prefrontal cortex and amygdala: advanced cognition, learned responses and instinctive behaviors.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, there is no consensus on the specific roles of the OFC and amygdala in the neural circuits underlying flexible behavior. Some authors have posited that OFC is specialized for supporting flexible behavior because it is better or faster than other brain areas, such as the amygdala, at signaling new cue-outcome associations—i.e., associations between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) (Rolls et al., 1996Rolls E.T. Critchley H.D. Mason R. Wakeman E.A. Orbitofrontal cortex neurons: role in olfactory and visual association learning.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1970-1981PubMed Google Scholar, Rolls and Grabenhorst, 2008Rolls E.T. Grabenhorst F. The orbitofrontal cortex and beyond: from affect to decision-making.Prog. Neurobiol. 2008; 86: 216-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Under this framework, during reversal learning the OFC is thought to rapidly detect the new CS-US associations and emit a “reversal signal” that facilitates the updating of CS-US contingencies in the amygdala. Other authors have suggested that the OFC plays a different role in reversal learning: maintaining the prereversal CS-outcome associations after reversal (Schoenbaum et al., 2009Schoenbaum G. Roesch M.R. Stalnaker T.A. Takahashi Y.K. A new perspective on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in adaptive behaviour.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 885-892PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the persistent representation of prereversal CS-US contingencies in OFC is thought to provide a basis for comparison with ongoing events, facilitating error-based updating in the amygdala and other areas. We sought to test these hypotheses by simultaneously recording in amygdala and OFC in order to compare the onset and time course of neural changes during reversal learning. We reasoned that if OFC directs the reversal of associations in the amygdala—perhaps via a reversal signal—then the encoding of new CS-US associations should emerge more rapidly in the OFC than the amygdala during reversal learning. Alternately, if OFC maintains the previous CS-US associations during reversal learning, then the encoding of new associations should appear slowly in OFC and more rapidly in other brain areas such as the amygdala. Previous studies have identified neural activity that encodes the reinforcement associations of stimuli in primate OFC or amygdala separately (Belova et al., 2007Belova M.A. Paton J.J. Morrison S.E.

By recording from OFC and amygdala simultaneously, we were able to examine the time course of changing neural responses during and after reversal learning in both areas for two populations of neurons: those that respond more strongly to stimuli that predict reward (“positive” value-coding neurons) and neurons that respond more strongly to stimuli that predict aversive events (“negative” value-coding neurons). Surprisingly, we found marked differences between positive and negative cell populations in the relative dynamics of their changing signals: negative value-coding cells “learned” faster in amygdala, while positive value-coding cells learned faster in OFC. Only after completion of reversal learning was there evidence consistent with the idea that one brain area (OFC) may drive processing in the other (amygdala). Thus, the debate concerning which area directs learning in the other area must be expanded to account for valence-dependent differences in dynamics. Instead of being driven by a particular brain area, our data indicate that reversal learning is more likely driven by complex interactions between neural circuits spanning both brain areas. We recorded single neuron activity and LFPs simultaneously from the OFC and amygdala of two monkeys performing a Pavlovian trace-conditioning task with a reversal learning component (Figure 1A ). In each session, monkeys learned the associations of two novel, abstract visual CSs; one CS, the “positive” image, was followed by a rewarding US (liquid reward), while the other CS, the “negative” image, was associated with an aversive US (an air-puff to the face). We monitored monkeys' learning by tracking the amount of licking at the reward spout in expectation of reward and eye closure (“blinking”) in expectation of air-puff. After monkeys learned the initial reinforcement contingencies, we reversed the associations of the positive and negative CSs without warning, and monkeys learned the new contingencies, as indicated by changes in licking and blinking after reversal. We determined the onset of monkeys' learning-related behavioral changes using a change point test (Gallistel et al., 2004Gallistel C.R. Fairhurst S. Balsam P.

The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In the example shown in Figures 1B and 1C, anticipatory licking and blinking rates begin to change quickly after the reversal of reinforcement contingencies, although the monkey did not switch to the appropriate behavior until it had experienced at least one pairing of each image with its new reinforcement outcome. Across experiments, monkeys were no more likely to lick on the first positive trial after reversal, or to blink on the first negative trial, after first experiencing a trial of the other type (Figures 1D and 1E; Wilcoxon, p > 0.5 for both), and this did not change with experience (comparison between first and second half of recording sessions; χ2 test, p > 0.05). Thus, monkeys do not appear to develop a working concept of reversal to guide their behavior on this task (a higher level strategy); rather, they learn reversals by experiencing each cue paired with its associated outcome. We recorded from 217 neurons while targeting area 13 of the right OFC (Ongür and Price, 2000Ongür D. Price J.L. The organization of networks within the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex of rats, monkeys and humans.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), and 222 neurons in the right amygdala (Figure 2). We used a two-way ANOVA with factors for CS value (positive or negative) and CS identity to detect neurons that have activity reflecting the association of CSs with reward or air-puff. Many cells in each brain area showed a significant main effect of CS value on neural firing in the CS and/or trace intervals (n = 86 in each area, p < 0.01). We further categorized these 172 cells by their preference for CS valence: neurons that fired more strongly in response to the positive or negative CS were designated “positive” or “negative” value-coding cells, respectively. We identified substantial populations of positive and negative value-coding cells in each brain area (41 positive cells and 45 negative cells in OFC; 27 positive cells and 59 negative cells in amygdala). These value-coding cells responded more strongly either to CSs predicting reward (positive cells) or air-puff (negative cells) both before and after reversal (Figure 3).Figure 3Value-Coding Cells Encode Reinforcement Contingencies before and after ReversalShow full caption(A–H) Average normalized neural activity (±SEM) of positive value-coding cells (A,C,E,G) and negative value-coding cells (B, D, F, and H) in OFC (A–D) and amygdala (E–H), shown separately for initial (A, B, E, and F) and reversal (C, D, G, and H) blocks.

Blue line, average activity during positive trials; red, average activity during negative trials. Vertical dotted line, CS onset. We applied the change point test to neural activity to determine whether the activity of these value-coding cells could underlie the behavioral changes seen following reversal (Figures 1B and 1C). Figures 4A–4D illustrate the responses of a positive value-coding cell from OFC recorded during the behavioral session depicted in Figures 1B and 1C. The neural response to Image 1 decreased as its associated outcome changed from positive to negative (Figures 4A and 4C), and the response to Image 2 increased as the image changed from negative to positive (Figures 4B and 4D). For each image, the change in neural response started to occur at the same time as one or both shifts in licking and blinking behavior. Using this procedure, we identified a trial number corresponding to the onset of the change in activity of each value-coding neuron, and we compared it to when licking and blinking behavior began to change upon reversal for the same image. For each group of value-coding cells, neural change points either were not different from behavioral change points (Figures 4F–4H; sign rank test, p > 0.05) or were slightly earlier than behavioral changes (Figure 4E; sign rank test, p < 0.05). The change point differences did not differ between groups (Wilcoxon, p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Thus, neural activity in OFC—as well as in amygdala (Paton et al., 2006Paton J.J. Belova M.A. Morrison S.E. Salzman C.D. The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar)—could contribute to reversal learning. We next examined the differences in the time course, as opposed to onset, of the neural changes among positive and negative value-coding cells in OFC and amygdala. An unexpected pattern of differences emerged: among positive value-coding cells (Figure 4I), OFC neurons exhibited a larger change in activity from the 12 trials before to the 12 trials after the change point (significant for positive trials; Wilcoxon, p < 0.05). However, among negative value-coding cells, amygdala neurons exhibited a larger change in activity than OFC neurons (Figure 4J; Wilcoxon, p < 0.05 for both trial types). Thus, positive and negative value-coding neurons in amygdala and OFC appear to “learn” at different rates relative to each other. To examine this apparent difference in time course, we calculated a “difference index”—the difference in average normalized neural response to the two CSs—over the trials following reversal, using a six-trial moving window (Figures 5A and 5B ). We quantified the time course of the difference indices for each neural population by calculating a scale-adjusted latency or “threshold” for a fitted sigmoid curve, representing the trial number when the curve reached a specific percentage of its maximum value (see Experimental Procedures). The curves reached this threshold at significantly different times for amygdala and OFC (F-test, p < 0.001), and this difference had an opposite sign for positive and negative value-coding cells. The scale-adjusted latency was 15.15 ± 0.68 trials for positive OFC and 18.24 ± 1.07 trials for positive amygdala cells, and 16.97 ± 2.12 trials for negative OFC and 10.03 ± 0.65 trials for negative amygdala cells (margins of error are based on 95% prediction intervals). Thus, for positive cells, the OFC group changed more rapidly than the amygdala group, but, for negative cells, the amygdala group changed more rapidly than its counterpart in OFC. The difference index provides a straightforward way to analyze the time course of changing neural responses, but it does not take into account the possible contributions of other factors, such as the sensory characteristics of images. Therefore, we used a sliding ANOVA analysis to examine how the unique contributions to neural activity of image identity and image value change after reversal. For each value-coding cell, we calculated the average proportion of explainable variance in neural activity that was due to image value—a “contribution-of-value index”—using data from six trials of each type before and after reversal (24 total trials), and thereafter sliding the postreversal six-trial window in one-trial steps (i.e., using trials 2–7, then 3–8, etc.). As before, we fit sigmoid functions to the index and tested for differences in latency between the curves. This analysis, shown in Figures 5C and 5D, confirmed the findings of the difference index analysis. The contribution of image value to the activity of positive OFC cells increased more rapidly and reached a plateau 6.4 trials earlier than that of positive amygdala cells (Figure 5C); conversely, the contribution of value to the activity of negative amygdala cells reached a plateau 13.7 trials sooner than that of negative OFC cells (Figure 5D; F-test, p < 0.001 in both cases). Finally, we found that the average onset of changes in neural activity and behavior was similar (Figures 5C and 5D), consistent with the change-point analysis (see Figure 4). These data indicate that although neurons in both brain areas begin to update their signaling fast enough to drive the onset of behavioral learning, the dynamics of learning differ. The appetitive system (comprising positive value-coding neurons) changes more rapidly in OFC, but the aversive system (comprising negative value-coding neurons) updates more rapidly in amygdala. We next examined how the time course of value-related signals within trials changes during learning (Figure 6; Figure S1). Here, as in Figures 5C and 5D, we calculated a contribution-of-value index in six-trial windows stepped by 1 trial over the reversal learning period; but now we applied the analysis to neural activity in 200 ms bins advanced in 20 ms increments across the trial. For positive OFC cells and negative amygdala cells, the contribution-of-value index achieves significance (p < 0.01 for at least three consecutive bins) shortly after CS onset during the first trial after reversal (Figures 6A and 6D, top rows in each panel); in contrast, the contribution-of-value index for negative OFC cells and positive amygdala cells reaches significance later in the trial (or, for negative OFC cells, not until the time of reinforcement). For the first data point after reversal, negative amygdala cells reach this threshold significantly earlier in the trial than negative OFC cells (permutation test; p = 0.01), while positive OFC cells reach threshold earlier than positive amygdala cells, with the difference approaching significance (p = 0.056). Thus, the population responses of positive OFC and negative amygdala neurons accurately encode the associations of images with reward or air-puff before the population responses of positive amygdala neurons and negative OFC neurons have significantly adapted to the new reinforcement contingencies. These timing differences are unlikely to be accounted for by differences in the contribution-of-value index magnitude: the maximum index magnitudes are similar for negative cells in OFC and amygdala, while the peak magnitude is actually higher for positive amygdala cells than for positive OFC cells. This analysis also reveals that significant contribution-of-value indices shift to earlier times on later trials compared to the earliest trials after reversal, resembling the back-propagation of value signals predicted by temporal difference models of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R. Barto A. Reinforcement Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts1998Google Scholar). In the multidimensional sliding ANOVA, lingering prereversal reinforcement associations are absorbed by the image identity factor. This is illustrated in Figures 7A–7D (see also Figure S2), in which the putative contribution of image identity—a contribution-of-image index—is plotted as a function of time and trial number. The image identity term captures a large amount of the variance in neural activity immediately after reversal, and this effect is especially salient in the two slower-changing groups. Consistent with our previous findings (Morrison and Salzman, 2009Morrison S.E. Salzman C.D. The convergence of information about rewarding and aversive stimuli in single neurons.J.

This highlighted key pathways such as apoptosis and ubiquitination in GRN deficient human neurons, while revealing an unexpected major role for the Wnt signaling pathway, which was confirmed by analysis of gene expression data from postmortem FTD brain. Furthermore, we observed that the Wnt receptor Fzd2 was one of only a few genes upregulated at 6 weeks in a GRN knockout mouse, and that FZD2 reduction caused increased apoptosis, while its upregulation promoted neuronal survival in vitro. Together, these in vitro and in vivo data point to an adaptive role for altered Wnt signaling in GRN deficiency-mediated FTD, representing a potential therapeutic target.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJjYjQ4YTE1MmY1MTg5ZDY3YWNiODU1NmEyYjJjMzkzMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0Njc5NTM5fQ.EKLsBTjpRCQm9LP2UHJMlV7oJX5zZg7Lb1vJonxRtd_LY50nqu094mWOBF9PNel26OQN7LyKDFNrli0rTVA7-XDNvlWrRMD2kIwv4PwvZcP7XZ_OH5cNJirq2H2Lc2P9EmrrQgLdgmVQ_yA_WXEORf7dJ11TdwF9W5r4P0ffKlk_iOQemhxKjARh4umfTUIs0GqY3o1fLAz7_uFbYeYrnnKuahwEHJbsRRrbfvdLshiSWZrnBod9vViAFWg5teScBHmmj3ozC1HHLO1puEfrvI5wa4VJUtOo-24A60p0EV4hXmTOhRufmezN5aCAZfL43bbZGhrwJsGm8wjqMk3rkQ(mp4, (13.37 MB) Download video"

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptor 5 (DR5) is significantly elevated in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and steatotic hepatocytes demonstrate increased sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated cell death. Nonetheless, a role for TRAIL and/or DR5 in mediating lipoapoptotic pathways is unexplored. Here, we examined the contribution of DR5 death signaling to lipoapoptosis by free fatty acids. The toxic saturated free fatty acid palmitate induces an increase in DR5 mRNA and protein expression in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells leading to DR5 localization into lipid rafts, cell surface receptor clustering with subsequent recruitment of the initiator caspase-8, and ultimately cellular demise. Lipoapoptosis by palmitate was not inhibited by a soluble human recombinant DR5-Fc chimera protein suggesting that DR5 cytotoxic signaling is ligand-independent. Hepatocytes from murine TRAIL receptor knock-out mice (DR(-/-)) displayed reduced palmitate-mediated lipotoxicity. Likewise, knockdown of DR5 or caspase-8 expression by shRNA technology attenuated palmitate-induced Bax activation and apoptosis in Huh-7 cells, without altering induction of ER stress markers. Similar observations were verified in other cell models. Finally, knockdown of CHOP, an ER stress-mediated transcription factor, reduced DR5 up-regulation and DR5-mediated caspase-8 activation upon palmitate treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that ER stress-induced CHOP activation by palmitate transcriptionally up-regulates DR5, likely resulting in ligand-independent cytotoxic signaling by this death receptor."

This report identifies a subset of leukemia patients with reduced levels of MSH2 protein but without alterations in the MSH2 gene, and it identifies concurrent deletions in regulators of MSH2 stability as potential contributors to the MSH2 deficiency and associated drug resistance in this and other cancers. DNA mismatch repair enzymes (for example, MSH2) maintain genomic integrity, and their deficiency predisposes to several human cancers and to drug resistance. We found that leukemia cells from a substantial proportion of children (∼11%) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia have low or undetectable MSH2 protein levels, despite abundant wild-type MSH2 mRNA. Leukemia cells with low levels of MSH2 contained partial or complete somatic deletions of one to four genes that regulate MSH2 degradation (FRAP1 (also known as MTOR), HERC1, PRKCZ and PIK3C2B); we also found these deletions in individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16%) and sporadic colorectal cancer (13.5%). Knockdown of these genes in human leukemia cells recapitulated the MSH2 protein deficiency by enhancing MSH2 degradation, leading to substantial reduction in DNA mismatch repair and increased resistance to thiopurines. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby somatic deletions of genes regulating MSH2 degradation result in undetectable levels of MSH2 protein in leukemia cells, DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance."

To study the functional consequences of this asymmetry, we used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate axons of CA3 pyramidal cells originating in either left or right mouse hippocampus.

In CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendrites, the density of A-type K(+) current increases with distance from the soma, playing an important role in synaptic integration and plasticity. The mechanism underlying this gradient has, however, remained elusive. Here, dendritic recordings from mice lacking the Kv4 transmembrane auxiliary subunit DPP6 revealed that this protein is critical for generating the A-current gradient. Loss of DPP6 led to a decrease in A-type current, specifically in distal dendrites. Decreased current density was accompanied by a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation. Together these changes resulted in hyperexcitable dendrites with enhanced dendritic AP back-propagation, calcium electrogenesis, and induction of synaptic long-term potentiation. Despite enhanced dendritic excitability, firing behavior evoked by somatic current injection was mainly unaffected in DPP6-KO recordings, indicating compartmentalized regulation of neuronal excitability."

Here, we use a mouse model in which glutamatergic neurotransmission has been ablated in the locomotor region of the spinal cord. The isolated in vitro spinal cord from these mice produces locomotor-like activity—when stimulated with neuroactive substances—with prominent flexor-extensor alternation. Under these conditions, unlike in control mice, networks of inhibitory interneurons generate the rhythmic activity. In the absence of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, the flexor-extensor alternation appears to be generated by Ia inhibitory interneurons, which mediate reciprocal inhibition from muscle proprioceptors to antagonist motor neurons.

Maternal stimulation was provided by voluntary wheel running vs. standard housing during pregnancy. Following 5 mo of standard housing of transgenic and wild-type offspring, their brains were examined for AD-related pathology and/or plasticity changes. Running during pregnancy reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque burden (-35%, P=0.017) and amyloidogenic APP processing in transgenic offspring and further improved the neurovascular function by orchestrating different Aβ transporters and increasing angiogenesis (+29%, P=0.022). This effect was accompanied by diminished inflammation, as indicated by reduced microgliosis (-20%, P=0.002) and down-regulation of other proinflammatory mediators, and resulted in less oxidative stress, as nitrotyrosine levels declined (-28%, P=0.029). Moreover, plasticity changes (in terms of up-regulation of reelin, synaptophysin, and ARC) were found not only in transgenic but also in wild-type offspring. We conclude that exercise during pregnancy provides long-lasting protection from neurodegeneration and improves brain plasticity in the otherwise unstimulated progeny."

How different afferents in vivo establish specific connectivity patterns with the same dendrite is poorly understood. Here, we examine the synaptic development of three glutamatergic bipolar cell types converging onto a common postsynaptic retinal ganglion cell. We find that after axons and dendrites target appropriate synaptic layers, patterns of connections among these neurons diverge through selective changes in the conversion of axo-dendritic appositions to synapses. This process is differentially regulated by neurotransmission, which is required for the shift from single to multisynaptic appositions of one bipolar cell type but not for maintenance and elimination, respectively, of connections from the other two types. Thus, synaptic specificity among converging excitatory inputs in the retina emerges via differential synaptic maturation of axo-dendritic appositions and is shaped by neurotransmission in a cell type-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2121445788,"Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the major determinant of redox balance in mitochondria and as such is fundamental in the control of cellular bioenergetics. GSH is also the most important nonprotein antioxidant molecule in cells. Surprisingly, the effect of redox environment has never been examined in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT), two tissues that have exceptional dynamic range and that are relevant to the development of obesity and related diseases. Here, we show that the redox environment plays crucial, yet divergent, roles in modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics in skeletal muscle and BAT. Skeletal muscle mitochondria were found to naturally have a highly reduced environment (GSH/GSSGã46), and this was associated with fairly high (~40%) rates of state 4 (nonphosphorylating) respiration and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission. The deglutathionylation of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) following an increase in the reductive potential of mitochondria results in a further increase in nonphosphorylating respiration (~20% in situ). BAT mitochondria were found to have a much more oxidized status (GSH/ GSSGã13) and had basal reactive oxygen species emission that was higher (~250% increase in ROS generation) than that in skeletal muscle mitochondria. When redox status was subsequently increased (i.e., more reduced), UCP1-mediated uncoupling was more sensitive to GDP inhibition. Surprisingly, BAT was found to be devoid of glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2) expression, while there was abundant expression in skeletal muscle. Taken together, these findings reveal the importance of redox environment in controlling bioenergetic functions in both tissues, and the highly unique characteristics of BAT in this regard.—Mailloux, R.

We demonstrated expression of transcripts encoding full-length Na(V)1.6 in isolated ventricular myocytes and confirmed the striated pattern of Na(V)1.6 fluorescence in myocytes. On the ECG, the PR and QRS intervals were prolonged in the null mice, and the Ca(2+) transients were longer in the null cells.

Mechanistically, GDE2 is expressed by postmitotic motor neurons but utilizes extracellular glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity to induce motor neuron generation by inhibiting Notch signaling in neighboring motor neuron progenitors.

Using the light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) mouse model, which provides a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms underlying neuritogenesis, we found that retinoid X receptors (RXRs) control neuritogenesis. LIRD rapidly triggered retinal neuron neuritogenesis and up-regulated several key elements of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, including retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Exogenous RA initiated neuritogenesis in normal adult retinas and primary retinal cultures and exacerbated it in LIRD retinas. However, LIRD-induced neuritogenesis was partly attenuated in retinol dehydrogenase knockout (Rdh12(-/-)) mice and by aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors. We further found that LIRD rapidly increased the expression of glutamate receptor 2 and β Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (βCaMKII). Pulldown assays demonstrated interaction between βCaMKII and RXRs, suggesting that CaMKII pathway regulates the activities of RXRs. RXR antagonists completely prevented and RXR agonists were more effective than RA in inducing neuritogenesis. Thus, RXRs are in the final common path and may be therapeutic targets to attenuate retinal remodeling and facilitate global intervention methods in blinding diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders."

IntroductionAlterations in glycosphingolipid 3Ganglioside and glycosphingolipid nomenclature is in accordance with the IUPAC-IUBMB recommendations (1IUPAC-IUBMB, Joint Commission on Biochemical NomenclatureCarbohydr. Res. 1998; 312: 167-175Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). expression are common in tumors of different origins (2Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Moreover, gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are known to modulate several cellular functions relevant to tumor progression. Thus, altered ganglioside expression might play a relevant role in determining the aggressiveness and metastatic potential at least in certain tumors. Cellular ganglioside levels regulate cell proliferation, mainly by affecting the tyrosine kinase activity associated with growth factor receptors and receptor compartmentalization, thus regulating the responsiveness of these receptors to their ligands or their cross-talk with other signaling modules. However, gangliosides deeply affect tumor cell adhesion, motility, and migration. Ganglioside depletion by double knock-out of GM3 synthase and GM2 synthase in transformed fibroblasts reduced their migration on fibronectin and reduced their tumorigenic potential in syngeneic immunocompetent mice (3Liu Y. Yan S. Wondimu A. Bob D. Weiss M. Sliwinski K. Villar J. Notario V. Sutherland M. Colberg-Poley A.M. Ladisch S. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 3297-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, transfection with GM1a/GD1b synthase, leading to the expression of complex gangliosides, inhibited neuroblastoma cell migration by affecting the Rho/Rac1 pathway (4Dong L. Liu Y. Colberg-Poley A.M. Kaucic K. Ladisch S. Glycoconj. J. 2011; 28: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Invasiveness of melanoma cells was reduced by GM1/GD1b/GA1 synthase expression (5Dong Y. Ikeda K. Hamamura K. Zhang Q. Kondo Y. Matsumoto Y. Ohmi Y. Yamauchi Y. Furukawa K. Taguchi R. Furukawa K. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or by GlcCer synthase antisense inhibition (6Deng W. Li R. Guerrera M. Liu Y. Ladisch S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GM3 is highly expressed in noninvasive compared with invasive bladder tumors and derived cell lines (7Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Watanabe R. Satoh M. Saito S. Hoshi S. Gasa S. Orikasa S. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Satoh M. Ito A. Nojiri H. Handa K. Numahata K. Ohyama C. Saito S. Hoshi S. Hakomori S.I. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 723-731PubMed Google Scholar); the overexpression of GM3 synthase reduced cell proliferation, motility, and invasion in mouse bladder carcinoma cells (9Watanabe R. Ohyama C. Aoki H. Takahashi T. Satoh M. Saito S. Hoshi S. Ishii A. Saito M. Arai Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3850-3854PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of gangliosides in the regulation of tumor invasiveness are likely very heterogeneous. In colorectal (10Ono M. Handa K. Sonnino S. Withers D.A. Nagai H. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6414-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and bladder (8Satoh M. Ito A. Nojiri H. Handa K. Numahata K. Ohyama C. Saito S. Hoshi S. Hakomori S.I. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 723-731PubMed Google Scholar) cancer cells characterized by high GM3 levels and by the expression of tetraspanin CD9, a CD9·α3 integrin complex, were stabilized by GM3-mediated interactions. The Src C-terminal kinase CSK was recruited to this complex, with consequent inhibition of c-Src and reduced cell motility (11Mitsuzuka K. Handa K. Satoh M. Arai Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35545-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the influence of gangliosides on tumor cell motility seems to be mediated by the regulation of membrane-associated signaling complexes. Ganglioside interaction with hydrophobic membrane adaptor proteins seems to be crucial for this regulation. From this point of view, the interaction between gangliosides and the integral membrane protein caveolin-1 is potentially very interesting. Caveolin-1 is usually highly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, although it is markedly down-regulated in tumors of different origin, including ovarian, breast, and colon carcinoma (12Wiechen K. Diatchenko L. Agoulnik A. Scharff K.M. Schober H. Arlt K. Zhumabayeva B. Siebert P.D. Dietel M. Schäfer R. Sers C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1635-1643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cell lines with no caveolin-1 expression are usually characterized by increased proliferation (13Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and in certain cell types, inhibition of caveolin-1 expression is sufficient to induce transformation and to accelerate tumorigenesis (14Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Razani B. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32333-32341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Williams T.M. Medina F. Badano I. Hazan R.B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51630-51646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for caveolin-1 as a suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis in several types of cancer (16Prinetti A. Prioni S. Loberto N. Aureli M. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In particular, caveolin-1 inhibits metastatic potential in melanoma through suppression of the integrin/Src/FAK signaling pathway (17Trimmer C. Whitaker-Menezes D. Bonuccelli G. Milliman J.N. Daumer K.M. Aplin A.E. Pestell R.G. Sotgia F. Lisanti M.P. Capozza F. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 7489-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In some cases, entire signaling modules are dynamically associated with caveolin-1, implying a major functional role for caveolin-1 as a molecular organizer for multiprotein signaling complexes. In particular, the amino acid sequence between 80 and 101 on the N-terminal side of the membrane insertion region of caveolin-1 is important for its interactions with many other proteins and has consequently been named “caveolin scaffolding domain” (18Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Among others, caveolin-1 binds to nonreceptor kinases, including c-Src. Remarkably, for all of the enzymatic proteins that interact with caveolin-1 via a caveolin-binding motif, it has been observed that the binding motif is localized within the catalytic domain of the protein. In fact, in the case of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, the caveolin binding domain is localized within the catalytic kinase domain, and the caveolin scaffolding domain is able to inhibit the activity of several kinases, suggesting that the major regulatory function of caveolin-1 in multiprotein signaling complexes might rely on its ability to negatively affect multiple protein kinases associated with signaling modules (19Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to recall that many signaling modules are constitutively activated during cellular transformation. Among others, c-Src is usually overexpressed or activated in tumors. c-Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase belonging to a family of proteins comprising nine members, c-Src, Fyn, Yes, Lck, Hck, Blk, Fgr, Lyn, and Yrk (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). In normal cells, Src family tyrosine kinases transduce signals acting on cell proliferation, adhesion, and motility (21Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Particularly relevant is the role of Src in integrin-mediated cell adhesion (21Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conversely, cell lines from metastatic tumors usually exhibit elevated Src kinase activity (23Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 24Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Curr.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).A relationship between c-Src and caveolin-1 has been documented in different cell types. Caveolin-1 interacts with c-Src within a glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domain. The association between Src and caveolin is sensitive to the lipid composition of the membrane microenvironment (16Prinetti A. Prioni S. Loberto N. Aureli M. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Sonnino S. Prinetti A. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolin-1 reduces cell motility by inhibiting Src. For example, caveolin-1 inhibits metastatic potential in melanomas through the suppression of the integrin/Src/FAK signaling pathway (17Trimmer C. Whitaker-Menezes D. Bonuccelli G. Milliman J.N. Daumer K.M. Aplin A.E. Pestell R.G. Sotgia F. Lisanti M.P. Capozza F. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 7489-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 reduces osteosarcoma metastatic ability by inhibiting c-Src activity and Met signaling (29Cantiani L. Manara M.C. Zucchini C. De Sanctis P. Zuntini M. Valvassori L. Serra M. Olivero M. Di Renzo M.F. Colombo M.P. Picci P. Scotlandi K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7675-7685Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In turn, Src can also contribute to caveolin-1-related signaling by regulating the phosphorylation levels of caveolin-1 (30Park J.H. Ryu J.M. Han H.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2011; 226: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Banquet S. Delannoy E. Agouni A. Dessy C. Lacomme S. Hubert F. Richard V. Muller B. Leblais V. Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we suggest that a ganglioside·caveolin-1 complex, controlling the activation of c-Src, might be involved in the regulation of human ovarian carcinoma cell motility.DISCUSSIONThe evidence provided in this paper, together with our previously published results (32Prinetti A. Aureli M. Illuzzi G. Prioni S. Nocco V. Scandroglio F. Gagliano N. Tredici G. Rodriguez-Menendez V. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicate that, in human ovarian cancer cells, an increased cellular gangliosides content, caused by the enhanced expression of GM3 synthase, is paralleled by a marked up-regulation of the membrane adaptor protein caveolin-1. The result of concomitantly high levels of gangliosides and caveolin-1 is a marked reduction of in vitro cell motility. Up-regulation of caveolin-1 and reduced cell motility were observed in two cellular models in which higher GM3 synthase activity with respect to wild-type cells has been obtained by two entirely different procedures as follows: the genetic manipulation of GM3 synthase levels by its stable overexpression in the case of SAT-I-transfected A2780 cells or the selective pressure in the presence of a drug, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide), in the case of A2780/HPR cells. The existence of a causal connection between high levels of gangliosides and caveolin-1 and the observed reduction of cell motility are supported by the depletion experiments, as shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5. Both caveolin-1 silencing and block of gangliosides biosynthesis by pharmacological inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase led to a strong enhancement of cell motility. These results indicate that high levels of caveolin-1 and high levels of gangliosides are necessary but not sufficient, if independent, to down-regulate cell motility. Thus, the regulation of cell motility requires a certain degree of cooperation between gangliosides and caveolin-1. Caveolin-1, an integral membrane protein originally discovered as a main structural component of caveolae, soon gained a role as a molecular organizer for multiprotein signaling complexes, because of its ability to interact with several proteins involved in signal transduction and to concentrate whole signaling modules in specialized plasma membrane areas, allowing their functional regulation. Caveolin-1 is insoluble in cold nonionic detergents (48Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and can be enriched in low density Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fractions. These fractions, highly enriched also in cholesterol and sphingolipids, putatively correspond to lipid rafts. Thus, caveolin-1 at the plasma membrane is concentrated in a lipid-rich membrane environment, and lipids affect several of the functionally relevant properties of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 and sphingolipids not only co-localize in the same detergent-insoluble membrane fraction, but several pieces of evidence indicate that they can be close enough in specialized membrane subdomains to allow a direct interaction between the transmembrane domain of caveolin and the hydrophobic moiety of the lipid (49Chigorno V. Palestini P. Sciannamblo M. Dolo V. Pavan A. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4187-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 50Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In SAT-I-transfected A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells, photoreactive GM3 is able to label caveolin-1 in a detergent-resistant membrane preparation (32Prinetti A. Aureli M. Illuzzi G. Prioni S. Nocco V. Scandroglio F. Gagliano N. Tredici G. Rodriguez-Menendez V. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a few cases, it has also been reported that detergent-resistant association of caveolin-1 and sphingolipids is strong enough to allow co-immunoprecipitation. Caveolin-1 can be immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody to ganglioside GD3 in CHO cells transiently transfected by GD3 synthase cDNA (51Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Here, we report that caveolin-1 and gangliosides are enriched in a Triton-X-100-insoluble fraction and that a significant portion of the sphingolipids associated with the DRM fraction can be recovered upon immunoprecipitation with anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Fig. 6). Therefore, we hypothesize that the formation of a ganglioside·caveolin-1 complex, occurring in cells with concomitantly high levels of both components, might be involved in the negative regulation of ovarian carcinoma cell motility. We tried to elucidate the downstream signaling pathway possibly affected by the ganglioside·caveolin-1 complex. Our results indicated that integrin receptor subunits and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src are enriched together with caveolin-1 and sphingolipids within detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Moreover, integrin receptor subunits and c-Src co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 (16Prinetti A. Prioni S. Loberto N. Aureli M. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Sonnino S. Prinetti A. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Src kinases (52Bénistant C. Chapuis H. Mottet N. Noletti J. Crapez E. Bali J.P. Roche S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 53Bénistant C. Bourgaux J.F. Chapuis H. Mottet N. Roche S. Bali J.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1415-1420PubMed Google Scholar) are typically associated with sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains or other subtypes of lipid rafts also in other cell types. In addition, it has been suggested that caveolin-1 might act as a membrane adaptor coupling integrin receptors to Src kinases (54Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and that caveolin-1-mediated inactivation of the integrin/Src/FAK pathway might be responsible for the inhibition of metastatic potential in melanoma (17Trimmer C. Whitaker-Menezes D. Bonuccelli G. Milliman J.N. Daumer K.M. Aplin A.E. Pestell R.G. Sotgia F. Lisanti M.P. Capozza F. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 7489-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the inactivation of c-Src by a ganglioside·caveolin-1 complex might result in the down-regulation of ovarian carcinoma cell motility. We have previously shown that a Src inhibitor was able to inhibit the motility of A2780 cells (expressing low GM3 synthase and low caveolin-1) and that c-Src was less active in SAT-I-transfected cells (32Prinetti A. Aureli M. Illuzzi G. Prioni S. Nocco V. Scandroglio F. Gagliano N. Tredici G. Rodriguez-Menendez V. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), characterized by high caveolin-1 levels. Now we report that treatments able to reduce the content of caveolin-1 (CAV1 siRNA) or of gangliosides (glucosylceramide synthase inhibition) in A2780/HPR and in SAT-I-transfected A2780 cells led to enhanced c-Src kinase activation and increased motility. However, ganglioside administration to A2780 cells, which able to reduce their motility, resulted in c-Src kinase inactivation. Altogether, these data suggest a novel role for gangliosides in the regulation of cell motility in human ovarian carcinoma by affecting the organization of a signaling complex organized by caveolin-1, responsible for Src inactivation.Our results call attention to two aspects that probably deserve future consideration. First, despite the much higher expression of caveolin-1, the morphological analysis revealed the absence of caveolae both in A2780/HPR and SAT-I-transfected A2780 cells as in the wild-type A2780 cells. This finding might seem in contrast to the usual association between caveolin-1 and caveolae, but it is indeed in agreement with the diverse and multiple caveolae-independent roles of caveolin-1 that have been described in the last few years (16Prinetti A. Prioni S. Loberto N. Aureli M. Chigorno V. Sonnino S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Sonnino S. Prinetti A. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 55Head B.P. Insel P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The second aspect is related to the observation that cellular ganglioside or GM3 synthase levels can regulate the expression of caveolin-1. Yamagata and co-workers (56Wang L. Takaku S. Wang P. Hu D. Hyuga S. Sato T. Yamagata S. Yamagata T. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that GD1a ganglioside regulated caveolin-1 expression in FBJ mouse osteosarcoma cells. Also in that case, the concomitant increase in a certain ganglioside and in caveolin-1 seems to be related to the possible role of caveolin-1 as a tumor suppressor. FBJ mouse osteosarcoma cells and A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells exist in different phenotypic variants, characterized by strikingly different in vitro cell motility. For both cell types, the low motility variants are characterized by high ganglioside and high caveolin-1 expression, although the high motility variants contain low ganglioside and low caveolin-1 levels. Treatment of the highly motile FBJ-LL osteosarcoma cell line with exogenous GD1a ganglioside or transfection with GM2/GD2 synthase cDNA resulted in the up-regulation of caveolin-1 expression with reduced metastatic potential and suppressed cell adhesion to vitronectin (57Hyuga S. Yamagata S. Takatsu Y. Hyuga M. Nakanishi H. Furukawa K. Yamagata T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, GM3 synthase-transfected A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells were characterized by an increased expression of caveolin-1 and reduced in vitro cell motility. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of caveolin-1 expression by the cellular ganglioside levels is totally unknown. IntroductionAlterations in glycosphingolipid 3Ganglioside and glycosphingolipid nomenclature is in accordance with the IUPAC-IUBMB recommendations (1IUPAC-IUBMB, Joint Commission on Biochemical NomenclatureCarbohydr.

However, transfection with GM1a/GD1b synthase, leading to the expression of complex gangliosides, inhibited neuroblastoma cell migration by affecting the Rho/Rac1 pathway (4Dong L. Liu Y.

Invasiveness of melanoma cells was reduced by GM1/GD1b/GA1 synthase expression (5Dong Y. Ikeda K. Hamamura K. Zhang Q. Kondo Y. Matsumoto Y. Ohmi Y. Yamauchi Y. Furukawa K. Taguchi R. Furukawa K. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or by GlcCer synthase antisense inhibition (6Deng W. Li R. Guerrera M. Liu Y. Ladisch S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GM3 is highly expressed in noninvasive compared with invasive bladder tumors and derived cell lines (7Kawamura S. Ohyama C.

Takahashi T. Satoh M. Saito S. Hoshi S. Ishii A. Saito M. Arai Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3850-3854PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the role of gangliosides in the regulation of tumor invasiveness are likely very heterogeneous. In colorectal (10Ono M. Handa K. Sonnino S. Withers D.A. Nagai H. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6414-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and bladder (8Satoh M. Ito A. Nojiri H. Handa K. Numahata K. Ohyama C. Saito S. Hoshi S. Hakomori S.I. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 723-731PubMed Google Scholar) cancer cells characterized by high GM3 levels and by the expression of tetraspanin CD9, a CD9·α3 integrin complex, were stabilized by GM3-mediated interactions. The Src C-terminal kinase CSK was recruited to this complex, with consequent inhibition of c-Src and reduced cell motility (11Mitsuzuka K. Handa K. Satoh M. Arai Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35545-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, the influence of gangliosides on tumor cell motility seems to be mediated by the regulation of membrane-associated signaling complexes. Ganglioside interaction with hydrophobic membrane adaptor proteins seems to be crucial for this regulation. From this point of view, the interaction between gangliosides and the integral membrane protein caveolin-1 is potentially very interesting. Caveolin-1 is usually highly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, although it is markedly down-regulated in tumors of different origin, including ovarian, breast, and colon carcinoma (12Wiechen K. Diatchenko L. Agoulnik A. Scharff K.M. Schober H. Arlt K. Zhumabayeva B. Siebert P.D. Dietel M. Schäfer R. Sers C. Am. J.

Cell lines with no caveolin-1 expression are usually characterized by increased proliferation (13Lee S.W. Reimer C.L. Oh P. Campbell D.B. Schnitzer J.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and in certain cell types, inhibition of caveolin-1 expression is sufficient to induce transformation and to accelerate tumorigenesis (14Engelman J.A.

In antigen-presenting cells (APCs), HLA class II, HLA-DM, and associated invariant chain-encoding genes are exclusively regulated by the interferon γ (IFNγ)-inducible class II transactivator (CIITA). Control of CIITA expression could therefore govern expression of class II peptide receptors in the diverse group of APCs. We discovered that elevation of the HLA class III region encoded B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) increases and depletion of BAT3 decreases expression of HLA class II, HLA-DM, and invariant chain. IFNγ strongly elevates BAT3 transcription in various tumor cell lines and in primary macrophages. BAT3 chaperones the simultaneously IFNγ-induced CIITA. Following IFNγ-treatment, both CIITA and BAT3 translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus. The nuclear import of CIITA mediated by IFNγ controls activation of HLA class II genes. BAT3 is a novel key regulator of components of the HLA class II processing pathway. We present a mechanism explaining how parallel IFNγ-mediated regulation of CIITA and of its chaperone BAT3 controls the level of components of the HLA class II processing pathway.—Kämper, N., Franken, S., Temme, S., Koch, S., Bieber, T., Koch, K. γ-Interferon-regulated chaperone governs human lymphocyte antigen class II expression.

https://openalex.org/W2171291591,"AHNAK is a 700-kDa protein involved in cytoarchitecture and calcium signaling. It is secondarily reduced in muscle of dysferlinopathy patients and accumulates in muscle of calpainopathy patients, both affected by a muscular dystrophy. AHNAK directly interacts with dysferlin. This interaction is lost on cleavage of AHNAK by the protease calpain 3, explaining the molecular observations in patients. Currently, little is known of AHNAK regulation. We describe the self-regulation of multiple mRNA transcripts emanating from the AHNAK locus in muscle cells. We show that the AHNAK gene consists of a 17-kb exon flanked by multiple small exons. This genetic structure is shared by AHNAK2 and Periaxin, which share a common ancestor. Two major AHNAK transcripts are differentially expressed during muscle differentiation that encode for a small (17-kDa) and a large (700-kDa) protein isoform. These proteins interact in the cytoplasm, but the small AHNAK is also present in the nucleus. During muscle differentiation the small AHNAK is strongly increased, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop to regulate mRNA splicing of its own locus. A small 17-kDa isoform of Periaxin similarly traffics between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to regulate mRNA splicing. Thus, AHNAK constitutes a novel mechanism in post-transcriptional control of gene expression."
