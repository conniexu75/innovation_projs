https://openalex.org/W2037080341,"ADVANCES in auxin physiology within recent years have been limited by continued uncertainty as to the identity of the auxins present in various plant tissues, and by the absence of reliable methods of separating the growth-promoting and the growth-inhibiting substances present in plant extracts. The technique of paper chromatography, used in conjunction with biological tests, would seem to offer a ready solution to both these problems."

The amount excreted after birth varies from 60 to 200 gm. It is generally considered to be an accumulation of debris consisting of desquamated cells of the alimentary tract and skin, lanugo, fatty material from the vernix caseosa, amniotic fluid, and various intestinal secretions. It has been shown to contain very large amounts of blood group-specific materials which correspond with the blood type of the individual infant and its ability to secrete blood group materials in its body fluids (2). Most previous studies of blood group-specific substances have been made on those of animal origin, because there are so few sources of the human substances in a concentration sufficient to allow separation and purification. In meconium the specific substances are present in large amounts and in a relatively pure form. Meconium has not been studied by modern chemical methods. Preliminary studies (2) indicated that meconium is for the most part soluble in water and contains little ash and large amounts of hydrolyzable, nonfermentable carbohydrate. The experimental work described in this article was undertaken to elucidate the composition of normal meconium further. It was also of interest to investigate the chemical composition of some of the individual group-specific substances in meconium, to determine whether there were any gross differences between the different types of specific substances and to see whether the substances were comparable in composition to the materials prepared by other workers. The composition of single samples of meconium from a calf’ and a dog was also studied."

https://openalex.org/W1972111961,"IN recent methods1 for the isolation of deoxyribonucleic acids from mammalian tissues, the use of buffered (pH 7) solvents containing low concentrations of sodium arsenate, sodium citrate or sodium borate has been advocated in order to prevent enzymicdepolymerization during the initial extraction of the deoxyribonucleohistone. As these salts are known to inhibit the action of pancreas deoxyribonuclease2, their use in this connexion presumably rests upon the tacit assumption that the intracellular deoxypentosenucleases of mammalian tissues3 have properties similar to those of the pancreas enzyme."

The chlorphenol was used as an ordinary solution in water; though of high toxicity to many species of eelworms, such as the stem and bulb eelworm (Ditytenchus dipsaci), it was not found effective against cyst-forming species such as the potato root eelworm (Heterodera rostochiensis)."

https://openalex.org/W2025848681,"DETERMINATION of individual amino-acids in a chromatographed mixture by measuring nitrogen content was discouraged by Martin and Mittelmann1, who reported interference from the solvents used. The method has now been re-investigated. Chromatograms were prepared using Whatman No. 1 paper and the apparatus described by Datta, Dent and Harris2; the solvents were (a) n-butanol-acetic acid3, and (b) a mixture of phenol and water (4 : 1) in the presence of acetic acid. The papers were dried overnight at room temperature, then sprayed with Moore and Stein4 reagent diluted with methyl alcohol to contain 0.1 gm. ninhydrin/100 ml. The colours obtained with this reagent were found to be more stable than those given by a solution of ninhydrin in n-butanol, and there was less vertical streaking of the spots on the paper. The papers were heated, the spots outlined with pencil and identified by comparison with a series of similarly prepared ‘maps’. Demarcation of the spots is helped by the fact that adjacent spots often give slightly different colours with ninhydrin. The identified spot and a piece of paper of the same area were cut from the same sheet, the latter for a blank determination."

We have therefore compared the urinary neutral 17-ketosteroids obtained by various methods of hydrolysis and extraction (for example, Talbot et al.1, Hamburger2, Beher and Gaebler3)."
