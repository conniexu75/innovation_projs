https://openalex.org/W1547755849,"Radioactive labeling of the 5′-termini of DNA with polynucleotide kinase has been used in conjunction with treatment by alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli to study single strand breaks (phosphodiester bond interruptions) produced in duplex DNA molecules by the action of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease. At 37° alkaline phosphatase will quantitatively hydrolyze external phosphomonoesters (those located at either end of the duplex molecule), but it will not hydrolyze internal phosphomonoesters (those located at single strand breaks). However, at elevated temperatures or following denaturation of the DNA, both external and internal phosphomonoesters are hydrolyzed by phosphatase. These methods permit (a) the identification, measurement, and characterization of single strand breaks in DNA molecules and (b) the preparation of specifically labeled DNAs used for studies on enzymes acting at internal and external termini."
https://openalex.org/W1532458240,"Very lysine-rich histones were extracted by aqueous trichloracetic acid from calf thymus, from the thymus, mammary gland, and liver of rabbits, and from chicken livers. The elution profiles of these histones, obtained by chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with a shallow guanidinium chloride gradient, revealed that the very lysine-rich histone complement varied from one animal species to another when a single kind of organ was considered, and even varied among different organs of a single species. The chromatographic resolution of the subfractions of very lysine-rich histones, their amino acid compositions, and their relative mobilities on polyacrylamide gels suggest that the whole very lysine-rich complement of any species consists of a moderately large number of molecular types."
https://openalex.org/W1609302917,"Abstract Deoxycytidine kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxycytidine (dCR) to form deoxycytidine monophosphate in the presence of specific nucleoside 5'-triphosphates and a cation, has been purified about 100-fold from extracts of calf thymus. This enzyme appeared also to catalyze the phosphorylation of an analogue of dCR, 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). The Km (4.0 x 10-5 m) for ara-C was found to be higher than the Km (1.4 x 10-5 m) for the natural substrate dCR. Both nucleosides could accept a phosphate group from the same phosphate donors; however, in each case, ara-C was much less active as a phosphate acceptor than dCR. dCMP, dCDP, and dCTP were all active as inhibitors of dCR kinase. Ara-C was more sensitive to the inhibition produced by these cytosine deoxynucleotides than dCR. The inhibition produced by dCTP appeared to be competitive with the phosphate donor (ATP) and noncompetitive with the phosphate acceptor (dCR or ara-C). In studies on the phosphorylation of dCR or ara-C, ara-C was found to be a competitive inhibitor of dCR (Ki, 3.6 x 10-5 m), and dCR was found to be a very potent competitive inhibitor of ara-C (Ki, 1.3 x 10-9 m)."
https://openalex.org/W1523892535,"The ability of liver lysosomes to degrade hyaluronic acid and glycoproteins has been investigated. Purified liver lysosomes, prepared from rats previously treated, by injection, with Triton WR-1339, were incubated with the substrates at acid pH and 37°. Hyaluronic acid was degraded to the extent of about 85% to an equimolecular mixture of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, with 15% of the molecule remaining in the form of hyalobiuronic acid, which proved resistant to attack by the lysosomal mixture of enzymes. With orosomucoid and fetuin as substrates, cleavage of about half the peptide bonds and removal of the larger part of the sialyl end groups of the carbohydrate chains occurred rapidly. This was followed more slowly by the release of galactose and of N-acetylglucosamine, which, however, did not exceed 30% of the theoretical yield under the conditions tried. Mannose could not be detected in the hydrolysis mixture. Apparently, considerable resistance to digestion occurs at or near the branching points in the carbohydrate portions of these glycoproteins. With submaxillary mucin as substrate, up to 80% of the disaccharide side chains were split off in the form of free N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. Peptide hydrolysis did not start until about half the carbohydrate portion had been removed, and then proceeded slowly, reaching 30% of theoretical yield at the end of the incubation period. Some 60% of the mannose residues were detached from ovalbumin glycopeptides. Thus, lysosomes can extensively degrade both the carbohydrate and the peptide portions of glycoproteins, but may lack the ability to bring their digestion to completion, at least with some substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1506262568,"Abstract The effect of different metals on the hydrolysis of DNA by DNase I was studied with the assay previously described which depends upon the release of large fragments of isotopically labeled DNA from a gel. With Mg2+, an initial lag in the rate of release occurred. This lag was eliminated when Mn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ plus Ca2+ was used. Na1+ added to Mn2+, to Ca2+, or to Mg2+ plus Ca2+ reestablished the lag. The presence of the lag was related to a double hit mechanism of hydrolysis, while the absence was related to a single hit mechanism. This interpretation was confirmed by viscometry and ultracentrifuge experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1970436663,"Slices of mammalian brain accumulate H3-norepinephrine and H3-serotonin when incubated in a physiologic medium containing these tritiated monoamines. When these tissues are subjected to mild electrical stimulation of short duration, which is associated with depolarization of nerve membranes, a striking increase in the rate of efflux of the exogenous labeled monoamines occurs. Stimulation-induced release of both labeled monoamines is diminished by the presence of lithium ions in the perfusing medium; related monovalent cations had no such effect. Evoked release from slices of brain from animals treated intraperitoneally with lithium chloride for 3 days was also reduced."

https://openalex.org/W1511044345,"The two arginine-rich histones III and IV, isolated from pea buds and calf thymus glands, were separated by preparative disc electrophoresis and each was shown to be homogeneous by amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal analysis. Homologous arginine-rich components from calf thymus and pea bud were found to be extremely similar or identical in their amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids, amino acid compositions, electrophoretic mobilities, and tryptic peptide maps. The complex electrophoretic behavior of calf thymus histone III was shown to be artifactual and due to the formation of disulfide bridges between electrophoretically identical monomer units. Each monomer was found to contain 2 moles of cysteinyl residues per 20,000 g of protein (presumably 2 residues per molecule). Pea bud histone III was shown to differ from calf thymus histone III in that the former contains only 1 cysteinyl residue per molecule; thus only dimers can be formed by oxidative polymerization. It is proposed on the basis of the extensive sequence homology between calf and pea histone III that histone III performs the same function in pea and calf and that consequently no more than 1 cysteinyl residue per molecule may be required in histone III function. Thus calf thymus histone III polymers are artifacts of preparation. The question is raised: are histone III-nonhistone protein complexes, linked by disulfide bridges, biologically meaningful?"
https://openalex.org/W1981019867,"High-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of low- and high-density lipoproteins from human serum closely resemble those of dispersions of lipoprotein lipids in water. Linewidths of hydrocarbon proton absorptions are not increased in the lipoproteins. In contrast, apolar binding of lysolecithin on serum albumin causes extensive line-broadening and an upfield chemical shift of the hydrocarbon proton resonances of lysolecithin. The results are consistent with a predominantly micellar structure for the lipoproteins rather than with extensive hydrophobic association of lipid and protein."

https://openalex.org/W1491523301,"Abstract The effects of two different inhibitors of rat liver RNA synthesis, actinomycin D and ethionine, upon liver RNA metabolism have been studied and compared. Whereas ethionine administration leads to a relatively slow loss of about 30% of total nuclear RNA over a period of 12 to 16 hours involving the molecular species representative of the total pool, the administration of actinomycin D is followed by a rapid loss of recently labeled moieties of nuclear RNA. The pretreatment of animals with ethionine had no significant effect upon the loss of nuclear RNA induced by actinomycin D. The labeling of cytoplasmic RNA with orotic acid-6-14C was inhibited by each agent. It is considered probable that the different patterns of response of hepatic nuclear RNA to these two agents are a reflection of the different mechanisms whereby they inhibit RNA synthesis. It is concluded that compounds which bind to DNA, such as actinomycin D, have effects on nuclear RNA metabolism in addition to those resulting from the inhibition of RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2063345588,"The previously observed incorporation of deoxynucleoside triphosphate precursors into DNA by isolated rat liver mitochondria could reflect either replication of DNA or a repair process. Density labeling experiments in cesium chloride demonstrate that DNA synthesized in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate instead of thymidine triphosphate shows an appreciable increase in density. In some of the molecules undergoing synthesis, the amount of the density increase indicated a replacement of thymine by bromouracil to the extent of 33 percent. This extensive replacement, which would compute to twice this amount if only a single strand of the duplex is labeled, provides evidence for the synthesis of fairly long pieces of DNA. Such synthesis is characteristic of replication rather than repair, and the results thus suggest that mitochondria are able to replicate their own DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1570895082,"Abstract Histones have been isolated from the mammary glands of rats and rabbits and chromatographically separated into very lysine-rich, slightly lysine-rich, and arginine-rich classes. When these histones were compared with corresponding fractions obtained from rabbit thymus, substantial differences in amino acid composition were observed for the very lysine-rich and arginine-rich classes. In the case of the arginine-rich class the difference was shown to arise from nonhistone contaminants and could be largely eliminated by changing the method used to extract histones from deoxyribonucleoprotein of mammary gland. The very lysine-rich histone from mammary gland approached that of thymus in amino acid composition when minor histone fractions were removed with 5% trichloracetic acid. The very lysine-rich histone from mammary gland was subfractionated by chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with a shallow guanidinium chloride gradient. The pattern of subfractions differed for rabbit thymus and rabbit mammary gland, in agreement with results reported previously. In addition mammary glands of rabbits and rats differed in their complement of very lysine-rich histones. Mammary gland histones from animals in different stages of pregnancy and lactation were compared to see whether the histone complement changed with the changing function of the gland. The three major histone classes were not observed to change significantly from late pregnancy to early lactation in rats. The complement of very lysine-rich histones also remained essentially constant in that period. Very lysine-rich histones from the mammary glands of rabbits were compared over the wider range of mammary development from nonpregnant to lactating to involuting states. Although the very lysine-rich histone patterns from rabbits in late pregnancy and lactation were similar, they differed from those of the nonpregnant and the involuting states."

Examination by moving boundary electrophoresis, by zone electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel, and by sedimentation velocity indicated a high degree of homogeneity for the preparations; enzymatic assays revealed that the final products were free of detectable amounts of the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester and l-leucyl-β-naphthylamide by the crude venom. The purified venom protease had a sedimentation coefficient of 2.78 S, a D20,w of 10.66 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, and a molecular weight of 22,500 by sedimentation velocity and approach to equilibrium. It was isoelectric near pH 6.5 and contained approximately 205 amino acid residues."

https://openalex.org/W1551287823,"Abstract Cell nuclei prepared from mammary gland were contaminated to various extents with cytoplasm. Histones extracted by acid from such nuclear preparations contained nonhistone protein, the amount of which increased dramatically as cytoplasmic contamination increased. Reasonably pure nuclei could be obtained by sedimentation through dense sucrose or treatment with detergent. Even when these purified nuclei were used, the arginine-rich histone prepared by elution from Amberlite IRC-50 with guanidinium chloride contained contaminants which could be detected and measured by amino acid analysis. The contamination was substantially reduced by modifying the histone isolation procedure to include stepwise extraction at decreasing pH values or prior treatment of the crude deoxyribonucleoprotein with organic solvents."
https://openalex.org/W1532753184,"Abstract An enzymatic synthesis of sphingomyelin, N-acylsphingosylphosphorylcholine, was demonstrated by Sribney and Kennedy to occur via a reaction between ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and CDP-choline. They indicated in this study that N-acyl derivatives of threo-sphingosine were far superior to the erythro derivatives as acceptors for the phosphorylcholine moiety. We have repeated these enzymatic experiments and obtained essentially identical results. The observation, however, appears to be inconsistent with the fact that the sphingosine moiety of ceramides and sphingomyelins existing in nature has the erythro configuration. Since this discrepancy could be ascribed to an enzymatic artifact, as discussed elsewhere, due to the fact that emulsification of threo-ceramides is more efficient than that of the erythro isomers, we decided to investigate the reaction further. The present communication describes experiments which indicate that under appropriate conditions not only threo-ceramides but also erythro-ceramides are active as substrates in the enzymatic formation of sphingomyelin."

This finding was based on studies of sedimentation velocity at various concentrations and with the use of agents generally effective in subunit separation, together with determinations by sedimentation equilibrium. No evidence of subunit aggregation was obtained. Column filtration studies suggest that the hemoglobins are more asymmetrical than myoglobin, but not to the extent of greatly altering sedimentation velocity. The monomeric nature of the molecule establishes a direct correspondence of hemoglobins to globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W2077453713,Pulmonary macrophages and plutonium particles were removed by washing the lungs of rats that had inhaled plutonium oxide-(239)Pu. A significant amount of plutonium was found in multiple washings of the same lung. The removal of toxic particles by washing is of potential therapeutic value. Particles were phagocytized by macrophages during the first 3 hours and retained within these cells for up to 25 days. Nearly all particles in washings were found in macrophages after the second day. The percent of macrophages with engulfed particles increased with increasing amounts of plutonium deposited in the lungs. The ability of pulmonary macrophages to rapidly phagocytize and retain plutonium particles deposited in the lungs has been shown.

https://openalex.org/W137179730,"Conditions for the inactivation and reactivation of chick embryo deoxycytidylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) are described. Aeration or dialysis in the absence of deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate, MgCl2, and mercaptoethanol yields an inactive, disaggregated protein, which can be separated from residual active enzyme by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Reversal of the inactive state can be effected by incubation of the protein with a mixture of deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (or deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate), MgCl2, and mercaptoethanol. The rate of reactivation is dependent on temperature, pH, and mercaptoethanol concentration, and reactivation results in a reaggregation of the enzyme. Inactivation of the deaminase by the microsomal sulfhydryl-disulfide interchange enzyme is also reversed by the above conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1492917798,"The tritiated isomeric sterols 17α,20α-dihydroxycholesterol and 17α,20β-dihydroxy-20-isocholesterol (which was previously assumed by Shimizu to be the C-20α epimer) and cholesterol-4-14C were incubated with guinea pig adrenal acetone-dried preparations in air in the presence of a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-generating system. With three different preparations the conversion of cholesterol to 3β-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one and 3β,17α-dihydroxypregn-5-en-20-one ranged from 6 to 11% and 0.05 to 0.35%, respectively. In the same incubations 17α,20α-dihydroxycholesterol was converted to 3β,17α-dihydroxy-pregn-5-en-20-one at a yield of 1 to 3% while the conversion from the 20β isomer ranged from 0.02 to 0.05%. The over-all metabolism of the 20α and 20β epimers ranged from 20 to 40% and from 1 to 10%, respectively. No demonstrable 14C radioactivity was found in the reisolated 17α,20α-dihydroxycholesterol (or its 20β epimer), indicating that in these preparations the conversion of cholesterol to 3β,17α-dihydroxypregn-5-en-20-one proceeded via 17α-hydroxylation of 3β-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one. The latter transformation was shown following incubation with tritiated 3β-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one. With the preparations studied no evidence for the formation of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one from either cholesterol or its 17,20-dihydroxy derivatives was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1488855661,"The activation and dissociation of tetrameric phosphorylase a to a dimer upon prior incubation with glucose and AMP has been studied in relation to the allosteric transitions of this enzyme. The dependence of both the initial rate and extent of activation upon glucose concentration are characteristic of homotropic interaction having Hill coefficients of 2.9 and 1.5, respectively. The initial rate as well as the extent of phosphorylase a activation is also dependent upon AMP concentration. The maximum extent of AMP activation of the enzyme is much lower than that of glucose activation. In the presence of 0.005 M to 0.1 M glucose, AMP causes inactivation rather than activation. The final enzyme activity obtained at saturating AMP is dependent upon the glucose concentration. At 0.2 M glucose, AMP has no effect on the enzyme activity. The reversal of glucose dissociation by AMP shows a similar dependence upon glucose concentration. Both glucose and AMP affect the rate of inactivation of phosphorylase a in the presence of trypsin or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (HMB). Although 0.2 M glucose enhances the rate of inactivation of phosphorylase a by trypsin, this effect can be completely reversed by AMP. Glucose at 0.2 M retards the initial rate of phosphorylase a inactivation by HMB. Although AMP by itself provides slight protection of the enzyme against HMB inactivation, it enhances the inactivation rate when 0.2 M glucose is present. These results support the view that enzyme dissociation is a result of conformational changes of the enzyme subunits. The effect of modifier concentration on phosphorylase a activation may be explained by the model proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux if three conformational states are postulated for the enzyme. This model, however, cannot readily account for the effect of modifiers on the rate of enzyme inactivation by HMB and trypsin. The present results suggest that the allosteric transitions of phosphorylase a may be best explained by a direct application of Koshland's “induced fit” theory."
https://openalex.org/W1584597173,"Abstract The lipids of highly purified fowlpox virus and those of the normal and infected host cell (chick scalp epithelium) were studied. 1. It was found that the virus contained 34% lipid with squalene being a major component (16.8%) and the only hydrocarbon present. In contrast, squalene was either absent or present only in trace amounts in normal epithelium. 2. Except for the presence of squalene, the lipid classes of the virus qualitatively resembled those found in the normal cell, but thin layer chromatography and individual measurements revealed marked differences in quantitative distribution. The amount of cholesteryl ester, in particular, was elevated in the virus. Cholesterol, mono-, di-, and triglycerides, free fatty acid, phospholipid, and an unidentified lipid class composed the remainder of the virus lipid. 3. Total fatty acids of the virus and the surrounding matrix and those of the normal and infected epithelium were mainly saturated and monoenoic with less than 10% polyenoic members present. Analysis with a complementary thin layer and gas-liquid chromatographic procedure revealed that a minimum of 31 fatty acids containing both even and odd chain members from C12–C28 inclusive were present. Branched chain acids were not found. Two points of dissimilarity between the fatty acid composition of the virus and the normal epithelium were the depression in percentage of odd chain acids and the increased monoene to saturate ratio observed with the virus acids. Fatty acid patterns in the cholesteryl ester, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and phospholipid fractions of the virus did not differ greatly. 4. Complex mixtures of aldehydes were discovered in the virus and epithelium phospholipid fractions. At least 54 components, predominately saturated, were detected. Two essentially complete homologous series (normal and isoaldehydes) with even and odd chain members from C10–C28 were found. Anteiso-aldehydes were also present. Aldehydes of the virus were more unsaturated and contained less branched chain members than those of the epithelium. 5. The function of the lipid in fowlpox virus is unclear. The present evidence, however, indicates that the lipid of fowlpox virus differs markedly from that of cell membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1586301613,"Abstract The extent to which several polypeptidyl proteins (polyvalyl and polyglycyl ribonuclease, polyvalyl, poly-t-leucyl and polyglycyl α-chymotrypsin, and poly-t-leucyl bovine serum albumin) aggregate has been determined in an attempt to show that these protein derivatives are useful as experimental models for studying hydrophobic bonding. Between 0° and room temperature aqueous solutions of the modified proteins are predominately monomeric. However, among those derivatives modified with nonpolar amino acid residues, a highly aggregated fraction amounting to approximately 10% of the total protein was often present. The particle size of this fraction was large enough to produce a visible turbidity. Lowering the temperature reduced the size of the aggregate, thus causing the solution to clear. This temperature dependence of the aggregation is characteristic of material presumed to be undergoing hydrophobic bonding. Details concerning the aggregation reactions were obtained through use of the ultracentrifuge. At higher temperatures (above approximately 30°) the monomeric fractions of all of the nonpolar derivatives polymerize. The polymerization is dependent on temperature and pH in a manner indicating the involvement of hydrophobic forces. In contrast to the behavior of the nonpolar polypeptidyl proteins, the polyglycyl proteins, having as many or more added residues, were totally monomeric at temperatures from 0° to nearly 100°. They were not only more stable to heat than the nonpolar derivatives, but also more stable than the corresponding unmodified proteins. For example, chymotrypsin which normally exists as a dimer or trimer (as high as the hexamer at low ionic strength) becomes monomeric when glycine peptides are attached. Chymotrypsin precipitates out of solution at about 65°, but solutions of polyglycyl chymotrypsin can be brought almost to the boiling point without evidence of aggregation. Based on the behavior of the derivatives of α-chymotrypsin and ribonuclease, it is suggested that adding glycine to other proteins may also yield a monomeric species. Similarly, attaching nonpolar peptides should produce an aggregate. The modified proteins were characterized by amino acid and end group analysis. A comparison of the aggregated and monomeric fractions of the polyvalyl proteins showed that the chymotrypsin derivatives differed with respect to the extent of modification. There was no detectable difference between the two ribonuclease fractions."
