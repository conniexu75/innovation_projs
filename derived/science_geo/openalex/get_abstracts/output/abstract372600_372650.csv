https://openalex.org/W2140301591,"Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an umbrella designation that includes a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors. Several classification strategies of GBM have been reported, some by clinical course and others by resemblance to cell types either in the adult or during development. From a practical and therapeutic standpoint, classifying GBMs by signal transduction pathway activation and by mutation in pathway member genes may be particularly valuable for the development of targeted therapies. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed targeted proteomic analysis of 27 surgical glioma samples to identify patterns of coordinate activation among glioma-relevant signal transduction pathways, then compared these results with integrated analysis of genomic and expression data of 243 GBM samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the pattern of signaling, three subclasses of GBM emerge which appear to be associated with predominance of EGFR activation, PDGFR activation, or loss of the RAS regulator NF1. The EGFR signaling class has prominent Notch pathway activation measured by elevated expression of Notch ligands, cleaved Notch receptor, and downstream target Hes1. The PDGF class showed high levels of PDGFB ligand and phosphorylation of PDGFRβ and NFKB. NF1-loss was associated with lower overall MAPK and PI3K activation and relative overexpression of the mesenchymal marker YKL40. These three signaling classes appear to correspond with distinct transcriptomal subclasses of primary GBM samples from TCGA for which copy number aberration and mutation of EGFR, PDGFRA, and NF1 are signature events. Conclusions/Significance Proteomic analysis of GBM samples revealed three patterns of expression and activation of proteins in glioma-relevant signaling pathways. These three classes are comprised of roughly equal numbers showing either EGFR activation associated with amplification and mutation of the receptor, PDGF-pathway activation that is primarily ligand-driven, or loss of NF1 expression. The associated signaling activities correlating with these sentinel alterations provide insight into glioma biology and therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2003025878,"Because genetically monomorphic bacterial pathogens harbour little DNA sequence diversity, most current genotyping techniques used to study the epidemiology of these organisms are based on mobile or repetitive genetic elements. Molecular markers commonly used in these bacteria include Clustered Regulatory Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR). These methods are also increasingly being applied to phylogenetic and population genetic studies. Using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) as a model, we evaluated the phylogenetic accuracy of CRISPR- and VNTR-based genotyping, which in MTBC are known as spoligotyping and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units (MIRU)-VNTR-typing, respectively. We used as a gold standard the complete DNA sequences of 89 coding genes from a global strain collection. Our results showed that phylogenetic trees derived from these multilocus sequence data were highly congruent and statistically robust, irrespective of the phylogenetic methods used. By contrast, corresponding phylogenies inferred from spoligotyping or 15-loci-MIRU-VNTR were incongruent with respect to the sequence-based trees. Although 24-loci-MIRU-VNTR performed better, it was still unable to detect all strain lineages. The DNA sequence data showed virtually no homoplasy, but the opposite was true for spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR, which was consistent with high rates of convergent evolution and the low statistical support obtained for phylogenetic groupings defined by these markers. Our results also revealed that the discriminatory power of the standard 24 MIRU-VNTR loci varied by strain lineage. Taken together, our findings suggest strain lineages in MTBC should be defined based on phylogenetically robust markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or large sequence polymorphisms, and that for epidemiological purposes, MIRU-VNTR loci should be used in a lineage-dependent manner. Our findings have implications for strain typing in other genetically monomorphic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2039677191,"The biological process underlying axonal myelination is complex and often prone to injury and disease. The ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter or g-ratio is widely utilized as a functional and structural index of optimal axonal myelination. Based on the speed of fiber conduction, Rushton was the first to derive a theoretical estimate of the optimal g-ratio of 0.6 [1]. This theoretical limit nicely explains the experimental data for myelinated axons obtained for some peripheral fibers but appears significantly lower than that found for CNS fibers. This is, however, hardly surprising given that in the CNS, axonal myelination must achieve multiple goals including reducing conduction delays, promoting conduction fidelity, lowering energy costs, and saving space.In this study we explore the notion that a balanced set-point can be achieved at a functional level as the micro-structure of individual axons becomes optimized, particularly for the central system where axons tend to be smaller and their myelin sheath thinner. We used an intuitive yet novel theoretical approach based on the fundamental biophysical properties describing axonal structure and function to show that an optimal g-ratio can be defined for the central nervous system (approximately 0.77). Furthermore, by reducing the influence of volume constraints on structural design by about 40%, this approach can also predict the g-ratio observed in some peripheral fibers (approximately 0.6).These results support the notion of optimization theory in nervous system design and construction and may also help explain why the central and peripheral systems have evolved different g-ratios as a result of volume constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2019998985,"Runx2, a bone-specific transcriptional regulator, is abnormally expressed in highly metastatic prostate cancer cells. Here, we identified the functional activities of Runx2 in facilitating tumor growth and osteolysis. Our studies show that negligible Runx2 is found in normal prostate epithelial and non-metastatic LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In the intra-tibial metastasis model, high Runx2 levels are associated with development of large tumors, increased expression of metastasis-related genes (MMP9, MMP13, VEGF, Osteopontin) and secreted bone-resorbing factors (PTHrP, IL8) promoting osteolytic disease. Runx2 siRNA treatment of PC3 cells decreased cell migration and invasion through Matrigel in vitro, and in vivo shRunx2 expression in PC3 cells blocked their ability to survive in the bone microenvironment. Mechanisms of Runx2 function were identified in co-culture studies showing that PC3 cells promote osteoclastogenesis and inhibit osteoblast activity. The clinical significance of these findings is supported by human tissue microarray studies of prostate tumors at stages of cancer progression, in which Runx2 is expressed in both adenocarcinomas and metastatic tumors. Together these findings indicate that Runx2 is a key regulator of events associated with prostate cancer metastatic bone disease."
https://openalex.org/W2120866750,"The enterobacterium Escherichia coli synthesizes two H2 uptake enzymes, Hyd-1 and Hyd-2. We show using precise electrochemical kinetic measurements that the properties of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 contrast strikingly, and may be individually optimized to function under distinct environmental conditions. Hyd-2 is well suited for fast and efficient catalysis in more reducing environments, to the extent that in vitro it behaves as a bidirectional hydrogenase. In contrast, Hyd-1 is active for H2 oxidation under more oxidizing conditions and cannot function in reverse. Importantly, Hyd-1 is O2 tolerant and can oxidize H2 in the presence of air, whereas Hyd-2 is ineffective for H2 oxidation under aerobic conditions. The results have direct relevance for physiological roles of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, which are expressed in different phases of growth. The properties that we report suggest distinct technological applications of these contrasting enzymes. The enterobacterium Escherichia coli synthesizes two H2 uptake enzymes, Hyd-1 and Hyd-2.

How Escherichia coli is equipped to oxidize hydrogen under different redox conditions.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 285Issue 26PreviewVOLUME 285 (2010) PAGES 3928–3938 Full-Text PDF Open Access Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of H2 into protons and electrons, and play an important role in the energy metabolism of a broad range of microorganisms (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4206-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Hydrogenases are classified according to their active site metal ion content, and three phylogenetically distinct classes have so far been identified: di-iron [FeFe]-, nickel-iron [NiFe]-, and mono-iron [Fe]-hydrogenases (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4206-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Nickel-iron hydrogenases are the most abundant of the three types (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4206-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), and many members of this class are membrane bound, with the membrane-extrinsic domain consisting of a large subunit containing the active site, and a small subunit accommodating one to three electron-transferring iron-sulfur clusters. The active sites of [NiFe]-hydrogenases contain a nickel atom coordinated by four cysteine-S ligands, two of which bridge to an iron atom that is further coordinated by three unusual diatomic ligands, two cyanides and one carbonyl (2Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Volbeda A. Cavazza C. Nicolet Y. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4273-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Hydrogenases are inactivated by O2: reaction of the [NiFe] active site with O2 results in at least two inactive Ni(III) forms, known as Ni-A (“unready”) and Ni-B (“ready”). The ratio of these forms depends upon the conditions (especially the availability of electrons) under which O2 attacks, and varies from one enzyme to another (3Lamle S.E. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 14899-14909Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18179-18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The unready state appears to contain a product of partial reduction of O2 (a coordinated peroxide has been assigned (2Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Volbeda A. Cavazza C. Nicolet Y. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4273-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 5van Gastel M. Stein M. Brecht M. Schröder O. Lendzian F. Bittl R. Ogata H. Higuchi Y. Lubitz W. J. Biol. Inorg.

Soc. 2004; 126: 14899-14909Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ready state contains a bridging hydroxo ligand (2Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Volbeda A. Cavazza C. Nicolet Y. Chem.

Fichtner C. Neese F. Lubitz W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (the product of complete reduction of O2) and is rapidly reactivated upon reduction (8Jones A.K. Lamle S.E. Pershad H.R. Vincent K.A. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hydrogen plays a critical metabolic role in bacteria ranging from the strictly anaerobic, such as Desulfovibrio species (9Caffrey S.M. Park H.S. Voordouw J.K. He Z. Zhou J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6159-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), to the facultative aerobic, such as Ralstonia species (10Burgdorf T. Lenz O. Buhrke T. van der Linden E. Jones A.K. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 10: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microaerophilic and facultative aerobic human pathogens, such as Helicobacter and Salmonella, respectively, are now known to require H2 oxidation activity for virulence (11Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1788-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Maier R.J. Olczak A. Maier S. Soni S. Gunn J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6294-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the majority of well characterized [NiFe]-hydrogenases are inactivated by very low levels of molecular O2 (4Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18179-18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), in certain species there is a requirement for H2 oxidation to occur in microaerobic and even fully aerobic environments. Hydrogenases capable of operating under aerobic conditions are defined as “O2 tolerant” (13Cracknell J.A. Wait A.F. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20681-20686Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To be O2 tolerant a hydrogenase requires certain mechanistic features for dealing with O2 attack, such as suppressing O2 access to the active site (14Buhrke T. Lenz O. Krauss N. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23791-23796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), avoiding the formation of the unready state (Ni-A) and ensuring that any ready state (Ni-B) formed is reactivated rapidly (13Cracknell J.A. Wait A.F. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20681-20686Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The enterobacterium Escherichia coli synthesizes at least three [NiFe]-hydrogenases (15Sawers G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Hydrogenase-3 (Hyd-3) is a cytoplasmic enzyme and forms part of the membrane-anchored formate hydrogen lyase system, which is responsible for H2 evolution under fermentative conditions (16Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 are membrane-bound periplasmic proteins, and are believed to function as “H2-uptake” enzymes (17Sawers R.G. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Hyd-1 is encoded by the first two genes of the hyaABCDEF operon, with hyaA coding for the [FeS] cluster-containing β-subunit and hyaB coding for the α-subunit, which binds the [NiFe] active site (19Menon N.K. Robbins J. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4851-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, Hyd-2 is encoded by genes hybO and hybC of the hybOABCDEFG operon, with hybO coding for the β-subunit and hybC coding for the α-subunit (20Sargent F. Ballantine S.P. Rugman P.A. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A membrane-anchoring hydrophobic helix is located at the extreme C terminus of the β-subunit of each enzyme. Hyd-1 couples H2 oxidation to quinone reduction via the HyaC transmembrane cytochrome b (19Menon N.K. Robbins J. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4851-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas Hyd-2 utilizes a periplasmic ferredoxin (HybA) to reduce quinone via the HybB integral membrane protein (21Dubini A. Pye R.L. Jack R.L. Palmer T. Sargent F. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2002; 27: 1413-1420Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Regulation of the expression of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 is distinct and complex. According to the available data, syntheses of both enzymes are repressed under aerobic conditions (22Giel J.L. Rodionov D. Liu M. Blattner F.R. Kiley P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1058-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but significant differences exist in the finer control of production. Repression by nitrate (23Richard D.J. Sawers G. Sargent F. McWalter L. Boxer D.H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or phosphate (24Atlung T. Nielsen A. Hansen F.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1683-1691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stationary phase induction (25Brøndsted L. Atlung T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5423-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and induction by acidic conditions (26King P.W. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are all reported for the hya operon. In contrast, the hyb operon is expressed most strongly during the exponential phase of growth, and its expression is possibly catabolite repressed (23Richard D.J. Sawers G. Sargent F. McWalter L. Boxer D.H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the physiological role of Hyd-2 is to catalyze the oxidation of extraneous H2, with the resulting electrons eventually being used by fumarate reductase to produce succinate (15Sawers G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus Hyd-2 allows E. coli to use H2 as an energy source during growth on non-fermentable carbon compounds. The physiological role of Hyd-1 is yet to be firmly established, but is believed to be quite distinct from that of Hyd-2. A suggested function of Hyd-1 is the recycling of H2 produced by Hyd-3 under fermentative conditions (16Sawers R.G. Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, evidence has emerged to suggest that Hyd-1 might be involved in linking H2 oxidation to O2 reduction under certain conditions (27Laurinavichene T.V. Tsygankov A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 202: 121-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a fragment of Hyd-1 has been purified from aerobically grown E. coli, implying that conditions might exist under which this enzyme is expressed in the presence of high concentrations of O2 (28Adams M.W. Hall D.O. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In protein film electrochemistry (PFE), 4The abbreviation used is: PFEprotein film electrochemistry. an extremely small quantity of redox protein is adsorbed directly onto an electrode to give a mono- or submonolayer film. A wealth of information can be obtained from enzymes, provided that full catalytic and electron-transfer activities are maintained in the adsorbed state (29Armstrong F.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The electrocatalytic activity of adsorbed enzymes responds directly to the electrode potential, and is monitored through the electrical current recorded in the presence of substrate. The current relates directly to the turnover frequency of the enzyme at the particular potential applied. Rates of change of catalytic state induced by stepping the electrode potential or introducing an inhibitor are measured from a current-time course. The environment of the adsorbed enzyme typically consists of 2 ml of enzyme-free buffer/electrolyte solution in a sealed electrochemical cell, through which precise mixtures of gases can be passed. Rotation of the electrode at controlled high speeds ensures that the observed reactions are not diffusion controlled, and also allows product inhibition to be quantified and suppressed (30Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). protein film electrochemistry. In this article we describe the characterization of E. coli hydrogenases 1 and 2 and report striking differences in the catalytic properties of the two enzymes, most notably their contrasting activities under the different redox conditions and oxidizing environments likely to be encountered by the organism. The E. coli K-12 strains used in this study were FTH004 and FTH013, which are based on MC4100 (31Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4530-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). FTH004 (21Dubini A. Pye R.L. Jack R.L. Palmer T. Sargent F. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2002; 27: 1413-1420Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) carries an engineered hyaABCDEF operon encoding a modified HyaA protein bearing a His6 affinity tag at its extreme C terminus, whereas FTH013 carries an engineered hybOABCDEFG operon encoding a similarly modified HybO protein. FTH013 was constructed by PCR-amplifying a 500-bp fragment covering the 3′ end of the hybO gene (minus stop codon), digesting with XbaI and BglII, and cloning into pFAT210 (21Dubini A. Pye R.L. Jack R.L. Palmer T. Sargent F. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2002; 27: 1413-1420Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Next, a 500-bp fragment covering the 5′ region of the hybA gene (including the hybA ribosome binding site) was amplified by PCR, digested with ClaI and KpnI, and cloned into the pFAT210 construct. The hybOhis allele now present on pFAT210 was then moved as an XbaI-KpnI fragment onto pMAK705 (32Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) before being transferred to the chromosome of MC4100 (32Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal modifications were carefully constructed so as to preserve identifiable regulatory elements, coding sequences, stop codons, and ribosome binding sites of genes flanking the hyaA and hybO loci. FTH004 and FTH013, respectively, produce His-tagged Hyd-1 and His-tagged Hyd-2 at wild-type levels under native regulatory and biosynthetic control. The bacteria were cultured anaerobically at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glycerol and 0.4% (w/v) sodium fumarate. The inoculum (1%) was grown aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium. To isolate Hyd-1, cells were harvested during the stationary phase (centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). To isolate Hyd-2, the cells were harvested similarly, but during late exponential phase. The procedure for isolating His-tagged hydrogenase was essentially the same for both Hyd-1 and Hyd-2. All steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. The pelleted cells (FTH004 or FTH013) were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, supplemented with 10 μg ml−1 of DNase I and 50 μg ml−1 of lysozyme (both from Sigma), and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the manufacturer's recommended concentration. The cells were disrupted by three passages through a French pressure cell, and crude membrane fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (33Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pelleted membrane fraction was resuspended in 10 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and the suspension adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg ml−1 in the same buffer. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were again added at the appropriate concentration. The detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was added to the suspension at a concentration of 1 mg/mg of protein, and the membranes were solubilized by gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Dithiothreitol was added to the cleared supernatant (giving 1 mm), and the solution was applied to a Ni2+-loaded 5-ml HisTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (buffer A). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A and then developed in 40 ml of the same buffer using a linear gradient of imidazole to a final concentration of 500 mm. Fractions containing purified Hyd-1 or Hyd-2 as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining were pooled and subjected to two rounds of dialysis against 500 ml of buffer A containing no imidazole. The purified protein was then concentrated by ultrafiltration, snap-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. To measure H2 uptake, the reduction of benzyl viologen (1 mm) (ϵ = 7.4 mm−1 cm−1) was followed at 604 nm in anaerobic cuvettes containing 1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, saturated with H2. Appropriate amounts of purified enzyme (5–50 μg) were injected to initiate the reaction. To measure H2 production, the oxidation of methyl viologen (1 mm, pre-reduced with an equivalent of sodium dithionite) (ϵ = 13.7 mm−1 cm−1) was followed at 604 nm in anaerobic cuvettes containing the same buffer, saturated with N2. Pyrolytic graphite “edge” electrodes were constructed in-house (30Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The pyrolytic graphite edge electrode surface is rich in hydrophilic C-O groups that bind many enzymes strongly with full retention of activity (34Léger C. Bertrand P. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 2379-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 35Léger C. Elliott S.J. Hoke K.R. Jeuken L.J. Jones A.K. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8653-8662Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The electrode (geometric surface area 0.03 cm2) was prepared by sanding with P800 Tufbak Durite sandpaper. Enzyme solution (2 μl at ∼20 μm) was then pipetted onto the surface and, after 15 s, the electrode was held under a stream of water to remove non-adsorbed enzyme. All solutions used in the electrochemical cell are enzyme free, and therefore only enzymes adsorbed on the electrode and under the direct control of the electrode potential was examined. A mixed buffer system was used (8Jones A.K. Lamle S.E. Pershad H.R. Vincent K.A. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Electrochemical experiments were conducted in an all-glass cell located in an anaerobic glove box (Vacuum Atmospheres, O2 <2 ppm). The saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was housed in a side-arm linked to the main compartment by a Luggin capillary. All potential values were corrected to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) scale using the relationship ESHE = ESCE + 0.241 V at 25 °C (36Bard A. Faulkner L.R. Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications. Second Ed. Wiley, Chichester, UK2000Google Scholar). The cell was sealed to a glass head fixed around an electrode rotator (EG&G). Gas inlet and outlet connectors allowed gas flow through the headspace. The electrode was rotated at variable high speed to control mass transport and ensure rapid equilibration of the cell solution with the head gas atmosphere. Precise gas mixtures were made using flow meters (Sierra Instruments). The total gas flow rate was typically 1000 standard cubic centimeters min−1. The cell was water-jacketed and thermostated by a water circulator (Neslab). Kinetic analyses of hydrogenase inhibition by product and CO are described under supplemental data. Continuous wave EPR experiments were performed either using an X-band (9–10 GHz) Bruker EMX spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Germany) equipped with an X-band Super High Sensitivity Probehead (Bruker), or a W-/X-band Bruker Elexsys 680 spectrometer using an X-band EMX High Sensitivity Probehead (Bruker), both equipped with a low temperature helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments CF935). For determining g values, the magnetic field was calibrated at room temperature with an external 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl standard (g value 2.0036). Data analysis and simulations of the EPR spectra were performed using the program EasySpin (37Stoll S. Schweiger A. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4294) Google Scholar). His6-tagged Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 were expressed from the chromosome of E. coli strains FTH004 and FTH013, respectively, at wild-type levels. Hyd-1 was purified from the solubilized membrane fraction to near homogeneity in a single affinity chromatography step, with a yield of ∼0.15 mg of protein (g of cells)−1. Hyd-2 was purified in a complex with its physiological redox partner HybA, again with low levels of contamination, with a yield of ∼0.015 mg of protein (g of cells)−1. SDS-PAGE analyses of both enzymes are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Spectrophotometric activity assays of purified Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 yielded specific activities for H2 uptake of 1 μmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 and 34 μmol of H2 min−1 mg−1, respectively. No H2 production by Hyd-1 was detected, but a specific activity of 2.5 μmol of H2 min−1 mg−1 was measured for Hyd-2. Both Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 are highly active in catalyzing H2 oxidation. Fig. 1 shows electrochemical experiments on Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, each adsorbed as a film on a pyrolytic graphite edge electrode, at pH 6.0, 30 °C under three different H2 partial pressures (10, 3, and 0.3% H2 in argon). The cyclic voltammograms were initiated at −0.560 V and the electrode potential was steadily increased to +0.244 V at a rate of 1 mV s−1. The scan direction was then reversed, and the potential lowered back to −0.560 V. Positive current is a direct measure of the net rate of steady-state H2 oxidation (H2 → 2H+ + 2e−), and negative current, similarly, provides a direct, net measurement of the reverse reaction, H2 production (30Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The underlying wave shapes for electrocatalysis by enzymes have been explained previously (38Léger C. Jones A.K. Albracht S.P.J. Armstrong F.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 13058-13063Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 39Reda T. Hirst J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; 110: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Important differences between the catalytic activities of the two enzymes are immediately apparent. The first of these differences relates to catalytic “bias” (the inherent ability to catalyze in one direction versus the other): whereas no H2 production by Hyd-1 can be detected, Hyd-2 shows significant catalysis of this process. The second difference relates to the ease of re-activation of the oxidized, inactive ready (Ni-B) state, which is formed under anaerobic oxidizing conditions (8Jones A.K. Lamle S.E. Pershad H.R. Vincent K.A. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Armstrong F.A. Albracht S.P. Philos. Transact. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363PubMed Google Scholar). The Ni-B state contains Ni(III) with a OH− ligand in a bridging position (2Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Volbeda A. Cavazza C. Nicolet Y. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4273-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). When the potential is scanned from a high (positive) value back to a low (negative) value, Ni-B reductively re-activates (a one-electron reduction of Ni(III) to Ni(II)); this reactivation is observed as an increase in current on the reverse scan, marked with asterisks in Fig. 1, top panel. The midpoint potential of reactivation is defined by the value Eswitch determined from the derivative di/dE (8Jones A.K. Lamle S.E. Pershad H.R. Vincent K.A. Albracht S.P. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At pH 6.0, Eswitch is +0.150 V for Hyd-1 and −0.085 V for Hyd-2, showing that the inactive Ni-B state is much less favored thermodynamically in Hyd-1 than in Hyd-2. Therefore, at equilibrium at a potential of, for instance, 0 V, Hyd-1 would exist entirely in its active state, whereas Hyd-2 would be entirely in its inactive state. The current trace for Hyd-2 crosses the zero line sharply and, under 10% H2, this occurs at a potential of −0.33 V, the value predicted by the Nernst equation for the 2H+/H2 redox couple (the reversible cell potential) under these conditions. However, trace for Hyd-1 shows that H2 oxidation under 10% H2 becomes apparent only above a potential of −0.28 V, significantly more positive than the 2H+/H2 cell potential. Hyd-1 therefore requires an overpotential of ∼0.05 V to begin catalysis of H2 oxidation under these conditions. Using the Hyd-2 voltammogram as a reference for the reversible cell potential, a close examination of Fig. 1 shows that the overpotential required for H2 oxidation by Hyd-1 decreases as the partial pressure of H2 is lowered. A comparison of all three panels of Fig. 1 also reveals the sensitivity of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 to changes in the partial pressure of H2. Oxidation of H2 by each enzyme is affected to a similar degree by changes in substrate concentration, and this implies that Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 have H2 affinities of the same order of magnitude. Indeed, by carrying out Hanes analyses on data recorded at seven different H2 concentrations, Km values of 9 ± 1 and 17 ± 4 μm were determined for Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, respectively, at −0.175 V (see supplemental Fig. S2). From separate experiments to examine product inhibition of the H2 production activity of Hyd-2, the inhibition constant KiH2 was measured to be 210 ± 19 μm at pH 6.0, 30 °C, and −0.600 V (see supplemental Fig. S3). H2 is therefore a weak product inhibitor of Hyd-2. Hyd-1 shows negligible H2 production activity, even under a 100% argon atmosphere. Hyd-1 is thus exclusively a H2 oxidizer, whereas Hyd-2 is, at least in vitro, a bidirectional hydrogenase. Fig. 2 shows the X-band continuous wave EPR spectra of as-isolated samples of Hyd-1 and Hyd-2, each recorded at 10 K and 80 K. At 10 K, both Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 spectra are dominated by the strong signal of the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster with g values (Hyd-1/Hyd-2: gx = 2.02/2.03, gy = 2.01/2.02, gz = 2.00/2.01) consistent with those reported for [NiFe]-hydrogenases (e.g. Refs. 41Albracht S.P.J.

At 80 K, only the EPR signals arising from nickel are observable, and can be examined without interference from the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster, which relaxes rapidly at this temperature. The spectra show that both Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 form Ni-A and Ni-B states upon aerobic isolation. The rhombic signals characteristic of both Ni-A and Ni-B show identical g values (to two decimal places) for Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 (Ni-A, gx = 2.31, gy = 2.24, and gz = 2.01; Ni-B, gx = 2.31, gy = 2.16, and gz = 2.01). These values are in good agreement with those previously reported for [NiFe]-hydrogenases (6Lubitz W. Reijerse E. van Gastel M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4331-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), although we consistently observed relatively more Ni-B than was evident in the data presented by DerVartanian et al.

The exact ratio of Ni-A to Ni-B varies between preparations: in the spectra shown, the ratio is ∼1:3 for Hyd-1 and 1:4 for Hyd-2. The spectra of Hyd-2 contai"

The role of miRNAs in pediatric leukemia still needs to be established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in pediatric acute leukemia and demonstrate miRNA patterns that are pediatric-specific and prognostic parameter-associated. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 111 pediatric bone marrow samples, including 99 patients and 12 normal donors, were enrolled in this study. Of those samples, 36 patients and 7 normal samples were used as a test cohort for the evaluation of miRNA profiling; 63 pediatric patients and 5 normal donors were used as a validation cohort to confirm the miRNA differential expression. Pediatric ALL- and AML-specific microRNA expression patterns were identified in this study. The most highly expressed miRNAs in pediatric ALL were miR-34a, miR-128a, miR-128b, and miR-146a, while the highly expressed miRNAs in pediatric AML were miR-100, miR-125b, miR-335, miR-146a, and miR-99a, which are significantly different from those reported for adult CLL and AML. miR-125b and miR-126 may serve as favorable prognosticators for M3 and M2 patients, respectively. Importantly, we identified a “miRNA cascade” associated with central nervous system (CNS) relapse in ALL. Additionally, miRNA patterns associated with prednisone response, specific risk group, and relapse of ALL were also identified. Conclusions/Significance There are existing pediatric-associated and prognostic parameter-associated miRNAs that are independent of cell lineage and could provide therapeutic direction for individual risk-adapted therapy for pediatric leukemia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2111925644,"Human language has evolved on a biological substrate with phylogenetic roots deep in the primate lineage. Here, we describe a functional analogy to a common morphological process in human speech, affixation, in the alarm calls of free-ranging adult Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli campbelli). We found that male alarm calls are composed of an acoustically variable stem, which can be followed by an acoustically invariable suffix. Using long-term observations and predator simulation experiments, we show that suffixation in this species functions to broaden the calls' meaning by transforming a highly specific eagle alarm to a general arboreal disturbance call or by transforming a highly specific leopard alarm call to a general alert call. We concluded that, when referring to specific external events, non-human primates can generate meaningful acoustic variation during call production that is functionally equivalent to suffixation in human language."

Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical component of the natural host defense against pathogens such as SA, but its therapeutic applications have been limited by a lack of effective delivery options. We tested the efficacy of a NO-releasing nanoparticle system (NO-np) in methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) abscesses in mice. The results show that the NO-np exert antimicrobial activity against MRSA in vitro and in abscesses. Topical or intradermal NO-np treatment of abscesses reduces the involved area and bacterial load while improving skin architecture. Notably, we evaluated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that are involved in immunomodulation and wound healing, revealing that NO-np lead to a reduction in angiogenesis preventing bacterial dissemination from abscesses. These data suggest that NO-np may be useful therapeutics for microbial abscesses."
https://openalex.org/W2071617241,"Mammalian filamins (FLNs) are a family of three large actin-binding proteins. FLNa, the founding member of the family, was implicated in migration by cell biological analyses and the identification of FLNA mutations in the neuronal migration disorder periventricular heterotopia. However, recent knockout studies have questioned the relevance of FLNa to cell migration. Here we have used shRNA-mediated knockdown of FLNa, FLNb or FLNa and FLNb, or, alternatively, acute proteasomal degradation of all three FLNs, to generate FLN-deficient cells and assess their ability to migrate. We report that loss of FLNa or FLNb has little effect on migration but that knockdown of FLNa and FLNb, or proteolysis of all three FLNs, impairs migration. The observed defect is primarily a deficiency in initiation of motility rather than a problem with maintenance of locomotion speed. FLN-deficient cells are also impaired in spreading. Re-expression of full length FLNa, but not re-expression of a mutated FLNa lacking immunoglobulin domains 19 to 21, reverts both the spreading and the inhibition of initiation of migration.Our results establish a role for FLNs in cell migration and spreading and suggest that compensation by other FLNs may mask phenotypes in single knockout or knockdown cells. We propose that interactions between FLNs and transmembrane or signalling proteins, mediated at least in part by immunoglobulin domains 19 to 21 are important for both cell spreading and initiation of migration."
https://openalex.org/W2030300755,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV, is an acute infectious disease with significant mortality. A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and associated lung failure. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, although significant progress towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of the infection has been made, a large gap still remains in our knowledge regarding how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell at the onset of infection. The rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. We have focused on a novel concept of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated host-virus interactions in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by correlating the ""BASC-microRNome"" with their targets within BASCs and viral genome. This work encompasses miRNA array data analysis, target prediction, and miRNA-mRNA enrichment analysis and develops a complex interaction map among disease-related factors, miRNAs, and BASCs in SARS pathway, which will provide some clues for diagnostic markers to view an overall interplay leading to disease progression. Our observation reveals the BASCs (Sca-1+ CD34+ CD45- Pecam-), a subset of Oct-4+ ACE2+ epithelial colony cells at the broncho-alveolar duct junction, to be the prime target cells of SARS-CoV infection. Upregulated BASC miRNAs-17*, -574-5p, and -214 are co-opted by SARS-CoV to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place. Viral Nucleocapsid and Spike protein targets seem to co-opt downregulated miR-223 and miR-98 respectively within BASCs to control the various stages of BASC differentiation, activation of inflammatory chemokines, and downregulation of ACE2. All these effectively accounts for a successful viral transmission and replication within BASCs causing continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity for lung repair. Overall, this investigation reveals another mode of exploitation of cellular miRNA machinery by virus to their own advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2041705284,"PTEN is a tumour suppressor with phosphatase activity in vitro against both lipids and proteins and other potential non-enzymatic mechanisms of action. Although the importance of PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity in regulating the PI3K signalling pathway is recognized, the significance of PTEN's other mechanisms of action is currently unclear. In this study, we describe the systematic identification of a PTEN mutant, PTEN Y138L, with activity against lipid, but not soluble substrates. Using this mutant, we provide evidence for the interfacial activation of PTEN against lipid substrates. We also show that when re-expressed at physiological levels in PTEN null U87MG glioblastoma cells, the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is not required to regulate cellular PtdInsP3 levels or the downstream protein kinase Akt/PKB. Finally, in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures of U87MG cells similarly re-expressing PTEN mutants, both the protein and lipid phosphatase activities were required to inhibit invasion, but either activity alone significantly inhibited proliferation, albeit only weakly for the protein phosphatase activity. Our data provide a novel tool to address the significance of PTEN's separable lipid and protein phosphatase activities and suggest that both activities suppress proliferation and together suppress invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2033457104,"SET-domain proteins are histone lysine (K) methyltransferases (HMTase) implicated in defining transcriptionally permissive or repressive chromatin. The Arabidopsis ASH1 HOMOLOG 2 (ASHH2) protein (also called SDG8, EFS and CCR1) has been suggested to methylate H3K4 and/or H3K36 and is similar to Drosophila ASH1, a positive maintainer of gene expression, and yeast Set2, a H3K36 HMTase. Mutation of the ASHH2 gene has pleiotropic developmental effects. Here we focus on the role of ASHH2 in plant reproduction.A slightly reduced transmission of the ashh2 allele in reciprocal crosses implied involvement in gametogenesis or gamete function. However, the main requirement of ASHH2 is sporophytic. On the female side, close to 80% of mature ovules lack embryo sac. On the male side, anthers frequently develop without pollen sacs or with specific defects in the tapetum layer, resulting in reduction in the number of functional pollen per anther by up to approximately 90%. In consistence with the phenotypic findings, an ASHH2 promoter-reporter gene was expressed at the site of megaspore mother cell formation as well as tapetum layers and pollen. ashh2 mutations also result in homeotic changes in floral organ identity. Transcriptional profiling identified more than 300 up-regulated and 600 down-regulated genes in ashh2 mutant inflorescences, whereof the latter included genes involved in determination of floral organ identity, embryo sac and anther/pollen development. This was confirmed by real-time PCR. In the chromatin of such genes (AP1, AtDMC1 and MYB99) we observed a reduction of H3K36 trimethylation (me3), but not H3K4me3 or H3K36me2.The severe distortion of reproductive organ development in ashh2 mutants, argues that ASHH2 is required for the correct expression of genes essential to reproductive development. The reduction in the ashh2 mutant of H3K36me3 on down-regulated genes relevant to the observed defects, implicates ASHH2 in regulation of gene expression via H3K36 trimethylation in chromatin of Arabidopsis inflorescences."
https://openalex.org/W2023733105,"Commonly glucose is considered to be the only preferred substrate in Bacillus subtilis whose presence represses utilization of other alternative substrates. Because recent data indicate that malate might be an exception, we quantify here the carbon source utilization hierarchy. Based on physiology and transcriptional data during co-utilization experiments with eight carbon substrates, we demonstrate that malate is a second preferred carbon source for B. subtilis, which is rapidly co-utilized with glucose and strongly represses the uptake of alternative substrates. From the different hierarchy and degree of catabolite repression exerted by glucose and malate, we conclude that both substrates might act through different molecular mechanisms. To obtain a quantitative and functional network view of how malate is (co)metabolized, we developed a novel approach to metabolic flux analysis that avoids error-prone, intuitive, and ad hoc decisions on 13C rearrangements. In particular, we developed a rigorous approach for deriving reaction reversibilities by combining in vivo intracellular metabolite concentrations with a thermodynamic feasibility analysis. The thus-obtained analytical model of metabolism was then used for network-wide isotopologue balancing to estimate the intracellular fluxes. These 13C-flux data revealed an extraordinarily high malate influx that is primarily catabolized via the gluconeogenic reactions and toward overflow metabolism.

Co-utilization of glucose and malate resulted in a synergistic decrease of the respiratory tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Typically, microbes prefer a single carbon source whose presence represses utilization of alternative substrates. The classical example is the diauxic shift of Escherichia coli with subsequent growth on first glucose and then lactose (1Jacob F. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 318-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). This widespread phenomenon, referred to as carbon catabolite repression, has been intensively studied in many chemo-organotrophic microbes, and in the vast majority of documented cases, the preferred carbon source is glucose (2Görke B. Stülke J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 3Brückner R. Titgemeyer F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 209: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Apart from repressing the co-utilization of alternative substrates, preferred carbon sources are normally associated with a high specific growth rate and substantial secretion of overflow metabolites such as ethanol, lactate, or acetate. For the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, glucose has long been recognized to be preferred, but recent data indicated that glucose might not be the only preferred carbon source (4Doan T.

According to the current model of the global carbon catabolite repression mechanism in B. subtilis, glucose-induced catabolite repression is mediated by the HPr kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of HPr at its Ser-46 residue (2Görke B. Stülke J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). This effect is propagated throughout the cell by the pleiotropic transcription factor CcpA (6Henkin T.M.

Based on indirect evidence, the gluconeogenic organic acid malate is a possible exception to this hierarchy. Unlike many other carboxylic acids, malate is rapidly metabolized by B. subtilis, allowing for a similar doubling time as with glucose (4Doan T. Servant P. Tojo S. Yamaguchi H. Lerondel G. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. Aymerich S. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although for most gluconeogenic carbon sources such as citrate, succinate, and fumarate, catabolite repressor (cre) binding sites have been found upstream of the genes involved in their transport (5Asai K.

Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30287-30292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of dctP, encoding the generic C4-dicarboxylic transporter for succinate and fumarate, is repressed by the addition of malate (5Asai K. Baik S.H. Kasahara Y. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of whether malate would also be a preferred carbon source for B. subtilis. By characterizing the physiology of growth on malate and through carbon source co-utilization studies, we present both physiological and transcriptional proof that this is indeed the case. Given the preferential status of malate for B. subtilis, we became interested in how malate is metabolized. To obtain a quantitative and functional network view, we used 13C-based flux analysis (11Sauer U. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 62Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The first prerequisite for an accurate estimation of fluxes from 13C rearrangements is a correct stoichiometric network model with defined reaction reversibilities (12Wiechert W. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 13Zamboni N. Fendt S.M. Rühl M. Sauer U. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although this knowledge is readily available for model organisms grown on glucose (14Zhao J. Shimizu K. J.

Bioeng. 2001; 76: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), one cannot simply extrapolate these reaction reversibilities to alternative growth conditions. To avoid error-prone, intuitive, and ad hoc decisions, we describe here a rigorous and generalized approach to derive these reaction reversibilities (see Fig. 1). The approach is based on determining quantitative metabolomic data under the considered conditions and combining these with predetermined standard thermodynamic formation energies (ΔG′fo) of the reactants that are defined in the stoichiometric network model. The framework of network-embedded thermodynamic (NET) analysis (17Kummel A. Panke S. Heinemann M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 34Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Zamboni N. Kümmel A. Heinemann M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is then used to calculate the actual Gibbs energies (ΔG′Ro) for all reactions in the network. These ΔG′Ro values are directly related to the reversibilities of the reactions (19Wiechert W. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using this general framework, we derived substrate-specific network models for exponentially growth of B. subtilis on glucose, malate, and the mixture of glucose plus malate that were subsequently used to quantify intracellular fluxes from 13C-labeling experiments. All physiological and flux analysis experiments were performed with wild-type B. subtilis BSB168 trp+ (20Jules M. Le Chat L. Aymerich S. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3168-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For each growth experiment, frozen glycerol stocks were used to inoculate 5 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. After 5 h of growth at 37 °C, LB cultures were used to inoculate 5 ml of M9 minimal medium precultures at dilutions ranging from 500- to 2000-fold. The range of dilutions was chosen to assure that M9 precultures reached an optical density at 600 nm (A600) between 0.5 and 1.0 upon overnight incubation. The M9 medium precultures with an A600 between 0.5 and 1.0 were used to inoculate 30 ml of M9 medium in 500 ml of non-baffled shake flasks to a starting A600 of 0.03–0.05. Cultivation was done at 300 rpm and 37 °C in an orbital shaker with a shaking diameter of 50 mm. The M9 minimal medium consisted of the following components (per liter): 8.5 g of Na2HPO4.2H20, 3 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of NaCl. The following components were sterilized separately and then added (per liter of final medium): 1 ml of 0.1 m CaCl2.2H2O, 1 ml of 1 m MgSO4.7H2O, 1 ml of 50 mm FeCl3.6H2O, and 10 ml of trace salt solution. The trace salts solution contained (per liter): 170 mg of ZnCl2, 100 mg of MnCl2.4H2O, 60.0 mg of CoCl2.6H2O, 60.0 mg of Na2MoO4.2H2O, and 43.0 mg CuCl2.2H2O. When preparing the medium, the base salts were added first followed by CalCl2, MgSO4, FeCl3, and finally the trace elements. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium at the final concentrations shown in Table 1. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH-neutralized with 4 m NaOH before filter-sterilization. For 13C-labeling experiments, the same final concentrations were used, but the carbon source was added directly to the shake flask. Both d-glucose and l-malate were added as a mixture of 20% (wt/wt) uniformly labeled carbon source (both > 99% isotopic purity; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 80% (wt/wt) naturally labeled carbon source.TABLE 1Carbon source concentrations in the described growth experimentsCarbon sourceConcentrationaConcentrations were chosen such that the total carbon molecular mol content of the medium remained approximately 200 mmol carbon/liter.Single carbon sourceDual carbon sourceg/literd-Glucose32l-Malic acid54d-Fructose32Sodium d-gluconate43Sodium pyruvate64Glycerol63d-Arabinose42Fumaric acid53Succinic acidbIn the absence of glucose, B. subtilis cultures grown on succinic acid are auxotrophic for glutamate (58). Consequently, 2g/liter glutamic acid was added to all cultures grown in the presence of succinic acid (both as single or dual carbon source).42a Concentrations were chosen such that the total carbon molecular mol content of the medium remained approximately 200 mmol carbon/liter.b In the absence of glucose, B. subtilis cultures grown on succinic acid are auxotrophic for glutamate (58Commichau F.M. Wacker I. Schleider J. Blencke H.M. Reif I. Tripal P. Stülke J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 12: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consequently, 2g/liter glutamic acid was added to all cultures grown in the presence of succinic acid (both as single or dual carbon source). Open table in a new tab Extracellular substrate and byproduct concentrations were measured by HPLC analysis using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC stack (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) in combination with an Aminex HPX-87H polymer column (Bio-Rad). Sugars were detected with a refractive index detector, and organic acids were detected with a UV-visible detector. Specific rates were calculated by regression analysis for at least five time points during the exponential growth phase as described previously (21Sauer U. Lasko D.R. Fiaux J. Hochuli M. Glaser R. Szyperski T. Wüthrich K. Bailey J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6679-6688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell growth was monitored photometrically at 600 nm, and cell dry weight was inferred from a predetermined conversion factor of 0.48 g of cells/A600 (22Tännler S. Decasper S. Sauer U. Microb. Cell Fact. 2008; 7: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All physiological parameters were determined during the exponential growth phase, typically ranging from 0.10 to 1.5 A600. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter strains of glpF or dctP transcription were obtained by insertion of either a fragment containing the entire glpF regulatory region (from −271 to + 130 relative to the transcription start) or the 3′ end region of the dctP gene (from +866 to +1466 relative to the translation start) into the pBaSysBioII plasmid upstream of the promoter-less gfpmut3 gene (23Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene. 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar) and then inserting the resulting plasmids into BSB168 strain (20Jules M. Le Chat L. Aymerich S. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3168-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) chromosome by single crossing-over recombination. Three independent clones were cultivated in 96-well plates into an incubator/reader (Synergy 2; Biotek, Winooski, VT) at 37 °C with shaking in the same media as those used for the uptake measurement experiments. Growth (A600) and fluorescence (485/528 nm) were followed every 10 min. Each clone was cultivated in at least two independent wells for each tested condition, and each plate (one for succinate ± glucose or malate, one for glycerol ± glucose or malate) was replicated twice. The expression of each fusion was, thus, determined using at least eight different cultures in each studied condition. Growth rates were similar to those obtained in shake flasks. The fluorescence signal was corrected for background using the fluorescence signal of the BSB168 strain (without the gfpmut3 gene). The expression levels of both fusions were calculated as dGFP/dt/A for 5 time points during the exponential phase (0.3–0.9 at A600) of each independent culture. Quenching of cell metabolism based on cold solvent mixtures was shown to result in unspecific metabolite leakage and is, thus, not suitable for bacteria (24Bolten C.J. Kiefer P. Letisse F. Portais J.C. Wittmann C. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Hence we used a rapid centrifugation method where 1 ml of culture broth was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged for 15 s at 14,000 × g in a tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Metabolites were extracted from the pellets by the addition of 1 ml of extracting solution at 78 °C. Aliquots for intracellular metabolite quantification were taken in triplicate from the shake flask cultures during exponential growth at a A600 between 0.8 and 1.2. The extraction solution consisted of 60% (v/v) ethanol buffered with 10 mm ammonium acetate at pH 7.2. Directly after the addition of the extraction solution, 5 nmol each of norvaline and glutarate were added as internal standards. Pellets were extracted three times for 1 min at 78 °C while shaking at 1000 rpm in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). Extracts were cooled on ice until further centrifugation. The metabolite extract was separated from cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were pooled and dried at 0.12 millibar to complete dryness in a SpeedVac setup composed of an Alpha 2–4 LD plus cooling trap, RVC 2-33 rotational vacuum concentrator, and RC-5 vacuum chemical hybrid pump (Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany). Dry metabolite extracts were stored at −80 °C until analysis. The GC-TOF workflow is described in detail by Ewald et al. (25Ewald J.C. Heux S. Zamboni N. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Dried aliquots were derivatized with 15 μl of either TMS-reagent (N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) or TBDMS reagent (N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, Fluka), and aliquots of 5 μl were injected into a 30-m GC column (HP-5-MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent) using a CIS4 injector (Gerstel, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany) and solvent venting. Derivatized metabolites were detected on a Pegasus 3D TOF mass spectrometer (Leco), with an acquisition rate of 40 Hz. Peak detection and assignment were performed with ChromaTOF software (Version 2.32, Leco). The ion-pairing liquid chromatography method is described in detail by Büscher et al. (26Büscher J.M. Czernik D. Ewald J.C. Sauer U. Zamboni N. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 2135-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Dry metabolite extracts were resuspended in 100 μl of water, 8 μl of which were injected on a Agilent 1100 series HPLC stack with a Synergi Hydro RP 2.1 × 150 × 4 column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). Metabolites were detected using a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB/MDS Sciex, Concord, Canada) operated in tandem MS mode with unit mass resolution. Analyst software (Version 1.4.2, AB/MDS Sciex) was used for both acquisition and integration. Ion spray voltage, auxiliary gas temperature, nebulizer gas, auxiliary gas, curtain gas, and collision gas were set to −4200 V, 650 °C, and 65, 40, 10, 4 (arbitrary units), respectively. Thermodynamic feasibility of the acquired metabolite datasets were computationally verified by NET analysis (17Kummel A. Panke S. Heinemann M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 34Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Using the MatLab-based software anNET (18Zamboni N. Kümmel A. Heinemann M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), measured metabolite concentrations, published Gibbs standard energies of formation for physiological conditions (27Alberty R.A. Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Crossref Google Scholar), and a genome-scale stoichiometric network (28Oh Y.K. Palsson B.O. Park S.M. Schilling C.H. Mahadevan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28791-28799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were combined to derive feasible ranges for the Gibbs energies of reactions (min/max ΔG′R). The original model of 1020 metabolic reactions and 988 metabolites was reduced to a core model with 166 reactions and 147 metabolites by omitting all metabolites for which no thermodynamic data were available. The intracellular pH was set to be 7.8 (29Breeuwer P. Drocourt J. Rombouts F.M. Abee T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 178-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ionic strength was assumed to be 0.15 m (30Voets T. Droogmans G. Raskin G. Eggermont J. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5298-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that the quotient of net and exchange fluxes are coupled to the Gibbs energies of enzyme reactions (19Wiechert W. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Beard D.A. Qian H. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e144Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The exchange flux theorem defined by Wiechert (19Wiechert W. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) states that the forward and backward flux of a multistep reaction mechanism is directly correlated to the ΔG′R, ρR≤v→v←≤ρ(Eq. 1) ρ=exp(-ΔGR'RT)(Eq. 2) where ρ is the non-equilibrium coefficient of the overall mechanism, and ρR is the coefficient of the reaction steps of the mechanism. Typically, binding steps and state transformations in a multistep reaction mechanism are close to equilibrium; in practice it holds that the flux ratio is approximately equal to ρ, yielding v→v←≈exp(-ΔGR'RT)(Eq. 3) By combining this theorem with the Gibbs energies of reaction derived from NET analysis we obtain a rational approach for deriving reaction reversibilities (Fig. 1). Here we adopt the criterion that a reaction is considered unidirectional if the value of the forward or the backward flux exceeds the other by at least 50 times. For 13C-labeling experiments, this means that of every 50 13C molecules converted by the forward reaction, less than one 13C molecule is converted by the backward reaction. For all practical purposes the contribution of the backward flux to the overall labeling distribution of the surrounding metabolites can be neglected in such cases. By combining this criterion with Equations 4 and 5 (see later in the section), four cases can be defined (Fig. 2). If the minimal and maximum ΔG′R for a reaction ranges between −10 and 10 kJ/mol, the reaction is defined as reversible. If both the minimal and maximum ΔG′R for a reaction are smaller than −10 kJ/mol, the reaction is unidirectional, and the backward reaction is negligible. If both the minimal and maximum ΔG′R for a reaction are larger than 10 kJ/mol, the reaction is unidirectional, and the forward reaction is negligible. If the minimal and maximum ΔG′R span either −10 or 10 kJ/mol, the reaction reversibility is undefined and modeled as reversible. Consequently, no constraints are imposed on the feasible 13C distributions. Biomass aliquots (30 ml ≈ 15 mg of biomass dry weight) for analyzing the 13C-labeling pattern of the proteinogenic amino acids were harvested from shake flask cultures during exponential growth. To ensure isotopic steady state, biomass samples were harvested at an A600 of 1.0 ± 0.2 (13Zamboni N. Fendt S.M. Rühl M. Sauer U. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution. Aliquots of 5 mg of biomass were hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 6 m HCl, dried, and derivatized as described by Fischer and Sauer (32Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In a next step GC-MS analysis and raw data analysis were performed (32Fischer E. Sauer U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The obtained isotopologue fractions were corrected for the occurrence of natural isotopes of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and silicon in both the amino acid and the derivatizing agent and for the occurrence of natural isotopes of C in the derivatizing agent only. Stoichiometric network models were based on a core model containing the reactions of central carbon metabolism defined by Oh et al. (28Oh Y.K. Palsson B.O. Park S.M. Schilling C.H. Mahadevan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28791-28799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Feasible ranges for the ΔG′R were obtained from anNET and combined with the exchange flux theorem of Wiechert (19Wiechert W. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to classify the reaction in the stoichiometric network as either unidirectional forward, unidirectional backward, or reversible. By default, all reactions in the initial network were set to be reversible. Reversible reactions were modeled as separate forward and backward reactions and are referred to as net and exchange fluxes. vnet=vforward-vbackward(Eq. 4) vexchange=min(vforward,vbackward)(Eq. 5) The growth rate-dependent biomass requirements of B. subtilis were previously established by Dauner et al. (16Dauner M. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 76: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and added to the network as unidirectional biomass precursor-withdrawing reactions. For a detailed overview of the reactions included into the stoichiometric network model, see supplemental Appendix A. Metabolic fluxes were derived using whole isotopologue analysis (15van Winden W.A. van Dam J.C. Ras C. Kleijn R.J. Vinke J.L. van Gulik W.M. Heijnen J.J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Kleijn R.J. van Winden W.A. van Gulik W.M. Heijnen J.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4970-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In short, the procedure uses the cumomer balances and cumomer to isotopologue mapping matrices introduced by Wiechert et al. (34Wiechert W. Möllney M. Isermann N. Wurzel M. de Graaf A.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 66: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to calculate the isotopologue distributions of metabolites in a pre-defined stoichiometric network model for a given flux-set. The flux-set that gives the best correspondence between the measured and simulated 13C-label distribution is determined by non-linear optimization and denoted as the optimal flux-fit. All calculations were performed in Matlab 7.6.0 (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Given previous indications of malate as a possible exception to the CcpA-imposed hierarchy of catabolite repression (4Doan T. Servant P. Tojo S. Yamaguchi H. Lerondel G. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. Aymerich S. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Asai K. Baik S.H. Kasahara Y. Moriya S. Ogasawara N.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6099-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that its utilization might not be repressed by glucose. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the culture physiology during growth on either glucose or malate and the mixture of both in minimal medium (Table 2). Consistent with previous data (4Doan T. Servant P. Tojo S. Yamaguchi H. Lerondel G. Yoshida K. Fujita Y. Aymerich S. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), virtually identical growth rates were observed on glucose and on malate, but malate was consumed at an unusual 4-fold higher specific rate. Most likely as a consequence of the high uptake rate, a higher fraction of the consumed carbon was secreted as overflow metabolites; i.e. 34% (mol/mol) on malate versus 15% on glucose. Moreover, pyruvate was the new main overflow product on malate, whereas only acetate was formed on glucose. Consistent with the above hypothesis, glucose and malate were fully co-utilized at a specific rate of growth that was higher than on the individual substrates. These physiological data, in particular the concomitant uptake of glucose and malate, demonstrate that malate does not comply with the previously proposed hierarchy in carbon source utilization for B. subtilis (3Brückner R. Titgemeyer F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 209: 141-148Crossref PubMed"
https://openalex.org/W2030297102,"Background The therapeutic use of multipotent stem cells depends on their differentiation potential, which has been shown to be variable for different populations. These differences are likely to be the result of key changes in their epigenetic profiles. Methodology/Principal Findings to address this issue, we have investigated the levels of epigenetic regulation in well characterized populations of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) and multipotent adult stem cells (ASC) at the trancriptome, methylome, histone modification and microRNA levels. Differences in gene expression profiles allowed classification of stem cells into three separate populations including ESC, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The analysis of the PcG repressive marks, histone modifications and gene promoter methylation of differentiation and pluripotency genes demonstrated that stem cell populations with a wider differentiation potential (ESC and MAPC) showed stronger representation of epigenetic repressive marks in differentiation genes and that this epigenetic signature was progressively lost with restriction of stem cell potential. Our analysis of microRNA established specific microRNA signatures suggesting specific microRNAs involved in regulation of pluripotent and differentiation genes. Conclusions/Significance Our study leads us to propose a model where the level of epigenetic regulation, as a combination of DNA methylation and histone modification marks, at differentiation genes defines degrees of differentiation potential from progenitor and multipotent stem cells to pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012174464,"The Kennedy pathway generates phosphocoline and phosphoethanolamine through its two branches. Choline Kinase (ChoK) is the first enzyme of the Kennedy branch of synthesis of phosphocholine, the major component of the plasma membrane. ChoK family of proteins is composed by ChoKalpha and ChoKbeta isoforms, the first one with two different variants of splicing. Recently ChoKalpha has been implicated in the carcinogenic process, since it is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers. However, no evidence for a role of ChoKbeta in carcinogenesis has been reported.Here we compare the in vitro and in vivo properties of ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta in lipid metabolism, and their potential role in carcinogenesis. Both ChoKalpha1 and ChoKbeta showed choline and ethanolamine kinase activities when assayed in cell extracts, though with different affinity for their substrates. However, they behave differentially when overexpressed in whole cells. Whereas ChoKbeta display an ethanolamine kinase role, ChoKalpha1 present a dual choline/ethanolamine kinase role, suggesting the involvement of each ChoK isoform in distinct biochemical pathways under in vivo conditions. In addition, while overexpression of ChoKalpha1 is oncogenic when overexpressed in HEK293T or MDCK cells, ChoKbeta overexpression is not sufficient to induce in vitro cell transformation nor in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, a significant upregulation of ChoKalpha1 mRNA levels in a panel of breast and lung cancer cell lines was found, but no changes in ChoKbeta mRNA levels were observed. Finally, MN58b, a previously described potent inhibitor of ChoK with in vivo antitumoral activity, shows more than 20-fold higher efficiency towards ChoKalpha1 than ChoKbeta.This study represents the first evidence of the distinct metabolic role of ChoKalpha and ChoKbeta isoforms, suggesting different physiological roles and implications in human carcinogenesis. These findings constitute a step forward in the design of an antitumoral strategy based on ChoK inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2086032212,"Changes in membrane morphology and membrane protein dynamics based on its fluidity are critical for cancer metastasis. However, this subject has remained unclear, because the spatial precision of previous in vivo imaging has been limited to the micrometer level and single molecule imaging is impossible. Here, we have imaged the membrane dynamics of tumor cells in mice with a spatial precision of 7-9 nm under a confocal microscope. A metastasis-promoting factor on the cell membrane, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), was labeled with quantum dots conjugated with an anti-PAR1 antibody. Movements of cancer cells and PAR1 during metastasis were clearly observed in vivo. Images used to assess PAR1 dynamics were taken of representative cells for four stages of metastasis; i.e. cancer cells far from blood vessels in tumor, near the vessel, in the bloodstream, and adherent to the inner vascular surface in the normal tissues near tumor were photographed. The diffusion constant of PAR1 in static cells far from tumor blood vessels was smaller than in moving cells near the vessels and in the bloodstream. The diffusion constant of cells adhering to the inner vascular surface in the normal tissues was also very small. Cells formed membrane protrusion during migration. The PAR1 diffusion constant on these pseudopodia was greater than in other membrane regions in the same cell. Thus, the dynamics of PAR1 movement showed that membrane fluidity increases during intravasation, reaches a peak in the vessel, decreases during extravasation, and is also higher at locally formed pseudopodia."
https://openalex.org/W2008233240,"The Myc oncoprotein, a transcriptional regulator involved in the etiology of many different tumor types, has been demonstrated to play an important role in the functions of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Nonetheless, it is still unclear as to whether Myc has unique target and functions in ES cells.To elucidate the role of c-Myc in murine ES cells, we mapped its genomic binding sites by chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarrays (ChIP-chip). In addition to previously identified targets we identified genes involved in pluripotency, early development, and chromatin modification/structure that are bound and regulated by c-Myc in murine ES cells. Myc also binds and regulates loci previously identified as Polycomb (PcG) targets, including genes that contain bivalent chromatin domains. To determine whether c-Myc influences the epigenetic state of Myc-bound genes, we assessed the patterns of trimethylation of histone H3-K4 and H3-K27 in mES cells containing normal, increased, and reduced levels of c-Myc. Our analysis reveals widespread and surprisingly diverse changes in repressive and activating histone methylation marks both proximal and distal to Myc binding sites. Furthermore, analysis of bulk chromatin from phenotypically normal c-myc null E7 embryos demonstrates a 70-80% decrease in H3-K4me3, with little change in H3-K27me3, compared to wild-type embryos indicating that Myc is required to maintain normal levels of histone methylation.We show that Myc induces widespread and diverse changes in histone methylation in ES cells. We postulate that these changes are indirect effects of Myc mediated by its regulation of target genes involved in chromatin remodeling. We further show that a subset of PcG-bound genes with bivalent histone methylation patterns are bound and regulated in response to altered c-Myc levels. Our data indicate that in mES cells c-Myc binds, regulates, and influences the histone modification patterns of genes involved in chromatin remodeling, pluripotency, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2030693165,"Poor methodological quality and reporting are known concerns with diagnostic accuracy studies. In 2003, the QUADAS tool and the STARD standards were published for evaluating the quality and improving the reporting of diagnostic studies, respectively. However, it is unclear whether these tools have been applied to diagnostic studies of infectious diseases. We performed a systematic review on the methodological and reporting quality of diagnostic studies in TB, malaria and HIV.We identified diagnostic accuracy studies of commercial tests for TB, malaria and HIV through a systematic search of the literature using PubMed and EMBASE (2004-2006). Original studies that reported sensitivity and specificity data were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics and diagnostic accuracy, and used QUADAS and STARD to evaluate the quality of methods and reporting, respectively.Ninety (38%) of 238 articles met inclusion criteria. All studies had design deficiencies. Study quality indicators that were met in less than 25% of the studies included adequate description of withdrawals (6%) and reference test execution (10%), absence of index test review bias (19%) and reference test review bias (24%), and report of uninterpretable results (22%). In terms of quality of reporting, 9 STARD indicators were reported in less than 25% of the studies: methods for calculation and estimates of reproducibility (0%), adverse effects of the diagnostic tests (1%), estimates of diagnostic accuracy between subgroups (10%), distribution of severity of disease/other diagnoses (11%), number of eligible patients who did not participate in the study (14%), blinding of the test readers (16%), and description of the team executing the test and management of indeterminate/outlier results (both 17%). The use of STARD was not explicitly mentioned in any study. Only 22% of 46 journals that published the studies included in this review required authors to use STARD.Recently published diagnostic accuracy studies on commercial tests for TB, malaria and HIV have moderate to low quality and are poorly reported. The more frequent use of tools such as QUADAS and STARD may be necessary to improve the methodological and reporting quality of future diagnostic accuracy studies in infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2140688812,"In the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation, the destabilizing activity of N-terminal Asp, Glu or (oxidized) Cys residues requires their conjugation to Arg, which is recognized directly by pathway's ubiquitin ligases. N-terminal arginylation is mediated by the Ate1 arginyltransferase, whose physiological substrates include the Rgs4, Rgs5 and Rgs16 regulators of G proteins. Here, we employed the Cre-lox technique to uncover new physiological functions of N-terminal arginylation in adult mice. We show that postnatal deletion of mouse Ate1 (its unconditional deletion is embryonic lethal) causes a rapid decrease of body weight and results in early death of approximately 15% of Ate1-deficient mice. Despite being hyperphagic, the surviving Ate1-deficient mice contain little visceral fat. They also exhibit an increased metabolic rate, ectopic induction of the Ucp1 uncoupling protein in white fat, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. In addition, Ate1-deficient mice have enlarged brains, an enhanced startle response, are strikingly hyperkinetic, and are prone to seizures and kyphosis. Ate1-deficient males are also infertile, owing to defects in Ate1(-/-) spermatocytes. The remarkably broad range of specific biological processes that are shown here to be perturbed by the loss of N-terminal arginylation will make possible the dissection of regulatory circuits that involve Ate1 and either its known substrates, such as Rgs4, Rgs5 and Rgs16, or those currently unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2038014932,"Background The annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARTI) is a key epidemiological indicator of the extent of transmission in a community. Several methods have been suggested to estimate the prevalence of tuberculous infection using tuberculin skin test data. This paper explores the implications of using different methods to estimate prevalence of infection and ARTI. The effect of BCG vaccination on these estimates is also investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Tuberculin surveys among school children in 16 communities in Zambia and 8 in South Africa (SA) were performed in 2005, as part of baseline data collection and for randomisation purposes of the ZAMSTAR study. Infection prevalence and ARTI estimates were calculated using five methods: different cut-offs with or without adjustments for sensitivity, the mirror method, and mixture analysis. A total of 49,835 children were registered for the surveys, of which 25,048 (50%) had skin tests done and 22,563 (90%) of those tested were read. Infection prevalence was higher in the combined SA than Zambian communities. The mirror method resulted in the least difference of 7.8%, whereas that estimated by the cut-off methods varied from 12.2% to 17.3%. The ARTI in the Zambian and SA communities was between 0.8% and 2.8% and 2.5% and 4.2% respectively, depending on the method used. In the SA communities, the ARTI was higher among the younger children. BCG vaccination had little effect on these estimates. Conclusions/Significance ARTI estimates are dependent on the calculation method used. All methods agreed that there were substantial differences in infection prevalence across the communities, with higher rates in SA. Although TB notification rates have increased over the past decades, the difference in cumulative exposure between younger and older children is less dramatic and a rise in risk of infection in parallel with the estimated incidence of active tuberculosis cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2084538239,"The identification of differentially regulated proteins in animal models of psychiatric diseases is essential for a comprehensive analysis of associated psychopathological processes. Mass spectrometry is the most relevant method for analyzing differences in protein expression of tissue and body fluid proteomes. However, standardization of sample handling and sample-to-sample variability are problematic. Stable isotope metabolic labeling of a proteome represents the gold standard for quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. The simultaneous processing of a mixture of labeled and unlabeled samples allows a sensitive and accurate comparative analysis between the respective proteomes. Here, we describe a cost-effective feeding protocol based on a newly developed 15N bacteria diet based on Ralstonia eutropha protein, which was applied to a mouse model for trait anxiety. Tissue from 15N-labeled vs. 14N-unlabeled mice was examined by mass spectrometry and differences in the expression of glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) and histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 2 (Hint2) proteins were correlated with the animals' psychopathological behaviors for methodological validation and proof of concept, respectively. Additionally, phenotyping unraveled an antidepressant-like effect of the incorporation of the stable isotope 15N into the proteome of highly anxious mice. This novel phenomenon is of considerable relevance to the metabolic labeling method and could provide an opportunity for the discovery of candidate proteins involved in depression-like behavior. The newly developed 15N bacteria diet provides researchers a novel tool to discover disease-relevant protein expression differences in mouse models using quantitative mass spectrometry."

IntroductionIntegrins are adhesive heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that bind to extracellular matrix ligands or to cell surface proteins on adjacent cells. The cytoplasmic tails of the integrins are linked directly, or via adaptors, to numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins and transmit signals from the outside of the cell to the inside. The adhesive properties of integrins are dynamically regulated as these receptors shift between different conformations upon binding to extracellular ligands or cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, integrins are present in high or low affinity states on the surface of cells depending on the cellular environment. Regulation of integrin activation is critical in controlling cell adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix assembly. This regulation is therefore important in normal development, hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, tumor cell metastasis, and immune responses (1Hynes R.O.

(band four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domain that has the ability to bind to β3 integrin cytoplasmic tails, and this results in the activation of αIIbβ3 integrins. The ability of talin to interact with integrins is itself regulated as the FERM domain is autoinhibited by binding to its C-terminal tail in an intra- or intermolecular manner (2Ginsberg M.H.

Experimentally, the autoinhibition can be removed by expressing the talin head (or FERM) domain in the absence of the inhibitory tail. Overexpression of the talin head or FERM domain activates the β3 and β1 integrins, and inhibition of talin expression reduces integrin activity in mammalian cell culture (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R.

This lead to speculation of a fundamental difference between Drosophila talin-PS2 integrin interactions and those observed for talin-αIIbβ3 in vertebrates (11Helsten T.L. Bunch T.A. Kato H. Yamanouchi J. Choi S.H. Jannuzi A.L. Féral C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Brower D.L. Shattil S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3589-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the methodologies used to measure integrin affinity for ligand in these two studies were fundamentally different. In this report, I find that when identical binding assays are conducted for αIIbβ3 integrins, as were used for the Drosophila PS2 integrins, talin has no effect on the affinity of αIIbβ3 for monovalent ligand. Thus, I find no difference between the Drosophila talin-PS2 integrin interactions and those seen for vertebrate talin-αIIbβ3 integrin.I do find that the talin FERM domain increases the ability of αIIbβ3 to bind to multivalent ligands, and this appears to be the source of discrepancy between the binding assays. Numerous studies have shown that a clustering mechanism activates β3 integrins. In platelets, avidity is an important component of αIIbβ3 binding to ligand as PAC-1 IgM showed 60-fold greater binding capacity as compared with the PAC-1 Fab even in the presence of secondary antibodies (12Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding, talin head expression, and agonist-induced activation in CHO cells all result in integrin clustering (13Buensuceso C. de Virgilio M. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Cluzel C. Saltel F. Lussi J. Paulhe F. Imhof B.A. Wehrle-Haller B. J.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).A clear understanding of αIIbβ3 activity regulation that distinguishes affinity from clustering effects is important as it may impact the development of therapeutic agents designed to modulate integrin activity to treat pathologies involving inflammation, thrombosis, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. If integrin activation or integrin activity is a general term that encompasses clustering and/or affinity changes, then clearly talin activates αIIbβ3 integrins in CHO cells. However, integrin activation is commonly interpreted to mean an increase in the affinity of an individual integrin heterodimer for ligand prior to encountering ligand (3Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It is this latter definition of integrin regulation by talin that is found in at least one cell biology textbook that states “Thus when talin binds to the β chain it undoes the intracellular α-β linkage, allowing the two legs of the integrin molecule to spring apart. This drives the extracellular portion of the integrin into its extended, active conformation.” (16Alberts B. Johnson A. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Walter P. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 5th Ed. Garland Science, New York, NY2007: 1172Google Scholar) My results in CHO cells and additional experiments in human platelets contradict this view of integrin affinity regulation by talin and point instead to the role of talin in integrin clustering.DISCUSSIONTalin has been demonstrated to be a key regulator of integrin adhesive activity both in whole organisms and in cell culture models (5Calderwood D.A.

Regulating integrin activity can occur by either changing the affinity of individual integrins for their ligands and/or clustering of integrins, thereby altering their ability to bind multivalent ligands.αIIbβ3 Affinity Versus ClusteringMy goal has been to distinguish between changes in integrin-ligand affinity versus avidity (clustering plus affinity) on the surface of living cells. Monovalent ligands, like PAC-1 Fab, in solution with cells, can probe the affinity of individual integrins for individual ligands. Simply clustering the integrins without changing their individual affinities should not affect their ability to bind a monovalent ligand. Multivalent ligands, like PAC-1 IgM, are able to detect clustering of integrins even in the absence of affinity changes. Each individual multivalent ligand can make multiple interactions with multiple integrins when these receptors are in close proximity (clustered), and this results in increased binding. When the integrins are not in close proximity (unclustered), multiple interactions are not possible, and reduced binding results. The binding of multivalent ligands will also be altered by changes in integrin affinity, and initial binding of the multivalent ligand can promote clustering of the integrins. The combination of affinity and clustering is often referred to as avidity. By using both types of assays, monovalent and multivalent, I can distinguish between affinity and avidity regulation of integrins.Using a newly developed binding assay for monovalent ligands that exposes integrins solely to the ligand in its monovalent state, we have reported on affinity increases in the Drosophila PS2 integrin due to the presence of Mn2+, integrin cytoplasmic and extracellular point mutations, and deletion of a βPS integrin plexin-semaphorin-integrin domain (19Bunch T.A. Helsten T.L. Kendall T.L. Shirahatti N. Mahadevan D. Shattil S.J. Brower D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5050-5057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here I show that this same assay reports αIIbβ3 integrin affinity modulation by Mn2+, a β3 cytoplasmic domain mutation, and ligand-induced activation. All of these results validate the ability of the monovalent fixation assay to detect affinity differences in Drosophila and vertebrate integrins.In contrast to previously reported results, I do not find increased binding of monovalent ligand (PAC-1 Fab) to αIIbβ3 integrins in the presence of high levels of talin head domains in CHO cells. The same cells did show increased binding to the same ligand presented in a multivalent state (PAC-1 IgM) in the traditional binding assay. Using the monovalent fixation assay, I also do not find increased affinity of αIIbβ3 on human platelets activated with thrombin. Despite being able to detect numerous activating conditions, I have considered that there might be an artifact of this assay, such as the presence of formaldehyde during the binding phase, that renders it unable to detect integrin activity differences resulting from platelet activation. To test this, I used the multivalent PAC-1 IgM in the exact same assay, including the presence of formaldehyde during the binding phase. This ligand did demonstrate an activation-dependent increase in binding. Thus, the monovalent fixation assay does not do away the ability to detect integrin activity increases upon activation; only changing the valency of the ligand does that. Therefore, I propose that talin increases integrin activity, both in CHO cell culture model assays and in human platelets, by increasing their clustering but not, directly, their affinity.Differences between the Monovalent Fixation Assay and Those Previously UsedThe monovalent fixation assay differs markedly from the ones currently used (monovalent plus multivalent secondary) to detect monovalent PAC-1 ligand binding to αIIbβ3, and I suggest that this difference is the cause of my different results in the cases of talin and thrombin activation of αIIbβ3 integrins in CHO cells and platelets. In the commonly used monovalent plus multivalent secondary assay, PAC-1 Fab fragment is incubated with cells for 15–30 min at room temperature, and then polyclonal secondary antibodies are added, and the incubation continues for an additional 20–30 min on ice. This is typically followed by a wash step and analysis by flow cytometry of the live cells. I have a number of concerns regarding this procedure. Most importantly, as soon as the secondary antibodies are added to the binding reaction, the PAC-1 Fab ceases to be a monovalent ligand. It is then capable of reporting on clustering as well as affinity changes. Although multivalent, the exact nature of the newly created ligand will depend on the exact concentration of the PAC-1 Fab and the polyclonal secondary antibodies and where the secondary antibodies bind to the PAC-1 Fab. Therefore, it is not expected that this ligand will behave exactly the same as the PAC-1 IgM in all binding assays.That multivalency is a component of the standard monovalent ligand secondary assay is illustrated by the fact that in all the reports based on this assay, PAC-1 Fab (and secondary antibody) remains bound even following a wash and/or dilution of live cells prior to flow cytometry that removes most or all unbound PAC-1 Fab. If unbound and bound PAC-1 Fab were truly in equilibrium with the integrins, then washes bringing the unbound PAC-1 concentration essentially to 0 should have resulted in dissociation of the bound ligand from the integrins. That it did not demonstrates that the reactions were not at equilibrium and therefore were not measuring the affinity of the integrins at that time. In preliminary experiments with Drosophila cells, I have found that washing the cells after binding of a monovalent ligand to PS2 integrins (without adding secondary antibodies) resulted in dissociation of the ligand (data not shown). Therefore, the monovalent ligand must be fixed to the integrins prior to washing.In the case of activated platelets, additional complications suggest that previous binding assays were not a reliable measure of the affinity of integrins prior to ligand binding. On the surface of activated platelets, the binding of ligands to αIIbβ3 is a multiphasic, energy-dependent process where ligand binding becomes irreversible over 15–30 min (36Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Fox J.E. Shattil S.J. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Richardson M. Packham M.A. Sanan D.A. J. Biol.

Med. 1999; 134: 398-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Time-dependent irreversibility has also been seen in CHO cell experiments measuring αIIbβ3 binding to fibrinogen or PAC-1 (18Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As the commonly used assays involve binding times of 15–30 min at room temperature followed by a 30-min incubation with secondary antibodies on ice, time-dependent changes make it difficult to determine what the affinity of the integrin is prior to ligand binding at a time when talin is proposed to increase integrin affinity. I suggest that a binding time of 10 min followed directly by fixation gives a more accurate measure of the effects of talin on early integrin-ligand interactions.The prediction of low affinity interactions between PAC-1 and αIIbβ3 integrins that have not been activated (presumably of low affinity and not clustered) is seen in the monovalent fixation assay because the bound ligand is fixed to the integrins prior to washing (Fig. 1). In the common monovalent plus multivalent secondary or multivalent IgM assays, almost no binding is detected. This is exactly what would be expected for assays that involve a wash that removes unbound ligand in the absence of integrin clustering, as in CHO cells expressing only αIIbβ3 integrins or non-activated platelets. Even dimerizing the low affinity integrins resulted in their binding to the PAC-1 IgM and fibrinogen (39Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This increase in binding was seen even though the integrins did not show an increased exposure to multiple conformation reporting antibodies, demonstrating that low affinity binding to soluble ligands does occur. This assay did not find binding to PAC-1 Fab under dimerizing conditions, suggesting that integrin affinity had not been increased. I would suggest that the PAC-1 Fab-secondary assay used in this study gave different results than PAC-1 IgM due to the sensitivity of clusters of only two integrins, linked by a disulfide bond, to the nature of the multivalent ligand formed by the PAC-1 Fab and secondary antibodies.Clustering of integrins in cultured cells and platelets when binding to PAC-1 IgM and other multivalent ligands has been repeatedly observed. In addition to my observations of PAC-1 IgM binding to CHO cells, integrin αIIbβ3 redistribution into macroclusters as a result of agonist-induced activation of talin has been demonstrated in CHO cells that express high levels of talin and PKCα (15Han J. Lim C.J. Watanabe N. Soriani A. Ratnikov B. Calderwood D.A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Lafuente E.M. Boussiotis V.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1796-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Additionally, β-galactosidase complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays demonstrated that αIIbβ3 is clustered in CHO cells binding to either bivalent antibodies or bivalent fibrinogen (13Buensuceso C. de Virgilio M. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Finally, in platelets, there is extensive evidence, by both confocal and electron microscopy, for the clustering of αIIbβ3 bound to PAC-1 IgM, fibrinogen, and peptides in thrombin- and ADP-activated human platelets (37Fox J.E.

Thus, in suggesting that the binding assays that rely on multivalent ligands introduce a clustering component, I am proposing something that is perhaps underappreciated but not unobserved.Re-evaluation of Differences between the Effects of Talin on αIIbβ3 and Drosophila IntegrinsMy results explain the apparent differences observed between talin effects on Drosophila PS2 and human αIIbβ3 integrins. The binding assays done on the Drosophila integrins were performed with the monovalent fixation protocol, whereas the experiments probing αIIbβ3 binding were done with the monovalent plus multivalent secondary protocol (11Helsten T.L. Bunch T.A. Kato H. Yamanouchi J. Choi S.H. Jannuzi A.L. Féral C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Brower D.L. Shattil S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3589-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). My data show that human αIIbβ3 gives the same result as was reported for Drosophila PS2 integrins when the experiments are conducted in the same manner. Talin head expression does not result in increased PAC-1 Fab binding in the monovalent fixation assay (Fig. 2).Models for Integrin Activation by TalinThe data presented here call into question simple models proposing that the mechanism of action of talin is to directly increase integrin affinity for ligands. My data are consistent with a model where the direct role of talin is one of regulating the clustering of αIIbβ3 integrins (Fig. 7A). Clustering may also be accompanied by changes in integrin conformation, but my data would suggest that the integrin is still in a low affinity state. Clustering increases the integrin αIIbβ3 avidity for multivalent ligands such as the widely used PAC-1 (either IgM or Fab with secondary antibodies) or fibrinogen. Once these ligands bind to the clustered low affinity integrins, they are predicted to stabilize the high affinity state of the integrins. As the ligand is retained in the vicinity of the clustered integrins, due to the talin-induced clustering, it binds to many of the integrins in the cluster and stabilizes the high affinity state that triggers sustained inside-out signaling. Once the integrins are clustered and converted to high affinity states, the multivalent ligand is essentially irreversibly bound. In this model, it is the ligand binding that directly induces the high affinity state of the αIIbβ3 integrin. Talin facilitates this indirectly by increasing the clustering of the integrins prior to ligand binding. Talin does not convert the conformation of the integrin heterodimers to a high affinity state prior to ligand binding. The model would predict that in the absence of integrin clustering, individual integrins do interact with ligands, such as PAC-1 IgM, and become activated to a high affinity state (Fig. 7B). However, dissociation of the ligand can and does occur because the integrins and ligand are in true equilibrium, and the integrin reverts to a low affinity state. The level of inside-out signaling resulting from these transient interactions is expected to be low and not result in dramatic cellular responses. A slightly more complicated model takes into consideration the observation that ligand binding to αIIbβ3 integrins has been shown to promote their clustering (13Buensuceso C. de Virgilio M.

It may be that it is ligand binding to the low affinity integrin that triggers clustering in CHO cells and platelets. Talin, in this model, would be required for executing the clustering that again would result in large increases in multivalent, but not monovalent, ligand binding.In addition to being different in valency, PAC-1 IgM (or PAC-1 Fab clustered with secondary antibodies) and PAC-1 Fab are different in size, and this could contribute to differences in binding to different integrin conformations. Although some models propose ligand binding to integrins in an extended conformation, results consistent with regulated binding to integrin αVβ3 in the bent conformation, without conversion to the extended form, have also been observed (42Xiong J.P. Mahalingham B. Alonso J.L. Borrelli L.A. Rui X. Anand S. Hyman B.T. Rysiok T. Müller-Pompalla D. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ligand binding head domain of αIIbβ3 in the bent conformation might be accessible to the smaller Fab probe but not to the larger IgM or (or PAC-1 Fab clustered with secondary antibodies). If this is the case, the monovalent fixation assay specifically probes the affinity state of the integrin head domain in either the bent or the extended conformation. IgM and other large multivalent ligands are sensitive to three factors: the affinity state of the head domain, the bent state of the integrin, and clustering.My work does not address the mechanisms of how ligand binding stabilizes or induces the high affinity state of integrins. One model, with support from structural data, of how this may occur proposes that binding of ligand to the MIDAS domain of β3 results in rearrangements in MIDAS contacts that are transmitted through changes in interactions between helixes α1 and α7 in the β integrin I-domain. Helix α7 connects directly to the hybrid domain, and ligand binding facilitates an outward of the hybrid domain from the I-domain leading to separation of the stalks and cytoplasmic tails of the α and β subunits. Separation of the α and β cytoplasmic domains then leads to cytoplasmic signaling and clustering (31Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar).Although the use of monovalent ligands is important experimentally, it is likely that most extracellular or cell surface integrin ligands in the organism are multivalent. Therefore, regulation of the clustering of low affinity integrins followed by the subsequent multivalent ligand-induced activation of integrin affinity is a parsimonious strategy to convert integrins on the cell surface to a clustered high affinity state. IntroductionIntegrins are adhesive heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that bind to extracellular matrix ligands or to cell surface proteins on adjacent cells. The cytoplasmic tails of the integrins are linked directly, or via adaptors, to numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins and transmit signals from the outside of the cell to the inside. The adhesive properties of integrins are dynamically regulated as these receptors shift between different conformations upon binding to extracellular ligands or cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, integrins are present in high or low affinity states on the surface of cells depending on the cellular environment. Regulation of integrin activation is critical in controlling cell adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix assembly. This regulation is therefore important in normal development, hemostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, tumor cell metastasis, and immune responses (1Hynes R.O.

(band four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domain that has the ability to bind to β3 integrin cytoplasmic tails, and this results in the activation of αIIbβ3 integrins. The ability of talin to interact with integrins is itself regulated as the FERM domain is autoinhibited by binding to its C-terminal tail in an intra- or intermolecular manner (2Ginsberg M.H.

Experimentally, the autoinhibition can be removed by expressing the talin head (or FERM) domain in the absence of the inhibitory tail. Overexpression of the talin head or FERM domain activates the β3 and β1 integrins, and inhibition of talin expression reduces integrin activity in mammalian cell culture (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R.

This lead to speculation of a fundamental difference between Drosophila talin-PS2 integrin interactions and those observed for talin-αIIbβ3 in vertebrates (11Helsten T.L. Bunch T.A. Kato H. Yamanouchi J. Choi S.H. Jannuzi A.L. Féral C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Brower D.L. Shattil S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3589-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the methodologies used to measure integrin affinity for ligand in these two studies were fundamentally different. In this report, I find that when identical binding assays are conducted for αIIbβ3 integrins, as were used for the Drosophila PS2 integrins, talin has no effect on the affinity of αIIbβ3 for monovalent ligand. Thus, I find no difference between the Drosophila talin-PS2 integrin interactions and those seen for vertebrate talin-αIIbβ3 integrin.I do find that the talin FERM domain increases the ability of αIIbβ3 to bind to multivalent ligands, and this appears to be the source of discrepancy between the binding assays. Numerous studies have shown that a clustering mechanism activates β3 integrins. In platelets, avidity is an important component of αIIbβ3 binding to ligand as PAC-1 IgM showed 60-fold greater binding capacity as compared with the PAC-1 Fab even in the presence of secondary antibodies (12Abrams C. Deng Y.J. Steiner B. O'Toole T. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18781-18788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding, talin head expression, and agonist-induced activation in CHO cells all result in integrin clustering (13Buensuceso C. de Virgilio M. Shattil S.J. J. Biol.

If integrin activation or integrin activity is a general term that encompasses clustering and/or affinity changes, then clearly talin activates αIIbβ3 integrins in CHO cells. However, integrin activation is commonly interpreted to mean an increase in the affinity of an individual integrin heterodimer for ligand prior to encountering ligand (3Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It is this latter definition of integrin regulation by talin that is found in at least one cell biology textbook that states “Thus when talin binds to the β chain it undoes the intracellular α-β linkage, allowing the two legs of the integrin molecule to spring apart. This drives the extracellular portion of the integrin into its extended, active conformation.” (16Alberts B. Johnson A. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Walter P. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 5th Ed. Garland Science, New York, NY2007: 1172Google Scholar) My results in CHO cells and additional experiments in human platelets contradict this view of integrin affinity regulation by talin and point instead to the role of talin in integrin clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2015754592,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit drug which is neurotoxic to the mammalian brain. Numerous studies have revealed significant decreases in dopamine and serotonin levels in the brains of animals exposed to moderate-to-large METH doses given within short intervals of time. In contrast, repeated injections of small nontoxic doses of the drug followed by a challenge with toxic METH doses afford significant protection against monoamine depletion. The present study was undertaken to test the possibility that repeated injections of the drug might be accompanied by transcriptional changes involved in rendering the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system refractory to METH toxicity. Our results confirm that METH preconditioning can provide significant protection against METH-induced striatal dopamine depletion. In addition, the presence and absence of METH preconditioning were associated with substantial differences in the identity of the genes whose expression was affected by a toxic METH challenge. Quantitative PCR confirmed METH-induced changes in genes of interest and identified additional genes that were differentially impacted by the toxic METH challenge in the presence of METH preconditioning. These genes include small heat shock 27 kD 27 protein 2 (HspB2), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), c-fos, and some encoding antioxidant proteins including CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-1, and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox-1). These observations are consistent, in part, with the transcriptional alterations reported in models of lethal ischemic injuries which are preceded by ischemic or pharmacological preconditioning. Our findings suggest that multiple molecular pathways might work in tandem to protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway against the deleterious effects of the toxic psychostimulant. Further analysis of the molecular and cellular pathways regulated by these genes should help to provide some insight into the neuroadaptive potentials of the brain when repeatedly exposed to drugs of abuse."
https://openalex.org/W1994916606,"Fig trees are pollinated by fig wasps, which also oviposit in female flowers. The wasp larvae gall and eat developing seeds. Although fig trees benefit from allowing wasps to oviposit, because the wasp offspring disperse pollen, figs must prevent wasps from ovipositing in all flowers, or seed production would cease, and the mutualism would go extinct. In Ficus racemosa, we find that syconia ('figs') that have few foundresses (ovipositing wasps) are underexploited in the summer (few seeds, few galls, many empty ovules) and are overexploited in the winter (few seeds, many galls, few empty ovules). Conversely, syconia with many foundresses produce intermediate numbers of galls and seeds, regardless of season. We use experiments to explain these patterns, and thus, to explain how this mutualism is maintained. In the hot summer, wasps suffer short lifespans and therefore fail to oviposit in many flowers. In contrast, cooler temperatures in the winter permit longer wasp lifespans, which in turn allows most flowers to be exploited by the wasps. However, even in winter, only in syconia that happen to have few foundresses are most flowers turned into galls. In syconia with higher numbers of foundresses, interference competition reduces foundress lifespans, which reduces the proportion of flowers that are galled. We further show that syconia encourage the entry of multiple foundresses by delaying ostiole closure. Taken together, these factors allow fig trees to reduce galling in the wasp-benign winter and boost galling (and pollination) in the wasp-stressing summer. Interference competition has been shown to reduce virulence in pathogenic bacteria. Our results show that interference also maintains cooperation in a classic, cooperative symbiosis, thus linking theories of virulence and mutualism. More generally, our results reveal how frequency-dependent population regulation can occur in the fig-wasp mutualism, and how a host species can 'set the rules of the game' to ensure mutualistic behavior in its symbionts."

Here, an induction of COX-2 expression in HaCaT human keratinocytes was observed only upon exposure of cells to UVB (280-320 nm) but not to UVA radiation (320-400 nm), as demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting. Prostaglandin E(2) levels were elevated in cell culture supernatants of HaCaT cells exposed to UVB. COX-2 mRNA stability was dramatically increased by UVB irradiation. Both the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA and the enhancement of COX-2 steady-state mRNA and protein levels caused by UVB were prevented both by inhibition and small interfering RNA-induced depletion of p38(MAPK), a kinase strongly activated upon exposure to UVB, suggesting p38(MAPK)-dependent mRNA stabilization as a mechanism of UVB-induced COX-2 expression. A dramatic decrease in COX-2 expression induced by UVB was elicited by small interfering RNA-based depletion of a stress-responsive mRNA stabilizing protein regulated by p38(MAPK), i.e. HuR; UVB-induced elevation of COX-2 mRNA and protein levels coincided with an accumulation of HuR in the cytoplasm and was attenuated in cells depleted of HuR. Moreover, UVB-induced generation of prostaglandin E(2) by HaCaT cells was blunted by HuR depletion, suggesting that stress kinases (such as p38(MAPK)) as well as HuR are excellent targets for approaches aiming at interfering with induction of COX-2 expression by UVB."
https://openalex.org/W2015063112,"Human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype, frequently reported since 2003, result in high morbidity and mortality. It is feared that these viruses become pandemic, therefore the development of safe and effective vaccines is desirable. MVA-based H5N1 vaccines already proved to be effective when two immunizations with high doses were used. Dose-sparing strategies would increase the number of people that can be vaccinated when the amount of vaccine preparations that can be produced is limited. Furthermore, protective immunity is induced ideally after a single immunization. Therefore the minimal requirements for induction of protective immunity with a MVA-based H5N1 vaccine were assessed in mice. To this end, mice were vaccinated once or twice with descending doses of a recombinant MVA expressing the HA gene of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1194/04. The protective efficacy was determined after challenge infection with the homologous clade 1 virus and a heterologous virus derived from clade 2.1, A/Indonesia/5/05 by assessing weight loss, virus replication and histopathological changes. It was concluded that MVA-based vaccines allowed significant dose-sparing and afford cross-clade protection, also after a single immunization, which are favorable properties for an H5N1 vaccine candidate."

Here, it is reported that increased RNMT expression enhances cellular mRNA cap methyltransferase activity, promotes mammary epithelial cell transformation and cooperates with H-RasV12 or c-Myc to promote fibroblast cell transformation. Cyclin D1 is a prominent oncogene in epithelial tumours. A significant fraction of Cyclin D1 mRNA was found to be unmethylated on the mRNA cap and thus dormant in mammary epithelial cells. Cyclin D1 expression was increased by enhanced mRNA cap methylation. In summary, this report shows that mRNA cap methylation is rate-limiting for expression of an oncogene and cell transformation."

However, regulatory mechanism of the cell-cycle dependent distribution of dynein has not fully been understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report live-cell imaging of cytoplasmic dynein in HeLa cells, by expressing multifunctional green fluorescent protein (mfGFP)-tagged 74-kDa intermediate chain (IC74). IC74-mfGFP was successfully incorporated into functional dynein complex. In interphase, dynein moved bi-directionally along with MTs, which might carry cargos such as transport vesicles. A substantial fraction of dynein moved toward cell periphery together with EB1, a member of MT plus end-tracking proteins (+TIPs), suggesting +TIPs-mediated transport of dynein. In late-interphase and prophase, dynein was localized at the centrosomes and the radial MT array. In prometaphase and metaphase, dynein was localized at spindle MTs where it frequently moved from spindle poles toward chromosomes or cell cortex. +TIPs may be involved in the transport of spindle dyneins. Possible kinetochore and cortical dyneins were also observed. Conclusions and Significance These findings suggest that cytoplasmic dynein is transported to the site of action in preparation for the following cellular events, primarily by the MT-based transport. The MT-based transport may have greater advantage than simple diffusion of soluble dynein in rapid and efficient transport of the limited concentration of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2098127208,"Background Dectin-1 is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) expressed by myeloid cells that specifically recognizes β-1,3 glucan, a polysaccharide and major component of the fungal cell wall. Upon activation, dectin-1 signaling converges, similar to NOD2, on the adaptor molecule CARD9 which is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An early stop codon polymorphism (c.714T>G) in DECTIN-1 results in a loss-of-function (p.Y238X) and impaired cytokine responses, including TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17 upon in vitro stimulation with Candida albicans or β-glucan. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the DECTIN-1 c.714T>G (p.Y238X) polymorphism is associated with lower disease susceptibility or severity in IBD and to investigate the level of dectin-1 expression in inflamed and non-inflamed colon tissue of IBD patients. Methodology Paraffin embedded tissue samples from non-inflamed and inflamed colon of IBD patients and from diverticulitis patients were immunohistochemically stained for dectin-1 and related to CD68 macrophage staining. Genomic DNA of IBD patients (778 patients with Crohn's disease and 759 patients with ulcerative colitis) and healthy controls (n = 772) was genotyped for the c.714T>G polymorphism and genotype-phenotype interactions were investigated. Principal Findings Increased expression of dectin-1 was observed in actively inflamed colon tissue, as compared to non-inflamed tissue of the same patients. Also an increase in dectin-1 expression was apparent in diverticulitis tissue. No statistically significant difference in DECTIN-1 c.714T>G allele frequencies was observed between IBD patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, no differences in clinical characteristics could be observed related to DECTIN-1 genotype, neither alone, nor stratified for NOD2 genotype. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that dectin-1 expression is elevated on macrophages, neutrophils, and other immune cells involved in the inflammatory reaction in IBD. The DECTIN-1 c.714T>G polymorphism however, is not a major susceptibility factor for developing IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2158019963,"Elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 promote metastasis and in carcinoma cells are associated with reduced survival of cancer patients. S100A4 interacts with target proteins that affect a number of activities associated with metastatic cells. However, it is not known how many of these interactions are required for S100A4-promoted metastasis, thus hampering the design of specific inhibitors of S100A4-induced metastasis. Intracellular S100A4 exists as a homodimer through previously identified, well conserved, predominantly hydrophobic key contacts between the subunits. Here it is shown that mutating just one key residue, phenylalanine 72, to alanine is sufficient to reduce the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to 50% that of the wild type protein, and just 2 or 3 specific mutations reduces the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to less than 20% that of the wild type protein. These mutations inhibit the self-association of S100A4 in vivo and reduce markedly the affinity of S100A4 for at least two of its protein targets, a recombinant fragment of non-muscle myosin heavy chain isoform A, and p53. Inhibition of the self-association of S100 proteins might be a novel means of inhibiting their metastasis-promoting activities."
https://openalex.org/W2046608205,"The introduction and maintenance of plasmids in cells is often associated with a reduction of growth rate. The reason for this growth reduction is unclear in many cases.We observed a surprisingly large reduction in growth rate of about 50% of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 during methylotrophic growth in the presence of a plasmid, pCM80 expressing the tetA gene, relative to the wild-type. A less pronounced growth delay during growth under non-methylotrophic growth conditions was observed; this suggested an inhibition of one-carbon metabolism rather than a general growth inhibition or metabolic burden. Metabolome analyses revealed an increase in pool sizes of ethylmalonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA of more than 6- and 35-fold, respectively, relative to wild type, suggesting a strongly reduced conversion of these central intermediates, which are essential for glyoxylate regeneration in this model methylotroph. Similar results were found for M. extorquens AM1 pCM160 which confers kanamycin resistance. These intermediates of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway have in common their conversion by coenzyme B(12)-dependent mutases, which have cobalt as a central ligand. The one-carbon metabolism-related growth delay was restored by providing higher cobalt concentrations, by heterologous expression of isocitrate lyase as an alternative path for glyoxylate regeneration, or by identification and overproduction of proteins involved in cobalt import.This study demonstrates that the introduction of the plasmids leads to an apparent inhibition of the cobalt-dependent enzymes of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Possible explanations are presented and point to a limited cobalt concentration in the cell as a consequence of the antibiotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1996789884,"There has been accumulating evidence for the involvement of retroviral integrase (IN) in the reverse transcription of viral RNA. We previously identified a host factor, survival motor neuron-interacting protein 1 (SIP1/Gemin2) that binds to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN and supports HIV-1 infection apparently at reverse transcription step. Here, we demonstrated that HIV-1 IN together with SIP1 augments reverse transcriptase (RT) activity by enhancing the assembly of RT on viral RNA in vitro. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the binding motifs within IN that inhibited the IN-SIP1 interaction abrogated reverse transcription in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of SIP1 reduced intracellular stability and multimer formation of IN through proteasome-mediated degradation machinery. Taken together, SIP1 appears to stabilize functional multimer forms of IN, thereby promoting the assembly of IN and RT on viral RNA to allow efficient reverse transcription, which is a prerequisite for efficient HIV-1 infection."

https://openalex.org/W2112310046,"V(D)J recombination is essential for the maturation of lymphocytes. Because of the involvement of cutting and joining DNA double strands, this recombination activity is strictly contained within the noncycling phases of the cell cycle. Such containment is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is known to have a central role in sensing general DNA damage and mediating cell-cycle checkpoint. In this study, we investigated the role of ATM and its downstream targets in the cell-cycle control of V(D)J recombination in vivo. Our results revealed the persistence of double-strand breaks (DSBs) throughout the cell cycle in ATM(-/-) and p53(-/-) thymocytes, but the cell-cycle regulation of a V(D)J recombinase, Rag-2, was normal. The histone variant H2AX, which is phosphorylated during normal V(D)J recombination, was dispensable for containing DSBs. H2AX was still phosphorylated at V(D)J loci in the absence of ATM. Therefore, V(D)J recombination, a physiological DNA rearrangement process, activates the ATM/p53 pathway to contain DNA breaks within the noncycling cells and surprisingly this pathway is not important for containing Rag-2 activity. This study shows the dynamic multiple functions of ATM in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis in developing lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2032511325,"Here, we report the overexpression, purification, and characterization of the transcriptional activator fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator from the pathogenic bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (NmFNR). Like its homologue from Escherichia coli (EcFNR), NmFNR binds a 4Fe-4S cluster, which breaks down in the presence of oxygen to a 2Fe-2S cluster and subsequently to apo-FNR. The kinetics of NmFNR cluster disassembly in the presence of oxygen are 2-3x slower than those previously reported for wild-type EcFNR, but similar to constitutively active EcFNR* mutants, consistent with earlier work in which we reported that the activity of FNR-dependent promoters in N. meningitidis is only weakly inhibited by the presence of oxygen (Rock, J. D., Thomson, M. J., Read, R. C., and Moir, J. W. (2007) J. Bacteriol. 189, 1138-1144). NmFNR binds to DNA containing a consensus FNR box sequence, and this binding stabilizes the iron-sulfur cluster in the presence of oxygen. Partial degradation of the 4Fe-4S cluster to a 3Fe-4S occurs, and this form remains bound to the DNA. The 3Fe-4S cluster is converted spontaneously back to a 4Fe-4S cluster under subsequent anaerobic reducing conditions in the presence of ferrous iron. The finding that binding to DNA stabilizes FNR in the presence of oxygen such that it has a half-life of approximately 30 min on the DNA has implications for our appreciation of how oxygen switches off FNR activatable genes in vivo."

In comparison with tobacco-related lung carcinogenesis, lung cancer in nonsmokers may involve important and etiologically distinct causal pathways. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study on spontaneous lung tumor incidence in inbred mice and identified a major susceptibility locus on mouse chromosome 2 (rs27328255, P=6.68 x 10(-7)). We then evaluated the correlations of polymorphisms with the transcription of positional candidate genes in normal lungs. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs27328255 was consistently and strongly associated (P=7.42 x 10(-9)) in cis with transcript levels of Xrn2. We further showed that Xrn2 promotes proliferation and inhibits squamous differentiation in human lung epithelial cells and polymorphisms in human homolog XRN2 are associated with human lung cancer (rs2025811, P=1.90 x 10(-3), OR=1.20). We conclude that genetic variants regulating Xrn2 expression in cis are determinants of spontaneous lung tumor susceptibility in mice and have genetic equivalents in lung cancer susceptibility in human beings. Identifying Xrn2 as a major candidate for spontaneous lung cancer has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer as well as delineation of the mechanisms underlying the genesis of lung cancer in nonsmokers."

We show that these organelles are disrupted after sublethal irradiation and both FLASH and NPAT are degraded, which in turn results in cell-cycle arrest at the S/G2 transition. The effect on the cell cycle is due to reduced transcription of histone genes and restoring normal histone protein levels by stabilizing histone mRNA allows cells to progress through the cell cycle. This provides a novel mechanism of S-phase arrest in response to DNA damage that potentially allows DNA repair before cells continue into mitosis, and thus prevents transmission of genomic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2038634077,"We report the solution NMR structures of the N-domain of the Menkes protein (ATP7A) in the ATP-free and ATP-bound forms. The structures consist of a twisted antiparallel six-stranded beta-sheet flanked by two pairs of alpha-helices. A protein loop of 50 amino acids located between beta 3 and beta 4 is disordered and mobile on the subnanosecond time scale. ATP binds with an affinity constant of (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10(4) m(-1) and exchanges with a rate of the order of 1 x 10(3) s(-1). The ATP-binding cavity is considerably affected by the presence of the ligand, resulting in a more compact conformation in the ATP-bound than in the ATP-free form. This structural variation is due to the movement of the alpha1-alpha2 and beta2-beta 3 loops, both of which are highly conserved in copper(I)-transporting P(IB)-type ATPases. The present structure reveals a characteristic binding mode of ATP within the protein scaffold of the copper(I)-transporting P(IB)-type ATPases with respect to the other P-type ATPases. In particular, the binding cavity contains mainly hydrophobic aliphatic residues, which are involved in van der Waal's interactions with the adenine ring of ATP, and a Glu side chain, which forms a crucial hydrogen bond to the amino group of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2003238767,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing demyelination and nerve loss in the central nervous system. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model of MS that is widely used to investigate complex pathogenic mechanisms. Transcriptional control through isoform selection and mRNA levels determines pathway activation and ultimately susceptibility to disease.We have studied the role of alternative splicing and differential expression in lymph node cells from EAE-susceptible Dark Agouti (DA) and EAE-resistant Piebald Virol Glaxo.AV1 (PVG) inbred rat strains using Affymetrix Gene Chip Rat Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. Comparing the two strains, we identified 11 differentially spliced and 206 differentially expressed genes at day 7 post-immunization, as well as 9 differentially spliced and 144 differentially expressed genes upon autoantigen re-stimulation. Functional clustering and pathway analysis implicate genes for glycosylation, lymphocyte activation, potassium channel activity and cellular differentiation in EAE susceptibility.Our results demonstrate that alternative splicing occurs during complex disease and may govern EAE susceptibility. Additionally, transcriptome analysis not only identified previously defined EAE pathways regulating the immune system, but also novel mechanisms. Furthermore, several identified genes overlap known quantitative trait loci, providing novel causative candidate targets governing EAE."

Tat is secreted by HIV-1-infected cells where it acts on both uninfected bystander cells and infected cells. In this study, we show that clade B Tat, but not clade C Tat, increases CXCR4 surface expression on resting CD4+ T cells through a CCR2b-dependent mechanism that does not involve de novo protein synthesis. The expression of plectin, a cytolinker protein that plays an important role as a scaffolding platform for proteins involved in cellular signaling including CXCR4 signaling and trafficking, was found to be significantly increased following B Tat but not C Tat treatment. Knockdown of plectin using RNA interference showed that plectin is essential for the B Tat-induced translocation of CXCR4 to the surface of resting CD4+ T cells. The increased surface CXCR4 expression following B Tat treatment led to increased function of CXCR4 including increased chemoattraction toward CXCR4-using-gp120. Moreover, increased CXCR4 surface expression rendered resting CD4+ T cells more permissive to X4 but not R5 HIV-1 infection. However, neither B Tat nor C Tat was able to up-regulate surface expression of CXCR4 on activated CD4+ T cells, and both proteins inhibited the infection of activated CD4+ T cells with X4 but not R5 HIV-1. Thus, B Tat, but not C Tat, has the capacity to render resting, but not activated, CD4+ T cells more susceptible to X4 HIV-1 infection.

Within group M, nine clades are recognized, designated by the letters A–D, F–H, J, and K. In addition, circulating recombinant forms (CRF) have also been identified (1Hemelaar J. Gouws E. Ghys P.D.

HIV-1 isolates are distinguishable by the chemokine receptor they use for cell entry (21Berger E.A. AIDS. 1997; 11: S3-S16PubMed Google Scholar). Chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using isolates are termed X4, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5)-using isolates are termed R5, and isolates that use both CXCR4 and CCR5 are termed R5X4. R5 viruses predominate early in HIV-1 infection for all clades, whereas X4 or R5X4 viruses emerge in about 40% of late clade B HIV-1 infection (22Philpott S.M. Curr. HIV Res. 2003; 1: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which this emergence occurs is poorly understood, but it coincides with both significantly lower levels of CD4+ T cells and a lower thymic production of new T cells than in individuals with R5 variants irrespective of viral load (23Koot M. van't Wout A.B. Kootstra N.A. de Goede R.E. Tersmette M. Schuitemaker H. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Blaak H. van't Wout A.B. Brouwer M. Hooibrink B. Hovenkamp E.

Muñoz-Fernández M.A. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1959-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that the R5 to X4 shift is also a cause of the CD4+ T cell decline, because X4 variants target the naïve cell pool (26Davenport M.P. Zaunders J.J. Hazenberg M.D. Schuitemaker H. van Rij R.P. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 275-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In clade C HIV-1 infection, R5 variants dominate all stages of disease, including late stage AIDS, with only limited X4 or R5X4 variants described or characterized (27Björndal A. Deng H. Jansson M.

Virology. 2006; 347: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors limiting the development of X4 clade C viruses exist, although it is unclear whether they are host or virological constraints. CXCR4 is a seven-transmembrane receptor coupled to a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi protein, which modulates the levels of intracellular cAMP by inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase. It also links to phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is intrinsically linked to cell motility by promoting reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (30Sotsios Y. Ward S.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CXCR4 also activates Src kinase, which in conjunction with other protein tyrosine kinases of the Syk, Tec, and focal adhesion kinase families promotes the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Ras-related GTPases, which change the transcriptional profile of the cell and promote actin remodeling (30Sotsios Y. Ward S.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The natural ligand for CXCR4 is CXCL12, which is a chemoattractant for CD4+ T cells. HIV-1 clade B Tat (B Tat) has been shown to up-regulate CXCR4 on resting CD4+ T cells (31Huang L. Bosch I. Hofmann W. Sodroski J. Pardee A.B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8952-8960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Secchiero P. Zella D. Capitani S. Gallo R.C. Zauli G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2427-2431PubMed Google Scholar). Tat is an 86–101-residue regulatory protein (9–11 kDa) that is essential for productive and processive transcription from the HIV-1 LTR (33Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and is secreted from unruptured, HIV-1-infected cells where it has a variety of effects on both uninfected and infected cells (reviewed in Refs. 34Huigen M.C. Kamp W. Nottet H.S. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 34: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 35Campbell G.R. Loret E.P. Retrovirology. 2009; 6: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat are responsible for its trans-activational properties (33Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Aligning this region of Tat with several β-chemokines indicates positioning and similarity of key residues critical for β-chemokine receptor binding and signal transduction (36Albini A. Benelli R. Giunciuglio D. Cai T. Mariani G. Ferrini S. Noonan D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15895-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), including a CC(F/Y) motif at positions 30–32. However, clade-specific variations occur, with more than 90% of HIV-1 clade C Tat proteins (C Tat) possessing a C31S mutation (12Ranga U. Shankarappa R. Siddappa N.B. Ramakrishna L. Nagendran R. Mahalingam M. Mahadevan A. Jayasuryan N. Satishchandra P. Shankar S.K. Prasad V.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2586-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and HIV-1 CRF_AE Tat proteins have an (F/Y)32W mutation (19Ranjbar S. Rajsbaum R. Goldfeld A.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4182-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the C31S variation found in C Tat results in its reduced ability to bind CCR2b and stimulate TNF and CCL2 production from monocytes (16Campbell G.R. Watkins J.D. Singh K.K. Loret E.P. Spector S.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that B Tat but not C Tat up-regulates the surface expression of CXCR4 on resting CD4+ T cells, rendering a larger population of resting CD4+ T cells more susceptible to X4 HIV-1 infection. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the heparinized blood of healthy HIV-1 seronegative donors by density centrifugation over Ficoll-PaqueTM Premium (GE Healthcare). CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection using the CD4+ T cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The final cultures of CD4+ T cells were always >95% pure, as determined by two-color flow cytometry analysis using monoclonal fluorescently tagged antibodies specific for CD4 and CD3 (BD Pharmingen). After purification, the cells were resuspended in AIM-V medium with human serum albumin (AIM-V; Invitrogen) at 1 × 106 CD4+ T cells/ml for 24 h to allow for maximal unstimulated surface expression of CXCR4 before use. Full-length synthetic Tat proteins were synthesized in the solid phase using the method of Barany and Merrifield (37Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J.

Amino acid analysis was performed on a model 6300 Beckman analyzer, and mass spectrometry was carried out using an Ettan matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The trans-activation activities of the synthetic Tat proteins were analyzed by monitoring the production of β-galactosidase after activation of lacZ expression in HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-galactosidase cells as previously described (16Campbell G.R.

The viruses were propagated on phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from Phaseolus vulgaris (Sigma) and interleukin (IL)-2 (Roche Applied Science)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen), and purified using Vivaspin 20 columns with a 300,000 molecular weight cut-off (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Edgewood, NY). The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was determined by serial dilution of the virus and calculated using the Spearman-Kärber method as described elsewhere (41Japour A.J. Mayers D.L.

The HIV-1 p24 antigen concentration in culture supernatants was determined using the Alliance HIV-1 p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2b (CCR2b) antagonist RS102895, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2 inhibitor U0126, and pertussis toxin (PTX) from Bordetella pertussis were all purchased from Sigma. The cytotoxic effect of the different inhibitors and antagonists was tested by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and none was found to be cytotoxic (viability was >99%). Anti-CD3 antibody (clone HIT3a) was purchased from (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). All of the flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). All of the cytogram analysis was performed using CellQuest Pro® software (BD Biosciences). Surface protein expression of CXCR4, CCR5, CD25, CD69, human leukocyte antigen-DR, and CD45RO on CD4+ T cells was investigated by flow cytometry using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies CD4PerCp, CD3FITC, CXCR4PE, CD45ROAPC, CCR5APC, CD14APC, CD14FITC, CD25APC, CD69APC, and human leukocyte antigen-DRPE (where FITC is fluorescein isothiocyanate, PE is phycoerythrin, APC is allophycocyanin, and PerCp is peridin-chlorophyll protein) obtained from BD Pharmingen as described previously (42Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30745-30753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as [mean fluorescence intensity in treated cells/mean fluorescence intensity in untreated cells] × 100. Total CXCR4 content was evaluated by surface staining for CXCR4, then permeabilizing with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and restaining for CXCR4. Nonspecific fluorescence was assessed using isotype- and fluorophore-matched controls. Receptor internalization was measured by the retention of anti-CXCR4 antibody binding following elimination of cell surface bound antibody via acid wash as described previously (42Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30745-30753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Receptor internalization was quantified as the percentage of total anti-CXCR4 fluorescence intensity (pH 7 wash) retained following acid wash (pH 4). For the quantification of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, Tat-conditioned cells or unconditioned controls were harvested and stimulated with gp120 for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of glacial Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized in 90% glacial methanol overnight, washed twice in DPBS supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, and stained with the 20A Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated monoclonal anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) obtained from BD Pharmingen. The specificity for phosphorylated Erk1/2 was assessed using 40 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which induced a significant increase in mean fluorescence over unstimulated control cells. Filamentous actin (F-actin) polymerization following the addition of gp120 was assessed mainly as previously described (42Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, CD4+ T cells (107/ml) were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm HEPES (both Invitrogen) and gp120MN (Immunodiagnostics, Woburn, MA) or gp120SF162 (obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Every 15 s, 100 μl of cell suspension was added to 400 μl of DPBS supplemented with 4.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 100 nm FITC-labeled phalloidin, and 125 μg/ml l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (both Sigma). The results are expressed as [median fluorescence intensity after the addition of ligand/median fluorescence intensity before the addition of ligand] × 100. CXCR4 mRNA and HIV-1 LTR DNA quantification were measured by real time PCR using a using the LightCycler System and the FastStart RNA Master SYBR Green I kit and the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (all from Roche Applied Science), respectively, as previously described (42Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30745-30753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of the results are expressed as the ratio between the copy number of the target gene and the copy number of RNA polymerase II and normalized so that CXCR4 mRNA expression and HIV-1 LTR in unconditioned cells equals 1.00. A control duplex siRNA consisting of a scramble sequence that does not lead to the degradation of any cellular message and three plectin duplex siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA duplexes were transfected into primary resting CD4+ T cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in Opti-MEM I (both Invitrogen) with a final siRNA concentration of 40 nm. The cells were then used after 48 h, and the extent of knockdown was quantified by immunoblotting as described below. Plectin was quantified by electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting using anti-plectin C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or E398P (Abcam) as described previously (42Campbell G.R. Spector S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30745-30753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed for β-actin using a monoclonal antibody (clone AC-74; Sigma) The relative density of the plectin (target) band was compared with the β-actin (reference) band and analyzed using the freely available ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Total CXCR4 content and the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) were determined by electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting. Briefly, the cells were washed and lysed in CelLytic M in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (all from Sigma) and subjected to centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min) to remove debris. 40 μg/sample was then heated to 100 °C for 10 min in SDS sample buffer containing reducing agent and separated by 4–12% bis-Tris-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Fisher). The membranes were blocked overnight with DPBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (Sigma) and 5% (w/v) dried nonfat milk (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) and probed with an antibody against either CXCR4 (Abcam), phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), phosphorylated SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), or phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (from Cell Signaling Technology) followed by detection using the WesternBreeze chemiluminescence kit (Invitrogen). The membranes were subsequently stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin (Sigma) in the case of CXCR4 or with the corresponding antibody against total p38, Erk1/2, or SAPK/JNK (all from Cell Signaling Technology) to confirm equal loading. The migration of CD4+ T cells in response to gp120 was evaluated using 24-well Transwell migration chambers with 5-μm-pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (Corning) as previously described (44Patrussi L. Ulivieri C. Lucherini O.M. Paccani S.R. Gamberucci A. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Baldari C.T. Blood. 2007; 110: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After 4 h of conditioning with Tat, CD4+ T cells were infected with X4 HIV-1IIIB or the R5 HIV-193In905 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 3 h and then washed three times with DPBS. The cells were then cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (all from Invitrogen). After 14 h, either the cells were harvested and total DNA was prepared with the QIAamp DNA mini kit in accordance with the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen), or the medium was supplemented with 20 units/ml IL-2 and cells were cultured for a further 96 h. The supernatants were then collected and assayed using the Alliance HIV-1 p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

https://openalex.org/W2033002567,"The barrier function of the skin protects the mammalian body against infection, dehydration, UV irradiation and temperature fluctuation. Barrier function is reduced with the skin's intrinsic aging process, however the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. We previously demonstrated that Claudin (Cldn)-containing tight junctions (TJs) are essential in the development of the epidermis and that transgenic mice overexpressing Cldn6 in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis undergo a perturbed terminal differentiation program characterized in part by reduced barrier function. To dissect further the mechanisms by which Cldn6 acts during epithelial differentiation, we overexpressed a Cldn6 cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant in the suprabasal compartment of the transgenic mouse epidermis. Although there were no gross phenotypic abnormalities at birth, subtle epidermal anomalies were present that disappeared by one month of age, indicative of a robust injury response. However, with aging, epidermal changes with eventual chronic dermatitis appeared with a concomitant barrier dysfunction manifested in increased trans-epidermal water loss. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed aberrant suprabasal Cldn localization with marked down-regulation of Cldn1. Both the proliferative and terminal differentiation compartments were perturbed as evidenced by mislocalization of multiple epidermal markers. These results suggest that the normally robust injury response mechanism of the epidermis is lost in the aging Involucrin-Cldn6-CDelta196 transgenic epidermis, and provide a model for evaluation of aging-related skin changes."
https://openalex.org/W2041407304,"Background Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that can arise sporadically, be genetically inherited or acquired through infection. The key event in these diseases is misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a pathogenic isoform that is rich in β-sheet structure. This conformational change may result in the formation of PrPSc, the prion isoform of PrP, which propagates itself by imprinting its aberrant conformation onto PrPC molecules. A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing protocols for purifying PrPSc for structural studies, and testing its biological properties. Most procedures rely on protease digestion, allowing efficient purification of PrP27-30, the protease-resistant core of PrPSc. However, protease treatment cannot be used to isolate abnormal forms of PrP lacking conventional protease resistance, such as those found in several genetic and atypical sporadic cases. Principal Findings We developed a method for purifying pathological PrP molecules based on sequential centrifugation and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody selective for aggregated PrP. With this procedure we purified full-length PrPSc and mutant PrP aggregates at electrophoretic homogeneity. PrPSc purified from prion-infected mice was able to seed misfolding of PrPC in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification reaction, and mutant PrP aggregates from transgenic mice were toxic to cultured neurons. Significance The immunopurification protocol described here isolates biologically active forms of aggregated PrP. These preparations may be useful for investigating the structural and chemico-physical properties of infectious and neurotoxic PrP aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1989458449,"Respiratory muscle contractile performance is impaired by diabetes, mechanisms of which included altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and changes in membrane electrophysiology. The present study examined to what extent these cellular perturbations involve changes in gene expression.Diaphragm muscle from streptozotocin-diabetic rats was analyzed with Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Diaphragm from diabetic rats had 105 genes with at least +/-2-fold significantly changed expression (55 increased, 50 decreased), and these were assigned to gene ontology groups based on over-representation analysis using DAVID software. There was increased expression of genes involved in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity (a component of lipid metabolism) (P = 0.037, n = 2 genes, fold change 4.2 to 27.5) and reduced expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism (P = 0.000061, n = 8 genes, fold change -2.0 to -8.5). Other gene ontology groups among upregulated genes were protein ubiquitination (P = 0.0053, n = 4, fold change 2.2 to 3.4), oxidoreductase activity (P = 0.024, n = 8, fold change 2.1 to 6.0), and morphogenesis (P = 0.012, n = 10, fold change 2.1 to 4.3). Other downregulated gene groups were extracellular region (including extracellular matrix and collagen) (P = 0.00032, n = 13, fold change -2.2 to -3.7) and organogenesis (P = 0.032, n = 7, fold change -2.1 to -3.7). Real-time PCR confirmed the directionality of changes in gene expression for 30 of 31 genes tested.These data indicate that in diaphragm muscle type 1 diabetes increases expression of genes involved in lipid energetics, oxidative stress and protein ubiquitination, decreases expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and has little effect on expression of ion channel genes. Reciprocal changes in expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism may change the availability of energetic substrates and thereby directly modulate fatigue resistance, an important issue for a muscle like the diaphragm which needs to contract without rest for the entire lifetime of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2044727664,"Expression of the VACM-1/cul5 gene in endothelial and in cancer cell lines in vitro inhibits cellular proliferation and decreases phosphorylation of MAPK. Structure-function analysis of the VACM-1 protein sequence identified consensus sites specific for phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC) and a Nedd8 protein modification site. Mutations at the PKA-specific site in VACM-1/Cul5 ((S730A)VACM-1) sequence resulted in increased cellular growth and the appearance of a Nedd8-modified VACM-1/Cul5. The aim of this study was to examine if PKA-dependent phosphorylation of VACM-1/Cul5 controls its neddylation status, phosphorylation by PKC, and ultimately growth. Our results indicate that in vitro transfection of rat adrenal medullary endothelial cells with anti-VACM-1-specific small interfering RNA oligonucleotides decreases endogenous VACM-1 protein concentration and increases cell growth. Western blot analysis of cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against a PKA-specific phosphorylation site and probed with anti-VACM-1-specific antibody showed that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of VACM-1 protein was decreased in cells transfected with (S730A)VACM-1 cDNA when compared with the cytomegalovirus-transfected cells. This change was associated with increased modification of VACM-1 protein by Nedd8. Induction of PKA activity with forskolin reduced modification of VACM-1 protein by Nedd8. Finally, rat adrenal medullary endothelial cells transfected with (S730A)VACM-1/cul5 cDNA and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 and 100 nm) to induce PKC activity grew significantly faster than the control cells. These results suggest that the antiproliferative effect of VACM-1/Cul5 is dependent on its posttranslational modifications and will help in the design of new anticancer therapeutics that target the Nedd8 pathway."

Condensation of glycine and succinyl coenzyme A produces 5-aminolevulinate, coenzyme A, and carbon dioxide. X-ray crystal structures of Rhodobacter capsulatus ALAS reveal that a conserved active site serine moves to within hydrogen bonding distance of the phenolic oxygen of the PLP cofactor in the closed substrate-bound enzyme conformation and within 3–4 Å of the thioester sulfur atom of bound succinyl-CoA. To evaluate the role(s) of this residue in enzymatic activity, the equivalent serine in murine erythroid ALAS was substituted with alanine or threonine. Although both the KmSCoA and kcat values of the S254A variant increased, by 25- and 2-fold, respectively, the S254T substitution decreased kcat without altering KmSCoA. Furthermore, in relation to wild-type ALAS, the catalytic efficiency of S254A toward glycine improved ∼3-fold, whereas that of S254T diminished ∼3-fold. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that removal of the side chain hydroxyl group in the S254A variant altered the microenvironment of the PLP cofactor and hindered succinyl-CoA binding. Transient kinetic analyses of the variant-catalyzed reactions and protein fluorescence quenching upon 5-aminolevulinate binding demonstrated that the protein conformational transition step associated with product release was predominantly affected.

Introduction5-Aminolevulinate synthase (EC 2.3.1.37; ALAS) 2The abbreviations used are: ALAS5-aminolevulinate synthaseALA5-aminolevulinatePLPpyridoxal 5′-phosphate. is a homodimeric PLP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first and key regulatory step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in non-plant eukaryotes and the α-subclass of purple bacteria, involving the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA to produce CoA, carbon dioxide, and ALA (1Akhtar M. Abboud M.M. Barnard G. Jordan P. Zaman Z. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1976; 273: 117-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Animal genomes encode two highly conserved but differentially expressed ALAS genes, one of which is expressed in all tissues (ALAS1), and the other of which is erythroid-specific (ALAS2) (2May B.K.

In humans, mutations in the ALAS2 gene can result in X-linked sideroblastic anemia (3May A. Bishop D.F. Haematologica. 1998; 83: 56-70PubMed Google Scholar), a hypochromic and microcytic anemia characterized by iron accumulation within erythroblast mitochondria (4Bottomley S.S. Curr. Hematol. Rep. 2006; 5: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately one-third of X-linked sideroblastic anemia patients are pyridoxine-responsive, and in these patients the ALAS mutations are commonly observed in the PLP-binding site (5Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Al-Daihan S. Alexeev D. Baxter R.L. Bottomley S.S. Kahari I.D. Roy I. Sarwar M. Sawyer L. Wang S.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23025-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mechanistic complexity is manifested structurally as an enzyme with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, as exemplified by the observation that the catalytic cores of human ALAS2 and Rhodobacter capsulatus ALAS are 49% identical and 70% similar (8Astner I.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). ALAS is evolutionarily related to transaminases and is grouped within class II of the fold type I PLP-dependent enzyme superfamily, for which the prototypical enzyme is generally considered to be aspartate aminotransferase (10Jäger J.

ALAS is most closely related to the three other members of the α-oxoamine synthase subfamily, each of which also catalyzes a reaction involving a small amino acid, a CoA ester, and a 1,3-aminoketone (13Christen P.

Catalysis occurs in the closed conformation, consistent with the induced fit hypothesis, where electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the substrates, cofactor, and amino acids comprising the active site provide the energetic impetus to stabilize a catalytically optimal conformation (17Koshland Jr., D.E. Neet K.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1968; 37: 359-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).Prior to solution of an ALAS crystal structure, kinetic data led to the proposal that the ALAS catalytic cycle is dominated by a rate-limiting conformational change associated with release of ALA (7Hunter G.A.

The crystal structures of R. capsulatus ALAS in holoenzymic and substrate-bound forms confirmed that the enzyme adopts open and closed conformations, respectively, and allowed discrimination of the specific regions and residues of the enzyme involved in protein dynamics (8Astner I. Schulze J.O. van den Heuvel J. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3166-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the structure in general collapses slightly around the bound substrates, a more conformationally mobile loop of amino acids located between two β-sheets at the subunit interface closes directly over the active site channel, which extends ∼20 Å down into the core of the enzyme to the PLP-binding site (Fig. 1) (8Astner I. Schulze J.O. van den Heuvel J. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3166-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A conserved threonine at the apex of the mobile loop forms a strong hydrogen bond (∼2.5 Å) with the carboxylate tail of succinyl-CoA in the substrate-bound structure and appears to simultaneously provide molecular recognition for succinyl-CoA while helping to lock this substrate into optimal stereoelectronic position for catalysis (21Lendrihas T. Zhang J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Coincident with these changes, the side chain of Ser-189 (R. capsulatus numbering) migrates from noncovalently associating with the peptide macroskeleton to within hydrogen bonding distance of the PLP phenolic oxygen, as well as the sulfur atom of succinyl-CoA (8Astner I.

These interactions suggest that this serine residue may be an important determinant in conformer equilibrium and catalysis by providing orientational binding energy between the enzyme, cofactor, and substrate, exclusively, in the closed Michaelis complex conformation. The conservation of this residue in ALAS and the other α-oxoamine synthases further suggests an important functionality that may be general to these enzymes (Fig. 2). Here, we present experiments aimed at probing the role of this serine in catalysis by murine ALAS2. We have generated and purified the positionally equivalent S254A and S254T variants and investigated the effects of these mutations on the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of the enzyme. The results support the postulate that this serine residue couples succinyl-CoA binding to enzyme conformational equilibria and catalysis.FIGURE 1Structural models for murine erythroid ALAS based on the R. capsulatus crystal structures.

Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis for the S254A and S254T mouse ALAS variants was performed on the whole plasmid pGF23 using a previously described method (25Miyazaki K. Takenouchi M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (1036–1038): 1033-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Experimental details are described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”Protein Purification, SDS-PAGE, Protein Determination, and Steady-state AnalysisRecombinant murine ALAS2 and the S254 variants were purified from DH5α Escherichia coli bacterial cells containing the overexpressed protein as described previously (24Ferreira G.C. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 584-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and protein concentration determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar). All protein concentrations are reported on the basis of a subunit molecular mass of 56 kDa. Enzymatic activity was determined by a continuous spectrophotometric assay at 30 °C (see supplemental material) (28Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Structural AnalysesThe Protein Data Base files 2BWN, 2BWO, and 2BWP, corresponding to the holoenzyme, succinyl-CoA-bound, and glycine-bound R. capsulatus ALAS crystal structures, were used as templates to model the PLP-binding core of the murine ALAS2 (8Astner I. Schulze J.O. van den Heuvel J. Jahn D. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3166-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond determinations were accomplished using Deepview/Swiss-PdbViewer software (29Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar).Spectroscopic MeasurementsAll spectroscopic measurements were performed with dialyzed enzyme in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 10% (v/v) glycerol to remove free PLP. CD spectra were collected using an AVIV CD spectrometer calibrated for both wavelength maxima and signal intensity with an aqueous solution of D-10 camphorsulfonic acid (31Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CD spectra recorded from 190 to 240 nm were analyzed by the ridge regression method using a modified version of the computer program CONTIN developed by Provencher and Glöckner (32Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were 10 and 100 μm for the near-UV-visible and far-UV CD spectra, respectively. The final concentration of succinyl-CoA was 100 μm, giving a 1:1 molar ratio of enzyme to ligand for collection of the latter spectra. At least three CD spectra were collected per experiment and averaged, using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette with a total volume of 300 μl. Blank CD spectra contained all components of the solution except enzyme. CD spectra containing the enzyme samples were collected immediately after adding the enzyme. The spectra of the samples containing enzyme were analyzed after subtracting the blank spectra. Co-factor fluorescence spectra were collected on a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer using protein concentrations of 2 μm. Spectra were measured at pH 7.5, 50 mm HEPES, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Excitation was at 331 nm, and the excitation and emission slit widths were each set to 10 nm. Emission was measured over the wavelength range 350–600 nm. Buffer blanks were subtracted from the spectra.Stopped-flow SpectroscopyAll of the experiments were carried out at 30 °C in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Because of the difference in Km for succinyl-CoA between the two variant enzymes, two different succinyl-CoA concentrations were used to ensure the identification of a single enzyme-catalyzed event. For the S254A-catalyzed reaction, the final concentrations were as follows: 120 μm S254A, 130 mm glycine, and 30 μm succinyl-CoA. The final concentrations of the reactants for S254T were as follows: 50 μm S254T, 130 mm glycine, and 10 μm succinyl-CoA. Rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic measurements were conducted using an OLIS model RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The dead time of this instrument is ∼2 ms, and the observation chamber optical path length is 4.0 mm. Scans covering the wavelength region 270–550 nm were acquired at a rate of either 62 or 31 scans/s to condense the resulting data files to a tractable size for data fitting analysis. An external water bath was utilized to maintain constant temperature of the syringes and observation chamber. Specifically, spectral data covering the 270–550 nm range were analyzed by global fitting to a triple exponential using the SIFIT program supplied with the stopped-flow instrument (OLIS, Inc.) (33Tsai M.D. Weintraub H.J. Byrn S.R. Chang C. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3183-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The quality of fits was judged by visual analysis of the calculated residuals in conjunction with the Durbin-Watson statistic (34Durbin J. Watson G.S. Biometrika. 1950; 37: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Single turnover data were interpreted using a three kinetic step mechanism as described by Reaction 1.A→kobs1B→kobs2C→kobs3D The observed rate constants were determined from at least three replicate experiments, and the reported values represent the average and standard error of measurement for each experimental condition. The forward and reverse rate constants depicted in the kinetic mechanism (Fig. 7) were obtained by modeling single wavelength kinetic traces at 510 nm with KinTekSim (Austin, TX) kinetic simulation software (35Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The eight interior rate constants were allowed to float, althoughthe KD values were held constant as determined separately.FIGURE 7Kinetic mechanisms of the Ser-254 variant enzymes. The single turnover quinonoid formation and decay reaction kinetics of the variant enzymes and wild-type ALAS and the reactions of the enzymes with glycine and ALA were used to model their kinetic mechanisms. The fits for S254A (A), S254T (B), and wild-type ALAS (C) (7Hunter G.A. Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23025-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were indistinguishable from those completed based on the global fit of spectral data.

The final enzyme concentration was 60 μm. The glycine concentration was always at least 10-fold greater than the enzyme concentration to ensure that pseudo-first order kinetics were observed. The treatment of the data was performed using the fitting software supplied with the instrument. The time courses at 420 nm were fitted to Equation 1,At=∑n=13aie-kit+C(1) where At is the absorbance at time t; a is the amplitude of each phase; k is the observed rate constant for each phase, and c is the final absorbance. The quality associated with the fit was determined by the calculated residuals and from the Durbin-Watson ratio (34Durbin J. Watson G.S. Biometrika. 1950; 37: 409-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). The observed rate constants were plotted against increasing concentrations of glycine, and the resulting data were fitted to a two-step reaction process represented by Reaction 2. Data fitting to Equation 2 used the nonlinear regression analysis program SigmaPlot10 (Systat, San Jose, CA),A→kobs1B→kobs2Ckobs=k1[S]KD+[S]+k-1(2) -> where S is the concentration of substrate; k1 and k−1 are the forward and reverse rate constants; KD is the dissociation constant, and kobs, the observed rate constant.Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence QuenchingThe presteady-state kinetics of the product binding reaction of ALAS and the two serine variants were examined by measuring changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence intensity. An OLIS RSM-1000F rapid mixing spectrofluorimeter, equipped with a high intensity xenon arc lamp, was used to monitor the reaction. The enzyme and ligand in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol were maintained at 30 °C in separate syringes prior to their mixing in the reaction chamber. The intrinsic protein fluorescence, as measured with 5 μm enzyme, was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the product ALA. The excitation wavelength and the slit width were 280 and 5 mm, respectively. The emitted light was filtered using a cutoff filter (WG 320; 80% transmittance at 320 nm (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ)). Typically, 500 time points were collected for varying lengths of time, and three or more experiments were averaged. Each averaged data set was then fitted to Equation 3, using the Global fitting software provided with the instrument.ΔFobs(t)=A1e-kobst+A0(3) where Fobs(t) is the observed fluorescence change (in arbitrary units) at time t; kobs is the observed first order rate constant; A1 is the pre-exponential factor, and A0 is the offset. The observed rate constants were then plotted against ligand concentration, and the data were fitted to Equation 4 by nonlinear regression. The rates of dissociation (koff) and association (kon) as well as the ligand binding constants (KD) were calculated from the asymptotic maximal observed rate, the ordinate intercept, and the ligand concentration (x) in Equation 4.f(x)=kon+koffxKD+x(4) DISCUSSIONThe spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the S254A and S254T murine ALAS variants were examined and compared with those of the wild-type enzyme in an effort to better understand the role of Ser-254 in the catalytic process. Mutation of serine to alanine removes the side chain oxygen atom and eliminates the possibility of hydrogen bond formation with the PLP cofactor and succinyl-CoA. The conservative S254T mutation adds a methyl group and is predicted to allow for hydrogen bonding, although some steric constraints may be introduced due to the tight packing in this region of the active site. Comparison of the steady-state kinetic parameters of the variants with those of the wild-type enzyme determined under similar conditions hints at the unusual kinetic significance of Ser-254 (Table 1). Point mutations typically result in increased Michaelis constants and decreased turnover numbers, but strikingly, in the S254A variant both of these parameters were increased. The Km value for succinyl-CoA was increased 25-fold over that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the kcat value was increased 2-fold. Although the physiological significance remains to be established, it is worth noting that mutation of this evolutionarily conserved residue in such a metabolically important enzyme led to enhanced values for both kcat and catalytic efficiency toward glycine (kcat/KmGly).The kcat value for murine ALAS2 has been proposed to be defined by a conformational change of the enzyme accompanying ALA release (7Hunter G.A. Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23025-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is further supported here by the studies involving quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence upon product binding with both wild-type ALAS and the Ser-254 variants (Fig. 5). Indeed, the protein fluorescence-associated ALA off-rates (k−1) were indistinguishable from the steady-state kcat values (Table 1). These data also indicated that the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle was unaltered in the mutated enzymes. The increase in kcat value observed for the S254A variant may be attributable to diminished stability of the closed conformation, leading to faster reversion to the open conformation and product release. In this interpretation, the large concomitant increase in the Km value for succinyl-CoA in the S254A variant would result not only from the direct effect of loss of hydrogen bonding to the substrate but also from the less direct effect of impaired enzyme conformational change as triggered by the substrate, which is believed to be required for optimal binding (7Hunter G.A. Zhang J. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23025-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12222-12228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 3-fold decrease in the kcat value without any effect on the Km value for succinyl-CoA resulting from the more conservative S254T mutation would then arise primarily from enhanced stability of the closed conformation. Both mutations substantially diminished the catalytic efficiency with succinyl-CoA (kcat/KmSCoA) but in different ways, and although the effects of these very conservative mutations on the steady-state kinetic parameters may appear relatively modest, they are presumably sufficient to have metabolically harmful effects in vivo, given the strong evolutionary selection for serine at this position.Significant effects on the cofactor microenvironment of ALAS were induced with the S254A mutation, as determined using fluorescence and CD spectroscopies.

https://openalex.org/W2081332370,"The majority of studies employing short tandem repeats (STRs) require investigation of several of these genetic markers. As such, we demonstrate the feasibility of the trinucleotide threading (TnT) approach for scalable analysis of STRs. The TnT method represents a parallel amplification alternative that addresses the obstacles associated with multiplex PCR. In this study, analysis of the STR fragments was performed with capillary gel electrophoresis; however, it should be possible to combine our approach with the massive 454 sequencing platform to considerably increase the number of targeted STRs."
