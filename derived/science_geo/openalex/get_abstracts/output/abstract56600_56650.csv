https://openalex.org/W1570548591,"Abstract d-Amino acid oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of β-chloroalanine to chloropyruvate as well as its conversion to pyruvate, a nonoxidative reaction. The product composition depends on oxygen: only pyruvate is produced in 100% N2, chloropyruvate is formed almost exclusively in 100% O2, and mixtures result at intermediate levels. The rate of total keto acid production (pyruvate + chloropyruvate) is independent of oxygen, indicating the rate-determining formation of a common precursor of the two keto acids. Substitution of the α-hydrogen of β-chloroalanine by deuterium and tritium results in kinetic isotope effects which slow down chloroalanine conversion but do not differentially affect product distribution. A similar relationship holds for the deuterium solvent isotope effect with incubations conducted in 2H2O. The substrate kinetic isotope effects indicate that the dissociation of the α-C—H bond of the substrate is rate-determining or at least partially rate-determining in the formation of the common intermediate. Preliminary experiments indicate that l-amino acid oxidase also produces both pyruvate and chloropyruvate from l-chloroalanine. These results suggest that the conversion of chloroalanine to pyruvate and chloropyruvate by d-amino acid oxidase involves a common intermediate in which the α-hydrogen of the substrate has been removed as a proton. It is very probable that the oxidation of other amino acid substrates involves similar intermediates. The intermediate could be a carbanion or an adduct derived from a substrate carbanion and the flavin coenzyme. d-Amino acid oxidase does not catalyze the exchange of the α-hydrogen of chloroalanine and serine with solvent protons under anaerobic conditions. When [α-3H]proline, pyruvate, and NH4+ were incubated anaerobically with the enzyme, no 3H was observed in the alanine formed in such incubations. This indicates that the proton released from the substrate is rapidly released from E·FADII2."
https://openalex.org/W1505085184,"Abstract The mechanism of hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by an enzyme system containing cytochrome P-450 was investigated with the aid of highly purified enzymes known to catalyze the generation and decomposition of superoxide (O2·-). The liver microsomal enzyme system used in these studies was previously solubilized and resolved into three components (cytochrome P-450, TPNH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and phosphatidylcholine) which are required for the hydroxylation of a variety of fatty acids, hydrocarbons, and drugs. Superoxide dismutase (erythrocuprein) was shown to inhibit benzphetamine hydroxylation in the presence of TPNH, molecular oxygen, and the reconstituted liver microsomal enzyme system. The extent of inhibition was the same determined by benzphetamine-dependent TPNH oxidation and by benzphetamine demethylation, which results from hydroxylation of the N-methyl group and the subsequent liberation of formaldehyde. The dismutase caused complete inhibition only in the presence of a concentration of salt which itself was partially inhibitory. A superoxide generating system (xanthine and xanthine oxidase) was shown to couple with cytochrome P-450 to support the hydroxylation of benzphetamine and ethylmorphine in the absence of TPNH and the reductase. The coupling was dependent upon the presence of phosphatidylcholine and was abolished by the addition of the dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1558128541,"Abstract We have recently described the preparation of a solubilized cat myocardial adenylate cyclase which is unresponsive to norepinephrine, glucagon, histamine, and thyroxine, the hormones which activate the membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. The addition of phosphatidylinositol totally restored the norepinephrine activation of the solubilized adenylate cyclase, whereas, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine did not. Half-maximal activation was achieved with norepinephrine, 8 x 10-8 m, a concentration approximately 1% of that required in particulate preparations. Norepinephrine activation of adenylate cyclase in the presence of phosphatidylinositol was abolished by the beta adrenergic blocking agent, dl-propranolol."
https://openalex.org/W1560062467,"Abstract Reuber H35 hepatoma cells growing in monolayer cultures have been found to contain the soluble enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The activity of this enzyme can be increased 2- to 3-fold by the addition of either N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (DBcAMP) or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Δ1,2,9α-fluoro,16α-methyl cortisol). Tyrosine transaminase responds similarly to DBcAMP but its activity was elevated 5- to 8-fold by dexamethasone. The effects of each inducer on both enzymes were similar with respect to kinetics, dose-response relationships, analogues, and cycloheximide inhibition. The response of both enzymes to DBcAMP, however, was more rapid than to dexamethasone. The rate of transaminase synthesis was increased 2- to 3-fold by DBcAMP but no effect of the cyclic nucleotide could be detected on the rate of transaminase degradation. Elevation of carboxykinase activity appears to be due to an increase in the rate of synthesis of this enzyme based on immunological evidence and cycloheximide inhibition of the response to both dexamethasone and DBcAMP. Insulin completely suppressed the effects of both DBcAMP and dexamethasone on the carboxykinase at the same time that it produced additive increases in transaminase activity with these agents. On the other hand, progesterone completely prevented the effects of dexamethasone on both enzymes but did not inhibit the effects of DBcAMP on either enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1534556407,"Abstract Hydrocortisone addition to cell cultures of the Reuber (H-35) hepatoma initiated an 8- to 10-fold increase in tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) levels, the response being maximal at 9 hours and persisting at this new level for at least 36 hours. The optimal concentration of hydrocortisone for this induction was 5 x 10-7 m. Insulin was also found to elevate this enzyme in H-35 cells, and caused the enzyme to rise without the lag period that is apparent after hydrocortisone. With a single addition of insulin, the increase in enzyme (5- to 6-fold) ceased after 8 hours, but a high steady state could be maintained by resupplementation with insulin. When the effect of insulin is measured at 6 hours, 1 milliunit per ml is optimal and 0.02 milliunit per ml is readily detected. The isolated A and B chains of insulin are not effective and do not compete with intact insulin. Glucagon is not effective in these cells, which appear to lack adenyl cyclase activity. Immunochemical-isotopic analyses show that both hydrocortisone and insulin specifically accelerate synthesis of the enzyme, but there may also be a stimulation of general protein synthesis after insulin treatment. Analysis of the kinetics of these inductions indicates a half-life of about 3 hours for tyrosine transaminase in the cells; this was confirmed by chase analysis and shown to be unaffected by insulin. Transaminases from hydrocortisone-induced, insulin-induced, and noninduced cells are immunologically identical with the rat liver enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2015833028,"For hypothyroid rats, spontaneous motor activity was less than that in matched normal controls, and the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain was significantly greater than that in controls. Rats made hyperthyroid with thyroxine became hyperactive and showed increased sensitivity to the behaviorally activating effects of norepinephrine administered intraventricularly. In hyperthyroid rats, the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the midbrain remained within the normal range. These results are consonant with studies that suggested both receptor ""tuning"" and feedback regulation of activity of enzymes involved in biosynthesis of presynaptic neurotransmitter as methods of regulation of the central catecholamine synapse. These results may also help explain the reported potentiation by thyroid hormone of the antidepressant effects of imipramine."
https://openalex.org/W1556589772,"Abstract A detailed spectrophotometric study was made of the electron transport systems in mitochondria from wild type and poky strains of Neurospora crassa. Wild type mitochondria were found to contain flavoproteins, two b-type cytochromes (α-peaks (77°K) at 554 and 561 nm), two c-type cytochromes (α-peaks (77°K) at 545 and 550 nm), and cytochrome aa3 (α-peak (77°K) at 601 nm). In terms of their spectra, the b- and c-type cytochromes of poky mitochondria are identical with those of wild type; the room temperature absorption minimum of poky flavoproteins is shifted from 460 (the wild type value) to 451 nm, however, and the α-peak (77°K) of poky cytochrome aa3 is shifted from 601 to 591 nm. The most striking difference between wild type and poky lies in the concentrations of the electron carriers. Poky mitochondria contain flavoproteins and cytochrome c (largely c545) at 30% higher concentrations than wild type mitochondria, but are grossly deficient in b- and a-type cytochromes. Furthermore, the concentration ratio, cytochrome aa3 to cytochrome b, is about 0.3 in poky compared with 1.0 in wild type mitochondria, a fact which probably accounts for relatively high steady state levels of reduction of cytochrome c in poky mitochondria. Enzymatic determinations of pyridine nucleotides showed NAD+ and NADH to predominate over NADP+ and NADPH in mitochondria from both strains. The total concentration of pyridine nucleotides in poky was about one-half that in wild type. In addition to the cytochrome chain, poky is known to possess an alternate, cyanide-insensitive oxidase system. The present experiments show that none of the cytochrome components of poky mitochondria plays any direct role in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1564623278,"Abstract The intranuclear localization of the 5α-reductase that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in rat ventral prostate has been investigated in nuclei purified by sedimentation through 2.2 m sucrose. First, as the result of chemical analyses of the isolated nuclei, light microscopy studies, and an investigation of the subcellular distribution of several marker enzymes in this tissue, it was concluded that the nuclei prepared in this manner were free from major contamination with other cytoplasmic constituents. In keeping with previous studies of the enzyme approximately half the enzyme activity in rat prostate was found in the nucleus. Second, the nuclei were fragmented by exposure to sonic oscillation and subjected to centrifugation in previously formed cesium chloride density gradients. Under these conditions, all the enzyme activity was found to coincide with a visible band of turbidity at approximately d 1.23 to 1.27. On the basis of the buoyant density, the chemical composition of the fraction, and similar flotation patterns of NADH-cytochrome c reductase, a known enzyme of the nuclear membrane, it was concluded that the 5α-reductase in prostatic nuclei is located in a nuclear membrane. In the isolation of this nuclear membrane fraction a 90-fold purification of the enzyme has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2006699153,"Epinephrine caused amylase secretion and K(+) release in rat parotid slices. Propranolol, which blocks beta-receptors, inhibited amylase secretion; phentolamine, which blocks alpha-receptors, inhibited K(+) release. Since enzyme secretion was associated with fusion of secretory granules to the cell membrane and K(+) release was associated with vacuole formation, it could be shown that both alpha- and beta-receptors are present in the same exocrine cell. The findings appear to exclude cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate as an intermediate in the alpha-receptor response."
https://openalex.org/W2161011670,"Abstract Substrate concentration effects on isotopic exchange rates at equilibrium have been measured with Escherichia coli glutamate synthetase (adenylated form) with 32P, 14C, 18O, and 15N. A new test for possible compulsory substrate-binding orders is presented, involving measurement of equilibrium exchange rates while increasing concentration of all substrates. This test shows random substrate-binding patterns for the enzyme. Inhibition of some equilibrium exchange rates while various pairs of substrates were increased in concentration appears to result from competitive rather than compulsory binding order effects. The relative rates of equilibrium exchanges were (glutamate ⇄ glutamine) g (NH3 ⇄ glutamine) g (Pi ⇄ ATP) = (ADP ⇄ ATP). The inequalities show that interconversion of bound substrates is not the only rate-limiting step, and allow deductions about relative association-dissociation rates of various substrates. Glutamine synthetase from E. coli does not catalyze any detectable ADP ⇄ ATP, Pi ⇄ ATP, glutamate ⇄ glutamine, or NH3 ⇄ glutamine exchanges unless all substrates are present. The absence of ADP ⇄ ATP exchange in presence of glutamate or of NH3 ⇄ glutamine exchange in presence of Pi, together with lack of compulsory substrate-binding orders, does not give support to formation of γ-glutamyl phosphate as an enzyme-bound intermediate. No phosphoryl enzyme, glutamyl enzyme, or amido enzyme could be detected by isotopic labeling and isolation procedures. The results suggest further consideration of a concerted reaction mechanism requiring all substrates present in the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1585053261,"Abstract Evidence is given for the generation of a component having the properties of a free radical during the oxidation of TPNH by liver microsomes. The component is apparently responsible for the peroxidative chain scission of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the microsomal membrane which occurs during TPNH-dependent electron transport. The component is also capable of causing rapid lysis of erythrocytes when the latter are added to the reaction system. The hemolysis is prevented (a) by inhibitors of TPNH oxidation, (b) by prior heat denaturation of the microsomes, (c) by including free radical trapping agents in the incubation system, and (d) by elevating the level of α-tocopherol intake of the erythrocyte donors for several days. Hemolysis, when in progress, stops abruptly whenever the enzyme activity ceases, demonstrating that the component has a very short half-life. The hemolysis was shown not to be caused by the microsomal phospholipids which had undergone peroxidative cleavage. The hemolysis occurred even under conditions in which there was no alteration of microsomal phospholipids at all. The results indicate that the mechanism of electron transport from TPNH by microsomes involves free radical intermediates. The course of production of the radical-like component can be followed by observing its lytic action on erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1566949129,"Abstract A trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate-squalene synthetase has been isolated in a soluble form from yeast extracts and purified 45-fold. The molecular weight of the enzyme estimated from sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography is 426,000. Solubilization of the squalene synthetase is achieved with deoxycholate. Treatment with the detergent markedly lowers squalene synthetase activity but when deoxycholate is removed by Amberlite XAD-2, the soluble enzyme regains full activity. Such synthetase preparations are relatively labile. They can be stabilized by glycerol and 2-mercaptoethanol. Both TPNH and DPNH serve as electron donors for the squalene synthetase. Their Km values are 122 µm and 310 µm, respectively. The two pyridine nucleotides differ somewhat in their effects on the Hill coefficient for the bimolecular condensation of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene. With DPNH the Hill slope is 2.0 and with TPNH 1.4. The purified synthetase catalyzes not only the formation of squalene from farnesyl pyrophosphate but also accumulates presqualene pyrophosphate (in the absence of pyridine nucleotide) and converts biosynthetic presqualene pyrophosphate to squalene."
https://openalex.org/W1547967257,"Abstract The interaction between spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and ferredoxin was kinetically investigated in the presence and absence of NaCl. Ferredoxin was inhibitory toward the diaphorase activity of ferredoxin-NADP+-reductase at low ionic strength. This inhibition was revealed to be partially competitive with respect to NADPH (Ki = 2 x 10-9 m). At higher ionic strength (over 0.05 m NaCl), however, ferredoxin markedly stimulated the activity by lowering the Michaelis constant for the electron acceptor. It was shown that there are, at least, three stages of interaction between the reductase and ferredoxin, depending on the ionic strength of the environment: (a) a very tightly bound complex which is present at near zero ionic strength where ferredoxin is inhibitory toward the catalyzed reaction, (b) a comparatively loosely bound, but catalytically most effective, complex which is seen at around 0.1 m NaCl concentration, and (c) a complex of decreased activity where the reductase is inactivated by high ionic strength. The results strongly suggest that the enzymatic activities displayed by the complex formation between two protein components can be regulated by ionic strength of the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1588946050,"Abstract Reduced pyridine nucleotide dehydrogenase was purified 44,000-fold from normal human erythrocytes by procedures including ammonium sulfate fractionation, calcium phosphate gel chromatography, Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing. The most purified enzyme preparation showed a single homogeneous peak (s20,w = 2.77 S) upon ultracentrifugation and was nearly homogeneous on acrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. Absorption spectrum of the enzyme, fluorimetry of flavin, and effect of inhibitors showed that the enzyme contained no flavin nucleotides and no heme as a coenzyme. Various hemoproteins and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol served as electron acceptors for the enzymatic reaction. Among the hemoproteins, cytochrome b5 was the most effective electron acceptor. Assuming a molecular weight of 28,000, the enzyme has a molecular activity of 6.5 for methemoglobin and 4,550 for cytochrome b5 with NADH as an electron donor. The Michaelis constants (Km) for methemoglobin and cytochrome b5 were 3.1 x 10-4 m and 7.1 x 10-6 m, respectively. Rapid reduction of methemoglobin was observed in the presence of a small amount of cytochrome b5, which can be explained by the enzymatic reduction of cytochrome b5 and subsequent nonenzymatic reduction of methemoglobin by the reduced cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1597438862,"Abstract Nonhemoglobin proteins of normal human red cells and methemoglobinemic red cells were separated from hemoglobin by carboxymethylcellulose column chromatography and NADH-dependent diaphorases were fractionated by the column chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and DEAE-Sephadex. Two NADH-dependent diaphorases, diaphorase A and diaphorase C, were isolated from the normal red cell extracts, diaphorase A forming 90% of the total activity. The Km of partially purified diaphorase A for 2,6-dichloroindophenol is 3.3 x 10-4 m. The diaphorase A fraction was less than 3% of normal in the methemoglobinemic red cell extracts. The methemoglobinemic enzyme is similar to the normal enzyme with respect to its Km for the dye, affinity with NADH, and the effects of phosphate on its activity, and, although its chromatographic behavior is normal, it is not identical with the normal enzyme, judging from its heat stability and electrophoretic properties. When assayed in 1.0 m sodium phosphate buffer, another NADH-dependent diaphorase, diaphorase B, is seen in both the normal and methemoglobinemic red cell extracts, which is found to be essentially NADPH-dependent diaphorase. It exhibits NADH-diaphorase activity in proportion to phosphate concentration and causes the phosphate activation of NADH-diaphorase activity in the methemoglobinemic hemolysate. When assayed in 1.0 m phosphate buffer, Km for the dye is 2.0 x 10-5 m and Km for NADH is 9.0 x 10-5 m regardless of NADH and the dye concentrations, respectively, which suggests a reaction mechanism whereby the affinity of one substrate to the enzyme is not influenced by the presence of another substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1602875282,"Abstract [2-14C]Thiouracil and [35S]thiouracil are incorporated into the melanin of chick retinal pigment epithelium incubated in vitro. This synthesis of a thiouracil pheomelanin (thiol-containing melanin) can be used to measure the rate of melanin synthesis in living cells. Thiouracil incorporation is dependent on tyrosinase activity: incorporation is inhibited by phenylthiourea, a tyrosinase inhibitor, and there is a proportional relationship between thiouracil incorporation and the level of tyrosinase activity in pigment tissues. Other chick embryo tissues do not incorporate thiouracil, but small quantities are incorporated by embryo tissues containing tyrosine hydroxylase. Radioactivity is retained in melanin prepared from isolated melanosomes of pigment tissues incubated in [2-14C]thiouracil. A comparison of [35S]thiouracil and l-[2-14C]tyrosine incorporations into melanin indicates that 1.5 moles of thiouracil are incorporated for each mole of tyrosine. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that thiouracil condenses with the quinone intermediates in the melanin pathway and is incorporated into the melanin polymer as part of the subunit structure."
https://openalex.org/W1557892981,"Fatty acid synthetase of the liver of all of the mammalian species investigated and of the lactating mammary gland shows a pronounced preference for butyryl-CoA over acetyl-CoA as primer in the synthesis of fatty acids from the primer, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. This relative primer specificity, in contrast to that of the enzyme complex isolated from rat adipose or pigeon liver, appears to be related to the presence in the particle-free supernatant of enzymes which are capable of synthesizing butyryl-CoA from acetyl-CoA by the reversal of β oxidation. A high proportion of fatty acid synthesis from acetyl-CoA by the mammalian liver and mammary supernatant, which contained NADH, NADPH and malonyl-CoA, occurred after its initial conversion to butyryl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1570291004,"Abstract An optically active (+) C30 alcohol has been isolated after hydrolysis of presqualene pyrophosphate by yeast microsomes. This alcohol can be prepared on a relatively large scale directly from farnesyl pyrophosphate in incubations with yeast microsomes from which inhibitors of phosphatase are omitted. The alcohol is named presqualene alcohol as its pyrophosphorylated form appears to be identical with natural presqualene pyrophosphate and is converted into squalene by microsomes in the presence of NADPH. The elemental compositions of presqualene alcohols biosynthesized from protio-farnesyl pyrophosphate and from [1-D2]-farnesyl pyrophosphate were found by high resolution mass spectrometry to be C30H49OH and C30H46D3OH, respectively. Presqualene alcohol contains five double bonds and one carbocycle. Mass spectral, nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopic studies as well as chemical degradation of presqualene alcohol indicate that its structure is that of a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane: cis-(1,2-anti-1,3-anti)-3-(2',6',10'-trimethylundeca-2',6'-10'-trienyl)-2-(2'',6''-dimethylnona-2'',6''-dienyl)-2-methyl-1-hydroxymethylcyclopropane. The data limit the absolute configuration around the three asymmetrical centers of the ring to either 1R, 2R, 3R or 1S, 2S, 3S out of the eight possible isomers."
https://openalex.org/W2153910960,"Abstract Glutamate dehydrogenase binds α-ketoglutarate and TPNH in a ternary complex such that both ligands are more tightly bound than in binary complexes. TPNH, bound in this ternary complex, absorbs maximally at 332 nm with E332 = 5.2 mm-1 cm-1 in contrast to the absorbance of free TPNH (E339 = Emax = 6.2 mm-1 cm-1) and TPNH bound in either a binary or in a glutamate dehydrogenase-TPNH-l-glutamate dead-end ternary complex (E348 = Emax = 4.8 mm-1 cm-1). One molecule of TPNH per 47,000 to 54,000 molecular weight glutamate dehydrogenase (approximately one per peptide chain) was found to be bound in either the α-ketoglutarate or l-glutamate ternary complex. The spectral shifts associated with ternary complex formation were not observed when the coenzyme and substrate analogs, 3-acetylpyridine DPNH or α-ketobutyrate, were used. Therefore, an intact amide on the reduced nicotinamide moiety and a gamma-carboxyl of the dicarboxylate substrate must be required for observable complex formation. The demonstration of the high stability of the glutamate dehydrogenase-TPNH-α-ketoglutarate complex and the correlation of the binding characteristics of the ligands involved in this complex with the effects of these ligands on catalytic events warrants the inclusion of this complex as either a reactive intermediate or a dead-end complex in all general mechanisms proposed for glutamate dehydrogenase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1586598543,"Abstract Interaction of NADPH and NADP+ with the oxidized (E) and 2-electron reduced (F) states of yeast glutathione reductase was studied at pH 7.6 and 25°. It is concluded that either NADPH or NADP+ can bind to both E and F. Spectrophotometric evidence is presented for formation of an F-NADPH complex with a stoichiometry of one NADPH per enzyme-bound FAD. The dissociation constant for this complex is 2.1 µm and its formation is complete in about 15 msec. Two previously unreported spectral species, considered to represent complexes between F and NADP+, result on anaerobic reduction of E by NADPH in the presence of high NADP+ concentrations. The more rapidly formed F-NADP+ complex slowly undergoes further spectral change to the second, stable species, F-NADPs+. Sufficiently high NADPH concentrations prevent formation of either F-NADP+ or F-NADPs+, suggesting that NADPH and NADP+ compete for a common site, probably the active site. The affinity of that site is greater for NADPH than for NADP+. Competitive inhibition by NADP+ of reduction of enzyme-bound FAD by NADH (studied by stopped flow methods) and of NADH-dependent GSSG reduction (studied by steady state kinetics) provide kinetic evidence for an E-NADP+ complex with a dissociation constant of 70 µm."
https://openalex.org/W1632030925,"Nicotinamide deamidase is synthesized constitutively in very small amounts by Escherichia coli. Mutants characterized by up to 50-fold higher deamidase activity have been isolated by mutagenesis and selection on minimal plates containing nicotinamide as the sole nitrogen source. These mutants still synthesize the enzyme constitutively. The enzyme was purified 200-fold. The final specific activity from one mutant is 10,000 times greater than the specific activity in the wild type. The molecular weight of the enzyme is about 30,000. Kinetic constants and heat stabilities of purified enzymes from two mutant strains and the wild type are identical. Gel electrophoresis has further suggested that the mutations result in over production of unaltered nicotinamide deamidase. Various hyperconstitutive mutations and the deamidase structural gene are cotransduced at high frequency, and thus lie close together."
https://openalex.org/W1639567665,"Abstract A protein that converts l-ornithine to l-proline and ammonia has been partially purified (up to 37-fold) from Clostridium PA 3679. The preparation contained a very active Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (l-proline:NAD(P) 5-oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.2), but this enzyme is not involved in the reaction. The cyclase was completely separated from the reductase activity by filtration through Sephadex G-200, centrifugation in a linear sucrose gradient, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cyclase activity in the peak fractions from these treatments was very unstable. Since the protein with cyclase activity has a much smaller sedimentation coefficient than the Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (5.7 versus 10.7), it could not be an aggregate containing the reductase. The partially purified cyclase had a pH optimum of 8.0 to 8.2 and a temperature optimum of 44°. NAD+ was required for a maximum activity but some response was evident when high levels of NADP+ or FAD+ were added. Lineweaver-Burk plots for NAD+ and NADP+ were linear and the apparent Km values were 6.1 x 10-3 and 3.3 mm, respectively. The enzyme is specific for l-ornithine and the apparent Km is 11.1 mm. The products are l-proline and ammonia. No tritium was incorporated into either ornithine or proline when the cyclase reaction was carried out in 3H2O."

Successful resolution of phosphorylation coupling factors from energy-converting membranes of this bacterium permitted tests for reciprocal function of such protein factors in oxidative-and photophosphorylation processes. Evidence was obtained for the interchangeability of coupling factor preparations from dark-grown and photosynthetically grown cells in both kinds of energy conversion.

Tritium was incorporated into product, mevalonic acid, in high yield from Form A of [3H]NADPH in each of these reactions. Only a trace of radioactivity was associated with mevalonic acid when the reduction was carried out under identical conditions with Form B of [3H]NADPH. Therefore, hydrogen is transferred from the A side of the pyridine ring of NADPH in each of these dehydrogenase-catalyzed reductions (ester (NADPH)/→ aldehyde-derivative (intermediate) (NADPH)/→ alcohol)."
https://openalex.org/W1955169045,"Abstract The enzymatic incorporation of d-alanine into membranes of Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469) is described. The activity is dependent on ATP, supernatant fraction and membrane fragments; it is enhanced by the addition of Mg2+. The incorporation is insensitive to ribonuclease. The product of this reaction is characterized as a hydroxylamine (1 m, pH 7.0, 37°) labile ester that is not extracted into lipophilic solvents. The lability of the incorporated d-alanine in hydroxylamine is similar to that observed for the d-alanine ester residues in the glycerol teichoic acid from this organism. The chromatographic properties of the product are not consistent with alanyl phosphatidylglycerol. The Km for d-alanine and d-α-NH2-n-butyric acid is 18 µm and 850 µm, respectively. l-[14C]Alanine is not incorporated. The following analogues are effective inhibitors of d-alanine incorporation: (a) d-α-NH2-n-butyric acid; (b) dl-alanine hydroxamate; (c) dl-α-amino-n-butyric acid hydroxamate; (d) dl-alanine amide; and (e) d-serine. Although the specificity profile is similar to that described for the d-alanine-activating enzyme (Baddiley, J., and Neuhaus, F. C., Biochem. J., 75, 579 (1960)), the supernatant factor was partially separated from this enzyme and alanine racemase by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. It is proposed that the supernatant fraction contains an enzyme, d-alanine:membrane acceptor ligase, that is involved in the introduction of d-alanine ester residues into membranes of this organism."
https://openalex.org/W1494816576,"Abstract The oxido-reduction of 17-hydroxystearic acid by enzymes present in the microsomal and soluble fractions of homogenates of rat and guinea pig liver was studied. The rate of oxidation of l-17-hydroxystearic acid into 17-ketostearic acid by the 100,000 x g supernatant fluid of rat and guinea pig liver homogenate was 2.2 and 6 times, respectively, faster than the rate of oxidation of d-17-hydroxystearic acid. In the presence of microsomal fraction of rat liver homogenate, d-17-hydroxystearic acid was oxidized 1.4 times faster than l-17-hydroxystearic acid. Reduction of 17-ketostearic acid by the 100,000 x g supernatant fluid of rat and guinea pig liver homogenate yielded 17-hydroxystearic acid of which 72% and 91%, respectively, was the l-17-enantiomer. Reduction by the microsomal fraction of rat liver homogenate yielded 68% of d-17- and 32% of l-17-hydroxystearic acids. The soluble enzyme was found to utilize the 4A-hydrogen in NADPH whereas the microsomal enzyme utilized the 4B-hydrogen in NADH."

A 2400-fold purification was achieved with a 10% yield and an average specific activity of 470. The glucose 6-phosphate and NADP Michaelis constants were determined, as well as the optimal pH for activity. The analogues, 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate and galactose 6-phosphate, were utilized as substrates in place of glucose 6-phosphate. No reaction was observed when NAD was substituted for NADP. The amino acid composition and extinction coefficient are given."
https://openalex.org/W1833845642,"Abstract Tryptic glycopeptide fractions GP-1, -2, and -3, representative of the heterosaccharides attached to asparagines-21, -34, and -76, respectively, in porcine pancreatic ribonuclease were subjected to oxidation with periodic acid, either alone or in combination with successive, controlled hydrolyses with carefully purified glycosidases. The enzymes used were α-mannosidase from jack beans, β-mannosidase from the hepatopancreas of Busycotypus, β-galactosidase and β-Nacetylglucosaminidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Aspergillus niger, and neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae. The progress of these degradative procedures was monitored by gas-liquid chromatography of the per-trimethylsilyl derivatives of methyl glycosides produced after acid-catalyzed methanolysis. The following were the principal findings and conclusions. (a) Of the 6 mannose residues in GP-2, four are α-linked, two are β-linked. These distinct types of residue occur to mutual exclusion in separate side chains attached to an N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide core unit, itself glycosidically linked to asparagine. (b) By the successive action of neuraminidase, β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase on GP-1 and GP-3 fractions, peptido-heptasaccharides were obtained which contained identical heterosaccharide moieties composed of 3 residues each of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine and 1 residue of fucose. By further degradation of these peptido-heptasaccharides a peptidotetrasaccharide was obtained with the following partial structure. Fuc(1 → 3,4)βGlcNAc(1 → 3)αMan(1 → 3,4)GlcNAc → Asn (c) The heterogeneity of GP-1 and GP-3 fractions may be attributed to variation in the extent to which the common heptasaccharide core moiety in these fractions is substituted with β(1 → 6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine-containing side chains which terminate in sialylgalactose units. (d) The results suggest that during biosynthesis differentiation of the two different types of heterosaccharide side chains in porcine ribonuclease occurs as the 2nd carbohydrate residue is attached to an aspartamido-2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxyglucopyranose unit in the peptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1521705037,"Data are presented which are consistent with the concept that transaminases can be bound to glutamate dehydrogenase. In the presence of TPNH and ammonium ions the transaminase in this enzyme-enzyme complex can be converted to the pyridoxamine phosphate form. Keto acids bind to and react with the transaminase in this complex to yield the pyridoxal phosphate form of the transaminase, TPN, and the corresponding amino acid. The specific structure of the keto acid required for binding to the enzyme-enzyme complex is determined by the transaminase, and not glutamate dehydrogenase. For example, oxalacetate is bound better than pyruvate to the complex of glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase while the opposite is the case when glutamate-pyruvate transaminase is part of the complex. The conversion of oxalacetate to aspartate occurs more readily with the complex between glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase than with the latter enzyme alone. With the enzyme-enzyme complex the specific activity with respect to glutamate dehydrogenase is higher (in some cases over 70-fold); the concentration of oxalacetate required to produce maximal activity is more than 1000-fold lower, and the concentration of ammonium ion required to produce maximal activity is more than 10-fold lower. Also, in the presence of the enzyme-enzyme complex, ADP is a significant activator. The activity of the complex can be regulated by several factors. For example, the specific activity and activation by ADP decreases when the concentration of glutamate dehydrogenase exceeds about 0.1 mg per ml. If the concentrations of keto acid and glutamate dehydrogenase are both high, then the reaction is similar to that of the keto acid with glutamate dehydrogenase alone. If the concentrations of the transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase are both high, the pyridoxamine phosphate form of the transaminase is produced faster than the capacity of the keto acid to react and TPN is produced in excess of the amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1535735436,"Abstract A soluble 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was found in porcine testes. The enzyme content was roughly proportional to the wet weight of the gland, when glands weighing 160 to 440 g were examined. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity by a six-step procedure. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be about 35,000 by gel filtration methods. The mobility of the enzyme protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also corresponded to this molecular weight, suggesting that the enzyme has no apparent subunit structure. The purified enzyme sedimented as a symmetrical boundary with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.9. Sucrose gradient centrifugation gave a similar sedimentation coefficient for the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to 17α,20α-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one with oxidation of an equimolar amount of NADPH. Apparently the enzyme has a dual pyridine nucleotide specificity although the Michaelis constant for NADH is 14 to 50 times larger than that for NADPH. The enzyme exhibits pH optimum between 5.5 and 7.5 both for the NADH- and NADPH-linked reactions, and its isoelectric point is pH 5.2. Progesterone, corticosterone, and 17α-hydroxycorticosterone were much less reactive than 17α-hydroxyprogesterone as hydrogen acceptors in the 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction. The enzyme had no 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity toward estrone. The maximum rate of the enzymatic reduction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone was observed at 50°, while the enzyme was rapidly inactivated at temperatures higher than 55°. The enzyme was stable at -20°, but unstable at 25°. Partial restoration of the original activity could be achieved by addition of cysteine and other sulfhydryl compounds. p-Chloromercuribenzoate, heavy metal ions, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were strong inhibitors, while albumin and EDTA had no influence upon the enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1575964280,"Abstract The interaction of the flavoprotein glutathione reductase from yeast with NADH has been studied. A reduced enzyme species resulting from addition of 2 electrons per enzyme-bound FAD is formed on addition of NADH to oxidized enzyme. This 2-electron reduced enzyme is stable toward further reduction to the 4-electron reduced state by excess NADH. Yeast glutathione reductase reduced by excess NADH has spectral properties distinct from those of yeast glutathione reductase reduced by excess NADPH, the physiological substrate, but virtually identical with the spectral properties reported by Massey and Williams (J. Biol. Chem., 240, 4470 (1965)) for yeast glutathione reductase reduced by a 526-fold molar excess of GSH. It is concluded that glutathione reductase reduced by a small molar excess of NADH is the free, 2-electron reduced enzyme with no oxidized or reduced pyridine nucleotide bound to it. A bimolecular rate constant of 1.8 x 104 m-1 sec-1 was measured using stopped flow techniques for reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD by NADH. The rate of reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD by NADH is identical with the steady state rate of NADH-dependent GSSG reduction, suggesting that reduction of enzyme-bound FAD is rate limiting in the over-all reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1482541033,"Abstract Neurospora glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a multimeric protein and occurs as tetramers and dimers with molecular weights of 206,000 and 104,000 to 114,000, respectively. The existence of the two types of molecules is supported by electron microscopic observations. The molecular weight of the subunits was estimated to be 57,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and 63,000 by sedimentation equilibrium studies in guanidine·HCl. By both techniques the polypeptide chains appeared to be homogeneous, and reduction followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide has no effect on the apparent molecular weight. Since Neurospora glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is under the control of three unlinked genes, nonidentity of the polypeptide chains is indicated. Although the reduced and alkylated subunits are identical electrophoretically, two to three bands of protein were separable in preliminary electrofocusing studies. NADP influences the size of the native enzyme. Increasing concentrations of the cofactor convert mixtures of tetramers and dimers to tetramers with a concomitant increase in specific activity. The enzyme was estimated to consist of 72% tetramers at 2 x 10-5 m NADP, 92% at 2 x 10-4 m NADP, and 100% at 2 mm NADP. It is suggested that NADP-mediated changes in the aggregation state and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase may be involved in the in vivo regulation of the enzyme activity, and in the pleiotropic effects of mutant glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1499465438,"Abstract Subcutaneous administration of l-thyroxine (75 µg/100 g of body weight per day) to rats for 10 to 14 days caused a decrease in the activity of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase to about 50% of the control value. Enzymic properties of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase of mitochondrial outer membrane preparations isolated from normal and l-thyroxine-treated rats were almost identical, suggesting that l-thyroxine acted by controlling the amount rather than the structure of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase. Analyses of the time course of changes in enzyme activities following the institution and withdrawal of l-thyroxine indicated that the decreased level of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase was caused by a decreased synthesis of the enzyme, rather than an increased degradation. In contrast, the activity of kynurenine aminotransferase localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane was increased about 1½ times by l-thyroxine administration. This l-thyroxine-induced rise in kynurenine aminotransferase activity was completely inhibited by ethionine or cycloheximide, suggesting that l-thyroxine induced the de novo synthesis of kynurenine aminotransferase. Kynurenine hydrolase, an extramitochondrial enzyme, was not affected however by the hormone. These enzyme patterns observed in hyperthyroid rats were consistent with the urinary levels of kynurenine and its metabolites. These results are considered in terms of the NAD(P) synthesis from tryptophan in hyperthyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W1607702097,"Abstract The fatty acid synthetase complex of pigeon liver is completely dissociated to half-molecular weight subunits of either negligible or no enzyme activity in the presence of 35 mm glycine, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 8.3 (µ = 0.008). This dissociation and loss of enzyme activity can be prevented by the addition of 0.2 m KCl or 20 µm NADPH to the above incubation medium. The addition of NADH at either low (20 µm) or high (1.0 mm) concentrations has no effect on the rate of dissociation of the complex, whereas adenosine 2'-monophosphoric acid at 1.0 mm protects the enzyme slightly against inactivation. Adenosine 3'-monophosphoric acid has no protective effect. Reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide (1.0 mm), either alone or in association with adenosine 2'-monophosphoric acid (1.0 mm), also has no effect. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate (0.5 mm and 2.0 mm) considerably enhances the stability of the fatty acid synthetase complex at a low ionic strength. This effect is not due to an increase in ionic strength contributed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The latter compound does not compete with NADPH for binding sites on the enzyme. In contrast to NADPH, coenzyme A and dephospho-CoA increase the rate of inactivation of the complex possibly as a result of the formation of mixed disulfides with sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient of the fatty acid synthetase complex in low ionic strength buffer is increased by NADPH (from 11.8 S in the absence to 12.9 S in the presence of 0.3 mm NADPH). This effect appears to result from a partial alteration in the structure of the complex. The structure of the enzyme also appears to be modified by increasing the pH, even at high ionic strengths. The slope of plots of the reciprocal of the sedimentation coefficient against protein concentration is increased 4-fold in going from pH 7.0 to pH 8.3 in 0.2 m potassium phosphate. The results reported in this paper are discussed in relation to the stability and integrity of the enzyme complex and the type of forces which may hold the subunits of the complex together. The possibility of NADPH and CoA acting as metabolic regulators of fatty acid synthesis through their effect on the stability of the complex has been considered."

https://openalex.org/W1509422238,"Abstract The pathway of l-sorbose metabolism in Aerobacter aerogenes was determined to be: l-sorbose → l-sorbose 1-phosphate → d-glucitol 6-phosphate → d-fructose 6-phosphate. Phosphorylation of l-sorbose at C-1 is mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, whereas l-sorbose 1-phosphate reduction and d-glucitol 6-phosphate oxidation are mediated by pyridine-nucleotidelinked dehydrogenases. Mutants deficient in l-sorbose 1-phosphate reductase, d-glucitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or a component (Enzyme I) of the phosphotransferase system did not grow on l-sorbose, whereas revertants which had regained these activities grew normally. Extracts of the Enzyme I-deficient mutant failed to catalyze the phosphorylation of l-sorbose with phosphoenolpyruvate, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate could not replace the phosphoenolpyruvate requirement for l-sorbose phosphorylation in extracts of the wild type strain."
https://openalex.org/W1550154378,"Abstract The mechanism of action of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida, strain M-6, has been investigated. The aromatic substrate analogues, benzoate, p-fluorobenzoate, p-chlorobenzoate, p-nitrobenzoate, p-aminobenzoate, and 6-hydroxynicotinate, are found to be competitive inhibitors. This finding differs from the previously reported noncompetitive behavior in a different buffer system. The optical activity of the enzyme-inhibitor complex has been studied. From the kinetic and circular dichroism (CD) measurements, we have found that the carboxyl moiety is necessary and sufficient for the enzyme-substrate binding, whereas the hydroxyl group alone will not lead to binding. There are two classes of inhibitory analogues: one causes changes in CD spectra of the enzyme similar to those evoked by the substrate, and the other does not cause significant changes. The results indicate that more than one mode of enzyme-inhibitor interaction is involved. The CD of the enzyme-NADPH complex under anaerobic conditions suggests that the oxidized enzyme and reduced pyridine nucleotide form a complex, both in the absence and presence of the substrate, p-hydroxybenzoate. Furthermore, evidence for a ternary complex is given."
https://openalex.org/W1584121388,"Abstract Theoretical and experimental results are presented to illustrate the applicability of equilibrium rate measurements by isotope exchange to the understanding of the effect of modifiers on enzymic catalysis. A table summarizes the expected theoretical patterns for a two-substrate, two-product system with random substrate addition and ternary complex interconversion. Such patterns are used as a first approximation model for interpreting rate measurements with Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase for the glutamate ⇄ glutamine, ATP ⇄ Pi, NH3 ⇄ glutamine, and Oglutamate ⇄ Opi exchanges. These measurements with nine different modifiers showed strikingly different inhibitory patterns, including apparent complete block of chemical interconversion, and differential interference with various substrate-binding and release steps. A new type of modifier action by GDP and AMP is reported, in which the glutamate ⇄ glutamine exchange is unimpaired but the ATP ⇄ Pi exchange is completely inhibited. This is interpreted as a cryptic catalysis in which the modifier prevents dissociation of the ATP, but still allows the rapid chemical interconversion of bound substrates and rapid exchange between the NH3-glutamine and glutamate-glutamine pools, as well as 18O between glutamate and Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1525263001,"Abstract A 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity has been demonstrated in the microsomal preparations made from the skin of newborn rats. The enzyme prefers NAD to NADP as the coenzyme and utilizes 17β-estradiol as well as testosterone as substrates. The apparent Km values estimated for 17β-estradiol are 4.1 x 10-6 m, for estrone 1.0 x 10-5 m, and for testosterone 4.0 x 10-6 m. The enzyme can be stabilized by 10 to 20% by volume of glycerol when stored at -10° in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. 17β-Estradiol and testosterone have been shown to inhibit each other in the enzymic dehydrogenation at C-17, and kinetic data are compatible with the explanation that these steroids probably compete with each other on the same enzyme site. A number of other steroids have been tested for their inhibitory effects on the conversion of [4-14C]17β-estradiol into [4-14C]estrone by the enzyme preparation. Of these, 4-androstene-3β,17β-diol, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and 19-nortestosterone are effective inhibitors, whereas epitestosterone and 17α-hydroxy-progesterone are poor inhibitors, and androstene-3,17-dione, cortisone, and cortisol are not inhibitors. A common structural feature of the effective inhibitors is the presence of a 17β-hydroxyl group; the structure in ring A and the presence of the 19-methyl group do not seem to be critical for the inhibitory effect. The structural features of these inhibitors are quite different from those for steroid inhibitors of the 5α-reductase of testosterone and progesterone in the microsomes of human skin (Voigt, W., et al. (1970) J. Biol. Chem., 245, 5594), implying that the topographical features at the binding sites for steroids on the surface of the two enzymes are quite different."
https://openalex.org/W131116266,"Abstract The pyridine nucleotide-mediated reduction of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose (GDP-4-keto-d-rhamnose) as catalyzed by extracts of soil bacterium GS (ATCC 19241) has been investigated with the use of 200- to 400-fold purified GDP-4-keto-d-rhamnose reductase. The results of these investigations suggest that a single enzyme protein is responsible for the formation of both C-4 epimers, GDP-d-rhamnose and GDP-d-talomethylose. Experiments with GDP-d-[14C]rhamnose exclude interconversion of the sugar nucleotide epimers by means of a GDP-d-rhamnose-4-epimerase. Thus, their formation appears to result from separate reductive reactions in which either GDP-d-rhamnose or GDP-d-talomethylose is produced, depending upon the orientation of the pyranose ring with respect to the reducing hydrogen atom. In experiments with stereospecifically labeled [4-3H]TPNH, it has been possible to show the quantitative transfer of tritium from [4B-3H]TPNH to the rhamnose and talomethylose moieties of GDP-d-rhamnose and GDP-d-talomethylose. Hence, while location of tritium at C-4 of the 6-deoxyhexose is assumed, it appears that a single enzyme transfers hydrogen from the 4B position of TPNH to either side of the pyranose ring at the C-4 carbonyl function of GDP-4-keto-d-rhamnose. This is the first description of a pyridine nucleotide oxidoreductase which lacks precise stereoselectivity with respect to its hydrogen receptor carbonyl function."
https://openalex.org/W1593101913,"Abstract The effect of mercaptopyridethyl benzimidazole on glucocorticoid-mediated tyrosine aminotransferase induction in cultured hepatoma cells was examined and compared with the action of actinomycin D. In this system mercaptopyridethyl benzimidazole rapidly inhibits RNA synthesis as judged by diminished rates of RNA precursor incorporation, and when administered at the same time as the steroid inducer, inhibits the glucocorticoid induction of tyrosine aminotransferase. Upon removal of inducer (deinduction) from a previously induced culture, mercaptopyridethyl benzimidazole, like actinomycin D, prevents the fall in the concentration of the induced enzyme. If mercaptopyridethyl benzimidazole or actinomycin D is administered at various intervals after deinduction, the synthesis of the induced enzyme can be reactivated. Mercaptopyridethyl benzimidazole has no discernible effect on the rate of turnover of the induced enzyme. These results are interpreted in terms of a model involving a labile post-transcriptional repressor of the translation of the messenger RNA for tyrosine aminotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1615154137,"Abstract When development is initiated in Dictyostelium discoideum by the removal of exogenous energy sources, there is an increase in the specific activity of tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase EC 2.6.1.5). The enzyme was partially purified from crude extracts of developed cells and shown to be specific for l-tyrosine among aromatic amino acids. The increase in specific activity which occurs 8 hours after the initiation of development appears to result from de novo synthesis of the enzyme rather than from activation of latent activity. Experiments with actinomycin D suggest that synthesis of tyrosine transaminase depends on prior RNA synthesis. Analysis of the kinetics of accumulation of tyrosine transaminase in a series of morphologically and temporally deranged mutant strains indicates that both the synthesis and subsequent partial inactivation of this enzyme are developmentally regulated in D. discoideum."

https://openalex.org/W1547243584,"Abstract l-Tryptophan, l-5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and other indole amines increase tyrosine aminotransferase activity in mice liver. l-5-Hydroxytryptophan was as effective as serotonin, whereas l-tryptophan was far less effective at low doses. If inhibitors of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase were injected prior to the administration of indole compounds, the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity by 5-hydroxytryptophan or tryptophan was completely blocked, whereas the increase by serotonin was not reduced. On the other hand, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor enhanced the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity by serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptophan. These results indicate that indole amines are the active agents in the increase of enzyme level. Among various indole amines, serotonin, 5-methoxytryptamine, and tryptamine were effective in increasing the enzyme activity. Although the increase in the enzyme activity was partially mediated by adrenal hormones, these indole amines could increase tyrosine aminotransferase activity in adrenalectomized mice. Cycloheximide blocked the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity by serotonin, indicating that the increase is due to induction of new enzyme. The results suggest a possible role of indole amines in the regulation of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1566249627,"Abstract A nucleotide pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.9) has been purified from extracts of the hybrid yeast, Saccharomyces fragilis x Saccharomyces dobzhanskii, to an extent where it appears homogeneous by ultracentrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Multiple protein components seen on polyacrylamide and starch gel electrophoresis also exhibit enzyme activity. Ultracentrifugation, Sephadex gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis all gave a molecular weight of approximately 65,000 for the enzyme, the electrophoresis results indicating also that the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain. Substrates for the enzyme include several sugar nucleotides (including GDP-mannose and UDP-glucose), pyridine nucleotide coenzymes, and the synthetic substrate, thymidine 5'-p-nitrophenylphosphate. Substrate competition experiments and similar inhibition of hydrolysis of different substrates by metal ion binding agents indicate that a single catalytic site is involved in the hydrolysis of the numerous substrates. No nucleotidase, endonuclease, or exonuclease activities were detectable with the purified enzyme, thus distinguishing it from other yeast and mammalian nucleotide pyrophosphatases which also exhibit nucleotidase and/or exonuclease (phosphodiesterase) activity. The enzyme as isolated does not require addition of any cations for maximal activity, but is strongly inhibited in the presence of metal-binding agents. This inhibition can be reversed by addition of zinc salts or other metal ions, suggesting that protein-bound metal ion is necessary to catalytic activity."
