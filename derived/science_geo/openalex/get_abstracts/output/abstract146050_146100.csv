https://openalex.org/W1965569618,"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to human immunodeficiency virus arise early after infection, but ultimately fail to prevent progression to AIDS. Human immunodeficiency virus may evade the CTL response by accumulating amino-acid replacements within CTL epitopes. We studied 10 CTL epitopes during the course of simian immunodeficiency virus disease progression in three related macaques. All 10 of these CTL epitopes accumulated amino-acid replacements and showed evidence of positive selection by the time the macaques died. Many of the amino-acid replacements in these epitopes reduced or eliminated major histocompatibility complex class I binding and/or CTL recognition. These findings strongly support the CTL 'escape' hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W1509992306,"The use of transgenic crops has generated concerns about transgene movement to unintended hosts and the associated ecological consequences. Moreover, the in-field monitoring of transgene expression is of practical concern (e.g., the underexpression of an herbicide tolerance gene in crop plants that are due to be sprayed with herbicide). A solution to these potential problems is to monitor the presence and expression of an agronomically important gene by linking it to a marker gene, such as GFP. Here we show that GFP fluorescence can indicate expression of the Bacillus thuringiensus cry1Ac gene when co-introduced into tobacco and oilseed rape, as demonstrated by insect bioassays and western blot analysis. Furthermore we conducted two seasons of field experiments to characterize the performance of three different GFP genes in transgenic tobacco. The best gene tested was mGFP5er, a mutagenized GFP gene that is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated that host plants synthesizing GFP in the field suffered no fitness costs."

The error appears to have been a result of a compression introducing a frameshift and of the ING1 gene encoding several differentially spliced isoforms that contain a common 3′ exon, one of whichis of a size very similar to that reported in the publication above."

The reasonthe drug at the center of the fight, Deferiprone, was approved in Europe this August and is now headed for Olivieri's backyard, Canada."

Historically, the use of public funds by universities has never been subjected to rigorous examinationa factor that has contributed to improper use of those funds."
https://openalex.org/W2048775751,"US President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are interested in ensuring that scientists have free access to the data emerging from human genome research. But they are not about to sign a formal trade agreement that would, in effect, bar private companies from snapping up genome-related patents, as suggested in a 20 September report in the London-based Guardian newspaper. The White House flatly denied the suggestion when contacted by Nature Medicine."

They say that, unlike other industrialized nations, Japan lacks guidelines on reproductive medicine with which to legislate against cloning."
