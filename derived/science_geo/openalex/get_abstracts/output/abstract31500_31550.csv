https://openalex.org/W2145890122,"Intraperitoneal administration of human recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) to rats can increase blood levels of corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The route by which IL-1 affects pituitary-adrenal activity is unknown. That the IL-1-induced pituitary-adrenal activation involves an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is indicated by three lines of evidence. First, immunoneutralization of CRF markedly attenuated the IL-1-induced increase of ACTH blood levels. Second, after blockade of fast axonal transport in hypothalamic neurons by colchicine, IL-1 administration decreased the CRF immunostaining in the median eminence, indicating an enhanced release of CRF in response to IL-1. Third, IL-1 did not stimulate ACTH release from primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. These data further support the notion of the existence of an immunoregulatory feedback circuit between the immune system and the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2053636966,"The scrapie (PrPSc) and cellular (PrPC) prion proteins are encoded by the same gene, and their different properties are thought to arise from posttranslational modifications. We have found a phosphatidylinositol glycolipid on both PrPC and PrP 27-30 (derived from PrPSc by limited proteolysis at the amino terminus). Ethanolamine, myo-inositol, phosphate, and stearic acid were identified as glycolipid components of gel-purified PrP 27-30. PrP 27-30 contains 2.8 moles of ethanolamine per mole. Incubation of PrP 27-30 with a bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) releases covalently bound stearic acid, and allows PrP 27-30 to react with antiserum specific for the PIPLC-digested glycolipid linked to the carboxyl terminus of the trypanosomal variant surface glycoprotein. PIPLC catalyzes the release of PrPC from cultured mammalian cells into the medium. These observations indicate that PrPC is anchored to the cell surface by the glycolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1983031935,"The role of polypeptide growth factors in the processes of inflammation and repair was investigated by analyzing the influence of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), applied directly to linear incisions made through rat dorsal skin. A dose-dependent, direct stimulatory effect of a single application of TGF-beta on the breaking strength of healing incisional wounds was demonstrated. An increase in maximum wound strength of 220 percent of control was observed at 5 days; the healing rate was accelerated by approximately 3 days for at least 14 days after production of the wound and application of TGF-beta. These increases in wound strength were accompanied by an increased influx of mononuclear cells and fibroblasts and by marked increases in collagen deposition at the site of application of TGF-beta. TGF-beta is thus a potent pharmacologic agent that can accelerate wound healing in rats."
https://openalex.org/W1999160850,"Intracortical infusion of the ""N-methyl-D-aspartate"" (NMDA) receptor blocker D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) renders kitten striate cortex resistant to the effects of monocular deprivation. In addition, 1 week of continuous APV treatment (50 nanomoles per hour) produces a striking loss of orientation selectivity in area 17. These data support the hypothesis that crucial variables for the expression of activity-dependent synaptic modifications are a critical level of postsynaptic activation and calcium entry through ion channels linked to NMDA receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2031928161,"A DNA sequencing system based on the use of a novel set of four chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides, each carrying a different chemically tuned succinylfluorescein dye distinguished by its fluorescent emission is described. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase is used in a modified dideoxy DNA sequencing protocol to produce a complete set of fluorescence-tagged fragments in one reaction mixture. These DNA fragments are resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in one sequencing lane and are identified by a fluorescence detection system specifically matched to the emission characteristics of this dye set. A scanning system allows multiple samples to be run simultaneously and computer-based automatic base sequence identifications to be made. The sequence analysis of M13 phage DNA made with this system is described."
https://openalex.org/W1560768456,"The biological latency of serum transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was shown to be due to the interaction of TGF-beta with a specific serum binding protein. This binding protein was affinity labeled with 125I-TGF-beta, and its Mr and subunit structure were determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. Its Mr is reminiscent of that of the serum protease inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). Immunoprecipitation of the 125I-TGF-beta-binding protein complex by a specific anti-alpha 2M antibody, and the formation of identical complexes between 125I-TGF-beta and purified alpha 2M, confirmed that alpha 2M is the TGF-beta-binding protein in serum. Immunoblot analysis showed that endogenous serum TGF-beta is also bound to alpha 2M. However, in contrast to added 125I-TGF-beta, the majority of the endogenous TGF-beta is linked to alpha 2M covalently. Alpha 2M and acid-activated TGF-beta co-eluted from a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography column, confirming that the interaction of TGF-beta with alpha 2M accounts for the latency of serum TGF-beta. It is proposed that alpha 2M may serve an important multifunctional role at sites of inflammation by scavenging both active peptides and proteases that are released by platelets at the site of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2020024927,"In heart, glycolysis may be a preferential source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for membrane functions. In this study the patch-clamp technique was used to study potassium channels sensitive to intracellular ATP levels in permeabilized ventricular myocytes. Activation of these K+ channels has been implicated in marked cellular K+ loss leading to electrophysiological abnormalities and arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia. The results showed that glycolysis was more effective than oxidative phosphorylation in preventing ATP-sensitive K+ channels from opening. Experiments in excised inside-out patches suggested that key glycolytic enzymes located in the membrane or adjacent cytoskeleton near the channels may account for their preference for glycolytic ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2026447477,"Calcium influx is often an essential intermediate step for the release of neurotransmitter. However, some retinal neurons appear to release transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium influx. It was uncertain whether depolarization released calcium from an intracellular store or released transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium. The possibility that voltage, and not calcium, can regulate the release of transmitter was studied with pairs of solitary retinal neurons. Horizontal and bipolar cells were isolated from fish retinas and juxtaposed in culture. Communication between them was studied with electrophysiological methods. A horizontal cell released its neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid, when depolarized during conditions that buffered the internal calcium concentration and prohibited calcium entry. The speed and amount of material released were sufficient for a contribution to synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2050603236,"A group of proteins anchored to the cell by phosphatidylinositol (PI) has recently been identified. The significance of this new class of membrane anchor is unknown; one possibility is that it facilitates release of the molecule by phospholipases. In fact, phospholipase C enzymes specific for the complex carboxyl-terminal glycolipids of these proteins have been isolated from African trypanosomes and from hepatocyte plasma membranes. This study reports the discovery of a glycan-PI-specific phospholipase D in human serum that cleaves both the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes and its glycolipid precursor, but not phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylinositol. Decay-accelerating factor, another PI-anchored molecule, is also cleaved by the enzyme and converted from a hydrophobic to a soluble protein. The enzyme is Ca2+-dependent, heat labile, and not affected by the inhibitor of serine proteases, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Its function is not known, but the present findings indicate that it participates in the metabolism of glycolipid-anchored membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2038081918,"The variant specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes of T. brucei are expressed in telomeric expression sites. We have determined the structure of the active site in trypanosome variant 221a, which contains VSG gene 221, by analysis of cloned DNA segments that represent 65 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the VSG gene. In nuclear run-on experiments, 57 kb of adjacent sequences are cotranscribed with the VSG gene at approximately similar rates and in the alpha-amanitin-resistant manner characteristic of VSG genes. Besides the VSG mRNA, this expression site yields at least seven stable RNAs, suggesting that it is a multicistronic transcription unit. Our results also show that insertion of a transcriptional terminator is not the general mechanism of switching off expression sites."
https://openalex.org/W1623800398,"Stimulation of P2-purinergic receptors by ATP resulted in activation of phosphorylase, which was associated with marked production of inositol trisphosphate (Ins-P3), in rat hepatocytes. ATP also inhibited forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. On the contrary, adenosine or AMP never inhibited the cAMP accumulation, but increased hepatocyte cAMP; the stimulation was antagonized by a methylxanthine. Thus, P1-purinergic receptors are linked to adenylate cyclase in a stimulatory fashion in hepatocytes. Various kinds of purine nucleotides stimulating P2-receptors can be divided into two groups on the basis of their relative abilities to stimulate Ins-P3 production and to inhibit cAMP accumulation; the first group including adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), ADP, 5-adenylyl imidodiphosphate, GTP, and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) has an efficacy similar to that of ATP, and the second group of nucleotides including alpha, beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate, beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (App(CH)2)p), and GDP exerts considerable inhibitory effects on cAMP accumulation, but only slight effects on inositol lipid metabolism. Treatment of hepatocytes with islet-activating protein, pertussis toxin, blocked the nucleotide-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation, but exerted only a small effect on Ins-P3 production. In membranes prepared from hepatocytes, forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase was inhibited by GTP. This GTP-induced inhibition of the enzyme was susceptible to islet-activating protein and dependent on the concentration of ATP (or its derivatives, ATP gamma S or App(CH2)p). It is concluded that there are two types of P2-purinergic receptors: one is linked to adenylate cyclase via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi) and the other is linked to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W2166347628,"We have utilized protein synthesis inhibitors to investigate the autoregulatory mechanism that uses the concentration of unpolymerized tubulin subunits to specify tubulin mRNA content in animal cells. Puromycin and pactamycin, both of which remove RNAs from polysomes, completely unlink tubulin RNA content from the level of free subunits, whereas pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, which traps mRNAs onto stalled polyribosomes, enhances the specific degradation of tubulin RNAs in response to increases in the subunit content. Moreover, in the absence of protein synthesis inhibitors, the tubulin RNAs that are lost from cells with elevated free tubulin subunit levels are those that are associated with polyribosomes. Further, beta-tubulin mRNAs encoding a truncated translation product of only 26 amino acids (and that cannot be polyribosomal) are not substrates for autoregulation. We conclude that autoregulation of tubulin synthesis is achieved by specifically altering the stability of tubulin RNAs that are bound to polyribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1573864704,"Antibodies to the alpha and beta 2 subunits and site-directed antibodies that distinguish alpha subunits of the RI and RII subtypes have been used to study the biosynthesis and assembly of sodium channels. The RII sodium channel subtype is preferentially expressed in rat brain neurons in primary cell culture. Post-translational processing of alpha subunits includes incorporation of palmityl residues in thioester linkage and sulfate residues attached to oligosaccharides. The incorporation of [3H] palmitate into alpha subunits is inhibited by tunicamycin, indicating that it occurs in the early stages of biosynthesis but after co-translational glycosylation. Mature alpha subunits are attached to beta 2 subunits through disulfide bonds within 1 h after synthesis and up to 30% can be specifically immunoprecipitated from the cell surface with antibodies against the beta 2 subunits by 4 h after synthesis. The remaining alpha subunits remain in an intracellular pool. The alpha subunits synthesized in the presence of castanospermine and swainsonine have reduced apparent size. Castanospermine prevents incorporation of approximately 81% of the sialic acid of the alpha subunit and inhibits sulfation but not palmitylation. Although inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin blocks assembly of functional sodium channels, castanospermine and swainsonine do not prevent the covalent assembly of alpha and beta 2 subunits or the transport of alpha beta 2 complexes to the cell surface, and sodium channels synthesized under these conditions have normal affinity for saxitoxin. Thus, the extensive processing and terminal sialylation of oligosaccharide chains during maturation of the alpha subunit is not essential. A kinetic model for biosynthesis, processing, and assembly of sodium channel subunits is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1579126107,"Single rat lactotroph cells were studied after loading with the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) indicator fura-2 either 1 or 3 days after cell dispersion. Under unstimulated conditions, two groups of lactotrophs were observed, the first (predominant at day 1) with large [Ca2+]i fluctuations (peaks up to 300 nM) probably due to spontaneous action potentials and the second (predominant at 3 days) with stable [Ca2+]i (values variable between 65 and 200 nM). The effect of dopamine on the resting [Ca2+]i was different in the two groups. Even at high dopamine concentrations, no change occurred in the second group; whereas in the first, disappearance of fluctuations and marked decrease of [Ca2+]i were observed. These effects of dopamine appear to be due to hyperpolarization that was demonstrated by the use of a specific fluorescent indicator, bis(oxonol). Two types of triggered [Ca2+]i transients were studied in detail: those due to redistribution of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores (induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone) and those due to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (induced by high [K+]). Dopamine (1 microM) markedly inhibited both these transients by the action of D2 receptors (blocked by 1-sulpiride and domperidone). All effects of dopamine were prevented by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of one (or more) GTP-binding protein(s). Another consequence of D2 receptor activation is the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Treatments (cholera toxin, forskolin), known to raise cAMP levels, were found to dissociate the effects of dopamine on [Ca2+]i inasmuch as they markedly relieved the inhibition of the redistributive transients by thyrotropin-releasing hormone but left hyperpolarization and inhibition of K+ transients unaffected. The spectrum of intracellular signals elicited by the activation of D2 receptors is therefore complex and includes at least two mechanisms that involve [Ca2+]i, one related and the other independent of the decrease of cAMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W2114276844,"A 1,4-dihydropyridine- and phenylalkylamine-binding polypeptide has been identified by photoaffinity labeling of purified rabbit and guinea pig skeletal muscle calcium channel preparations. The arylazide ligands (-)-[3H]azidopine and (-)-5-[(3-azidophenethyl)[N-methyl-3H]methylamino]-2-(3,4,5- trimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropylvaleronitrile [(N-methyl-3H]LU 49888) were used to label 1,4-dihydropyridine- and phenylalkylamine-binding sites, respectively. A single, 155 to 170-kDa polypeptide was specifically labeled by both ligands in rabbit and guinea pig preparations provided that the skeletal muscle membranes used for purification were derived from fresh and not previously frozen and thawed tissue. The photoaffinity labeled polypeptide (termed here alpha 1) is different from the previously described alpha subunit in that it has the identical electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels irrespective of pretreatment either with N-ethylmaleimide or with dithiothreitol. The use of transverse tubular membranes isolated from previously frozen and thawed skeletal muscle results in a purified calcium channel preparation devoid of the alpha 1 subunit. In these preparations proteolytic degradation products of alpha 1 are labeled with both (-)-[3H]azidopine and [N-methyl-3H]LU 49888. Another large molecular weight polypeptide (termed here alpha 2) was also present in every purified calcium channel preparation studied. alpha 2 is distinct from alpha 1 in that reduction with dithiothreitol changes its apparent mass from 160-190 to 130-150 kDa. The alpha 2 subunit is not photoaffinity labeled either with (-)-[3H]azidopine or [N-methyl-3H]LU 49888. These data suggest that two distinct high molecular weight polypeptides (termed alpha 1 and alpha 2) are putative subunits of skeletal muscle calcium channels. Only the alpha 1 subunit contains both 1,4-dihydropyridine and phenylalkylamine receptors. alpha 2 is the same as the previously described alpha subunit (Curtis, B. M., and Catterall, W. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2113-2118), but is neither a 1,4-dihydropyridine- nor a phenylalkylamine-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1570911552,"We have investigated the role of dihydrofolate (H2PteGlu) accumulation in the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by methotrexate (MTX) in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that cytotoxic concentrations of MTX that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase produce only minimal depletion of the reduced folate cofactor, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, required for purine synthesis. At the same time, de novo purine synthesis is totally inhibited. In these studies, we show that 10 microM MTX causes inhibition of purine synthesis at the step of phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide (AICAR) transformylase, as reflected in a 2-3-fold expansion of the intracellular AICAR pool. The inhibition of purine synthesis coincides with the rapid intracellular accumulation of H2PteGlu, a known inhibitor of AICAR transformylase. When the generation of H2PteGlu is blocked by pretreatment with 50 microM 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd), an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, MTX no longer causes inhibition of purine synthesis. Intermediate levels of H2PteGlu produced in the presence of lower (0.1-10 microM) concentrations of FdUrd led to proportional inhibition of purine biosynthesis, and the exogenous addition of H2PteGlu to breast cells in culture re-established the block in purine synthesis in the presence of FdUrd and MTX. The early phases of inhibition of purine biosynthesis could be ascribed only to H2PteGlu accumulation. MTX polyglutamates, also known to inhibit AICAR transformylase, were present in breast cells only after 6 h of incubation with the parent compounds and were not formed in cells preincubated with FdUrd. The lipid-soluble antifolate trimetrexate, which does not form polyglutamates, produced modest 10-formyltetrahydrofolate depletion, but caused marked H2PteGlu accumulation and a parallel inhibition of purine biosynthesis. This evidence leads to the conclusion that MTX and the lipid-soluble analog trimetrexate cause inhibition of purine biosynthesis through the accumulation of H2PteGlu behind the blocked dihydrofolate reductase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1509629462,"The cell surface receptor for hyaluronate is an integral membrane glycoprotein of Mr 85,000 (Underhill, C. B., Thurn, A. L., and Lacy, B. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8128-8133), which appears to be associated with actin filaments. This protein is similar in many respects to another protein, termed gp85, which was originally identified by Tarone, G., Ferracini, R., Galeto, G., and Comoglio, P. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 512-519), using a monoclonal antibody designated as K-3. The gp85 is also a membrane glycoprotein of Mr 85,000 which is associated with the cytoskeleton. Indeed, immunohistological staining has shown that it is distributed in patches along stress fibers of spread baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. In the present study, we have used the K-3 monoclonal antibody to determine whether gp85 is identical to the hyaluronate receptor. Initial studies showed that the K-3 antibody reacted with material at Mr 85,000 on immunoblots of a purified preparation of the hyaluronate receptor. In addition, the K-3 antibody specifically blocked the binding of [3H]hyaluronate to detergent extracts of the receptor from both BHK and polyoma virus transformed baby hamster kidney (PY-BHK) cells, as well as to intact PY-BHK cells. These results indicate that the K-3 antibody is directed against the hyaluronate receptor, which therefore must be identical to gp85. The K-3 antibody was then used to determine the relative number of hyaluronate receptors associated with parent (BHK) and transformed (PY-BHK) cells. Using an enzyme-linked assay, we found that parent cells had a substantially greater number of receptors than their transformed counterparts. These results were consistent with those obtained when detergent extracts of cells were directly assayed for [3H]hyaluronate binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1555616557,"Both substance P and carbachol produced increases in inositol tris- and tetrakisphosphate and increased cytosolic free [Ca2+] in dispersed parotid acinar cells loaded with fura-2. The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to each agonist was due to a combination of mobilization of internal Ca2+ and entry of extracellular Ca2+. Kinetic studies of the initial response to substance P, and measurement of peak [Ca2+]i, demonstrated that the initial rapid rise in [Ca2+]i was due to both internal release and entry of Ca2+. Substance P could evoke a greater initial increase in [Ca2+]i and inositol trisphosphate than could carbachol. However, after 1 min in the presence of external Ca2+, the maintained [Ca2+]i level in response to substance P was considerably smaller than that seen with carbachol, an effect apparently due to homologous desensitization of the substance P receptor. The two agonists each produced a similar 4-5-fold increase in inositol tetrakisphosphate levels within 30 s; this level was maintained in the presence of carbachol, but decreased with substance P. Similarly, the level of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate decreased after prolonged incubation with substance P. Thus, the maintained level of [Ca2+]i, and by deduction Ca2+ entry, correlated with the levels of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate; a result consistent with a possible role for these inositol phosphates in the control of receptor-mediated Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1982389510,"We have studied the relationship between major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted antigen recognition and alloreactivity by examining T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta gene expression in cytochrome c-specific, Ek alpha:Ek beta (Ek)-restricted helper T cell clones derived from B10.A mice. The clones could be segregated on the basis of four distinct alloreactivity patterns. Clones cross-reactive for three different allogeneic la molecules (As alpha:As beta [As], Ab alpha:Ab beta [Ab], Ek alpha: Eb beta [Eb]) expressed the same V alpha and V beta gene segments, generating the distinct alloreactive specificities via unique V alpha-J alpha and V beta-D beta-J beta joining events. Ek alpha:Es beta (Es)-alloreactive B10.A clones expressed the same V alpha, J alpha, and V beta segments as an Es-restricted, Ek-alloreactive, cytochrome c-specific, H-2-congenic B10.S(9R) clone. This homology between TCRs mediating allorecognition of la molecules and recognition of the same la molecules as restriction elements associated with nominal antigen suggests that MHC-restricted recognition and allorecognition represent differences in the affinity of the TCR-MHC molecule interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1487439310,"The control of RNA degradation by amino acids, insulin, and glucagon was investigated in perfused livers of fed rats previously labeled in vivo with [6-14C] orotic acid; rates were determined from the release of [14C]cytidine in the presence of 0.5 mM cytidine to suppress reutilization. Studies with cyclically perfused livers showed that plasma amino acids at 10 times (10X) normal concentrations inhibited RNA breakdown by 85%. Similar inhibition was obtained with a known regulatory amino acid mixture (Leu, Met, Pro, Trp, and His), whereas leucine alone (0.8 mM) decreased degradation by 47%. Perfusions carried out in the single-pass mode with graded levels of plasma amino acids revealed that the acceleration of RNA degradation over the full range of amino acid deprivation (0 to 10X normal levels) was the same as that for protein breakdown (3.19 and 3.15% h-1, respectively), and both were equally suppressed by insulin (2.4 micrograms h-1). Glucagon (10 micrograms h-1), though, was far less effective in stimulating RNA than protein turnover. A direct comparison of the two dose responses revealed a strong dissociation at 1 and 2 times normal amino acid levels. These findings support the notion that RNA and protein are degraded within a single macroautophagic compartment during amino acid and insulin deprivation. Glucagon, however, appeared to induce a second pathway in which the proportion of sequestered RNA to protein was selectively reduced. Electron micrographs showed that the ratio of vacuoles containing rough as compared with smooth endoplasmic reticulum was decreased by nearly 80% under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1596689262,"Rat brain myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) is known to contain long chain, covalently bound fatty acids. In the course of characterizing the mechanism of acylation, we found that the isolated PLP, in the absence of any membrane fraction, was esterified after incubation with [3H]palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA). This observation demonstrated that the protein acts as both an acylating enzyme and an acceptor. Thus, acylation occurs by an autocatalytic process. The possibility of a separate acyltransferase that copurifies with PLP was essentially excluded by adding brain subcellular fractions to the reaction mixtures and by changing the isolation procedure. After deacylation, the protein was acylated at a 4-fold greater rate, suggesting that the original sites were reacylated. The palmitoyl-CoA concentration followed Michaelis kinetics, confirming that spontaneous acylation was not occurring. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the reaction entails net addition of acyl groups. Although fatty acids are bound via an O-ester linkage, free SH groups are required in the reaction. Denaturation of the protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate or heat inhibits the reaction, whereas cerulenin has little or no effect. PO, the major protein in peripheral nerve myelin, is also an acylated protein, but it was not labeled upon incubation of either peripheral myelin or the isolated protein with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, demonstrating that it is acylated by a different route. Several synthetic peptides derived from PLP sequences with sites known to be acylated in vivo as well as a series of deacylated PLP tryptic peptides were not labeled, indicating that integrity of the protein is required for acylation. Limited proteolysis and peptide mapping showed that the same sites are acylated in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that the autocatalytic acylation reaction is physiological."
https://openalex.org/W1524321112,"The effect of aging on the expression of alpha 2u-globulin was studied in liver tissue from 6-30-month-old male Fischer F344 rats. The synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin by suspensions of isolated hepatocytes decreased 90% between 6 and 22 months of age. The levels of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA and the transcription of alpha 2u-globulin genes by isolated liver nuclei decreased 80-85% between 5 and 24 months of age. Because alpha 2u-globulin has been suggested to be a senescence marker protein, the expression of alpha 2u-globulin was measured in rats fed a diet restricted in calories. This dietary restriction procedure has been shown to increase significantly the longevity of rodents. The expression of alpha 2u-globulin was compared in liver tissue from 18-month-old rats fed ad libitum and a restricted diet (40% restriction of total calories). The synthesis, mRNA levels, and transcription of alpha 2u-globulin were 1.8-3-fold higher for liver tissue from restricted rats compared to liver tissue from rats fed ad libitum. Therefore, dietary restriction alters the age-related change in the expression of alpha 2u-globulin. Our results demonstrate that the changes in alpha 2u-globulin expression that arise during aging or dietary restriction are regulated at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1518102216,"Type VII procollagen has been characterized as a product of epithelial cell lines. As secreted, it contains a large triple-helical domain terminated by a multi-globular-domained carboxyl terminus (NC-1), and a smaller amino-terminal globule (NC-2). The triple helix and the NC-1 domain have previously been identified in anchoring fibril-containing tissues by biochemical and immunochemical means, leading to the conclusion that type VII collagen is a major component of anchoring fibrils. In order to better characterize the tissue form of type VII collagen, we have produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies which recognize the NC-1 domain. Peptide mapping of these epitopes indicate that they are independent and span approximately 125,000 kDa of the total 150,000 kDa of each alpha chain contained in NC-1. All these antibodies elicit immunofluorescent staining of the basement membrane zone in tissues. Type VII collagen has been extracted from tissues. As previously reported, it is smaller than type VII procollagen, (Woodley, D. T., Burgeson, R. E., Lunstrum, G. P., Bruckner-Tuderman, L., and Briggaman, R. A., submitted for publication), and we now find that it predominantly occurs as a dimer. Following clostridial collagenase digestion, intact NC-1 has been recognized, indicating that the difference in apparent Mr between the tissue form of the molecule and type VII procollagen results from modification of the amino terminus. The size of the amino-terminal globule has been determined to be between approximately 96 and 102 kDa. Rotary shadowing analyses of extracted molecules indicate that dimeric molecules contain the NC-1 domain, but are missing intact NC-2. We propose that the tissue form monomer, Mr = 960,000, be referred to as “type VII collagen.” These studies strongly suggest that anchoring fibrils contain dimeric molecules with intact NC-1 domains. The data also support the previous suggestion that the NC-2 domain is involved in the formation of disulfide bond-stabilized type VII collagen dimers, and is subsequently removed by physiological proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1548018585,"Abstract This work describes the molecular characterization of a human pancreatic cancer-associated antigen defined by a murine monoclonal antibody (DU-PAN-2). DU-PAN-2 antigen was isolated from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (HPAF) or patient's ascitic fluid, and the antigenic activity was monitored by competitive inhibition radioimmunoassay. Affinity chromatography and CsCl/guanidine HCl density gradient centrifugation were employed to remove other populations of mucin-type glycoproteins and noncovalently associated proteins, respectively. Three electrophoretically distinct components were detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and were resolved by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. The major fraction (FII) was subjected to carbohydrate and amino acid analyses. The sum of threonine, serine, proline, glycine, and alanine comprised more than 50% of the amino acid residues. The saccharide units, O-glycosidically linked to the peptide via GalNAc, contained fucose, galactose, GlcNAc, GalNAc, and sialic acid. The total carbohydrate content of FI and FII was 80.8% and 77.4% by weight, respectively. The molecular weight of FII antigen showed two species of molecules of 1.45 X 10(6) and 4.59 X 10(6) by analytical sedimentation equilibrium. DU-PAN-2 antigen was susceptible to neuraminidase, pepsin, Pronase, and papain digestion. These results suggest that both protein components and sialic acid residues may play important roles in the binding of DU-PAN-2 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1579621903,"An alpha 2-macroglobulin-like protease inhibitor was isolated from the cell-free hemolymph of the american lobster (Homarus americanus) by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Whereas the undissociated molecule has a molecular weight of 342,000 as determined by ultracentrifugation studies, under reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein has a subunit molecular weight of 180,000. On the basis of this and other evidence, we conclude that the lobster protein is a dimer consisting of two disulfide-bonded monomers. The purified protein inhibits proteolytic enzymes but protects the esterolytic activity of trypsin toward low molecular weight substrates from inactivation by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The methylamine sensitivity of this activity suggests the presence of an internal thioester bond. This was confirmed by the covalent incorporation of [14C]methylamine, by the formation of Mr 55,000 and 125,000 autolytic cleavage fragments in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and, more directly, by the amino acid sequence of a tryptic peptide containing the putative thioester region. Whereas the N-terminal amino acid sequence (22 residues) of the protein revealed an overall identity of only 18% when compared with the human protein, the sequence of the thioester-containing peptide was highly conserved, both with respect to human alpha 2-macroglobulin and to other proteins having a thioester bond. The protein showed the slow to fast conformational change typical in alpha 2-macroglobulins in nondenaturing gel electrophoresis after treatment with trypsin, but not after incubation with methylamine."
https://openalex.org/W1552197098,"Protein C, like the other vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins that participate in blood coagulation, except prothrombin, has at least one high affinity calcium-binding site that is independent of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. Calcium binding to this site is required for activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. In an attempt to localize this calcium-binding site, we subjected protein C to limited tryptic digestion. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes a calcium-dependent epitope both in intact protein C, in gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-domainless protein C, and in activated protein C, was used to isolate a fragment from the tryptic digest. The fragment was derived from the light chain of protein C and consisted of the two domains that are homologous to the epidermal growth factor precursor. Half-maximal binding of the intact protein and of the isolated fragment by the antibody occurred at 100-200 microM Ca2+. The results suggest the presence of a Ca2+-binding site in the epidermal growth factor homology region of protein C."
https://openalex.org/W1570546189,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III (Ca2+/CaM kinase III) phosphorylates a protein of Mr = 100,000 (the 100-kDa protein), a major substrate for Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation found in many mammalian tissues and cell lines (Nairn, A.C., Baghat, B., and Palfrey, H.C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 7939-7943). Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) or forskolin resulted in a decrease in the depolarization-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein in intact cells and in a decrease in the Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein in cytosolic extracts. In experiments using cytosolic extracts, the initial effect of NGF on the phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein was observed in less than 1 h, was maximal (70% decrease) after 12 h, and began to recover after 24 h. The effect of forskolin was more rapid and the maximal effect was greater (90-95% decrease). Decreased Ca2+/CaM kinase III activity was also found in PC12 cells treated with epidermal growth factor, 2-chloroadenosine plus isobutylmethylxanthine, or dibutyryl cAMP. The effect of forskolin did not reverse unless it was removed. Cycloheximide blocked the recovery of Ca2+/CaM kinase III activity observed following the removal of forskolin but did not affect the ability of forskolin to reduce kinase activity. Short-term treatment with phorbol ester had little effect on Ca2+/CaM kinase III activity; long-term treatment with phorbol ester, which results in the disappearance of enzymatically detectable protein kinase C, had no effect on the ability of NGF or 2-chloroadenosine to reduce Ca2+/CaM kinase III activity. The level of the 100-kDa protein as determined by immunological techniques was not changed by any treatment. These results suggested that the effect of treatment of PC12 cells with NGF or forskolin was to reduce the level of Ca2+/CaM kinase III per se."

https://openalex.org/W1600339587,"Previous studies of purine nucleotide synthesis de novo have suggested that major regulation of the rate of the pathway is affected at either the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) synthetase reaction or the amidophosphoribosyltransferase (amido PRT) reaction, or both. We studied control of purine synthesis de novo in cultured normal, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT)-deficient, and PP-Rib-P synthetase-superactive human fibroblasts by measuring concentrations and rates of synthesis of PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide end products, proposed effectors of regulation, during inhibition of the pathway. Incubation of cells for 90 min with 0.1 mM azaserine, a glutamine antagonist which specifically blocked the pathway at the level of conversion of formylglycinamide ribotide, resulted in a 5-16% decrease in purine nucleoside triphosphate concentrations but no consistent alteration in generation of PP-Rib-P. During this treatment, however, rates of the early steps of the pathway were increased slightly (9-15%) in normal and HGPRT-deficient strains, more markedly (32-60%) in cells with catalytically superactive PP-Rib-P synthetases, and not at all in fibroblasts with purine nucleotide feedback-resistant PP-Rib-P synthetases. In contrast, glutamine deprivation, which inhibited the pathway at the amido PRT reaction, resulted in time-dependent nucleoside triphosphate pool depletion (26-43% decrease at 24 h) accompanied by increased rates of PP-Rib-P generation and, upon readdition of glutamine, substantial increments in rates of purine synthesis de novo. Enhanced PP-Rib-P generation during glutamine deprivation was greatest in cells with regulatory defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase (2-fold), but purine synthesis in these cells was stimulated only 1.4-fold control rates by glutamine readdition. Stimulation of these processes in normal and HGPRT-deficient cells and in cells with PP-Rib-P synthetase catalytic defects was, respectively: 1.5 and 2.0-fold; 1.5 and 1.7-fold; and 1.6 and 4.1-fold. These studies support the following concepts. 1) Rates of purine synthesis de novo are regulated at both the PP-Rib-P synthetase and amido PRT reactions by end products, with the latter reaction more sensitive to small changes in purine nucleotide inhibitor concentrations. 2) PP-Rib-P exerts its role as a major regulator of purine synthetic rate by virtue of its interaction with nucleotide inhibitors to determine the activity of amido PRT. 3) Activation of amido PRT by PP-Rib-P is nearly maximal at base line in fibroblasts with regulatory defects in PP-Rib-P synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W1535181131,"Chondrogenesis, the differentiation of mesenchyme into cartilage, involves a transition from synthesis of type I to type II collagen. Chicken vertebral chondroblasts contain both type II and alpha 2 type I collagen RNAs but synthesize only type II collagen, suggesting the existence of translational discrimination between these RNAs. The experiments outlined in this report examine the translational control mechanism preventing the synthesis of alpha 2(I) collagen in chondroblasts. Specifically, the alpha 2(I) collagen RNA in the cytoplasm of mature chondroblasts does not appear to be sequestered in ribonucleoprotein particles that could prevent its translation in these cells. Instead, the RNA associates with an average of only three ribosomes; each of these ribosomes appears to be capable of forming at least one peptide bond. However, treatment of chondroblasts with low concentrations of cycloheximide, an elongation inhibitor, suggests movement of the ribosomes on the alpha 2(I) collagen RNA may be partially blocked, resulting in a severe reduction in the translation elongation rate. This translational mechanism may constitute an important regulatory function mediating the cessation of type I collagen synthesis during chondrogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1541905265,"The degradation of RNA in the cyclically perfused rat liver was determined from the release of labeled cytidine from RNA that had been previously labeled with [6-14C]orotic acid in vivo. Because cytidine is not appreciably degraded in rat liver (its deamination to uridine is virtually nil) or produced in significant amounts from free 5'-nucleotides, its release will directly reflect net RNA breakdown. This conclusion was substantiated by the fact that the specific radioactivity of released cytidine equaled that of CMP in RNA and remained unchanged for 180 min of perfusion. The initial rate of [14C]cytidine accumulation was slow, but after 10-20 min it increased abruptly by more than 4-fold and remained virtually constant. The addition of 0.5 mM unlabeled cytidine effectively prevented the reutilization of label and increased the rate of labeled cytidine release by an amount representing 13% of the maximal rate of cytidine accumulation. Rates of RNA degradation, measured between 20 and 60 min in the presence of 0.5 mM unlabeled cytidine, averaged 1.00 +/- 0.05 mg h-1 liver-1 (100-g rat), the equivalent of 65% of total RNA per day. This accelerated value, which was about 4-fold larger than the initial rate, is believed to be the direct consequence of amino acid deprivation since, in separate experiments, the increase was completely suppressed by the addition of plasma amino acids (Lardeux, B. R., and Mortimore, G. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14514-14519). These findings demonstrate the potential value of cytidine as a marker for following moment-to-moment regulatory alterations in RNA degradation in the isolated liver or hepatocyte preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1490607841,"Hog gastric vesicles showed Cl- conductance when treated with Cu2+-o-phenanthroline, an S-S cross-linking reagent. An IgG monoclonal antibody caused dose-dependent inhibition of Cl- conductance that had been induced by S-S cross-linking. The antibody did not cause intervesicular aggregation, as determined by measurement of vesicle size. These results show that Cl- conductance, the stimulation and inhibition of which are regulated reversibly by S-S—2SH transformation, is due to native, physiological channels. The antibody also dose dependently inhibited the activities of H,K-ATPase and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase in gastric vesicles, but did not inhibit Na,K-ATPase obtained from dog kidney. Immunoblotting with the antibody of vesicle proteins solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel showed that the antibody binds to a 95-kDa subunit of H,K-ATPase and its dimeric 180-kDa polypeptide. The antibody-binding sites of H,K-ATPase activity and the Cl- channel for the inhibition were present on the external (cytosolic) surface of the transmembraneous ATPase. A gastric antisecretory compound, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2 alpha] pyridine-3-acetonitrile (SCH 28080), competitively bound to the high affinity site of K+ on the internal (luminal) surface of H,K-ATPase, and its half-maximal inhibitory concentration for H,K-ATPase activity in tight vesicles was 0.2 microM in the presence of valinomycin. SCH 28080 also dose dependently inhibited opening of Cl- channels by S-S cross-linking, the regulatory site being present on the cytosolic side and more internally than the antibody binding site. The half-inhibitory concentration of SCH 28080 was 0.3 microM. The present results with the antibody and SCH 28080 indicate that the Cl- channel is part of the function of H,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1555347684,"The sodium channel purified from rat brain is composed of three subunits: alpha (Mr 260,000), beta 1 (Mr 36,000), and beta 2 (Mr 33,000). alpha and beta 2 subunits are linked through disulfide bonds. Procedures are described for preparative isolation of the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits under native conditions. Pure beta 2 subunits obtained by this procedure were used to prepare a specific anti-beta 2 subunit antiserum. Antibodies purified from this serum by antigen affinity chromatography recognize only disulfide-linked alpha beta 2 complexes and beta 2 subunits in immunoblots, and immunoprecipitate 32P-labeled alpha subunits of purified sodium channels having intact disulfide bonds, but not those of sodium channels from which beta 2 subunits have been detached by reduction of disulfide bonds. These antibodies also immunoprecipitate 89% of the high affinity saxitoxin-binding sites from rat brain membranes, indicating that nearly all sodium channels in rat brain have disulfide-linked alpha beta 2 subunits. Approximately 22% of beta 2 subunits in adult rat brain are not disulfide-linked to alpha subunits. Anti-beta 2 subunit antibodies are specific for sodium channels in the central nervous system and will not cross-react with sodium channels in skeletal muscle or sciatic nerve. The brains of a broad range of vertebrate species, including electric eel, are shown to express sodium channels with disulfide-linked alpha beta 2 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1563274969,"The in vitro acidic pH dependence of colicin E1 channel activity was investigated by directed mutagenesis of Glu-468 in the colicin E1 channel domain, a residue conserved in the sequences of the four channel-forming colicins examined so far. Mutations were made to the amino acids leucine, serine, glutamine, or lysine, residues of different polarity and charge. All of the mutant polypeptides possessed high cytotoxic activity in vivo, although in vitro activity, especially with planar membranes, was lower than that of the wild type protein. A change in the in vitro acidic pH dependence of activity could be readily detected in the mutation to the hydrophobic leucine residue. The dependence of mutant activity on pH in the interval 3.5-5.0 was markedly smaller than that of the wild type, whether assayed on membrane vesicles or membrane bilayers. Differences in pH dependence between the wild type and the polar serine and glutamine mutants were small or of marginal statistical significance. No change in pH dependence could be detected with the charged lysine mutant. The residual pH dependence in all cases indicated that more than one carboxylic residue must be protonated to account for the increased activity at acidic pH values. A role of Glu-468 in the mechanism of channel formation or function was implied by the changes determined in vitro of channel parameters relative to the wild type: (i) the relatively small rates of current increase measured for colicin COOH-terminal peptide derived from the mutants, (ii) the small values of steady-state conductance of mutant peptide at pH 3.5, and (iii) the reduced anion selectivity of peptide from the serine mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2080978672,"The replication origin gamma of plasmid R6K in certain miniplasmids is kept silent by a silencer RNA. We have identified a major and three minor transcripts that are synthesized in a direction antiparallel and complementary to the silencer RNA. The major RNA, called the activator, is essential for replication from ori gamma. The complementary nature of the activator and silencer RNAs strongly suggests that the former is a target of the latter. We have also discovered that the initiator protein is a sequence-specific double-stranded RNA-binding protein that accelerates the rate of activator-silencer hybrid formation. Thus the efficient silencing of ori gamma can be explained by silencer RNA-activator RNA hybrid formation that is driven to completion by the initiator protein."

E., Kolesnikov, S. S., and Lyubarsky, A.L. (1985) Nature 313, 310-313). We have recently described the existence of a similar channel in photoreceptor disc membranes (Koch, K. W., and Kaupp, U. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6788-6800). In this paper we report that the cGMP-dependent channel in the disc membrane of outer segments exists in at least two forms of different cGMP sensitivity and pharmacological behavior. One form has a low Km value of activation by cGMP (25 microM), and it is not blocked by l-cis-diltiazem. The other form has a high Km value (170 microM) and is blocked by this drug. Both channel forms are cooperatively activated by cGMP (Hill coefficient n = 2.0-3.5), suggesting that the channel may have a cGMP receptor that can bind at least three, and possibly four, molecules of cGMP. In the presence of cGMP, the open state of both channel forms inactivates to a weakly or nonconductive state (cf. Puckett, K. L., and Goldin, S. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 1739-1746). A mixed population of different forms of the cGMP-dependent channel may explain the variable numbers reported for the Michaelis constant Km for the channel activation by cGMP and the cooperativity n."
https://openalex.org/W1552647816,"A monoclonal antibody (mAb-233) directed against an epitope in the nonglycosylated carboxyl-terminal region of human erythrocyte glycophorin A (GPA) was used in combination with metabolic labeling, the modification of N- and O-linked oligosaccharide processing by tunicamycin and monensin, and digestions with neuraminidase and O-glycanase to elucidate the pathway of GPA biogenesis in K562 human erythroleukemia cells. Cell-surface GPA is derived from two obligatory precursors in a stepwise manner. The initial GPA precursor has a Mr of 27,000 and appears to contain one N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide chain. In tunicamycin-treated cells, the initial precursor is similar in size (Mr = 24,000) to deglycosylated GPA from human erythrocytes. The 27-kDa initial precursor is rapidly converted to a transient 31-kDa intermediate by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine residues to serine/threonine hydroxyl groups. Subsequent maturation involves the conversion of the high mannose chain to a complex-type oligosaccharide and the concomitant addition of galactose and sialic acid to internal N-acetylgalactosamine residues to extend the O-linked chains. These results define a single, stepwise processing pathway for the generation of all cell-surface GPA molecules and document for the first time the occurrence of both a unique initial precursor that contains a high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide chain but no O-linked sugars and a transient intermediate that appears to contain the same N-linked group and N-acetylgalactosamine at multiple serine/threonine residues. The properties of the intracellular GPA precursors and the relatively simple nature of the processing pathway reported herein contrast markedly with the characteristics of three intermediates and the complexity of two independent pathways in previously postulated schemes for GPA biogenesis (Gahmberg, C. G., Jokinen, M., Karhi, K. K., Kampe, O., Peterson, P. A., and Andersson, L. C. (1983) Methods Enzymol. 96, 281-298; Jokinen, M., Andersson, L. C., and Gahmberg, C. G. (1985) J. Biol.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is widely used to isolate and induce clonal expansion of CTLs for functional studies in vitro and in vivo. However, in studies with CTLs specific for class I and class II histocompatibility antigens, IL-2 rapidly downregulated the lytic activity of some class II-specific CTLs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Lytic activity of L3T4+ CTLs specific for the murine class II antigen I-Ek was repeatedly up- and downregulated in vitro by alternate exposure to specific (alloantigen) and nonspecific (recombinant IL-2) signals, respectively. These results demonstrate that some CTLs modulate their functional property (cytolysis) while undergoing IL-2-driven cell proliferation without loss of antigen specificity or ability to revert to a lytic phenotype."
