https://openalex.org/W2114228460,"The engineering of genetic circuits with predictive functionality in living cells represents a defining focus of the expanding field of synthetic biology. This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level."
https://openalex.org/W2081197259,"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of freely moving rats provide a strikingly periodic representation of self-location which is indicative of very specific computational mechanisms. However, the existence of grid cells in humans and their distribution throughout the brain are unknown. Here we show that the preferred firing directions of directionally modulated grid cells in rat entorhinal cortex are aligned with the grids, and that the spatial organization of grid-cell firing is more strongly apparent at faster than slower running speeds. Because the grids are also aligned with each other, we predicted a macroscopic signal visible to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We then looked for this signal as participants explored a virtual reality environment, mimicking the rats' foraging task: fMRI activation and adaptation showing a speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry in running direction. The signal was found in a network of entorhinal/subicular, posterior and medial parietal, lateral temporal and medial prefrontal areas. The effect was strongest in right entorhinal cortex, and the coherence of the directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated with spatial memory performance. Our study illustrates the potential power of combining single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI in systems neuroscience. Our results provide evidence for grid-cell-like representations in humans, and implicate a specific type of neural representation in a network of regions which supports spatial cognition and also autobiographical memory."

https://openalex.org/W2012457691,"Robustness seems to be the opposite of evolvability. If phenotypes are robust against mutation, we might expect that a population will have difficulty adapting to an environmental change, as several studies have suggested. However, other studies contend that robust organisms are more adaptable. A quantitative understanding of the relationship between robustness and evolvability will help resolve these conflicting reports and will clarify outstanding problems in molecular and experimental evolution, evolutionary developmental biology and protein engineering. Here we demonstrate, using a general population genetics model, that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape. In particular, neutral diversity in a robust population can accelerate adaptation as long as the number of phenotypes accessible to an individual by mutation is smaller than the total number of phenotypes in the fitness landscape. These results provide a quantitative resolution to a significant ambiguity in evolutionary theory."

SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent histone/protein deacetylase, promotes cell survival under oxidative stress when it is expressed in the nucleus. However, adult cardiomyocytes predominantly express SIRT1 in the cytoplasm, and its function has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of SIRT1 in the heart and the potential use of SIRT1 in therapy for heart failure. We investigated the subcellular localization of SIRT1 in cardiomyocytes and its impact on cell survival. SIRT1 accumulated in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes in the failing hearts of TO-2 hamsters, postmyocardial infarction rats, and a dilated cardiomyopathy patient but not in control healthy hearts. Nuclear but not cytoplasmic SIRT1-induced manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), which was further enhanced by resveratrol, and increased the resistance of C2C12 myoblasts to oxidative stress. Resveratrol's enhancement of Mn-SOD levels depended on the level of nuclear SIRT1, and it suppressed the cell death induced by antimycin A or angiotensin II. The cell-protective effects of nuclear SIRT1 or resveratrol were canceled by the Mn-SOD small interfering RNA or SIRT1 small interfering RNA. The oral administration of resveratrol to TO-2 hamsters increased Mn-SOD levels in cardiomyocytes, suppressed fibrosis, preserved cardiac function, and significantly improved survival. Thus, Mn-SOD induced by resveratrol via nuclear SIRT1 reduced oxidative stress and participated in cardiomyocyte protection.

The death of cardiomyocytes and the consequent maladaptive changes in the remaining myocytes and extracellular matrix induce the clinical manifestation of heart failure (1.McMurray J.J.

Over the past 20 years, the arsenal of treatments available for heart failure has increased considerably, with the introduction of β blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and nonpharmacological therapies including cardiac resynchronization therapy (2.Neubauer S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). However, even with the very best current therapy, the annual mortality rate among patients with heart failure is still ∼10% (3.Cleland J.G. Daubert J.C. Erdmann E. Freemantle N. Gras D.

The mitochondrial electron transport chain is the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most cells (4.Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Hearts consume large amounts of O2 and yield high levels of ROS (5.Giordano F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Various factors, including angiotensin II and tumor necrosis factor-α, also induce ROS formation, leading to cardiomyocyte death and heart failure (5.Giordano F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) has a pivotal role in the detoxification of ROS. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which in turn is reduced to water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (5.Giordano F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of SOD have been identified in mammals: copper-zinc SOD (Cu,Zn-SOD, SOD1), manganese SOD (Mn-SOD, SOD2), and extracellular SOD (SOD3). Although cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD knock-out mice (6.Elchuri S. Oberley T.D. Qi W. Eisenstein R.S. Jackson Roberts L. Van Remmen H. Epstein C.J. Huang T.T.

Patients with hemochromatosis, in which iron overload induces robust oxidative stress, have a significantly higher prevalence of cardiomyopathy if they have a mutation in the Mn-SOD gene that leads to reduced enzymatic activity (9.Valenti L. Conte D. Piperno A. Dongiovanni P. Fracanzani A.L. Fraquelli M. Vergani A. Gianni C. Carmagnola L. Fargion S. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adriamycin increases ROS and induces cardiomyocyte death. However, the cardiotoxicity from adriamycin is less severe in transgenic mice expressing high levels of Mn-SOD than in nontransgenic mice (10.Yen H.C. Oberley T.D. Vichitbandha S. Ho Y.S. St. Clair D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Recently, the FOXO3a (forkhead boxO transcription factor 3a)-dependent induction of Mn-SOD by SIRT3, a Sir2 orthologue, was reported to block cardiac hypertrophy (11.Sundaresan N.R. Gupta M. Kim G. Rajamohan S.B. Isbatan A. Gupta M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2758-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in Mn-SOD levels may provide a prognostic advantage for heart failure patients. SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent protein/histone deacetylase, is one of the mammalian orthologues of yeast Sir2 (12.Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 13.Longo V.D. Kennedy B.K. Cell. 2006; 126: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). SIRT1 deacetylates and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator, resulting in the induction of gluconeogenesis (14.Rodgers J.T.

SIRT1 plays an important role in development, and SIRT1-deficient mice exhibit severe developmental abnormalities, such as a small body, heart defects, and exencephaly, and they only infrequently survive postnatally (17.Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It binds and inhibits the tumor suppressor p53 and thereby represses apoptosis induced by DNA damage and oxidative stress (12.Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 13.Longo V.D. Kennedy B.K. Cell. 2006; 126: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). SIRT1 deacetylates and inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, an NAD+-dependent enzyme that contributes to caspase-independent myocyte death in failing hearts (21.Rajamohan S.B. Pillai V.B. Gupta M. Sundaresan N.R. Birukov K.G. Samant S. Hottiger M.O. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4116-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, mild to moderate heart-specific overexpression of SIRT1 in transgenic mice improves the resistance of the heart to stress (22.Alcendor R.R. Gao S. Zhai P. Zablocki D. Holle E. Yu X. Tian B. Wagner T. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Moreover, SIRT1 deacetylates and activates the FOXOs under oxidative stress, thereby inducing Mn-SOD expression (23.Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). SIRT1 is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm in adult cardiomyocytes (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), but its nuclear localization is necessary for it to regulate gene expression. Cytoplasmic SIRT1 may serve as a reservoir for nuclear SIRT1; it may be translocated into the nucleus on demand in some pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization of SIRT1 in failing hearts. This study was approved by the Human and Animal Research Ethics Committees, Sapporo Medical University. Transient transfection was performed using a Nucleofector kit (Amaxa). siRNAs (100 nmol/liter) were transfected twice into C2C12 cells with an interval of 24 h, with or without the simultaneous transfection of EGFP-fused plasmids. Twenty-four h after the second introduction of siRNA and/or plasmids, the cells were treated with resveratrol (40 or 100 μmol/liter) or vehicle for 12 h and then exposed to antimycin A for 8 h (20 or 100 μmol/liter) or angiotensin II (100 μmol/liter) for 12 h to induce oxidative stress. For each gene, we purchased three different siRNAs (B-Bridge, see supplemental Methods), which we used as a mixture (100 nmol/liter) to knock down expression efficiently. In experiments examining the effect of resveratrol on acetyl-H3 levels, the cells were treated with 50 nmol/liter tricostatin A for 24 h before harvesting. To measure ROS levels, the cells were incubated with 7 μm dichlorofluorescein diacetate added to the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then examined by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100MP). Human heart specimens were obtained at autopsy from a patient who died of New York Heart Association class IV heart failure due to DCM at Sapporo Medical University Hospital. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Five sections separated by at least 50 μm from each other were analyzed. For the analysis of hamster hearts, immunostained areas from 10 separate sections per heart from four hamsters in each group were compared. The amount of nuclear SIRT1, fibrosis, and MnSOD protein levels were quantified as described in supplemental Methods. Male 4-week-old TO-2 and control golden hamsters were purchased from Bio Breeders, individually housed, and fed a standard control diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo) ad libitum. At 6 weeks of age, the TO-2 and golden hamsters were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control groups receiving the control diet and resveratrol-treated groups receiving control diet supplemented with resveratrol (4 g/kg control diet). Results are presented as means ± S.E. Differences were tested by an unpaired t test and analysis of variance. When the overall analysis of variance indicated a significant difference, multiple comparisons were conducted by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Survival rates were monitored and compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. The subcellular localization of SIRT1 was examined in the heart of TO-2 hamsters, which have a genetic defect in the δ-sarcoglycan gene and spontaneously develop DCM (24.Sakamoto A. Ono K. Abe M. Jasmin G. Eki T. Murakami Y. Masaki T. Toyo-oka T. Hanaoka F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13873-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The expression levels of nuclear SIRT1 in the cardiomyocytes from TO-2 hamsters with DCM were much higher than in control hearts (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis of immunostained sections revealed that the amount of nuclear SIRT1 in failing hearts significantly increased, by 370 and 209%, respectively, compared with its level in the hearts of control hamsters and young TO-2 hamsters that had not yet developed heart failure (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, an exclusively nuclear expression of SIRT1 was observed in 3.2% of cardiomyocytes in the failing hearts of TO-2 hamsters (n = 3,000, supplemental Fig. 1A). In contrast, this nuclear accumulation of SIRT1 was absent in control and in young TO-2 hamsters (n = 3,000 each). In rats, 4 weeks after myocardial infarction, the cardiomyocytes also showed the nuclear accumulation of SIRT1. The expression levels of nuclear SIRT1 in rat hearts after myocardial infarction were twice as high as in sham-operated hearts (n = 4,000 each, Fig. 1B) with 7.0% of cardiomyocytes expressing SIRT1 exclusively in the nucleus (n = 4000, supplemental Fig. 1B). We further examined the heart of a patient who died of New York Heart Association class IV heart failure due to DCM. Western blotting showed that the failing heart expressed SIRT1 at a similar level to a control heart (supplemental Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis showed a 2.1-fold increase in the intensity of nuclear SIRT1 immunostaining in the DCM heart compared with the control heart (n = 4,000 each, Fig. 1C). In the failing heart, 1.7% of the cardiomyocytes expressed SIRT1 only in the nucleus (n = 4,000), whereas SIRT1 was diffusely distributed in the control heart (Fig. 1C). Thus, significantly higher levels of SIRT1 were expressed in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes in three different models of failing hearts compared with control hearts. To clarify the functional role of nuclear SIRT1, C2C12 myoblast cells were transfected with expression constructs for nucleus-directed (SIRT1-EGFP), cytoplasm-directed (mtNLS-EGFP), or dominant-negative (H355Y-EGFP) SIRT1 (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The cells were then exposed to antimycin A, which inhibits complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and increases superoxide production. The overexpression of SIRT1-EGFP markedly reduced the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2A) and the LDH activity in the culture medium (Fig. 2A), compared with the overexpression of EGFP alone. The overexpression of nuclear SIRT1 also reduced the number of cells showing necrotic features, i.e. the breakdown of the cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). However, in cells overexpressing mtNLS-EGFP, which bears mutations in two SIRT1 nuclear-localization signals and is therefore restricted to the cytoplasm (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the number of apoptotic cells and level of LDH release were similar to those in the control EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The overexpressed dominant-negative SIRT1 (H355Y-EGFP) also failed to suppress the antimycin A-induced cell death despite its nuclear localization (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2, A–C), demonstrating that the cytoprotective function of nuclear SIRT1-EGFP required the enzymatic activity of SIRT1. SIRT1 activates FOXOs and PGC-1α (14.Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar, 25.van der Horst A.

Indeed, a Western blot analysis showed that SIRT1-EGFP significantly increased Mn-SOD (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, which also participate in the detoxification of ROS, were not increased by SIRT1-EGFP (Fig. 2B). Immunostaining also showed that the expression levels of Mn-SOD increased in the C2C12 cells overexpressing SIRT1-EGFP, but not in cells overexpressing EGFP, mtNLS-EGFP, or H355Y-EGFP (supplemental Fig. 2D). To examine the function of Mn-SOD, we used Mn-SOD siRNA. The expression of MnSOD siRNA reduced the protein level of Mn-SOD to 25% of that in control cells (supplemental Fig. 3A) and did not affect the deacetylation of histone H3 promoted by the overexpression of nuclear SIRT1 (supplemental Fig. 3B). The Mn-SOD siRNA substantially enhanced the cell death induced by 100 μmol/liter antimycin A, in that most cells detached from the culture dish even in the presence of nuclear SIRT1 (supplemental Fig. 3C). Therefore, we switched to a lower dose of antimycin A, 20 μmol/liter, which induced only negligible cell death in the absence of Mn-SOD siRNA (Fig. 2C). When Mn-SOD siRNA was expressed, the overexpression of SIRT1-EGFP inhibited neither the apoptosis nor the increase in LDH release induced by antimycin A (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 3D). Thus, the cell-protective function of nuclear SIRT1 required Mn-SOD. Resveratrol, a well known antioxidant, is a potent activator of SIRT1 (27.Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). We next examined whether SIRT1 is involved in the antioxidative and cell-protective functions of resveratrol. Resveratrol significantly attenuated the increase in ROS levels induced by antimycin A (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 4) and angiotensin II (supplemental Fig. 4), as shown by the significantly lower level of dichlorofluorescein staining. The knockdown of SIRT1 by siRNA (supplemental Fig. 5) completely inhibited the decrease in ROS levels by resveratrol in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that the antioxidative function of resveratrol depends on SIRT1. SIRT1 is known to deacetylate histone H3. Resveratrol promoted the deacetylation of histone H3 in C2C12 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs, supplemental Fig. 6, A and B), and this deacetylation was blocked by SIRT1 siRNA (supplemental Fig. 6C). Resveratrol significantly suppressed the apoptosis of NRVMs induced by antimycin A (Fig. 3B) and by angiotensin II (Fig. 3C). The expression of SIRT1 siRNA abolished the antiapoptotic function of resveratrol in NRVMs (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 7A) and C2C12 cells (supplemental Fig. 7B). Thus, both the antioxidative and antiapoptotic functions of resveratrol completely depended on SIRT1 in these experimental conditions. Resveratrol may induce Mn-SOD via the activation of SIRT1. Indeed, resveratrol significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of Mn-SOD in NRVMs (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 8). Nicotinamide, an SIRT1 inhibitor, suppressed the resveratrol-mediated increase in Mn-SOD mRNA and, in fact, reduced its expression to levels below that of the control cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, the Mn-SOD siRNA blocked resveratrol's reduction of the ROS levels (Fig. 4B) and inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Resveratrol had no effect on either the expression level of SIRT1 (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. 9) or its subcellular localization (supplemental Fig. 9). Because nuclear but not cytoplasmic SIRT1 induced Mn-SOD expression (Fig. 2B), the expression levels of nuclear SIRT1 are likely to determine the levels of Mn-SOD induced by resveratrol. In fact, the treatment of C2C12 cells overexpressing nuclear SIRT1 with resveratrol further enhanced the already elevated Mn-SOD levels (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the overexpression of cytoplasmic SIRT1 did not affect the Mn-SOD levels, and resveratrol induced similar levels of Mn-SOD regardless of the presence or absence of cytoplasmic SIRT (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that resveratrol decreased ROS and promoted cell survival via Mn-SOD induction, and this protection was strongly influenced by the expression levels of nuclear SIRT1. Because the cardiomyocytes of failing hearts express nuclear SIRT1, resveratrol may have a more potent effect on failing hearts than on healthy ones. Resveratrol was orally administered to control golden hamsters and TO-2 hamsters from the age of 6 weeks. The average daily caloric intake of the animals was not affected by the administration of resveratrol (supplemental Fig. 10A). At the age of 30 weeks, we examined the cardiac function of control and TO-2 hamsters. Ventricular wall motion was severely impaired in TO-2 hamsters fed the control diet, but the impairment was significantly less pronounced in the animals treated with resveratrol (Fig. 5A). The administration of resveratrol attenuated the deterioration of cardiac function in TO-2 hamsters, as revealed by their significantly higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (34.4 ± 2.2% versus 27.9 ± 1.6%, n = 15 each) and fractional shortening (17.3 ± 1.1% versus 12.7 ± 0.8%, n = 15 each) compared with those of the TO-2 hamsters fed the control diet (Fig. 5A). Resveratrol did not affect the cardiac wall motion or function in control golden hamsters (Fig. 5A), and it did not affect the heart rate in either the golden hamsters (371 ± 5 versus 371 ± 8) or the TO-2 hamsters (381 ± 5 versus 387 ± 6). The hearts of control TO-2 hamsters at the age of 35 weeks showed spherical ventricles and enlarged atria with an increased heart weight to body weight ratio. These morphological features of heart failure were less evident in TO-2 hamsters treated with resveratrol (Fig. 5B), whose heart weights were significantly lower than those of the control TO-2 hamsters (Fig. 5C). The administration of resveratrol significantly attenuated the loss of cardiomyocytes and the development of interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 6A). It also alleviated the up-regulation of B-type natriuretic peptide (an index of the severity of heart failure) mRNA in the cardiomyocytes of 35-week-old TO-2 hamsters (Fig. 6B). Resveratrol affected neither the expression levels of SIRT1 nor its subcellular localization in the heart (data not shown). The levels of acetyl-histone H3 in the hearts of resveratrol-fed TO-2 hamsters were significantly lower than in control hamsters (supplemental Fig. 10B), suggesting that the cardiac SIRT1 of the TO-2 hamsters was activated by the oral administration of resveratrol. Resveratrol increased the Mn-SOD mRNA levels by >2-fold in the left ventricles of TO-2 hamsters compared with the levels in TO-2 hamsters fed the control diet (Fig. 6C). Immunohistochemical examinations also showed an increase in the Mn-SOD levels in the hearts of TO-2 hamsters fed resveratrol (Fig. 6C). The lifespan of TO-2 hamsters fed resveratrol was significantly extended compared with that of the control TO-2 hamsters (average lifespan = 318 ± 13 versus 287 ± 10 days, p < 0.05) (supplemental Fig. 10C). A Cox proportional hazards regression showed that resveratrol reduced the risk of death in TO-2 hamsters by 59% (Hazard ratio = 0.41, p = 0.03) (Fig. 6D). Overall, the oral administration of resveratrol suppressed the progression of heart failure and improved the survival of TO-2 hamsters. Normal adult mouse cardiomyocytes express eight times more SIRT1 in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Similarly, normal human cardiomyocytes predominantly expressed SIRT1 in their cytoplasm (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We found that chronic heart failure induced a nuclear translocation of SIRT1 in cardiomyocytes. The nuclear accumulation of SIRT1 is likely to be an adaptive mechanism of cardiomyocytes against heart failure, as indicated by the potent cell protective effect of nuclear SIRT1 against ROS. Previously, we used the pharmacological inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to exclude SIRT1 from the nucleus (19.Tanno M. Sakamoto J. Miura T. Shimamoto K. Horio Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6823-6832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and observed that insulin-like growth factor 1, an upstream activator of PI3K, dose-dependently promoted the nuclear localization of SIRT1 in NRVMs (data not shown). These findings indicate that PI3K is a candidate for signaling to induce the nuclear localization of SIRT1 in failing hearts. PI3K is activated in the cardiomyocytes of hypertrophic and failing hearts (28.Dorn 2nd, G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and enhanced PI3K activity prolongs the lifespan of mice with DCM, whereas the diminished activity of this kinase shortens it by ∼50% (29.McMullen J.R. Amirahmadi F. Woodcock E.A. Schinke-Braun M. Bouwman R.D. Hewitt K.A. Mollica J.P. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Shioi T. Buerger A. Izumo S. Jay P.Y. Jennings G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, a PI3K-enhanced increase in nuclear SIRT1 levels may have contributed to the prognostic advantage of the mice. The expression level of nuclear SIRT1 in the failing hearts was different from cell to cell (Fig. 1). Because many cardiomyocytes in failing hearts still express abundant cytoplasmic SIRT1, agents that promote the nuclear translocation of SIRT1 may elicit additional cardioprotective function when combined with resveratrol. Resveratrol has been proposed to be responsible for the cardioprotective effects of red wine, invoked by the so-called French paradox (30.Renaud S. de Lorgeril M. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1523-1526Abstract PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar). Resveratrol enhances SIRT1 activity by increasing the affinity of SIRT1 for NAD+ and for acetylated peptides by an allosteric interaction (27.Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar) and suppresses the cell death induced by various oxidative stressors (31.Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43121-43130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the antioxidative and cell-protective functions of resveratrol depended on SIRT1 because SIRT1 siRNA cancelled the resveratrol-mediated decrease in ROS levels (Fig. 3A) and cell survival (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 7B). SIRT1 has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes by inhibiting p53 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (21.Rajamohan S.B. Pillai V.B. Gupta M. Sundaresan N.R. Birukov K.G. Samant S. Hottiger M.O. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4116-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31.Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. J. Biol.

Res. 2004; 95: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We showed here that the Mn-SOD induced by nuclear SIRT1 and resveratrol plays an indispensable role in this protection. Mn-SOD was important for the decrease in ROS levels (Fig. 4B) and cell survival (Fig. 4C) promoted by resveratrol and has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress and to prevent cardiomyopathy (8.Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Together, these findings strongly indicate that the elevated levels of cardiac Mn-SOD in TO-2 hamsters treated with resveratrol (Fig. 6C) plays a significant role in the cardioprotection and survival of the animals with failing hearts. The effectiveness of resveratrol's induction of Mn-SOD was determined by the expression level of nuclear SIRT1 (Fig. 4D). Recently, the administration of resveratrol to healthy mice was shown to increase Mn-SOD expression in the brain but not the heart (33.Robb E.L. Winkelmolen L. Visanji N. Brotchie J. Stuart J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 372: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We observed that the oral administration of resveratrol to normal animals with healthy hearts had little effect on left ventricular function, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, or B-type natriuretic peptide expression (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). These findings indicate that resveratrol has a minimal effect on healthy cardiomyocytes, in which SIRT1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm. The plasma concentration of resveratrol in mice fed 200–400 mg resveratrol/kg/day was reported to be 44–526 nmol/liter (15.Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. Geny B. Laakso M. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Cell. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar). In the present study, the plasma concentration of resveratrol was estimated at 30–200 nmol/liter, which was lower than that used in our in vitro experiments (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). However, resveratrol significantly decreased the acetyl-histone H3 levels in the heart of TO-2 hamsters, indicating that the dose of resveratrol used in the present study was sufficient to activate SIRT1 in cardiomyocytes (supplemental Fig. 10B). Previous experiments showed that resveratrol is much more potent when given orally to animals than when incubated with cultured cells in vitro (34.Casper R.F. Quesne M. Rogers I.M. Shirota T. Jolivet A. Milgrom E. Savouret J.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 784-790PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Sun C. Zhang F. Ge X. Yan T. Chen X. Shi X. Zhai Q. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This might be explained, at least in part, by the tissue accumulation of resveratrol resulting from its hydrophobicity. The average daily intake of resveratrol by the hamsters was ∼145 mg/kg of body weight, which corresponds to the daily ingestion of as much as 9 g in humans. Recently, small molecule activators of SIRT1 that are 1,000-fold more potent than resveratrol have been developed (36.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Similar to resveratrol, these compounds improve insulin resistance and diabetes in mice and rats (36.Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Other SIRT1 activators, as well as resveratrol, should be considered for clinical applications. Current therapies using β blockers, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone blockers mainly aim at neurohumoral factors that are maladaptively activated in failing hearts. Because these medications neither directly detoxify ROS nor induce Mn-SOD, the protective function resveratrol for cardiomyocytes is distinct. Thus, a combination regimen that uses SIRT1 activators along with the above-mentioned medications may turn out to be an improvement on current therapeutic approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2128360853,"Cyclin D1 belongs to the core cell cycle machinery, and it is frequently overexpressed in human cancers. The full repertoire of cyclin D1 functions in normal development and oncogenesis is unclear at present. Here we developed Flag- and haemagglutinin-tagged cyclin D1 knock-in mouse strains that allowed a high-throughput mass spectrometry approach to search for cyclin D1-binding proteins in different mouse organs. In addition to cell cycle partners, we observed several proteins involved in transcription. Genome-wide location analyses (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA microarray; ChIP-chip) showed that during mouse development cyclin D1 occupies promoters of abundantly expressed genes. In particular, we found that in developing mouse retinas-an organ that critically requires cyclin D1 function-cyclin D1 binds the upstream regulatory region of the Notch1 gene, where it serves to recruit CREB binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase. Genetic ablation of cyclin D1 resulted in decreased CBP recruitment, decreased histone acetylation of the Notch1 promoter region, and led to decreased levels of the Notch1 transcript and protein in cyclin D1-null (Ccnd1(-/-)) retinas. Transduction of an activated allele of Notch1 into Ccnd1(-/-) retinas increased proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, indicating that upregulation of Notch1 signalling alleviates the phenotype of cyclin D1-deficiency. These studies show that in addition to its well-established cell cycle roles, cyclin D1 has an in vivo transcriptional function in mouse development. Our approach, which we term 'genetic-proteomic', can be used to study the in vivo function of essentially any protein."
https://openalex.org/W1971110487,"Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a cap-n-collar basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) transcription factor that is well established as a master regulator of phase II detoxification and antioxidant gene expression and is strongly expressed in tissues involved in xenobiotic metabolism including liver and kidney. Nrf2 is also abundantly expressed in adipose tissue; however, the exact function of Nrf2 in adipocyte biology is unclear. In the current study we show that targeted knock-out of Nrf2 in mice decreases adipose tissue mass, promotes formation of small adipocytes, and protects against weight gain and obesity otherwise induced by a high fat diet. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 cells, and human subcutaneous preadipocytes, selective deficiency of Nrf2 impairs adipocyte differentiation. Deficiency of Nrf2 also leads to decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), and their downstream targets during adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, activation of Nrf2 in 3T3-L1 cells by stable knockdown of its negative regulator Keap1 enhances and accelerates hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation. Transfection of Nrf2 stimulates Pparγ promoter activity, and stable knockdown of Keap1 enhances PPARγ expression in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that Nrf2 associates with consensus binding sites for Nrf2 in the Pparγ promoter. These findings demonstrate a novel biologic role for Nrf2 beyond its participation in detoxification and antioxidant pathways and place Nrf2 within the limited network of transcription factors that control adipocyte differentiation by regulating expression of PPARγ.

Fat cells play an important role in energy storage and metabolism and secrete a variety of factors that influence appetite, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and many other pathways of biologic and clinical significance (1.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Because of the significance of adipocyte biology in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory disorders, there has been intense interest in defining the network of transcription factors that controls the expression of genes involved in fat cell development.

PPARγ is expressed abundantly in adipose tissue and is considered to be the dominant transcriptional regulator of adipogenic differentiation (3.Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Accordingly, much attention has been directed at identifying factors that control PPARγ expression during the process of adipogenesis. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 Oil Red O Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum high fat diet dexamethasone, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, and insulin lipoprotein lipase adipsin adipose differentiation-related protein fatty acid translocase fatty acid-binding protein 4 fetal bovine serum mouse embryonic fibroblast knock-out short hairpin RNA. CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are leucine zipper transcription factors expressed in both white and brown adipose tissue and have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating PPARγ activity and adipogenesis (4.Darlington G.J.

Biol. 2005; 40: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are transiently expressed at the onset of the adipose differentiation program (6.Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 7.Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). This phase is then followed by induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression (8.Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9.Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, PPARγ and C/EBPα form a positive loop by regulating each other's expression (11.Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12.Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Although the enforced expression of C/EBPα in fibroblasts can trigger adipocytic differentiation, C/EBPα is incapable of inducing adipogenesis in the absence of PPARγ (13.Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In contrast, PPARγ can induce adipogenic differentiation in C/EBPα-null cells indicating that PPARγ is proximal in effecting adipogenesis (14.Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Apart from C/EBPβ, -δ, and -α, relatively few transcription factors have been described that bind to the Pparγ promoter and positively regulate Pparγ transcription during adipogenesis (15.Lefterova M.I. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a member of the cap-n-collar basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) family of transcription factors and has been shown to play an important role in mediating cytoprotective responses to oxidative stress and electrophilic xenobiotics (16.Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Nrf2 forms heterodimers with small-maf proteins to up-regulate expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and detoxifying proteins through the cis-active sequences known as antioxidant response elements. Although Nrf2 is dispensable for growth and development in mouse, Nrf2-deficient mice are sensitized to oxidative stress-related pathologies in various organs (16.Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in xenobiotic metabolism, Nrf2 is highly expressed in tissues such as the liver, lung, kidney, and intestine. High levels of Nrf2 are also found in fat tissues (17.Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18.Yoshinari K. Okino N. Sato T. Sugatani J. Miwa M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, Nrf2 expression is induced by a prolonged high fat diet (19.Kim S. Sohn I. Ahn J.I. Lee K.H. Lee Y.S. Lee Y.S. Gene. 2004; 340: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, a potential role for Nrf2 in adipocyte development or lipid metabolism has not been fully explored. Here we investigated the role of Nrf2 in adipocyte differentiation. Mice deficient in Nrf2 display decreased fat mass in association with small adipocytes and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in Nrf2 show impaired adipogenesis, and in 3T3-L1 and human subcutaneous preadipocytes, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 expression inhibits adipocyte differentiation. In addition, we further show that 1) PPARγ expression is Nrf2-dependent, 2) Nrf2 physically associates with the Pparγ promoter in vivo and stimulates Pparγ promoter activity, and 3) the impaired adipogenesis induced by knock-out or inhibition of Nrf2 is related at least in part to down-regulation of PPARγ expression. These studies provide evidence for a heretofore-unrecognized role of Nrf2 in adipogenesis and identify Nrf2 as a potentially important transcriptional regulator of PPARγ during the process of adipocyte differentiation.

Ambulations were scored as interruption of beams in 30-min intervals and converted to meters based on the distance between the beams. MEFs were isolated as previously described (21.Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and were cultured in high glucose DMEM with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum until they became confluent. Induction of adipocyte differentiation in MEFs was achieved by culturing 2-day post-confluent cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.5 mm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μm dexamethasone for 2 days. Cells were subsequently cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and insulin alone. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated 1 day after they became confluent (designated as day 0) by replacing calf serum with FBS and by adding 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 125 μm indomethacin, and 1 μm rosiglitazone maleate to the medium. After 3 days, cells were maintained for an additional 2–4 days in the same medium without additives, and fresh medium was replenished every 2 days. Cells were harvested on the indicated days in the figure legend after the induction for further analysis. Subcutaneous human preadipocytes were obtained from Zen-Bio, Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC) and cultured in preadipocyte medium (Zen-Bio, catalog #PM-1) according to the manufacture's recommendation. To induce differentiation, confluent cells were kept in adipocyte differentiation medium (Zen-Bio #DM-2) for 7 days followed by 5 days of culture in adipocyte medium (Zen-Bio #DM-1). Detection of lipid droplets was achieved by staining with ORO. Briefly, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 5 min. Fixed cells were rinsed 3 times in deionized water, stained with a solution of ORO for 30 min, and rinsed with deionized water. Quantification of the results was performed on a Typhoon scanner using Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000TM Systems and Bio-Rad TDS Quantity One software. MISSION shRNA lentiviral particles were obtained from Sigma. Lentiviral transduction of 3T3-L1 cells with particles for shRNAs targeting Nrf2 (SHVRS-NM_010902), Keap1 (SHVRS-NM_016679), or scrambled non-target negative control (Scr, SHC002V) was performed based on manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 24 h before transduction, 3T3-L1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at ∼40–50% confluency in complete medium described above. The following day hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma), a transduction enhancer, was added to each well at a concentration of 8 μg/ml, and viral particles were added to each well at a concentration of 2 × 105 transducing units/ml. After overnight incubation, medium containing viral particles was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were grown to ∼90% confluency and subcultured in medium containing puromycin. Before lentiviral transduction, a puromycin titration was performed to identify the minimum concentration of puromycin that caused complete cell death of 3T3-L1 cells after 3–5 days. Knockdown of Nrf2 in human preadipocytes was performed using MISSION shRNA lentiviral particles targeting human Nrf2 (SHVRS-NM_006164). 3T3-L1 cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitations using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology as described previously (23.Wang W. Kwok A.M. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24670-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A portion of the lysate was saved for subsequent purification of input genomic DNA. The remaining supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and sheared herring sperm DNA and followed by incubation with anti-Nrf2 rabbit polyclonal antibody or preimmune antibody control at 4 °C overnight. Purified DNA was PCR-amplified for 35 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C) with the primers indicated in supplemental Table 3 that span 3 kb of the Pparγ2 gene promoter. Non-precipitated (input) genomic DNA was amplified as input control, and NQO1 promoter was used as a positive control for Nrf2. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) or Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) with p < 0.05 taken as significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. For comparisons between groups, a Student's t test was performed. Two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc testing was done to evaluate statistical significance of gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells. The body weights of wild type and Nrf2 KO littermates were indistinguishable at weaning (3–4 weeks). By 12 weeks, however, the mean body weight of adult Nrf2 KO mice under an ad libitum diet consisting of regular chow was 20% lower than that of wild type littermates (Fig. 1A). A comparison of organ weights normalized for body mass did not reveal a significant difference between Nrf2 KO and wild type littermate controls (Fig. 1B). However, the fat pads in Nrf2 KO mice appeared smaller in comparison to wild type littermates (Fig. 1C). In Nrf2 KO mice, white adipose tissue weight (epididymal, perirenal, and mesenteric weight normalized to body weight) was 60% lower than in wild type littermates (Fig. 1C). To investigate this further, we examined morphology of white adipose tissues. Fat cells in Nrf2 KO mice appeared smaller than cells in wild type mice (Fig. 1D). Quantitative analysis indicated that the adipocytes of Nrf2 KO mice were significantly smaller that those of wild type mice as reflected by a 3-fold greater number of adipocytes in cross-sections of fat tissue from knock-out mice versus from wild type mice (Fig. 1E). In addition, the amount of DNA per gram of adipose tissue was significantly greater in Nrf2 KO mice than in wild type animals (data not shown). To further assess the potential role of Nrf2 in adipocyte function, we challenged adult mice with a HFD and examined whether deficiency of Nrf2 protects against diet-induced obesity. After 12 weeks on the HFD, wild type mice had gained 75% of their starting weight, whereas Nrf2 KO mice had gained only 15% of their starting weight (Fig. 2A). Similar to chow-fed animals, the group differences in body weight in HFD-fed animals were due to a decrease in fat mass in Nrf2 KO mice. Marked enlargement of fat pads was observed in wild type mice compared with Nrf2 KO mice (data not shown), and white adipose tissue weight was significantly greater in wild type mice compared with Nrf2 KO mice (Fig. 2B). To examine if the lower adipose tissue mass observed in Nrf2 KO mice was caused by a decrease in caloric intake or fat absorption, we measured food intake and fecal fat over a 1-week period. The amount of food consumed was similar between mutant and control mice (Fig. 2C), and there was no difference in the fecal lipid levels between the two groups (Fig. 2D). Thus, the lower adipose tissue mass of Nrf2 KO animals does not appear to be due to changes in food consumption or intestinal fat absorption. To examine if physical activity plays a role in the lean phenotype, locomotor activity was monitored using a beam break apparatus. Nrf2 KO mice did not demonstrate hyperactivity compared with wild type animals (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that the defect is intrinsic to adipose cells that are deficient in Nrf2. MEFs, isolated from embryos at gestation E12–14, can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes when exposed to a mixture consisting of dexamethasone, 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, and insulin (DMI) (24.Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared adipocyte differentiation capacity of MEFs isolated from wild type and Nrf2-deficient embryos to determine whether Nrf2 is required for adipogenesis. Wild type MEFs cultured with DMI showed a dramatic accumulation of intracellular lipid as determined by ORO staining (Fig. 3A). In contrast, lipid accumulation was significantly lower in Nrf2-deficient MEFs treated with DMI, suggesting that loss of Nrf2 impairs differentiation of MEFs into adipocytes (Fig. 3A). To investigate the underlying mechanism of impaired fat accumulation, we analyzed the expression of various genes related to adipocyte differentiation. Although Cebpβ and Cebp δ expression patterns were similar in wild type and Nrf2 KO fibroblasts (data not shown), Pparγ and Cebpα expression were markedly lower in Nrf2 KO fibroblasts compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3B). Western blotting also demonstrated that PPARγ and C/EBPα protein levels were lower in white adipose tissues of Nrf2 knockouts (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the decreased expression of Pparγ, both basal and DMI-induced expressions of downstream target genes involved in adipogenesis including lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), complement factor D (Adpsn), aP2, Cd36, and adipose differentiation-related protein (Adfp) were all significantly lower in Nrf2 KO MEFs compared with wild type (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that adipocyte differentiation was impaired in Nrf2 mutants. To confirm that Nrf2 is involved in adipogenesis and exclude nonspecific effects associated with development in MEF cells, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Nrf2 in 3T3-L1 cells. Several shRNAs against Nrf2 were used for transduction. As shown in Fig. 4A, one of the constructs (sh-Nrf2-I) markedly silenced Nrf2 expression, whereas two other constructs (sh-Nrf2-II, sh-Nrf2-III) had a moderate silencing effect. Oxidative stress induction of Nrf2 protein accumulation and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), a well established Nrf2 target gene, was attenuated, indicating that Nrf2 activity is suppressed in the knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine whether reduction in Nrf2 influences adipogenesis, knockdown cells were cultured in differentiation medium and monitored for lipid accumulation by ORO staining. After 6 days of exposure to differentiation medium, lipid accumulation was significantly decreased in Nrf2 knockdown cells compared with scramble (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these results, adipogenic differentiation in human subcutaneous preadipocytes was also suppressed by knockdown of Nrf2 (Fig. 4, C and D). In 3T3-L1 Nrf2 knockdown cells, gene (Fig. 4E) and protein (Fig. 4F) expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, CD36, LPL, and ADPSN induced by hormonal mixture was significantly lower than that of scramble cells. To further substantiate these findings, we examined the effects of increased Nrf2 function on adipogenesis by knocking down Keap1, which is a negative regulator of Nrf2. 3T3-L1 cells transduced with Keap1-shRNAs showed efficient knockdown of Keap1 expression (Fig. 5A). Nqo1 expression was induced by knockdown of Keap1, confirming that Nrf2 pathway is activated in these cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Under differentiation protocol, ORO staining demonstrated increased lipid accumulation in Keap1-knockdown cells compared with scramble cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, induction of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ target genes were accelerated and enhanced, suggesting that differentiation is enhanced by Nrf2 activation (Fig. 5, C and D).FIGURE 5Stable knockdown of Keap1 by shRNA lentivirus enhances hormonal mixture-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.

The γ2 isoform is highly enriched in adipose tissue (3.Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nrf2 regulates Pparγ2 promoter activity, a luciferase reporter gene driven by the Pparγ2 promoter was transfected into wild type MEF cells along with Nrf2 expression plasmid. Coexpression of Nrf2 increased luciferase activity driven by the Pparγ2 promoter ∼3-fold relative to cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 6A). To determine whether Pparγ2 promoter activity is Nrf2-dependent, we compared expression of the luciferase reporter plasmid transfected into wild type and Nrf2 KO MEFs. Luciferase expression in Nrf2-deficient MEFs was 3-fold lower compared with wild type MEFs (Fig. 6B), and low expression in Nrf2 KO MEFs was rescued by cotransfection of Nrf2 expression plasmid (Fig. 6B). Consistent with promoter assays, up-regulation of Nrf2 by knockdown of Keap1 in 3T3-L1 cells was accompanied by up-regulation of Pparγ2 expression (Fig. 6, C and D). These data suggest that the decrease in Pparγ2 expression in Nrf2 KO mice was due to loss of Nrf2 activation of the Pparγ2 promoter. To determine whether Nrf2 binds the endogenous Pparγ promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were carried out. Chromatin isolated from 3T3-L1 cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Nrf2 antibody or preimmune sera as control and subjected to PCR amplification using primers spanning 3 kb of the Pparγ promoter region (Fig. 7A). Occupancy by Nrf2 was detected with primer pairs C and D (Fig. 7B). No signal was observed when preimmune rabbit IgG was used for precipitation. Sequence inspection in the region spanned by primer pairs C and D revealed two consensus binding sites for Nrf2. One is located in the sense orientation at nucleotide position −1389 to −1398 and another at nucleotide position −2049 to −2058 in the negative strand. Together with the results in Nrf2 KO mice and the luciferase reporter studies, these findings suggest that Nrf2 binds the Pparγ promoter and contributes to its activation in vivo. Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is activated by oxidative stress and regulates the expression of cytoprotective and antioxidant genes (16.Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2006; 46: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Consistent with this function, Nrf2 is expressed in various organs including liver, lung, kidney, and digestive tract, which are involved in detoxification. In addition, Nrf2 is expressed in fat tissue, but its role in adipocyte differentiation has not been directly investigated (17.Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study we have discovered that Nrf2 plays an important role in adipogenesis. Nrf2 knock-out mice have lower adipose tissue mass, smaller adipocytes, and are resistant to HFD-induced obesity. Hormonal mixture-induced adipogenesis is depressed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nrf2 knock-out mice and in 3T3-L1 and primary human preadipocyte cells in which shRNA has been used to knock down Nrf2 expression. Conversely, adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells is enhanced by activation of Nrf2 through knockdown of"
https://openalex.org/W2039013165,"Group II chaperonins are essential mediators of cellular protein folding in eukaryotes and archaea. These oligomeric protein machines, approximately 1 megadalton, consist of two back-to-back rings encompassing a central cavity that accommodates polypeptide substrates. Chaperonin-mediated protein folding is critically dependent on the closure of a built-in lid, which is triggered by ATP hydrolysis. The structural rearrangements and molecular events leading to lid closure are still unknown. Here we report four single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Mm-cpn, an archaeal group II chaperonin, in the nucleotide-free (open) and nucleotide-induced (closed) states. The 4.3 A resolution of the closed conformation allowed building of the first ever atomic model directly from the single particle cryo-EM density map, in which we were able to visualize the nucleotide and more than 70% of the side chains. The model of the open conformation was obtained by using the deformable elastic network modelling with the 8 A resolution open-state cryo-EM density restraints. Together, the open and closed structures show how local conformational changes triggered by ATP hydrolysis lead to an alteration of intersubunit contacts within and across the rings, ultimately causing a rocking motion that closes the ring. Our analyses show that there is an intricate and unforeseen set of interactions controlling allosteric communication and inter-ring signalling, driving the conformational cycle of group II chaperonins. Beyond this, we anticipate that our methodology of combining single particle cryo-EM and computational modelling will become a powerful tool in the determination of atomic details involved in the dynamic processes of macromolecular machines in solution."

https://openalex.org/W1997170399,"Experience in complex environments induces numerous forms of brain plasticity, improving structure and function. It has been long debated whether brain plasticity can be induced under neuropathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), to an extent that would reduce neuropathology, rescue brain structure, and restore its function. Here we show that experience in a complex environment rescues a significant impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis in transgenic mice harboring familial AD-linked mutant APPswe/PS1ΔE9. Proliferation of hippocampal cells is enhanced significantly after enrichment, and these proliferating cells mature to become new neurons and glia. Enhanced neurogenesis was accompanied by a significant reduction in levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and oligomeric Aβ, the precursors of AD hallmarks, in the hippocampus and cortex of enriched mice. Interestingly, enhanced expression of the neuronal anterograde motor kinesin-1 was observed, suggesting enhanced axonal transport in hippocampal and cortical neurons after enrichment. Examination of synaptic physiology revealed that environmental experience significantly enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation, without notable alterations in basal synaptic transmission. This study suggests that environmental modulation can rescue the impaired phenotype of the Alzheimer's brain and that induction of brain plasticity may represent therapeutic and preventive avenues in AD.—Y.-S.

https://openalex.org/W2084697631,"RPK1 (receptor-like protein kinase 1) localizes to the plasma membrane and functions as a regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis. In our current study, we investigated the effect of RPK1 disruption and overproduction upon plant responses to drought stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing the RPK1 protein showed increased ABA sensitivity in their root growth and stomatal closure and also displayed less transpirational water loss. In contrast, a mutant lacking RPK1 function, rpk1-1, was found to be resistant to ABA during these processes and showed increased water loss. RPK1 overproduction in these transgenic plants thus increased their tolerance to drought stress. We performed microarray analysis of RPK1 transgenic plants and observed enhanced expression of several stress-responsive genes, such as Cor15a, Cor15b, and rd29A, in addition to H(2)O(2)-responsive genes. Consistently, the expression levels of ABA/stress-responsive genes in rpk1-1 had decreased compared with wild type. The results suggest that the overproduction of RPK1 enhances both the ABA and drought stress signaling pathways. Furthermore, the leaves of the rpk1-1 plants exhibit higher sensitivity to oxidative stress upon ABA-pretreatment, whereas transgenic plants overproducing RPK1 manifest increased tolerance to this stress. Our current data suggest therefore that RPK1 overproduction controls reactive oxygen species homeostasis and enhances both water and oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2095308688,"Both competition and cooperation between sperm have been well documented, but can individual sperm discriminate between kin, with whom they should cooperate, and non-kin, with whom they should not? Heidi Fisher and Hopi Hoekstra show that when the sperm of two deer mice species are mixed, they aggregate preferentially with sperm from their own species. In mixtures between individuals of the same species, sperm from a monogamous species do not discriminate kin from non-kin, whereas sperm from a promiscuous species do. Sperm can increase their swimming velocity and gain a competitive advantage over sperm from another male by forming cooperative groups, such that selection should favour cooperation of the most closely related sperm. Sperm of deer mice are now shown to aggregate more often with conspecific than heterospecific sperm, in accordance with this theory, whereas in a monogamous species lacking sperm competition, sperm indiscriminately group with unrelated conspecific sperm. Among the extraordinary adaptations driven by sperm competition is the cooperative behaviour of spermatozoa1. By forming cooperative groups, sperm can increase their swimming velocity and thereby gain an advantage in intermale sperm competition1,2. Accordingly, selection should favour cooperation of the most closely related sperm to maximize fitness3. Here we show that sperm of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) form motile aggregations, then we use this system to test predictions of sperm cooperation. We find that sperm aggregate more often with conspecific than heterospecific sperm, suggesting that individual sperm can discriminate on the basis of genetic relatedness. Next, we provide evidence that the cooperative behaviour of closely related sperm is driven by sperm competition. In a monogamous species lacking sperm competition, Peromyscus polionotus, sperm indiscriminately group with unrelated conspecific sperm. In contrast, in the highly promiscuous deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, sperm are significantly more likely to aggregate with those obtained from the same male than with sperm from an unrelated conspecific donor. Even when we test sperm from sibling males, we continue to see preferential aggregations of related sperm in P. maniculatus. These results suggest that sperm from promiscuous deer mice discriminate among relatives and thereby cooperate with the most closely related sperm, an adaptation likely to have been driven by sperm competition."
https://openalex.org/W1984693763,"The highly conserved RecQ family of DNA helicases has multiple roles in the maintenance of genome stability. Sgs1, the single RecQ homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, acts both early and late during homologous recombination. Here we present the expression, purification, and biochemical analysis of full-length Sgs1. Unlike the truncated form of Sgs1 characterized previously, full-length Sgs1 binds diverse single-stranded and double-stranded DNA substrates, including DNA duplexes with 5'- and 3'-single-stranded DNA overhangs. Similarly, Sgs1 unwinds a variety of DNA substrates, including blunt-ended duplex DNA. Significantly, a substrate containing a Holliday junction is unwound most efficiently. DNA unwinding is catalytic, requires ATP, and is stimulated by replication protein A. Unlike RecQ homologues from multicellular organisms, Sgs1 is remarkably active at picomolar concentrations and can efficiently unwind duplex DNA molecules as long as 23,000 base pairs. Our analysis shows that Sgs1 resembles Escherichia coli RecQ protein more than any of the human RecQ homologues with regard to its helicase activity. The full-length recombinant protein will be invaluable for further investigation of Sgs1 biochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2050946340,"There are 29 E. coli genome sequences available, mostly related to studies of species diversity or mode of pathogenicity, including two genomes of the well-known O157:H7 clone. However, there have been no genome studies of closely related clones aimed at exposing the details of evolutionary change. Here we sequenced the genome of an O55:H7 strain, closely related to the major pathogenic O157:H7 clone, with published genome sequences, and undertook comparative genomic and proteomic analysis. We were able to allocate most differences between the genomes to individual mutations, recombination events, or lateral gene transfer events, in specific lineages. Major differences include a type II secretion system present only in the O55:H7 chromosome, fewer type III secretion system effectors in O55:H7, and 19 phage genomes or phagelike elements in O55:H7 compared to 23 in O157:H7, with only three common to both. Many other changes were found in both O55:H7 and O157:H7 lineages, but in general there has been more change in the O157:H7 lineages. For example, we found 50% more synonymous mutational substitutions in O157:H7 compared to O55:H7. The two strains also diverged at the proteomic level. Mutational synonymous SNPs were used to estimate a divergence time of 400 years using a new clock rate, in contrast to 14,000 to 70,000 years using the traditional clock rates. The same approaches were applied to three closely related extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli genomes, and similar levels of mutation and recombination were found. This study revealed for the first time the full range of events involved in the evolution of the O157:H7 clone from its O55:H7 ancestor, and suggested that O157:H7 arose quite recently. Our findings also suggest that E. coli has a much lower frequency of recombination relative to mutation than was observed in a comparable study of a Vibrio cholerae lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2061390876,"Pannexins (Panx) are a class of integral membrane proteins that have been proposed to exhibit characteristics similar to those of connexin family members. In this study, we utilized Cx43-positive BICR-M1R(k) cells to stably express Panx1, Panx3, or Panx1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) to assess their trafficking, cell surface dynamics, and interplay with the cytoskeletal network. Expression of a Sar1 dominant negative mutant revealed that endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport of Panx1 and Panx3 was mediated via COPII-dependent vesicles. Distinct from Cx43-GFP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies revealed that both Panx1-GFP and Panx3-GFP remained highly mobile at the cell surface. Unlike Cx43, Panx1-GFP exhibited no detectable interrelationship with microtubules. Conversely, cytochalasin B-induced disruption of microfilaments caused a severe loss of cell surface Panx1-GFP, a reduction in the recoverable fraction of Panx1-GFP that remained at the cell surface, and a decrease in Panx1-GFP vesicular transport. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation assays revealed actin as a novel binding partner of Panx1. Collectively, we conclude that although Panx1 and Panx3 share a common endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi secretory pathway to Cx43, their ultimate cell surface residency appears to be independent of cell contacts and the need for intact microtubules. Importantly, Panx1 has an interaction with actin microfilaments that regulates its cell surface localization and mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2126253217,"Transcription activation by androgen receptor (AR), which depends on recruitment of coactivators, is required for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, yet the mechanisms of how hormone-activated AR interacts with coactivators remain unclear. This is because AR, unlike any other nuclear receptor, prefers its own N-terminal FXXLF motif to the canonical LXXLL motifs of coactivators. Through biochemical and crystallographic studies, we identify that steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3) (also named as amplified in breast cancer-1 or AIB1) interacts strongly with AR via synergistic binding of its first and third LXXLL motifs. Mutagenesis and functional studies confirm that SRC3 is a preferred coactivator for hormone-activated AR. Importantly, AR mutations found in prostate cancer patients correlate with their binding potency to SRC3, corroborating with the emerging role of SRC3 as a prostate cancer oncogene. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the selective utilization of SRC3 by hormone-activated AR, and they link the functional relationship between AR and SRC3 to the development and growth of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2014860499,"The egg-laying abnormal-9 (EGLN) prolyl hydroxylases have been shown to regulate the stability and thereby the activity of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) through its ability to catalyze their hydroxylation. We have previously shown that EGLN3 promotes differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts. However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that exposure of C2C12 cells to dimethyl oxalylglycine (DMOG), desferrioxamine, and hypoxia, all inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylase activity, led to repression of C2C12 myogenic differentiation. Inactivation of HIF by expression of a HIF dominant-negative mutant or deletion of HIF-1alpha by RNA interference did not affect the inhibitory effect of DMOG, suggesting that the effect of DMOG is HIF-independent. Pharmacologic inactivation of EGLN3 hydroxylase resulted in activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. The inhibitory effect of DMOG on myogenic differentiation was markedly impaired in C2C12 cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of IkappaBalpha. Exogenous expression of wild-type EGLN3, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, significantly inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpressed TRAF2 or IkappaB kinase 2. In contrast, deletion of EGLN3 by small interfering RNAs led to activation of NF-kappaB. These data suggest that EGLN3 is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, and its prolyl hydroxylase activity is required for this effect. Furthermore, wild-type EGLN3, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, potentiated myogenic differentiation. This study demonstrates a novel role for EGLN3 in the regulation of NF-kappaB and suggests that it is involved in mediating myogenic differentiation, which is HIF-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2026422941,"Homologous meiotic recombination occurs in most sexually reproducing organisms, yet its evolutionary advantages are elusive. Previous research explored recombination in the honeybee, a eusocial hymenopteran with an exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate. A comparable study in a non-social member of the Hymenoptera that would disentangle the impact of sociality from Hymenoptera-specific features such as haplodiploidy on the evolution of the high genome-wide recombination rate in social Hymenoptera is missing. Utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two Nasonia parasitoid wasp genomes, we developed a SNP genotyping microarray to infer a high-density linkage map for Nasonia. The map comprises 1,255 markers with an average distance of 0.3 cM. The mapped markers enabled us to arrange 265 scaffolds of the Nasonia genome assembly 1.0 on the linkage map, representing 63.6% of the assembled N. vitripennis genome. We estimated a genome-wide recombination rate of 1.4-1.5 cM/Mb for Nasonia, which is less than one tenth of the rate reported for the honeybee. The local recombination rate in Nasonia is positively correlated with the distance to the center of the linkage groups, GC content, and the proportion of simple repeats. In contrast to the honeybee genome, gene density in the parasitoid wasp genome is positively associated with the recombination rate; regions of low recombination are characterized by fewer genes with larger introns and by a greater distance between genes. Finally, we found that genes in regions of the genome with a low recombination frequency tend to have a higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, likely due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious non-synonymous substitutions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination reduces interference between linked sites and thereby facilitates adaptive evolution and the purging of deleterious mutations. Our results imply that the genomes of haplodiploid and of diploid higher eukaryotes do not differ systematically in their recombination rates and associated parameters."

Based on crystal structures, in one rotamer conformation, the threonine hydroxyl of Thr169 forms H-bonds to the flavin-N5/O4 locus, whereas, in a different rotamer, it may interact with either sugar or other parts of the P2O·sugar complex. Transient kinetics of wild-type (WT) and Thr169 → S/N/G/A replacement variants show that d-Glc binds to T169S, T169N, and WT with the same Kd (45–47 mm), and the hydride transfer rate constants (kred) are similar (15.3–9.7 s−1 at 4 °C). kred of T169G with d-glucose (0.7 s−1, 4 °C) is significantly less than that of WT but not as severely affected as in T169A (kred of 0.03 s−1 at 25 °C). Transient kinetics of WT and mutants using d-galactose show that P2O binds d-galactose with a one-step binding process, different from binding of d-glucose. In T169S, T169N, and T169G, the overall turnover with d-Gal is faster than that of WT due to an increase of kred. In the crystal structure of T169S, Ser169 Oγ assumes a position identical to that of Oγ1 in Thr169; in T169G, solvent molecules may be able to rescue H-bonding. Our data suggest that a competent reductive half-reaction requires a side chain at position 169 that is able to form an H-bond within the ES complex. During the oxidative half-reaction, all mutants failed to stabilize a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate, thus suggesting that the precise position and geometry of the Thr169 side chain are required for intermediate stabilization.

Pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O, 3Supported by a grant from the Austrian Research Foundation (Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung Translational Project L213-B11). pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.10) from Trametes multicolor is a homotetrameric enzyme with each subunit carrying one FAD covalently linked to Nϵ2 (N3) of His167 via the FAD 8α-methyl group (1.Halada P. Leitner C. Sedmera P. Haltrich D. Volc J. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). P2O catalyzes the oxidation by molecular oxygen of d-glucose (d-Glc) and several aldopyranoses at the C2 position to yield the corresponding 2-ketoaldoses and hydrogen peroxide (2.Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The overall catalytic reaction can be divided into two half-reactions (Scheme 1) obeying a Ping-Pong type mechanism at pH 7 (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar): a reductive half-reaction in which the protein-bound flavin receives a hydride equivalent from a sugar substrate to produce the reduced FAD (FADH−) and the 2-keto-sugar, and an oxidative half-reaction in which two electrons are transferred from the reduced flavin to O2 to form H2O2 (2.Leitner C. Volc J. Haltrich D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3636-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We reported the first detection of a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate for a flavoprotein oxidase (4.Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This flavin intermediate has not been previously observed for flavoprotein oxidases but has been limited to reactions of flavoprotein monooxygenases (5.Palfey B.A. Massey V. Michael S. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. III. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 83-153Google Scholar, 6.Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Besides P2O, an intermediate in flavoprotein oxidases has been detected only in the crystalline forms of choline oxidase (1.86 Å) (8.Orville A.M. Lountos G.T. Finnegan S. Gadda G. Prabhakar R. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and nitroalkane oxidase (in the presence of cyanide) (9.Héroux A. Bozinovski D.M. Valley M.P. Fitzpatrick P.F. Orville A.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 3407-3416Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in the mutant form, C42S, of an NADH oxidase (10.Mallett T.C. Claiborne A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8790-8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger, the generation of a flavin semiquinone-superoxide radical pair using pulse radiolysis resulted in formation of a putative C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate (11.Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Studies on the P2O reductive half-reaction indicate that P2O binds d-Glc according to a two-step binding mechanism: first an initial complex is formed, followed by an isomerization step to form an active Michaelis ES complex (P2O·glucose). Interestingly, this complex shows higher absorbance at 395 nm than does the oxidized enzyme, which is unique among flavoprotein oxidases (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). P2O belongs to the large family of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductases (12.Albrecht M. Lengauer T. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol.

Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The active site is gated by a dynamic active-site loop (residues 451–461), which has been shown to harbor several residues important for substrate binding and catalysis (13.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U.

Divne C. Haltrich D. Peterbauer C. Biotechnol. J. 2009; 4: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Comparison of P2O structures in sugar-free and sugar-bound forms reveals the presence of at least two well defined active-site loop conformations, each of which is relevant to one of the half-reactions (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol.

The structure of a less active P2O mutant (H167A), in complex with a slow substrate (2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R.

Schulz G.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6587-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), shows the active-site loop in an open conformation. The open loop state is able to accommodate spatially the sugar substrate, and thus this conformation is relevant for the reductive half-reaction (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35104-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The wild-type structure of P2O in complex with the small competitive inhibitor acetate revealed the loop in a different well defined conformational state (13.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This state is characterized as fully closed, and the active site is solvent-inaccessible and provides a more hydrophobic substrate environment than does the open state. Thus, this structural state provides a suitable environment for the reaction of the reduced enzyme and oxygen, and can spatially accommodate the C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD intermediate during the oxidative half-reaction (4.Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol.

We have discussed previously that the conserved residue Thr169 occupies an important position in the P2O active site, positioned immediately “above” the flavin, on the flavin si-side, where it forms a hydrogen bond to the flavin N5 and O4 atoms when the loop is in the closed conformation (13.Hallberg B.M. Leitner C. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R.

Flavin-N5-protein interactions are recurrent features in structures of many flavoprotein oxidases (17.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and little is known about the functional effects of this H-bonding interaction. When the active-site loop assumes the open conformation in P2O, Thr169 discards its flavin interaction by means of a rotamer change (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35104-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The position of the Thr169 side chain relative to the sugar substrate and FAD also provides a simple, straightforward explanation for the poor performance of d-galactose (d-Gal) as a substrate. The oxidation of d-Gal by P2O is industrially useful, because it produces the intermediate for further synthesis of d-tagatose, a low caloric and non-glycemic sweetener (18.Haltrich D. Leitner C. Neuhauser W. Nidetzky B. Kulbe K.D. Volc J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 864: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In wild-type P2O (WT), the axial O4 hydroxyl group of d-Gal is probably unfavorable due to steric clashes with the Thr169 side chain (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35104-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the binding and reaction mechanism of P2O with d-Gal have not been rationalized in detail, because transient kinetics of the reaction have not been investigated. In this report, steady-state and transient kinetics of Thr169 variants, T169S, T169N, T169G, and T169A, with d-Glc and d-Gal were investigated. Rapid kinetics of WT with d-Gal are also reported. These results provide mechanistic insights regarding the role of Thr169 in the reductive and oxidative half-reactions. In addition, three-dimensional structures of T169G and T169S were solved and used in conjunction with kinetic data for interpretation of the roles of Thr169 in catalysis of P2O. d-Glc (99.5% purity), d-Gal (99% purity), and horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ABTS (2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Germany). Concentrations of the following compounds were determined using the known absorption coefficients at pH 7.0: ϵ403 = 105m−1cm−1 for horseradish peroxidase; ϵ458 = 1.3 × 104m−1 cm−1 for the value of FAD per each subunit of T169S; ϵ458 = 1.2 × 104m−1 cm−1 for T169N; ϵ458 = 1.1 × 104m−1 cm−1 for T169G; and ϵ453 = 1.18 × 104m−1 cm−1 for T169A. All mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli without His6 tag, and purified according to the protocol described earlier (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35104-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis at position Thr169 of P2O was performed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit. All primers were from Sigma-Proligo (Singapore). The plasmid pET11a was used as a template for the mutagenic PCR (GeneAmp PCR system, Applied Biosystems, model 2004 or MyCyclerTM, Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad). All plasmids were confirmed using T7 forward and reverse primers, as well as a primer to an internal region of the p2o gene. The DNA sequencing was performed by MACROGEN (Korea). The nucleotide sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S1. Measurements of reduction potential values (Emo′) of the mutant enzymes were carried out according to the protocol described in a previous study (19.Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar), using xanthine/xanthine oxidase as a reduction system. Reactions for all mutants were carried out in reaction mixtures containing 500 μm xanthine, 3 nm xanthine oxidase (side arm), standard dye (26.8 μm indigo carmine (Emo′ = −116 mV), 18 μm cresyl violet (Emo′ = −166 mV), or 20 μm methylene blue (Emo′ = +10 mV)), and Thr169 mutants (26.8 μm T169S, 26.8 μm T169N, 18 μm T169A, or 20 μm T169G) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Details of the procedure are provided in supplemental Procedures. Initial velocities at various concentrations of oxygen with d-Glc or d-Gal were measured at 4 °C and 25 °C using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics of the P2O variants was studied by coupling to the reaction of horseradish peroxidase and ABTS. Progress of the reaction was followed at 420 nm (ϵ420 = 42.3 mm−1cm−1) where the oxidized ABTS absorbs (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The assay reaction typically contained 20–40 nm of a mutant enzyme, 0.6 μm peroxidase, 2 mm ABTS, varying concentrations of d-Glc or d-Gal, and varying oxygen concentrations in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Reductive and oxidative half-reactions of the Thr169 variants were studied using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech Scientific). Experimental protocols are similar to those in the previous report (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4.Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and described in detail in supplemental Procedures. The reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD was monitored at 395 and 458 nm. For studying the oxidative half-reaction, solutions containing the reduced enzyme were prepared as described previously (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4.Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and then mixed with buffers equilibrated with oxygen ([O2] = 0.13, 0.31, 0.61, and 0.96 mm) using the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The reactions were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and monitored at 5 nm intervals in the λ range between 300 and 550 nm. Analyses of observed rate constants (kobs) from kinetic traces were conducted by fitting data to exponential equations using the software Kinetic Studio (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) or Program A (developed by C. J. Chiu, R. Chung, J. Diverno, and D. P. Ballou at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Rate constants were determined from plots of kobsversus sugar or oxygen concentrations using Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear fitting algorithms included in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) according to Equations 1 and 2 (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rate constants are defined as in Table 2. kobs(first_phase)=k2[G]Kd+[G]+k−2(Eq. 1) kobs(second_phase)=k2k3(k2+k−2)[G]KD(k−2k2+k−2)+[G]+k−3(Eq. 2) Initial rates of steady-state measurements were calculated using Program A. The initial rates were analyzed for steady-state kinetic parameters of a two-substrate enzyme reaction according to a double-reciprocal plot of a Ping-Pong (Equation 3) or a ternary complex mechanism (Equation 4) (20.Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, data were analyzed according to direct plots (Equations 5 and 6) using the EnzFitter program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). ev=ϕ0+ϕG[G]+ϕO2[Ο2](Eq. 3) ev=ϕ0+ϕG[G]+ϕO2[Ο2]+ϕG:Ο2[G][Ο2](Eq. 4) V=VABKaB+KbA+AB(Eq. 5) V=VABKiaKb+KbA+AB(Eq. 6) Expression and purification of the Thr169 mutants used for crystallization have been reported previously (21.Spadiut O. Leitner C. Tan T.C. Ludwig R. Divne C. Haltrich D. Biocatal. Biotran. 2008; 26: 120-127Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For all proteins, crystals grew from microseeded hanging drops containing a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m Mes (pH 5.2), 50 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) monomethyl ether polyethylene glycol 2000 and protein at a concentration of 20 mg/ml in 20 mm Mes (pH 5.2). Crystals were stabilized in mother liquor with 28 (w/v) % polyethylene glycol 2000, followed by vitrification in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at beam line I911-2, MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden, and processed and scaled using the XDS package (22.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Details of data processing are provided in supplemental Procedures. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in supplementary Table S2. The absorbances at 458 nm, an isosbestic point for indigo carmine, and at 610 nm where P2O has no absorbance, were used for calculating the amount of the enzyme (E) and dye (D), respectively (19.Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar). Plots of log(Dred/Dox) versus log(Ered/Eox) gave a slope of ∼1.2 (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that both T169S and T169N were reduced by xanthine/xanthine oxidase via a two-electron process (indigo carmine as the reference dye). No absorption was detected at the long wavelength or 370 nm regions, which suggests that no semiquinone was stabilized during the reduction of FAD. The midpoint potentials (Emo′) calculated from these plots are −106 mV for T169S and −95 mV for T169N, which are similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (WT), −105 mV (14.Kujawa M. Ebner H. Leitner C. Hallberg B.M. Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Ludwig R. Rudsander U. Peterbauer C. Chaiyen P. Haltrich D. Divne C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35104-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). T169A and cresyl violet were also reduced by xanthine/xanthine oxidase via a two-electron process (absorbance at 414 and 585 nm was used for calculating concentrations of the oxidized enzyme and dye, respectively). The slope of the plot was ∼0.92 (data not shown), and Emo′ was calculated to be −197 mV, which is significantly lower than WT. For T169G (methylene blue as the standard dye), calculations using absorbance at 458 and 664 nm gave a slope of 0.86, and Emo′ of −1.2 mV. For each mutant, at least three standard dyes were used to ensure that there was no interference from dyes to the measurement. All data are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for the wild-type and Thr169 mutants of P2OParametersPing-PongTernaryWTT169ST169NT169GT169Ad-Glucose (4 °C)kcat (s−1)9.7 ± 0.1513.7 ± 0.25.6 ± 0.050.7 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.005KmGlc (mm)1.13 ± 0.071.7 ± 0.054.6 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.0230 ± 1KmO2 (mm)0.09 ± 0.0080.99 ± 0.034.8 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.50.2 ± 0.03kcat/KmGlc (mm−1s−1)8.68.11.20.80.002kcat/KmO2 (mm−1s−1)110.013.81.20.20.4d-Galactosekcat (s−1)1.2 ± 0.052.5 ± 0.025.3 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.002(25 °C)KmGal (mm)15.0 ± 0.316.2 ± 0.516 ± 13.1 ± 0.0850 ± 2KmO2 (mm)0.03 ± 0.0020.07 ± 0.011.32 ± 0.13.7 ± 0.080.4 ± 0.03kcat/KmGal (mm−1s−1)0.080.150.30.50.005kcat/KmO2 (mm−1s−1)44.232.03.40.40.07Reduction potentialEmo′ (mV)−105aRedox potential value is from a previous report (14).−106−95−1−197a Redox potential value is from a previous report (14.Kujawa M.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic parameters for all P2O variants were determined from initial rates of the assay reactions at various concentrations of oxygen and d-Glc or d-Gal. KmGlc denotes Km of d-Glc while KmGal represents Km of d-Gal. Double-reciprocal plots for T169N (Fig. 1, A and C), T169S, and T169G (supplemental Fig. S2) all display parallel-line patterns consistent with a Ping-Pong mechanism (Equation 3) similar to that of WT (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas T169A shows an intersecting-line pattern for reactions both with d-Glc (Fig. 1B) and d-Gal (Fig. 1D), consistent with a ternary-complex mechanism (Equation 4). All steady-state kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. When d-Glc was used as a substrate, the value of kcat/KmGlc for T169S was similar to that of WT (8.1 versus 8.6 mm−1s−1), whereas those of T169N and T169G were ∼7- and 11-fold lower than that of WT, respectively (Table 1). This shows that the reductive half-reaction is less affected in T169S, compared with T169N and T169G. When compared with WT, kcat/KmO2 was reduced by 8-, 92-, and 549-fold for T169S, T169N, and T169G, respectively, indicating that Thr169 is significantly important for the oxidative half-reaction. For T169A, both kcat/KmGlc and kcat/KmO2 decreased considerably, indicating that, in addition to altering the kinetic reaction pattern, replacing the side-chain hydroxyl group by a methyl group severely impairs the overall catalytic competence. It is interesting to note that with d-Glc as a substrate, T169S shows the highest kcat value (13.7 s−1), also exceeding that of the WT. With d-Gal as a substrate, the kcat/KmGal values of T169S, T169N, and T169G were all higher (2-, 4-, and 6-fold, respectively) than that of wild-type P2O, which can be mainly attributed to the increase in kcat of these mutants (Table 1). This implies that by replacing the Thr side chain with Ser, Asn, and Gly, the overall turnover of the reaction with d-Gal has improved. When compared with WT, the kcat/KmO2 values were 1.4-, 13-, and 111-fold lower for T169S, T169N, and T169G, respectively, again confirming that alterations at the amino acid position 169 significantly affect the oxidative half-reaction. To investigate the role of Thr169 in P2O catalysis and to identify the specific reaction steps affected by the mutations, transient kinetics were investigated. For analysis of the reductive half-reaction with d-Glc as a substrate, anaerobic enzyme solutions were mixed with buffers containing various concentrations of d-Glc, and reduction of the flavin was monitored at 458 and 395 nm. Absorbance at 458 nm gives the maximum difference between the oxidized and the reduced enzyme, and the signal at 395 nm indicates formation of an active P2O·sugar complex, as previously observed in the wild-type reaction (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Only the kinetic traces of the T169S and T169N reduction showed an obvious increase in absorbance at 395 nm. The first phase corresponds to a small increase in absorbance at 395 nm, concomitant with a lag at 458 nm (Fig. 2, A and B). This phase was interpreted as the formation of an active P2O·sugar complex required for flavin reduction (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The macroscopic equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) associated with the binding of d-Glc to the oxidized state of T169S and T169N (45 and 47 mm, respectively (Table 2)) are identical to that of WT (45 mm) (3.Prongjit M. Sucharitakul J. Wongnate T. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4170-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating the same binding affinity and similar nature of the P2O·Glc complex in the mutants and WT.TABLE 2Summary of rate constants for the flavin reduction of Thr169 variants at pH 7SubstrateParameterWTT169ST169NT169GT169Ad-Glc, 4 °Ckred (s−1)15.3 ± 0.4aRate constant and Kd are from the previous report (3).13.8 ± 0.49.7 ± 0.1 (fast) 0.002 (slow)0.7 ± 0.01NDKd (mm)45aRate constant and Kd are from the previous report (3).4547NDbND, not determined.

Taken together, these observations suggest that mispair binding may license an ATP binding-dependent conformational change that results in conversion to the sliding form.

Attempts to understand the ATP-bound conformations of these complexes by soaking ATP and ATP analogs into the MutS-mispair crystals have thus far failed to induce conformational changes expected from the biochemical characterization of these complexes, possibly because of restraints placed on the proteins by the crystal lattice (2.Lamers M.H.

Thus, the nature of the ATP binding-induced conformational changes that link mispair recognition with conversion to the sliding form and/or the form that is competent for ternary complex formation is presently unknown. The interactions between the bacterial and eukaryotic mispair-binding proteins and ATP are probably best understood for the Msh2-Msh6 complex (32.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA, the Msh6 nucleotide-binding site has high affinity for ATP and low affinity for ADP, whereas the Msh2 nucleotide-binding site has lower affinity for ATP and higher affinity for ADP. ATP binding at the Msh6 nucleotide-binding site results in reduced affinity for ADP in the Msh2 nucleotide-binding site. In the absence of mispair binding, the ATP in the Msh6 nucleotide-binding site is rapidly hydrolyzed, and the resulting ADP dissociates. Thus, in solution, Msh2-Msh6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, resulting in a form that contains ADP bound in the Msh2 nucleotide-binding site (32.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This ADP-bound form of Msh2-Msh6 can bind both base pairs and mispairs (21.Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J.

Interestingly, prebinding of ATP under non-hydrolyzing conditions (absence of Mg2+) or the presence of the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS prevents binding of Msh2-Msh6 to any DNA (21.Mendillo M.L.

Once Msh2-Msh6 is bound to base-paired DNA, ATP binding causes Msh2-Msh6 to directly dissociate from DNA (21.Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22245-22257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, when Msh2-Msh6 is bound to a mispair, ATP hydrolysis at the Msh6 site is inhibited, which then favors binding of ATP at the Msh2 site (32.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol.

A mispair-bound, ATP-bound form of the mispair-binding complexes is also competent for assembling Mlh1-Pms1 ternary complexes (17.Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

In this study, we have used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze eight MMR-deficient Msh2-Msh6 complexes for defects in ATP binding, sliding clamp formation, and Msh2-Msh6-Mlh1-Pms1 ternary complex assembly and for ATP binding-induced conformational changes. The results of this study have allowed us to directly detect conformational changes induced by ATP binding to the Msh6 nucleotide-binding site and to relate the ATP-binding properties of the Msh2 and Msh6 nucleotide-binding sites to conformational changes and the ability of Msh2-Msh6 to form sliding clamps and ternary complexes with Mlh1-Pms1. S. cerevisiae was grown on standard medium, either yeast extract/peptone/dextrose or complete supplement mixture medium (United States Biological), lacking specific amino acids to select for plasmid markers and/or Lys+ revertants. Escherichia coli strains used for the propagation of plasmids were grown on LB medium containing antibiotics to select for plasmids as appropriate. All S. cerevisiae strains used for genetic tests are isogenic derivatives of the same parental S288C strain (39.Amin N.S. Nguyen M.N. Oh S. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5142-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The wild-type strain RDKY 3590 has the genotype MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 hom3-10 lys2::InsE-A10, and the strains used for complementation studies were RDKY 3688 (MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 hom3-10 lys2::InsE-A10 msh2Δ::hisG) and RDKY 4234 (MATα ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200 hom3-10 lys2::InsE-A10 msh3Δ::hisG msh6Δ::hisG). Plasmids pRDK361-ARS-CEN-URA3-MSH2 and pRDK439-ARS-CEN-LEU2-MSH6 were from our laboratory collection and were derived from parental vectors pRS315 and pRS316, respectively. The dual Msh2-Msh6 E. coli expression plasmid pET11a-Msh2-Msh6 was from Dr. Manju Hingorani (38.Antony E. Hingorani M.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7682-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Derivatives of these plasmids containing the indicated MSH2 and MSH6 alleles were made by site-directed mutagenesis and are described in supplemental Table S1. All of the genetics methods used in the described studies, including those used for site-directed mutagenesis, verification by DNA sequencing, and evaluation of mutator phenotypes by patch tests, were exactly as described previously (11.Marsischky G.T.

To determine whether ATP binding affects the conformation of Msh2-Msh6, 1 μg of wild-type or mutant Msh2-Msh6 was incubated with 0–500 ng of trypsin with or without 100 μm ATPγS in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 110 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.01% IGEPAL, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol) in a final volume of 10 μl for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 10 mm. The proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% gel (Bio-Rad), and the resulting gel was silver-stained. Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to S. cerevisiae Msh2 or Msh6, which were raised in this laboratory, was performed to detect and differentiate Msh2 and Msh6. Nucleotide binding was measured by UV cross-linking exactly as described previously (32.Mazur D.J. Mendillo M.L. Kolodner R.D. Mol.

DNA substrates 236 bp in length with biotin conjugated to one end and a centrally located GT mispair were constructed as described (21.Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

Approximately 20 ng of DNA (140 response units) was conjugated to a flow cell of a streptavidin-coated Biacore SA chip. In the unblocked sliding experiments, 50 nm wild-type or mutant Msh2-Msh6 and 250 μm ATP were flowed over the chip at 20 μl/min for 120 s in reaction buffer. In the end-blocked sliding experiments, 30 nm LacI was flowed over the chip at 20 μl/min for 120 s in reaction buffer before and during Msh2-Msh6 binding. Dissociation of Msh2-Msh6 from the DNA end was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the sample. The DNA-coated surface was regenerated with a 20-μl pulse of 3 m NaCl. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Reference subtraction was made from an unmodified flow cell. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The formation of Msh2-Msh6-Mlh1-Pms1 ternary complexes on mispaired DNA was also analyzed with a Biacore T100 instrument essentially as described previously (21.Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J. Kolodner R.D.

The minus Mlh1-Pms1 control was performed similarly to the end-blocked sliding experiment described above; 30 nm LacI was flowed over the chip, followed by 20 μl of 20 nm Msh2-Msh6, 30 nm LacI, and 250 μm ATP and then 40 μl of 20 nm Msh2-Msh6, 30 nm LacI, and 250 μm ATP. In the plus Mlh1-Pms1 experiments, the third injection contained 20 nm Msh2-Msh6, 40 nm Mlh1-Pms1, 30 nm LacI, and 250 μm ATP. Selected ternary complex formation experiments were also performed in which 2 μm ATP was substituted for 250 μm ATP. A previous study of three dominant-negative S. cerevisiae msh6 mutations, msh6-S1036P, msh6-G1067D, and msh6-G1142D, revealed that the resulting mutant Msh2-Msh6 complexes were proficient for binding mispaired bases in DNA but were not converted to the sliding clamp form upon ATP binding. This suggested either that they occluded mispairs from detection by functional Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3 complexes or that they were unable to form appropriate ternary complexes with MutL homolog complexes (29.Das Gupta R. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42.Hess M.T. Gupta R.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

These mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions near the Msh2 and Msh6 nucleotide-binding sites but were not predicted to alter the structure of the nucleotide-binding sites. Here, we have extended our prior studies and have included five additional mutations in our analysis (Fig. 1). One of the new mutations is a dominant msh6 mutation, msh6-R1024C (47.Martinez, S., Kolodner, R. D. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in pressGoogle Scholar). The four other mutations are msh2 mutations, msh2-R730C, msh2-S742P, msh2-T773D, and msh2-G855D, which cause amino acid substitutions in Msh2 equivalent to those caused by the dominant msh6 mutations. These mutations cause amino acid substitutions near the Msh6 ATP-binding site (msh2-S742P, msh2-T773D, and msh6-G1142D), near the Msh2 ATP-binding site (msh6-S1036P, msh6-G1067D, and msh2-G855D), or at positions between the two ATP-binding sites (msh6-R1024C and msh2-R730C) (Fig. 1). The mutation rates of strains harboring each of the eight mutant genes on low copy number plasmids were assessed qualitatively using patch tests. Plasmids containing the mutant msh2 alleles did not complement the high frameshift mutation rate of an msh2Δ strain (supplemental Fig. S1), but they had no effect on the frameshift mutation rate of a wild-type strain (supplemental Fig. S2). These msh2 mutations therefore result in a strong loss of function but do not cause a dominant phenotype like that caused by the equivalent msh6 mutations (29.Das Gupta R. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To monitor nucleotide-induced conformational changes in the Msh2-Msh6 complex, we incubated wild-type Msh2-Msh6 with increasing concentrations of trypsin in the presence or absence of ATPγS in reactions containing Mg2+, and the digestion of Msh2-Msh6 was monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) as well as by Western blotting with Msh2- and Msh6-specific antibodies (supplemental Fig. S3). In the absence of ATPγS, Msh6 was extensively degraded at low trypsin concentrations, whereas Msh2 was degraded only at higher trypsin concentrations (>100 ng/reaction). Msh6 degradation correlated with the appearance of three species of ∼90, 80, and 75 kDa that were derived from Msh6 as indicated by Western blotting. As the trypsin concentration increased (≥50 ng/reaction), the 90- and 80-kDa species were degraded, and the 75-kDa species remained until much higher trypsin concentrations (>150 ng/reaction). We have shown previously that the 90-kDa species corresponds to an N-terminal Msh6 truncation product that is missing the first 441 r"
https://openalex.org/W2048867550,"Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. In this report, we examined the mechanism of action of human Ctf4 (hCtf4) in DNA replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings show that the purified hCtf4 exists as a dimer and that the hCtf4 SepB domain likely plays a primary role determining the dimeric structure. hCtf4 binds preferentially to DNA template-primer structures, interacts directly with the replicative DNA polymerases (alpha, delta, and epsilon), and markedly stimulates the polymerase activities of DNA polymerases alpha and epsilon in vitro. Depletion of hCtf4 in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA resulted in G(1)/S phase arrest. DNA fiber analysis revealed that cells depleted of hCtf4 exhibited a rate of DNA replication slower than cells treated with control small interfering RNA. These findings suggest that in human cells, hCtf4 plays an essential role in DNA replication and its ability to stimulate the replicative DNA polymerases may contribute to this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2003361382,"Previous studies suggest that high glucose-induced RhoA/Rho kinase/CPI-17 activation is involved in diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility. However, the upstream signaling that links high glucose and RhoA/Rho kinase/CPI-17 activation is unknown. Here we report that calcium-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β) is required for high glucose-induced RhoA/Rho kinase/CPI-17 activation and thereby contributes to diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility. We demonstrate that high glucose increases iPLA2β mRNA, protein, and iPLA2 activity in a time-dependent manner. Protein kinase C is involved in high glucose-induced iPLA2β protein up-regulation. Inhibiting iPLA2β activity with bromoenol lactone or preventing its expression by genetic deletion abolishes high glucose-induced RhoA/Rho kinase/CPI-17 activation, and restoring expression of iPLA2β in iPLA2β-deficient cells also restores high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of 12/15-lipoxygenases has effects on high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation similar to iPLA2β inhibition. Moreover, increases in iPLA2 activity and iPLA2β protein expression are also observed in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic vasculature. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of iPLA2β, but not iPLA2γ, diminishes diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility. In summary, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which high glucose-induced, protein kinase C-mediated iPLA2β up-regulation activates the RhoA/Rho kinase/CPI-17 via 12/15-lipoxygenases and thereby contributes to diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility.

The prevalence of diabetes has increased dramatically in the United States and worldwide. Diabetes-associated microvascular and macrovascular complications are the major causes of increased mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients (1.Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6864) Google Scholar). It is recognized that abnormal vascular reactivity, including an increase in vasoconstrictive responses and/or a decrease in vasodilatory responses, are present early in diabetes, and this might contribute to the development of diabetes-associated vascular complications (2.De Vriese A.S. Verbeuren T.J. Van de Voorde J. Lameire N.H. Vanhoutte P.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Although diabetes-associated endothelial and vasodilatatory dysfunction has been studied extensively, much less is known about vascular smooth muscle dysfunction in diabetes, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie endothelium-independent, diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility are largely unknown. G-protein-coupled receptor agonists can induce significant smooth muscle contraction by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase at a given Ca2+ concentration by a mechanism designated “Ca2+ sensitization” (3.Somlyo A.P.

Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Importantly, abnormal activation of Ca2+ sensitization pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, including vasospasm, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, and heart failure in both animal models and clinical trials (5.Shimokawa H. Takeshita A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1767-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).

In particular, we have demonstrated that CPI-17 is activated by high glucose in primary cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and blood vessels from obese and type 2 diabetic db/db mice, and ROCK is the kinase responsible for high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation and diabetes-associated hypercontractility in db/db mice (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the upstream signaling pathways that link exposure to high concentrations of glucose and activation of RhoA/ROCK/CPI-17 are unknown. Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are enzymes that hydrolyze fatty acid substituents from the sn-2 position of phospholipids, and their action results in concomitant production of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. Based upon their cellular location and the Ca2+ requirement for enzymatic activity, PLA2 can be classified into three groups: secretory PLA2, cytosolic PLA2, and calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (11.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is a family of iPLA2 intracellular enzymes that do not require Ca2+ for catalytic activity, and its members include iPLA2α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ξ, and η (12.Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F.

Of these, iPLA2β was the first recognized and most extensively characterized, and it has a ubiquitous tissue distribution and is implicated in several cellular functions (13.Ma Z. Turk J. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bromoenol lactone (BEL) is a suicide substrate of iPLA2 inhibitor and has been widely used for inhibiting iPLA2 activity in many cell types and tissues (14.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Using this pharmacological inhibitor, previous studies suggest that iPLA2 is involved in agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction (15.Guo Z. Su W. Ma Z. Smith G.M. Gong M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16.Park K.M. Trucillo M. Serban N. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that inhibiting iPLA2 with BEL inhibits thrombin-induced ROCK activation in endothelial cells. However, BEL also inhibits many other cellular enzymes, including phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (19.Fuentes L. Pérez R. Nieto M.L. Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, BEL inhibits all iPLA2 isoforms (12.Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B.

Thus, under physiological conditions, the mechanism by which iPLA2β mediates smooth muscle contraction via ROCK has not been established. Moreover, it is unknown whether iPLA2β is involved in high glucose-induced RhoA/ROCK/CPI-17 activation in VSMC and in diabetic vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility. The current study focuses on the role of iPLA2β in the calcium sensitization of smooth muscle contraction under diabetic conditions. In particular, we specifically test the hypothesis that activation of iPLA2β by hyperglycemia results in RhoA/ROCK/CPI-17 activation and thereby contributes to diabetes-associated vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility. The antibodies against iPLA2β, CPI-17, and phosphorylated CPI-17 (Thr-38) were generated in our laboratory as described previously (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The iPLA2β-null mice were generated in the laboratory of Dr. John Turk, as described elsewhere (25.Bao S. Miller D.J. Ma Z.

All of the animals were housed at an animal care facility at the Medical Center of the University of Kentucky that is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All of the animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To induce diabetes, 300–500-g Sprague-Dawley rats were induced by intravenous administration of 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) or saline as described (26.McHowat J. Creer M.H. Hicks K.K. Jones J.H.

Metab. 2000; 279: E25-E32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 7-Week-old male C57BL/6 mice, iPLA2β-null mice, and age- and gender-matched wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg of STZ or saline/kg of body weight on five consecutive days as described (27.Müller A. Schott-Ohly P. Dohle C. Gleichmann H. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Blood glucose and body weight were measured immediately before injection of STZ and at weekly intervals thereafter as described (28.Guo Z. Su W. Allen S. Pang H. Daugherty A. Smart E. Gong M.C.

Aortic arteries were isolated either from 12-week-old male db/db and gender/age-matched control mice or STZ mice as well as control mice. Isometric contractions in endothelium-denuded aortas were measured by using a “bubble chamber” as described previously (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc.

After various treatments as indicated in the text, the cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen and subject to Western blot as described (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc.

The method to label VSMC with [3H]AA and measure [3H]AA release and cellular [3H]phospholipid was performed as described (15.Guo Z. Su W. Ma Z. Smith G.M. Gong M.C. J. Biol.

The 15(S)-HETE in the supernatants of rat VSMC was extracted by C18 reverse phase columns (VWR, West Chester, PA) and measured by a specific 15(S)-HETE enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure of iPLA2β adenovirus generation, purification, and infection has been described previously (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc.

Statistical analyses were performed by using an unpaired t test or analysis of variance (GraphPad, Prim 4) and appropriate post-hoc analyses. To explore the potential role of iPLA2β in diabetic vasculopathy, we first determined whether high concentrations of glucose activate and/or up-regulate iPLA2β in primary cultured rat VSMC. We observed that high glucose significantly increased iPLA2β mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B), protein expression (Fig. 1, C and D), and iPLA2 activity (Fig. 1E) in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, high glucose did not change cytosolic PLA2α protein expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the same concentration of mannitol did not affect iPLA2β mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B), protein expression (Fig. 1, C and D), and iPLA2 activity (Fig. 1E), indicating that hyperosmolarity is not responsible for high glucose-induced iPLA2β up-regulation/activation. The assay used in Fig. 1E measures overall iPLA2 activity (22.Xie Z. Gong M.C. Su W. Turk J. Guo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25278-25289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29.Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The temporal correlation between high glucose-induced iPLA2β protein expression and iPLA2 activity at 1, 6, 12, and 72 h indicates that the increase in iPLA2 activity observed in Fig. 1E may be attributable to iPLA2β. To test this possibility, we conducted similar studies with VSMC from iPLA2β-null and WT mice (22.Xie Z. Gong M.C. Su W. Turk J. Guo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25278-25289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 1F illustrates that high glucose-stimulated iPLA2 activity in mouse VSMC, as it did in rat VSMC (Fig. 1E), but high glucose failed to significantly stimulate iPLA2 activity in iPLA2β-deficient mouse VSMC. This suggests that the high glucose-induced increase in VSMC iPLA2 activity primarily results from iPLA2β. It is well recognized that PKCβII is activated by high glucose and plays an important role in diabetic vascular complications (31.Way K.J. Katai N. King G.L. Diabet. Med. 2001; 18: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To investigate whether iPLA2β is involved in high glucose-induced PKCβII activation, we determined the effect of genetic deletion of iPLA2β or its inhibition by BEL on high glucose-induced PKCβII activation. BEL is a suicide substrate that selectively inhibits iPLA2 at concentrations that have little effect on secretory or cytosolic PLA2 activities (32.Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCβII activation was determined by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes PKCβII phosphorylation (33.Ramana K.V. Friedrich B. Tammali R. West M.B. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 818-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We found that neither inhibiting iPLA2 with BEL (Fig. 2, A and B) nor genetic deletion of iPLA2β (Fig. 2, C and D) affected high glucose-induced PKCβII activation, suggesting that PKCβII is not downstream of iPLA2β in the response to high glucose stimulation. We then tested whether PKCβII is involved in high glucose-induced iPLA2β activation. The cells were incubated with high glucose in the presence of GF109203X, which inhibits both conventional and novel PKCs including PKCβII. Surprisingly, GF109203X abolished high glucose-induced iPLA2β protein up-regulation (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that PKC is involved in such up-regulation. To investigate whether iPLA2β plays a role in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, we determined whether inhibiting iPLA2 with BEL blocks high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. Fig. 3(A and B) illustrates that, in rat VSMC, BEL abolished the high glucose-induced increase in CPI-17 phosphorylation without affecting the total CPI-17 protein expression or basal CPI-17 phosphorylation. Similar results were also obtained from human VSMC (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition to inhibiting iPLA2β, BEL also inhibits other iPLA2 family members and a variety of other enzymes (11.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the inhibition of high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation by BEL is attributable to inhibition of iPLA2β, we determined whether genetic deletion of iPLA2β in mouse aortic VSMC affects high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. Fig. 3 (C and D) illustrates that genetic deletion of iPLA2β diminished high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation without affecting total CPI-17 protein expression and basal CPI-17 phosphorylation, and this closely mimics the effects of BEL. To examine further the requirement for iPLA2β in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, we determined whether restoration of iPLA2β expression in iPLA2β-deficient VSMC by tetracycline-inducible, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer would also restore high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. Fig. 3 (E and F) illustrates that expressing iPLA2β in iPLA2β-deficient VSMC almost completely restored high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. Notably, a double band in phosphor-CPI-17 blot was observed in Fig. 3E, although its identity is currently not known. Importantly, neither adenovirus (in the absence of DOX; Fig. 3, E and F) nor doxycycline alone (data not shown) restored high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. The products of iPLA2 action on phospholipid substrates are a free fatty acid, e.g. AA, and a 2-lysophospholipid, e.g. LPC. AA can be further metabolized to a variety of biologically active eicosanoids via LO, cyclooxygenases (COX), and cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases (CytP450) (34.Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether AA and/or its metabolites are involved in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, we first determined whether high concentrations of glucose induce AA release and whether this is affected by inhibition of iPLA2β. Fig. 4A illustrates that high glucose markedly stimulated AA release from wild-type mouse VSMC and that such release was abolished in iPLA2β-null cells. To determine which AA metabolites are involved in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, rat VSMC were incubated with high glucose in the presence of the LO inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (22.Xie Z. Gong M.C. Su W. Turk J. Guo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25278-25289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the COX inhibitor indomethacin (28.Guo Z. Su W. Allen S. Pang H. Daugherty A. Smart E. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or the CytP450 inhibitor 17-octadecynoic acid (35.Fatima S. Khandekar Z. Parmentier J.H. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S3 illustrate that high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation was prevented by NDGA but unaffected by indomethacin or 17-octadecynoic acid. This suggests that LO enzyme(s) are involved in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation but that COX and CytP450 are not. Various LO(s) exhibit regiospecificity for oxygenation of AA at the 5-, 8-, 12-, or 15- positions, and these enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (34.Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine which LO(s) are expressed in VSMC, we performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using primers that specifically recognize rat 5-LO, rat leukocyte-type 12-LO, and rat platelet-type 12-LO. Fig. 4C shows that all three LO mRNAs are expressed in rat VSMC. To determine which LO(s) might be involved in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, we then incubated rat VSMC with high glucose in the presence of MK886 (a 5-LO inhibitor), baicalein (a 12-LO inhibitor), and luteolin (a 15-LO inhibitor), respectively, as described (22.Xie Z. Gong M.C. Su W. Turk J. Guo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25278-25289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We observed that luteolin diminished high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. S4) but that MK886 and baicalein did not. To determine whether luteolin and NDGA inhibit 15-LO and thereby inhibit high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation, we measured 15(S)-HETE, which is a product of rat leukocyte-type 12-LO. That enzyme is highly related to human and rabbit 15-LO, is distinct from rat platelet-type 12-LO, and is known to form both 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE (36.Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fig. 4E illustrates that high concentrations of glucose stimulated 15(S)-HETE release and that such release was abolished by luteolin and NDGA in rat VSMC. The potential role of 12/15-LO in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation was further examined in VSMC from 12/15-LO-null mice. Fig. 4F and supplemental Fig. S5 illustrate that genetic deletion of 12/15-LO abolished high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation without affecting total CPI-17 protein expression or basal CPI-17 phosphorylation. This indicates that 12/15-LOs are involved in high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation. We recently reported that activation of ROCK by high glucose is responsible for high glucose-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation in VSMC (6.Xie Z. Su W. Guo Z. Pang H. Post S.R. Gong M.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ROCK might link iPLA2β action and CPI-17 phosphorylation in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. To test this possibility, we determined whether inhibiting iPLA2β product generation by BEL or genetic deletion affects high glucose-induced ROCK activation. ROCK activation was determined by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody that selectively recognizes myosin phosphatase target subunit phosphorylation at Thr-853 (MYPT1-P), a site phosphorylated exclusively by ROCK (37.Velasco G. Armstrong C. Morrice N. Frame S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 101-104Crossref Pub"

Fsp27-null mice display increased energy expenditure and are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. However, little is known about how the Fsp27 protein is regulated. Here, we show that Fsp27 stability is controlled by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway in adipocytes. The ubiquitination of Fsp27 is regulated by three lysine residues located in the C-terminal region. Substitution of these lysine residues with alanines greatly increased Fsp27 stability and enhanced lipid storage in adipocytes. Furthermore, Fsp27 was stabilized and rapidly accumulated following treatment with β-agonists that induce lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification in adipocytes. More importantly, Fsp27 stabilization was dependent on triacylglycerol synthesis and LD formation, because knockdown of diacylglycerol acyltransferase in adipocytes significantly reduced Fsp27 accumulation in adipocytes. Finally, we observed that increased Fsp27 during β-agonist treatment preferentially associated with LDs. Taken together, our data revealed that Fsp27 can be stabilized by free fatty acid availability, triacylglycerol synthesis, and LD formation. The stabilization of Fsp27 when free fatty acids are abundant further enhances lipid storage, providing positive feedback to regulate lipid storage in adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1973879230,"Human alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) plays an important role in cellular responses by regulating the hydrolysis of ceramides in cells. Here we report its biochemical characterization, membrane topology, and activity regulation. Recombinant ACER2 was expressed in yeast mutant cells (Δypc1Δydc1) that lack endogenous ceramidase activity, and microsomes from ACER2-expressiong yeast cells were used to biochemically characterize ACER2. ACER2 catalyzed the hydrolysis of various ceramides and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. ACER2 required Ca2+ for both its in vitro and cellular activities. ACER2 has 7 putative transmembrane domains, and its amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini were found to be oriented in the lumen of the Golgi complex and cytosol, respectively. ACER2 mutant (ACER2ΔN36) lacking the N-terminal tail (the first 36 amino acid residues) exhibited undetectable activity and was mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the N-terminal tail is necessary for both ACER2 activity and Golgi localization. ACER2 mutant (ACER2ΔN13) lacking the first 13 residues was also mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum although it retained ceramidase activity. Overexpression of ACER2, ACER2ΔN13, but not ACER2ΔN36 increased the release of sphingosine 1-phosphate from cells, suggesting that its mislocalization does not affect the ability of ACER2 to regulate sphingosine 1-phosphate secretion. However, overexpression of ACER2 but not ACER2ΔN13 or ACER2ΔN36 inhibited the glycosylation of integrin β1 subunit and Lamp1, suggesting that its mistargeting abolishes the ability of ACER2 to regulation protein glycosylation. These data suggest that ACER2 has broad substrate specificity and requires Ca2+ for its activity and that ACER2 has the cytosolic C terminus and luminal N terminus, which are essential for its activity, correct cellular localization, and regulation for protein glycosylation. Human alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) plays an important role in cellular responses by regulating the hydrolysis of ceramides in cells. Here we report its biochemical characterization, membrane topology, and activity regulation. Recombinant ACER2 was expressed in yeast mutant cells (Δypc1Δydc1) that lack endogenous ceramidase activity, and microsomes from ACER2-expressiong yeast cells were used to biochemically characterize ACER2. ACER2 catalyzed the hydrolysis of various ceramides and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. ACER2 required Ca2+ for both its in vitro and cellular activities. ACER2 has 7 putative transmembrane domains, and its amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini were found to be oriented in the lumen of the Golgi complex and cytosol, respectively. ACER2 mutant (ACER2ΔN36) lacking the N-terminal tail (the first 36 amino acid residues) exhibited undetectable activity and was mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that the N-terminal tail is necessary for both ACER2 activity and Golgi localization. ACER2 mutant (ACER2ΔN13) lacking the first 13 residues was also mislocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum although it retained ceramidase activity. Overexpression of ACER2, ACER2ΔN13, but not ACER2ΔN36 increased the release of sphingosine 1-phosphate from cells, suggesting that its mislocalization does not affect the ability of ACER2 to regulate sphingosine 1-phosphate secretion. However, overexpression of ACER2 but not ACER2ΔN13 or ACER2ΔN36 inhibited the glycosylation of integrin β1 subunit and Lamp1, suggesting that its mistargeting abolishes the ability of ACER2 to regulation protein glycosylation. These data suggest that ACER2 has broad substrate specificity and requires Ca2+ for its activity and that ACER2 has the cytosolic C terminus and luminal N terminus, which are essential for its activity, correct cellular localization, and regulation for protein glycosylation.

Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2005; 77: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ceramide, SPH, and S1P are bioactive lipids that mediate various cellular responses. Both ceramides and SPH have been shown to induce cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis (3.Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 4.Cuvillier O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, S1P mainly promotes cell proliferation and survival (5.Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Due to the opposing role of ceramide and SPH versus S1P in cell survival and proliferation, it has been suggested that the balance between ceramide/SPH and S1P levels may determine the fate of the cell to proliferate and live or to undergo growth arrest and die (5.Spiegel S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, as key enzymes that regulate the metabolism of these bioactive lipids, ceramidases may play an important role in cell fate decision.ACER2 is one of three human alkaline ceramidases that we recently cloned (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We demonstrated by Northern blot and quantitative PCR that ACER2 mRNA is expressed highly in the placenta but moderately in other tissues (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ACER2 is a Golgi membrane protein with several putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moderate ectopic expression of ACER2 promotes cell proliferation and survival probably by decreasing levels of ceramides while elevating levels of S1P (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high ectopic expression of ACER2 causes fragmentation of the Golgi complex and inhibits cell proliferation due to an aberrant increase in the cellular levels of SPH (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ACER2 is actively involved in cell fate decisions by controlling the relative levels of ceramides, SPH, and S1P. In addition to cell growth and survival, our recent studies demonstrated that ACER2 has an important role in regulating protein glycosylation in the Golgi complex (7.Sun W. Hu W. Xu R. Jin J. Szulc Z.M. Zhang G. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 658-666Google Scholar). ACER2 overexpression inhibits the glycosylation of the precursor of the integrin β1 subunit (β1), resulting in an inhibition of β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrices. In contrast, ACER2 down-regulation by RNA interference enhances the glycosylation of the integrin β1 subunit, thus promoting cell adhesion. We also demonstrated that ACER2 expression is up-regulated in cells by serum deprivation (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or all-trans-retinoic acid (7.Sun W. Hu W. Xu R. Jin J. Szulc Z.M. Zhang G. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 658-666Google Scholar) but down-regulated by the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (7.Sun W. Hu W. Xu R. Jin J. Szulc Z.M. Zhang G. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 658-666Google Scholar), suggesting that ACER2 is a highly regulated protein.Although ACER2 plays such an important role in cellular responses, much remains unknown about its biochemical properties, membrane topology, and activity regulation. In this study, we show that ACER2 uses various ceramide species as substrates and that it requires Ca2+ for both its in vitro and cellular activity. We also find that the amino (N) terminus and carboxyl (C) terminus are oriented in the lumen of the Golgi complex and cytosol, respectively, and that the N-terminal tail is required for both ACER2 activity and Golgi localization. Finally, we demonstrate that its localization to the Golgi complex is essential for ACER2 to regulate protein glycosylation in the Golgi complex. Thus, this study not only reveals biochemical properties and membrane topology of ACER2 but also identifies Ca2+ in the lumen of the Golgi complex as a key regulator of the metabolism of sphingolipids.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we took advantage of our previously generated yeast mutant strain that lacks any endogenous ceramidase activity to express a recombinant ACER2 and characterize it biochemically. We demonstrated that similar to its yeast and mammalian homologues, the recombinant ACER2 has an alkaline pH optimum for its in vitro activity. ACER2 has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of most mammalian ceramide species. In vitro, ACER2 is activated by the specific cation Ca2+, and ACER2 requires Ca2+ in the lumen of the Golgi complex for its cellular activity. Our study for the first time revealed that luminal Ca2+ is required for the catabolism of sphingolipids. We also determined that the N-terminal tail is oriented in the lumen of the Golgi complex and is required for both ACER2 activity and Golgi localization. We also present evidence that Golgi localization is essential for ACER2 to regulate protein glycosylation. These studies provide a molecular and cellular basis for understanding the physiological and pathological function of ACER2.We showed that ACER2 has broad substrate specificity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of various mammalian ceramide species with a preference for unsaturated long-chain ceramides. Consistent with its in vitro substrate specificity, we previously demonstrated that ACER2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of most ceramide species in cells because overexpression of ACER2 decreases their levels in HeLa cells (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The role of ACER2 in catalyzing the hydrolysis of various ceramides in cells is further confirmed in this study. We previously demonstrated that ACER1, a homologue of ACER2, prefers ceramides with very long-chain unsaturated fatty acids with a minor activity toward ceramides with very long-chain saturated ceramides but had no activity toward saturated long-chain ceramides such as d-e- C16:0-ceramide (16.Sun W. Xu R. Hu W. Jin J. Crellin H.A. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Thiers B.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 389-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with its substrate specificity, ACER1 only catalyzes the hydrolysis of very long-chain ceramides in cells as ACER1 overexpression causes a decrease in very long-chain ceramides (d-e-C24:0-ceramide and d-e-C24:1) but not long-chain ceramide (d-e-C16-ceramide) or medium-chain ceramide (d-e-C14-ceramide) (16.Sun W. Xu R. Hu W. Jin J. Crellin H.A. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Thiers B.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 389-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Very recently, we demonstrated that ACER3, another ACER2 homologue that was previously referred to as haPHC (8.Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26577-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), only used unsaturated long-chain (C18:1, C20:1, C20:4) ceramides but not any other ceramides as substrates. 4Hu, W., Xu, R., Sun, W., Szulc, Z. M., Bielawski, J., Obeid, L. M., and Mao, C. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 7964–7976. These results suggest that the three human alkaline ceramidases have distinct substrate specificity although they share a high degree of similarity in protein sequence. ACER2 also differs in the substrate specificity from the acid ceramidase, which prefers ceramides with medium acyl chains (20.Koch J. Gärtner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The rat and human neutral ceramidases were shown to use ceramides with saturated or unsaturated long and very long acyl groups as substrates (21.El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 22.Usta J. El Bawab S. Roddy P. Szulc Z.M. Yusuf Hannun A. Bielawska A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9657-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.El Bawab S. Usta J. Roddy P. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that among the known ceramidases, ACER2 is closest in substrate specificity to the neutral ceramidase. Interestingly, it is noteworthy that ACER2 does not hydrolyze d-e-C12-NBD-ceramide, a good substrate for the neutral ceramidase ASAH2 (23.El Bawab S. Usta J. Roddy P. Szulc Z.M. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ACER2 activity can be distinguished from ASAH2 activity by using this synthetic ceramide analogue as substrate.In vitro ACER2 activity is markedly increased by Ca2+ but not by other divalent cations, suggesting that ACER2 specifically requires Ca2+ for its optimal in vitro activity. We demonstrated that ACER2 overexpression caused a substantial increase in the levels of SPH in resting HeLa cells, indicating that ACER2 is constitutively activated by intracellular Ca2+. As ACER2 is a transmembrane Golgi protein, it can be activated by Ca2+ either in the cytosol or in the lumen of the Golgi complex. We showed that the depletion of Ca2+ from the cytosol by BAPTA-AM only slightly inhibited the ACER2-catalyzed generation of SPH in cells, suggesting that free cytosolic Ca2+ is not required for ACER2 cellular activity. In contrast, treatment with THAP, which has been shown to decrease [Ca2+]g (17.Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Rizzuto R. Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), nearly abolished the ability of ACER2 to generate SPH in cells. Although THAP also decreases [Ca2+] in other intracellular Ca2+ stores, such as the ER, its inhibitory effect on ACER2 cellular activity appears to be linked to a decrease in [Ca2+]g rather than other effects. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, treatment with THAP increased rather than decreased ceramides in ACER2-TET-ON cells, suggesting that THAP does not inhibit the biosynthesis of ceramides. Second, ceramides are transported from the ER to the Golgi complex where they are incorporated into sphingomyelins. This process was not affected by THAP treatment because we demonstrated that treatment with THAP increased rather than decreased the levels of sphingomyelins. Third, we found that treatment with THAP did not alter the cellular localization of ACER2. These results suggest that the THAP-induced decrease in [Ca2+]g attenuates the ACER2-mediated generation of SPH directly by inhibiting cellular ACER2 activity rather than by depleting its cellular substrates or altering its cellular localization. Based on these observations, we conclude that ACER2 requires Ca2+ in the lumen of the Golgi complex for its cellular activity.Protein sequence analysis does not reveal a known Ca2+-binding motif in ACER2, suggesting that ACER2 may have a novel Ca2+-binding motif. Unlike other conventional Ca2+-binding proteins or enzymes, ACER2 requires a relatively high [Ca2+] for its activity, suggesting that this novel Ca2+-binding motif, if exists, may bind to Ca2+ with a high dissociation constant (Kd). [Ca2+]g is ∼300 μm in resting HeLa cells (24.Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Ca2+ at this concentration maximally activated in vitro ACER2 activity, suggesting that Golgi Ca2+ fully activates ACER2 in resting cells. If this hypothesis is correct, cellular ACER2 activity is likely inhibited by stimuli or genetic conditions that decrease [Ca2+]g. Mutations of the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SPCA1/ATP2C1) decrease [Ca2+]g in epidermal keratinocytes, the major cell type of the epidermis, and causes Hailey-Hailey disease manifested by the formation of painful blisters on the skin (25.Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein Jr., E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). With reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we demonstrated that ACER2 is expressed in the epidermis (data not shown). It is interesting to know whether ACER2 activity is inhibited in patients with Hailey-Hailey disease (benign familial pemphigus), and if so, whether ACER2 inhibition contributes to the symptom development of the disease.As mentioned earlier, ACER2 has 7 putative TMDs. Consistent with the finding of an odd TMD number, we demonstrated that the N and C termini are oppositely oriented in the Golgi lumen and cytosol, respectively. The ACER2 mutant lacking the entire luminal N-terminal tail (the first 36 amino acids) was mainly localized to the ER rather than the Golgi complex, suggesting that the N-terminal tail is important for targeting of ACER2 to the Golgi complex. The ACER2 mutant is localized mainly to the ER, suggesting that ACER2 has an ER retrieval signal in a region outside the N-terminal tail. In the wild-type ACER2, this ER retrieval signal may be quenched by a Golgi targeting signal residing in the N-terminal tail, thus, it is correctly targeted to the Golgi complex. The Golgi targeting signal must reside in the region between the first and 13th amino acid residues because deletion of the first 13 amino acid residues at the N terminus renders ACER2 translocation from the Golgi complex to the ER. This region is distinct in amino acid sequence from the corresponding region of ACER1, an ER alkaline ceramidase that shares a high similarity in overall protein sequence to ACER2, further supporting the importance of this region in Golgi targeting. However, whether this region is sufficient for ACER2 to target to the Golgi complex is currently unknown. Studies on the Golgi targeting of membrane-bound proteins with a single TMD demonstrated that Golgi targeting can be determined by the length and composition of the TMD or a signal sequence(s) in various regions including the cytoplasmic N terminus, the combined cytoplasmic terminus and TMD, or luminal regions (26.van Dijk A.D. Bosch D. ter Braak C.J. van der Krol A.R. van Ham R.C. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1779-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Luo et al. (27.Luo X. Feng L. Jiang X. Xiao F. Wang Z. Feng G.S. Chen Y. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that deleting the N-terminal tail or C-terminal tail, or replacing some of inter-TMD cytosolic or luminal loops of progesterone and adipoQ receptor 3, PAQR3 with 7 TMDs, also known as RKTG (Raf kinase trapping to Golgi), abolishes its localization to the Golgi complex. These observations suggest that multiple structural determinants are required for Golgi targeting of proteins with single TMD or multiple TMDs. This rule may also apply to ACER2.We demonstrated that the ACER2 mutant lacking the first 36 amino acid residues had undetectable alkaline ceramidase activity, whereas the ACER2 mutant lacking the first 13 amino acid residues remains active, suggesting that the region between the 14th and 36th amino acid residues is critical for ACER2 activity. Sequence alignment reveals that this region is highly conserved among known alkaline ceramidases, suggesting that this region in other alkaline ceramidases may also be critical for their activities. In addition to the N-terminal tail, the three putative luminal loops are highly conversed among all alkaline ceramidases, whereas the C terminus and three putative cytosolic loops are much less or not conserved at all (6.Xu R. Jin J. Hu W. Sun W. Bielawski J. Szulc Z. Taha T. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1813-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This suggests that the active site of ACER2 may be located in the lumen of the Golgi complex. This view is in line with the finding that ACER2 is activated by Ca2+ in the Golgi lumen but not in the cytosol. The N-terminal tail of ACER2 may contain part or the whole active site of the enzyme, so its deletion renders ACER2 inactive. Based on these observations, we conclude that ACER2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides to generate SPH likely in the Golgi lumen.Cellular localization is important for proteins or enzymes to exert their biological function. Our data suggest that mistargeting of ACER2 affects some of its biological roles. We previously demonstrated that SPH generated by ACER2 in the Golgi complex inhibits glycosylation of the β1 integrin subunit (19.Sun W. Hu W. Xu R. Jin J. Szulc Z.M. Zhang G. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that ACER2 overexpression also inhibited glycosylation of Lamp1, a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein, thus resulting in a shift of electrophoretic mobility. These results suggest that SPH generated by ACER2 in the Golgi complex has a general inhibitory effect on protein glycosylation. To our knowledge, SPH is the first endogenous bioactive lipid that inhibits protein glycosylation specifically in the Golgi complex. In contrast to SPH generated in the Golgi complex, SPH generated by the enzymatically active mutant ACER2ΔN13 in the ER failed to inhibit glycosylation of the integrin β1 subunit or Lamp1, suggesting that Golgi targeting of ACER2 is necessary for its ability to regulate protein glycosylation in the Golgi complex. This finding is in line with our previous study showing that SPH generated in the ER by overexpression of ACER1, an ER ceramidase, fails to inhibit glycosylation of the integrin β1 subunit in the Golgi complex (7.Sun W. Hu W. Xu R. Jin J. Szulc Z.M. Zhang G. Galadari S.H. Obeid L.M. Mao C. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 658-666Google Scholar). These two studies also clearly suggest that SPH generated in the ER cannot be transported in the free form to the Golgi complex.We previously demonstrated that ACER2 has the ability to regulate cell proliferation mediated by S1P and its receptors. Our finding that overexpression of ACER2 in Golgi complex or its active mutant in the ER increased the levels of extracellular S1P, suggests that S1P generated from SPH either in the Golgi complex or the ER is secreted extracellularly. Therefore, mislocalization of ACER2 does not abolish its ability to control the release of S1P from cells. It is noteworthy that ACER2 mislocalization may quantitatively affect S1P release because ACER2 may produce SPH, the S1P precursor, to different levels in the ER and Golgi complex due to differences in the availability of its substrates in these two organelles. The current study with transient transfection cannot address this issue because the expression levels of ACER2 and its mutant were different.In conclusion, we demonstrated that ACER2 has broad substrate specificity. Consistent with its in vitro activity, ACER2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of various cellular ceramides. ACER2 has an odd number of TMDs, and its N and C termini are oriented in the Golgi lumen and cytosol, respectively. The N terminus is essential for ACER2 activity, Golgi localization, and certain biological functions. ACER2 requires Ca2+ for its optimal activity both in vitro and in cells. Luminal Ca2+ is required for the catabolism of sphingolipids by activating ACER2 in cells, suggesting that ACER2 may mediate Ca2+-induced cellular responses.

We investigated whether the trafficking and assembly of Cx43 and Cx32 into GJs were contingent upon cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin. We also examined the role of the carboxyl termini of these Cxs in initiating the formation of GJs. Using cadherin and Cx-null cells, and by introducing Cx43 and Cx32, either alone or in combination with E-cadherin, our studies demonstrated that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion was neither essential nor sufficient to initiate GJ assembly de novo in A431D human squamous carcinoma cells. However, E-cadherin facilitated the growth and assembly of preformed GJs composed of Cx43, although the growth of cells on Transwell filters was required to initiate the assembly of Cx32. Our results also documented that the carboxyl termini of both Cxs were required in this cell type to initiate the formation of GJs de novo. Our findings also showed that GJ puncta composed of Cx43 co-localized extensively with ZO-1 and actin fibers at cell peripheries and that ZO-1 knockdown attenuated Cx43 assembly. These findings suggest that the assembly of Cx43 and Cx32 into GJs is differentially modulated by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and that direct or indirect cross-talk between carboxyl tails of Cxs and actin cytoskeleton via ZO-1 may regulate GJ assembly and growth.

https://openalex.org/W2033021781,"Factor VIII (FVIII) plays a critical role in blood coagulation by forming the tenase complex with factor IXa and calcium ions on a membrane surface containing negatively charged phospholipids. The tenase complex activates factor X during blood coagulation. The carboxyl-terminal C2 domain of FVIII is the main membrane-binding and von Willebrand factor-binding region of the protein. Mutations of FVIII cause hemophilia A, whereas elevation of FVIII activity is a risk factor for thromboembolic diseases. The C2 domain-membrane interaction has been proposed as a target of intervention for regulation of blood coagulation. A number of molecules that interrupt FVIII or factor V (FV) binding to cell membranes have been identified through high throughput screening or structure-based design. We report crystal structures of the FVIII C2 domain under three new crystallization conditions, and a high resolution (1.15 A) crystal structure of the FVIII C2 domain bound to a small molecular inhibitor. The latter structure shows that the inhibitor binds to the surface of an exposed beta-strand of the C2 domain, Trp(2313)-His(2315). This result indicates that the Trp(2313)-His(2315) segment is an important constituent of the membrane-binding motif and provides a model to understand the molecular mechanism of the C2 domain membrane interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2118795087,"The anionic phospholipid cardiolipin and its precursor phosphatidylglycerol are synthesized and localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane of eukaryotes. They are required for structural integrity and optimal activities of a large number of mitochondrial proteins and complexes. Previous studies showed that loss of anionic phospholipids leads to cell inviability in the absence of mitochondrial DNA. However, the mechanism linking loss of anionic phospholipids to petite lethality was unclear. To elucidate the mechanism, we constructed a crd1Deltarho degrees mutant, which is viable and mimics phenotypes of pgs1Delta in the petite background. We found that loss of cardiolipin in rho degrees cells leads to elevated expression of Swe1p, a morphogenesis checkpoint protein. Moreover, the retrograde pathway is activated in crd1Deltarho degrees cells, most likely due to the exacerbation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, the expression of SWE1 is dependent on retrograde regulation as elevated expression of SWE1 is suppressed by deletion of RTG2 or RTG3. Taken together, these findings indicate that activation of the retrograde pathway leads to up-regulation of SWE1 in crd1Deltarho degrees cells. These results suggest that anionic phospholipids are required for processes that are essential for normal cell division in rho degrees cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992996578,"Expression of gp78, an E3 ubiquitin ligase in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, is associated with tumor malignancy. To study gp78 overexpression in mammary gland development and tumorigenicity, we generated murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat-driven gp78 transgenic mice. Embryos carrying the gp78 transgene cassette were implanted in FVB surrogate mothers, and two founders with high copy integration showed elevated gp78 expression at both transcript and protein levels at the virgin stage and at 12 days gestation. Transgenic mammary glands showed increased ductal branching, dense alveolar lobule formation, and secondary terminal end bud development. Bromodeoxyuridine staining showed increased proliferation in hyperplastic ductal regions at the virgin stage and at 12 days gestation compared with wild type mice. Reduced expression of the metastasis suppressor KAI1, a gp78 endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrate, demonstrates that gp78 ubiquitin ligase activity is increased in MMTV-gp78 mammary gland. Similarly, metastatic MDA-435 cells exhibit increased gp78 expression, decreased KAI1 expression, and elevated proliferation compared with nonmetastatic MCF7 cells whose proliferation was enhanced upon knockdown of KAI1. Importantly, stable gp78 knockdown HEK293 cells showed increased KAI1 expression and reduced proliferation that was rescued upon KAI1 knockdown, demonstrating that gp78 regulation of cell proliferation is mediated by KAI1. Mammary tumorigenesis was not observed in repeatedly pregnant MMTV-long terminal repeat-gp78 transgenic mice over a period of 18 months post-birth. Elevated gp78 ubiquitin ligase activity is therefore not sufficient for mammary tumorigenesis. However, the hyperplastic phenotype observed in mammary glands of MMTV-gp78 transgenic mice identifies a novel role for gp78 expression in enhancing mammary epithelial cell proliferation and nontumorigenic ductal outgrowth."

Several APHs have been extensively characterized, including the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of two APH(3′) isozymes and an APH(2″) enzyme. Although many APHs are plasmid-encoded and are capable of inactivating numerous 2-deoxystreptmaine aminoglycosides with multiple regiospecificity, APH(9)-Ia, isolated from Legionella pneumophila, is an unusual enzyme among the APH family for its chromosomal origin and its specificity for a single non-2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside substrate, spectinomycin. We describe here the crystal structures of APH(9)-Ia in its apo form, its binary complex with the nucleotide, AMP, and its ternary complex bound with ADP and spectinomycin. The structures reveal that APH(9)-Ia adopts the bilobal protein kinase-fold, analogous to the APH(3′) and APH(2″) enzymes. However, APH(9)-Ia differs significantly from the other two types of APH enzymes in its substrate binding area and that it undergoes a conformation change upon ligand binding. Moreover, kinetic assay experiments indicate that APH(9)-Ia has stringent substrate specificity as it is unable to phosphorylate substrates of choline kinase or methylthioribose kinase despite high structural resemblance.

Aminoglycosides are a class of commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome. They are characterized by their signature chemical structure, an aminocyclitol nucleus. These antibiotics can be further categorized into two groups: the first group includes those that contain a 2-deoxystreptamine core, such as kanamycin, and the second, smaller group includes those that contain a non-2-deoxystreptamine core (Fig. 1A). Spectinomycin has a streptamine core and it is used in the treatment of acute gonococcal infections (1.Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Glupczynski Y. Tulkens P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 727-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the efficacy of aminoglycosides has been compromised due to the continuous rise of drug resistance in pathogens. Resistance to aminoglycosides can be attributed to several mechanisms, of which enzymatic inactivation of the aminoglycoside is the most prevalent in the clinical setting. Aminoglycosides can be inactivated by the addition of an acetyl, a nucleotidyl, or a phosphate group by acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases, or phosphotransferases (kinases; APHs), 5The abbreviations used are: APHaminoglycoside phosphotransferasesAPH(9)-Ia9-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type IaAPH(3′)-IIIa3′,5″-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type IIIaCKcholine kinaseMTRKmethylthioribose kinaseePKeukaryotic protein kinaseAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphatePDBProtein Data Bank. respectively (2.Shaw K.J.

These three enzymes share similar substrate specificities: 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides. Despite low sequence similarities, the structures revealed that their overall fold is related to that of eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs). However, in contrast to many ePKs that undergo a substantial conformation change from the open to closed state upon ligand binding, the structural differences between apo and ligand-bound APH(3′)-IIIa (and inferred for APH(3′)-IIa and APH(2″)-IIa) are localized (12.Burk D.L.

So far, much effort has been focused on studying APH enzymes that inactivate aminoglycosides containing a 2-deoxystreptamine core. In contrast, relatively little is known about the remaining members of the APH family, i.e. those that inactivate aminoglycosides with a non-2-deoxystreptamine core. Moreover, considering the diversity in the APH enzyme family in terms of their source, location of the gene in the bacteria, amino acid sequence, regiospecificity, and the size and range of substrate specificity, the three available APH crystal structures offer a finite amount of information for the development of broad range inhibitors and effective antibiotics. We have therefore undertaken the structural studies of APH(9)-Ia from Legionella pneumophila (GenBank protein code AAB58447), a disparate APH that will broaden our understanding of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (Fig. 1B). Many aph genes, including aph(3′)-IIa and aph(3′)-IIIa, exist as part of a plasmid or transposable element that can be widely distributed. The enzymes they encode possess broad substrate spectrums, having the ability to detoxify multiple 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides with multiple regiospecificity and high efficiency (8.Thompson P.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, APH(9)-Ia is chromosomally encoded in the human pathogen L. pneumophila, and specifically phosphorylates spectinomcyin (8.Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Suter T.M. Viswanathan V.K. Cianciotto N.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other spectinomycin phosphotransferases have recently been identified, SpcN and APH(9)-Ib (Fig. 1B) (25.Kim K.R. Kim T.J. Suh J.W. Curr. Microbiol. 2008; 57: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26.Thapa L.P. Oh T.J. Liou K. Sohng J.K. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2008; 105: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These two are found in spectinomycin producing streptomyces (in contrast to APH(9)-Ia) and are about 70% identical in sequence. In comparison, APH(9)-Ia shares ∼18% sequence identity with SpcN and APH(9)-Ib. APH(9) enzymes are the only type of APH capable of inactivating spectinomycin and they exclusively phosphorylate the hydroxyl group at position 9. APH(9)-Ia has been shown to carry out its activity using the same mechanism and posses the equivalent catalytically critical residues (Lys-52 and Asp-212) as APH(3′)-IIIa (8.Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme is highly efficient with kcat/Km values in the range of 106m−1 s−1 (8.Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), APH(9)-Ia appears to confer only moderate levels of resistance to spectinomycin for L. pneumophila (24.Suter T.M. Viswanathan V.K. Cianciotto N.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the extent of L. pneumophila exposure to spectinomycin is likely low as Legionnaires disease, the infectious manifestation of L. pneumophila, is not typically treated with spectinomycin. Therefore, it has been suggested that APH(9)-Ia might play a minor role in protecting L. pneumophila against the effects of spectinomycin or it might play a role in an as yet undetermined function in the context of L. pneumophila. Note that the genome sequences of four L. pneumophila strains (27.Cazalet C. Rusniok C. Brüggemann H. Zidane N. Magnier A. Ma L. Tichit M. Jarraud S. Bouchier C. Vandenesch F. Kunst F. Etienne J.

Efforts to circumvent bacterial resistance depend on our knowledge of the diversity in the APH family. We herein report three key crystal structures of APH(9)-Ia, an APH that differs greatly from those APHs with known structures, in terms of genetic context, sequence, and substrate spectrum and specificity. The structures of APH(9)-Ia in its apo, binary, and ternary states will be described and a comparison with other APHs and structurally homologous kinases will be presented. The construction of the cloning vector and protein expression and purification for APH(9)-Ia have been previously reported (30.Lemke C.T. Hwang J. Xiong B. Cianciotto N.P. Berghuis A.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). APH(9)-Ia in which methionine residues were substituted by selenomethionines (APH(9)-IaSe-Met) was produced in a similar manner to the unmodified protein except that minimal medium was used instead of Luria broth and a mixture of amino acids (100 mg/liter of Lys, Phe, and Thr; 50 mg/liter of Val, Ile, and Leu; and 60 mg/liter of selenomethionine) were added approximately one doubling time prior to induction. This combination of metabolites serves to inhibit methionine biosynthesis while providing a ready supply of selenomethionine for incorporation into newly synthesized polypeptides. Protein purification was then carried out as described for the unmodified enzyme, with the addition of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in all buffers to prevent oxidation of the selenium. Crystallization conditions for APH(9)-Ia in its apo state and in the presence of ADP and spectinomycin have been described elsewhere (30.Lemke C.T. Hwang J. Xiong B. Cianciotto N.P. Berghuis A.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Crystals of APH(9)-IaSe-Met were obtained under identical conditions as the apoenzyme crystals. APH(9)-Ia in complex with AMP was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The APH(9)-Ia-AMP crystals were obtained in drops containing equal volumes of protein and precipitant solutions where the protein solution consisted of 7.5 mg/ml of APH(9)-Ia in 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 4 mm AMP-PNP, and 10 mm MnCl2, and the precipitant solution contained 15% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.2 m calcium acetate. All diffraction data were collected at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY), equipped with an ADSC Quantum CCD detector. Prior to data collection, crystals were flash frozen in a cold stream of gaseous nitrogen and data collection was conducted at 100 K. For the APH(9)-IaSe-Met crystals, three-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected for phase determination.

Calculations for phase determination of the APH(9)-IaSe-Met data were performed using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing protocols incorporated into the program CNS (33.Brünger A.

Reciprocal space refinement was alternated with rounds of manual rebuilding, and the values of Rcryst and Rfree were used to monitor the progress of refinement. The model of APH(9)-Ia obtained was further refined against the 1.7-Å APH(9)-Ia data. The structures of APH(9)-Ia-AMP and APH(9)-Ia-ADP-spectinomycin were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (35.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar), using the high resolution APH(9)-Ia structure as the search model. Refinement of the ligand-bound APH(9)-Ia followed procedures analogous to that for the apoenzyme. Although AMP-PNP was used for crystallization of the binary complex, only the nucleoside monophosphate could be placed unambiguously in the available electron density, thus the β- and γ-phosphates were omitted in the final structure.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme assays to assess alternative substrates for APH(9)-Ia were performed using the procedure described by Thompson et al. (8.Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Cianciotto N.P. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14788-14795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of spectinomycin by APH(9)-Ia was monitored by coupling the release of ADP to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of APH(9)-Ia activity was reflected in the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the depletion of NADH in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Assays were measured using a Varian single-cell UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a thermo-equilibrated cell block. Data were fit to Equation 1 with nonlinear regression using Grafit version 5.0.1 software, and Michaelis-Menten parameters, Km and kcat, were determined. v0=kcat[Et][s]Km(app)+[S](Eq. 1) Choline, ethanolamine, and glycerol were obtained from Sigma; methylthioribose was generously donated by Dr. Michael Riscoe, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR. Kanamycin and streptomycin were used as negative controls and spectinomycin was used as the positive control. All assays were conducted in triplicates with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. The concentration of ATP was 1 mm, whereas the test substrates was 0.1 mm. The crystal structure of APH(9)-Ia was determined in its apo state at 1.7-Å resolution, the binary state (with nucleotide, AMP) at 2.8-Å, and the ternary complex state (with ADP and the substrate, spectinomycin) at 2.4-Å (Table 1). These three structures reveal that the 331-residue enzyme adopts a fold reminiscent of ePKs. APH(9)-Ia is a C-shaped molecule composed of two lobes, a small β-strand-rich N-terminal lobe (residues 1–101) and a larger α-helix-rich C-terminal lobe (residues 116–331), which are joined by a 12-residue linker (residues 102–115) (Fig. 2A). The core of the N-terminal lobe consists of a twisted 5-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β1–β5), as previously observed in ePKs. The lobe also contains two α-helices (α1 and α2), one on either face of the β-sheet. Helix α2 lies parallel to β4 and forms interactions with the C-terminal lobe. The C-terminal lobe can be subdivided into two intimately associated regions: an α/β“core” region consisting of four helices (α3-α6) and four strands (β6–β9), and an α-helical “thumb” region comprised of helices αA–αE. β7 runs antiparallel to β8, forming a β-sheet akin to that in ePKs. The Brenner motif (HXDXXXXN) (36.Brenner S. Nature. 1987; 329: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), found in many enzymes catalyzing phosphoryl transfer reactions including aminoglycoside phosphotransferases and ePKs, was located in the loop connecting β6 and β7 in the core region. The extended activation loop found in ePKs was absent in the APH enzymes. The segment following the DFG motif (DWD in APH(9)-Ia) between β8 and α5 is a β-strand (β9) and forms a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with β6. To date, the structures of three aminoglycoside APH enzymes have been reported: APH(3′)-IIa (15.Nurizzo D. Shewry S.C. Perlin M.H. Brown S.A. Dholakia J.N. Fuchs R.L. Deva T. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), APH(3′)-IIIa (12.Burk D.L. Hon W.C. Leung A.K. Berghuis A.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14.Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M.

Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and APH(2″)-IIa (16.Young P.G. Walanj R. Lakshmi V. Byrnes L.J. Metcalf P. Baker E.N. Vakulenko S.B. Smith C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4133-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The two APH(3′) isozymes share 33% sequence identity, identical phosphorylation targets, nearly identical substrate specificity profiles, and possess an essentially identical fold. APH(2″)-IIa is 11 and 15% identical in sequence to APH(3′)-IIa and APH(3′)-IIIa, respectively. The enzyme has a comparable substrate specificity and a similarly arranged two-domain structure as the APH(3′) isozymes but differs in its phosphorylation target. In contrast, APH(9)-Ia shows low similarity in sequence to either APH(3′)-IIa/IIIa or APH(2″)-IIa, its substrate profile contains only one aminoglycoside, and its sole substrate belongs to a small group distinct from those that can be phosphorylated by the APH(3′) isozymes or APH(2″)-IIa. However, the structure reveals that APH(9)-Ia has a fold that is homologous to that of the other three APH enzymes, thus placing it in the same family (Fig. 2, A–C). The overall structure of APH(9)-Ia is less compact relative to APH(3′)-IIa/IIIa and more comparable with APH(2″)-IIa, and has a large, solvent-exposed central cavity for ligand binding. The most prominent differences are located in the thumb region of APH(9)-Ia, where there are two additional helices (αC and αE) compared with APH(3′)-IIa and -IIIa and αB is absent in APH(2″)-IIa but has a slightly longer αD helix containing a kink. However, there are numerous subtle differences in the structure throughout the fold, such as the size and topological variations of the helices and strands. This results in 8, 9, and 9% identity between APH(9)-Ia and APH(3′)-IIa, APH(3′)-IIIa, and APH(2″)-IIa, respectively. Overall, a mere 37 residues can be considered to be structurally conserved among all four APH enzymes (i.e. 11% of APH(9)-Ia), and among these only 9 are identical (i.e. 3% of APH(9)-Ia). This underscores the diversity within the APH family of enzymes. The three crystal structures of APH(9)-Ia provide four crystallographically independent views of the enzyme as the apo crystals contain two distinct protein molecules per asymmetric unit. Comparison of these four views reveals that the enzyme displays open and closed conformations. The structures of the apoenzyme are in an open conformation, whereas the binary and ternary complex structures display the closed conformation, indicating that the conformational differences are linked to the presence or absence of the nucleotide ligand (Fig. 2A). The structures provide no evidence of further domain movement triggered by the binding of the substrate spectinomycin. The conformational change in APH(9)-Ia that ensues upon the binding of the nucleotide is akin to that observed in ePKs (38.Narayana N. Cox S. Nguyen-huu X. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Structure. 1997; 5: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3) and is clearly a unique departure from APH(3′)-IIa/IIIa and APH(2″)-IIa. The absence of domain motion has been most thoroughly examined in APH(3′)-IIIa (12.Burk D.L. Hon W.C. Leung A.K. Berghuis A.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here this lack of motion was attributed to the close association between the N- and C-terminal lobes via hydrogen bond interactions between α2 and the loop flanked by α4 and αA, resulting in limited lobe flexibility. Although α2 of APH(9)-Ia is in an equivalent location, the shape and position of the loop between α3 (analogous to α4 in APH(3′)-IIIa) and αA differ significantly. As a result, only one hydrogen bond is observed between the two lobes and this may contribute to the ease of domain movement in APH(9)-Ia. Examination of the domain motion using DynDom (40.Hayward S. Kitao A. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) shows that the five-stranded β-sheet in the N-terminal lobe and the N-terminal portion of helix α2 (residue 58–61) can rotate ∼20° with respect to the C-terminal lobe and the rest of helix α2 (residue 62–72) via three hinge regions: residues 53–62 and 79–80, which flank helix α2, and residues 101–102 in the linker region, which function as the pivot (Fig. 3). Maximum displacement in the moving domain between the open and closed conformations is ∼13 Å. Domain allocation and the extent of movement observed in APH(9)-Ia is comparable with that of protein kinase A (41.Hayward"

We have used a cell-free system to dissect the mechanism by which MSK1 phosphorylates histone H3 within the c-fos chromatin. Here, we show that the reconstituted c-fos chromatin presents a strong barrier to histone H3 phosphorylation by MSK1; however, the activators (serum response factor, Elk-1, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and ATF1) bound on their cognate sites recruit MSK1 to phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10 within the chromatin. This activator-dependent phosphorylation of histone H3 is enhanced by HMGN1 and occurs preferentially near the promoter region. Among the four activators, CREB plays a predominant role in MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3, and the phosphorylation of Ser-133 in CREB is essential for this process. Mutational analyses of MSK1 show that its N-terminal inhibition domain is critical for the kinase to phosphorylate chromatin-embedded histone H3 in a CREB-dependent manner, indicating the presence of an intricate regulatory network for MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3."

The first enzyme in the α-aminoadipate pathway, homocitrate synthase (HCS), is the target of the feedback regulation and is strongly inhibited by l-lysine. Here we report the structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe HCS (SpHCS) in complex with l-lysine. The structure illustrates that the amino acid directly competes with the substrate 2-oxoglutarate for binding within the active site of HCS. Differential recognition of the substrate and inhibitor is achieved via a switch position within the (α/β)8 TIM barrel of the enzyme that can distinguish between the C5-carboxylate group of 2-oxoglutarate and the ϵ-ammonium group of l-lysine. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that mutations of the switch residues, which interact with the l-lysine ϵ-ammonium group, abrogate feedback inhibition, as do substitutions of residues within the C-terminal domain that were identified in a previous study of l-lysine-insensitive HCS mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

https://openalex.org/W1965404381,"Histological examinations of MMTV-Wnt1 tumors reveal drastic differences in the tumor vasculature when compared to MMTV-Her2 tumors. However, these differences have not been formally described, nor have any angiogenic factors been implicated to be involved in the Wnt1 tumors.Here, we show that MMTV-Wnt1 tumors were more vascularized than MMTV-Her2 tumors, and this correlated with significantly higher expression of a CXC chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1/CXCL12) but not with VEGFA. Isolation of various cell types from Wnt1 tumors revealed that SDF1 was produced by both tumor myoepithelial cells and stromal cells, whereas Her2 tumors lacked myoepithelial cells and contained significantly less stroma. The growth of Wnt1 tumors, but not Her2 tumors, was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to SDF1, but not by neutralization of VEGFA. Anti-SDF1 treatment decreased the proportion of infiltrating Gr1(+) myeloid cells in the Wnt1 tumors, which correlated with a decrease in the percentage of endothelial cells. The involvement of Gr1(+) cells was evident from the retardation of Wnt1 tumor growth following in vivo depletion of these cells with an anti-Gr1-specific antibody. This degree of inhibition on Wnt1 tumor growth was comparable, but not additive, to the effect observed with anti-SDF1, indicative of overlapping mechanisms of inhibition. In contrast, Her2 tumors were not affected by the depletion of Gr1(+) cells.We demonstrated that SDF1 is important for Wnt1, but not for HER2, in inducing murine mammary tumor and the role of SDF1 in tumorigenesis involves Gr1(+) myeloid cells to facilitate growth and/or angiogenesis."

The LDL receptor binds apoB, apoE, and RAP via its seven LDL-A repeats (LR1 through LR7) (10.Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

The EGF repeats form a two-stranded β-sheet followed by a loop to a C-terminal short two-stranded sheet, with three conserved disulfide bonds in a different arrangement than the LDL-A repeats (5.Yamamoto T.

They can also bind calcium but may not need it for structural integrity (15.Kurniawan N.D. Aliabadizadeh K. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Smith R. J. Mol.

In the LDL receptor two of the three EGF repeats bind calcium, with one of the calcium ions noncanonically bound between the repeats (15.Kurniawan N.D. Aliabadizadeh K. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The EGF region in the LDL receptor is important for acid-triggered ligand release, which is coupled to a decrease in Ca2+ affinity (6.Rudenko G. Henry L. Henderson K. Ichtchenko K. Brown M.S.

Although all LDL-A sequences share >40% identity, calcium-binding sites and disulfide bonds are completely conserved, and although structures (as far as determined) are similar, reports on the role of calcium in folding and function show little consensus. Most studies involve in vitro refolding of individual LDL-A repeats of the LDL receptor family and show different characteristics of calcium binding, ranging from the absolute need of calcium for proper refolding (9.Yu X.

A study in intact cells with the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) minireceptor (containing eleven LDL-A repeats and nine EGF repeats) showed that LRP needs calcium to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19.Obermoeller L.M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These differences can be explained by the techniques used for measuring Ca2+ concentrations (25.Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Many ER-resident proteins involved in protein folding bind calcium through high affinity sites, often with additional low affinity binding sites (26.Macer D.R. Koch G.L. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 61-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The need of the LDL receptor family for calcium for its function is clear from previous studies (14.Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27.Kita T. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 2268-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but detailed insight in calcium incorporation during folding and its requirement for structural integrity in vivo is lacking. We have set up an in vivo folding assay for the LDL receptor (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in which we addressed these issues. We showed before that in intact cells the individual modules of the LDL receptor do not fold independently but first collapse into folding intermediates characterized by long distance non-native disulfide bonding and absence of native structure (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This is indicative of cooperative folding of the repeats. Our findings would predict calcium to be needed only late in folding, after the non-native phase, and long after protein synthesis. We therefore set out to revisit the role of calcium for the folding and structure of the full-length LDL receptor in vivo and to determine the timing of calcium incorporation during folding, its reversibility, and its importance for structural integrity in the intact cell. We found that the LDL receptor indeed did not adopt its proper conformation without calcium. As long as the protein was in the ER, it misfolded without calcium, but it also lost already native structure when calcium was removed from folded LDL receptors. Resistance to misfolding induced by calcium depletion was only acquired in the Golgi complex and beyond. The LDL receptor did not show reversibility of misfolding; once misfolded because of a lack of calcium, even at very early folding stages, rescue was not possible anymore. We concluded that the LDL receptor required calcium throughout its folding process, even though proper incorporation and formation of native epitopes occur much later.

Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or influenza virus proteins including the hemagglutinin (31.Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) have been described before. The LDL receptor cDNA sequence expressed from pBluescript (pBS-LDLR) or pcDNA3 (pcDNA3- LDLR) was derived from a pGEM LDL receptor (pGEM-LDLR) construct kindly provided by M. M. Jorgensen. pcDNA3- LDLR-P678L was derived from pBS-LDLR-P678L, which was a kind gift from Drs S. Fouchier and J. Defesche (Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). HeLa cells at 30–40% confluence were transfected with pcDNA3-LDLR using polyethylene-imine (32.Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 6-cm dishes with 4 μg of DNA in a total volume of 2.5 ml of medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The transfection medium was replaced after 4 h with complete medium for an additional 20 h before pulse-chase experiments. CHO15B cells were infected with X31 influenza virus as described before (33.Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), 5 h before pulse-chase experiments. Pulse-chase-based folding assays were performed as described before (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34.Jansens A. Braakman I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 232: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). To deplete calcium from the ER, 5 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187 (ICN) (35.Pfeiffer D.R. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was added to calcium-free starvation, pulse, and chase media, or 100 nm of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (ICN) (36.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) was added to calcium-containing starvation, pulse, and chase media. For the experiment in Fig. 2a, 200 nm thapsigargin was used. The cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min (for LDL receptor experiments) or 2 min (for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) studies) with 125 μCi/ml of Redivue Promix 35S cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences). After various chase times, the cells were treated with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide to block free sulfhydryl groups and prevent any further disulfide bond formation. LDL receptor expressing cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.2% DMSO, whereas HA-expressing cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MES, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All of the lysis buffers contained 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For calcium-depleted samples, the lysis buffer did not contain calcium. After pelleting and removing the nuclei, the cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation as described (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34.Jansens A. Braakman I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 232: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), antisera, and cell lysates were incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with wash buffer (for the LDL receptor 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, for HA 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6), resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with 1 mm EDTA and heated to 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.004% bromphenol blue; final concentrations). One-half of each sample was reheated for 5 min at 95 °C in 25 mm DTT. N-Ethylmaleimide was added to a concentration of 100 mm to both reduced and nonreduced samples at room temperature, which then were analyzed by 6% (LDL receptor) or 7.5% (HA) SDS-PAGE. A pulse-chase experiment was performed as above, except that after each chase time, the cells were incubated in chase medium containing 10 mm DTT for an additional 5 min. In vitro refolding studies showed that formation of native disulfide bonds in the ligand-binding repeats of the LDL receptor is closely related to calcium incorporation into these repeats (1.Jeon H. Blacklow S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 535-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 37.Koduri V. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12801-12807Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the LDL receptor acquires its native repeats only late in folding (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we set out to examine whether and, if so, when and how calcium is important for LDL receptor folding in the intact cell. We used two agents to deplete the ER for calcium: thapsigargin, which causes leakage of Ca2+ from the ER by inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) pumps (36.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) and A23187, an ionophore widely used to dissipate Ca2+ gradients in vivo (35.Pfeiffer D.R. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whereas A23187 equalizes calcium levels of both ER and cytosol with those in the medium, thapsigargin depletes the ER of calcium but as a result may increase calcium levels in cytosol. Similar results obtained with both drugs therefore must be due to the lowered calcium concentration in the ER and not because of pleiotropic effects. HeLa cells overexpressing the LDL receptor were starved for 15 min, pulse-labeled for 5 min, and chased for up to 2 h in the presence of either thapsigargin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or DMSO as control (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Detergent lysates were precipitated with polyclonal antibody 121 (Figs. 1, a, b, and d, and 2, a and c), which recognizes fully reduced, partly folded, as well as native LDL receptor molecules (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), or with a series of monoclonal antibodies (C7, 6B2, 7H2, 5G2, and 6E2) that recognize epitopes located in four of the seven LDL-A repeats that form the ligand-binding region of the LDL receptor (Figs. 1c and 2a). These monoclonal antibodies only recognize their epitopes when the correct disulfide bonds are formed and calcium is bound (29.Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Nguyen A.T. Hirama T. Chauhan V. Mackenzie R. Milne R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1399-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized LDL receptor molecules acquire their native conformation in the ER and were run at 120 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b, lanes 1–6, ER). After exit, they were O-glycosylated in the Golgi complex to a form that runs at 160 kDa before being moved to the plasma membrane (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38.Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. Schneider W.J. Hobgood K.K. Tolleshaug H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15261-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b, lanes 4–6, G). After 2 h of chase in the presence of calcium, almost half of LDL receptor molecules had reached the Golgi complex (Fig. 1b, lane 6). When these samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions to uncover changes in disulfide bonding, the LDL receptor first folded into a compact protein that contained non-native disulfide bonds between cysteines far apart in the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1a, lane 1) and lacked native epitopes in the ligand-binding repeats (Fig. 1c, lane 1) (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 6J. Gent, personal communication. During isomerization of these transient non-native disulfide bonds into native bonds forming shorter loops, the LDL receptor became more extended, decreased SDS-PAGE mobility (Fig. 1a, lanes 2–6) (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and acquired its folded repeats; LR1 became and 6B2- and C7-positive (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1c, lanes 1–7, and 2a), and the other repeats attained their epitopes as well (Fig. 2a, lanes 3–6). The protein thus folded in two phases. The first phase led to a compact non-native form, and in a subsequent reshuffling phase, the individual repeats formed, while the wrong disulfides were replaced by the native ones (as schematically represented in Fig. 3, Control). In the absence of calcium, a slightly larger fraction of LDL receptor molecules misfolded into disulfide-linked aggregates, but the monomeric ones moved to the Golgi complex with similar or even higher rates (Fig. 1, a and b). They were not properly folded, however, because both the ER and Golgi forms ran with higher mobility than in the presence of calcium, demonstrating the existence of non-native disulfide bonds between cysteines far apart in the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1, a and d). The ER hence released misfolded LDL receptor molecules. The first phase of folding appeared similar with and without calcium (Fig. 1d, lanes 1–3), but after the initial collapse the calcium-depleted molecules barely changed mobility with time (Fig. 1, a, lanes 7–18, and d), and they never acquired a properly folded LR1, LR3, LR5, or LR7 repeat (Figs. 1c, lanes 7–18, and 2a, lanes 2–6 and 8–12, compare control with thapsigargin). This implies that proper folding of the LDL receptor in the ER required calcium, as seen before in vitro (39.Atkins A.R. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Lee H.T. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40.Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.T. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cartoon in Fig. 3 depicts the events in vivo. The A23187 treatment not only changed folding of the LDL receptor, but also its O-glycosylation (Fig. 1d, lanes 4–6), most likely by influencing the activity of glycosylation enzymes in the Golgi complex. Similarly, A23187, but not thapsigargin, slightly inhibited trimming of N-linked glycans on Golgi-localized HA (not shown). We used HA as control for the effect of calcium depletion on the ER, because its folding depends on the calcium-binding lectin chaperone calnexin (42.Molinari M. Eriksson K.K. Calanca V. Galli C. Cresswell P. Michalak M. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 43.Pieren M. Galli C. Denzel A. Molinari M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28265-28271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HA folded via two intermediates with incomplete sets of disulfide bonds that have electrophoretic mobilities between those of reduced HA and native, properly folded HA (NT) when analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (31.Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b, lanes 1–5 and 6–10). Once folded, HA trimerized and left the ER for the Golgi complex, detectable by the extensive trimming of its N-glycans in the CHO15B cells. None of these HA maturation steps were affected by calcium depletion. Transport of misfolded LDL receptor molecules to the Golgi in the absence of calcium was not due to a defective retention system in the ER, because the folding-defective P678L mutant was retained with similar efficiency in the presence or absence of calcium (Fig. 2c). We therefore concluded that transport and quality control in general were not affected by the drugs we used and that the effects on the LDL receptor were caused by its need for calcium during folding in the ER. As a rule, proteins become more packed and rigid during folding. This increase in compactness often coincides with an increase in resistance to in vivo reduction of disulfide bonds (44.Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and to proteolytic digestion (45.Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We used a DTT resistance assay to examine conformational differences in early and late LDL receptor folding intermediates in the presence and absence of calcium. HeLa cells overexpressing the LDL receptor were pulse-labeled for 5 min and chased for 0 or 1 h. The cells then were cooled on ice as control, or in parallel, incubation was continued for an additional 5 min in chase medium containing 10 mm DTT to reduce accessible disulfide bonds in the intact cell before lysis. Detergent cell lysates were immunoprecipitated in parallel with polyclonal antiserum 121 and monoclonal antibody C7 and analyzed using nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Immediately after the pulse, DTT treatment of the cells separated the LDL receptor folding intermediates (Fig. 4a, lane 1) into two populations (Fig. 4a, lane 3): one completely reduced (upper band) and another population containing DTT-resistant disulfide bonds (lower band), which were completely reduced upon heating in reducing Laemmli sample buffer (lane 2). As expected (28.Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibody C7 did not recognize the completely reduced LDL receptor (Fig. 4a, compare lane 4 with lane 3), but it did precipitate some partially resistant molecules (lane 4), showing that LR1 was among the correctly folded, DTT-resistant domains. Only a small number of disulfide bonds became resistant because the partially resistant form (in lane 3) ran close to fully reduced LDL receptor (lane 2), and it had a much lower mobility than nonreduced control samples (Fig. 4a, compare lane 3 with lane 1 and lane 4 with lane 6). We concluded that the non-native disulfide bonds that span distant cysteines were DTT-sensitive. After 1 h of chase, some additional disulfide bonds became DTT-resistant; a smear underneath the lower band appeared upon DTT treatment (Fig. 4a, lane 9). Still, most disulfide bonds remained DTT-sensitive in the ER, because most LDL receptor molecules changed their mobility upon in vivo reduction (from lane 7 to lane 9) and now ran with similar mobility as denatured reduced LDL receptor (compare lanes 8 and 9). LDL receptor molecules that reached the Golgi complex did acquire complete DTT resistance (Fig. 4a, lanes 7, 9, 10, and 12), suggesting that the protein acquired additional compactness in the Golgi, whereas the ER environment kept th"

Transcriptional activity of WT1 (Wilm's tumor 1) is required for normal podocyte structure and is repressed by the podocyte adherens junction protein, WTIP (WT1 interacting protein). Here we show that WTIP translocated into podocyte nuclei in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, a model of transient nephrotic syndrome. Cultured podocytes, which stably expressed an epitope-tagged WTIP, were treated with LPS. Imaging and cellular fractionation studies demonstrated that WTIP translocated from podocyte cell contacts into nuclei within 6 h and relocalized to cell contacts within 24 h after LPS treatment. LPS-stimulated WTIP nuclear translocation required JNK activity, which assembled a multiprotein complex of the scaffolding protein JNK-interacting protein 3 and the molecular motor dynein. Intact microtubule networks and dynein activity were necessary for LPS-stimulated WTIP translocation. Podocytes expressing sh-Wtip change morphology and demonstrate altered actin assembly in cell spreading assays.

Co-expression of the auxiliary β1 subunit accelerated inactivation of both the Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 isoforms, but it did not eliminate the differences, demonstrating that this property is inherent in the α subunit. By constructing chimeric channels between Nav1.2 and Nav1.3, we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus is responsible for the differences. The Nav1.2 carboxyl terminus caused faster inactivation in the Nav1.3 backbone, and the Nav1.3 carboxyl terminus caused slower inactivation in the Nav1.2 channel. Through analysis of truncated channels, we identified a homologous 60-amino acid region within the carboxyl terminus of the Nav1.2 and the Nav1.3 channels that is responsible for this modulation of fast inactivation. Site-directed replacement of Nav1.3 lysine 1826 in this region to its Nav1.2 analogue glutamic acid 1880 (K1826E) shifted the voltage dependence of inactivation toward that of Nav1.2. The K1826E mutation also accelerated the inactivation kinetics to a level comparable with that of Nav1.2. The reverse Nav1.2 E1880K mutation exhibited much slower inactivation kinetics and depolarized inactivation voltage dependence. A complementary mutation located within the inactivation linker of Nav1.3 (K1453E) caused inactivation changes mirroring those caused by the K1826E mutation in Nav1.3.

Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 75-78Google Scholar). The voltage-dependent activation and inactivation events basic to channel gating are highly regulated to ensure normal channel function, which is vital to skeletal muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and cardiac conduction. Small changes in channel inactivation lead to diseases such as myotonia, paralysis, epilepsy, long QT syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, heart failure, or other disorders (2.Bennett P.B.

Each channel consists of an ion-conducting α subunit associated with one or more accessory β subunits (15.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The α subunit is a 260-kDa four-domain transmembrane protein. Each domain contains six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), with the S4 segments acting as voltage sensors and the hairpin-like S5-S6P loops forming the channel pore. Fast inactivation is mediated by the intracellular loop between DIII and DIV, which occludes the inner pore following channel activation.Because of their roles in action potential firing, the multiple sodium channel isoforms could contribute to diversity in physiological functions. Numerous studies investigating the mechanisms underlying isoform-specific inactivation and the physiological effects of channelopathies have not yet yielded a consensus model concerning the role of the different isoforms. Chimeras created by the exchange of the carboxyl termini between Nav1.5 and Nav1.4 (16.Deschênes I. Trottier E. Chahine M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and between Nav1.5 and Nav1.2 (17.Mantegazza M. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the results were mixed regarding how the carboxyl terminus determined channel-specific inactivation.In this report, we investigated two temporally distinct isoforms expressed in the central nervous system. Nav1.3 is mainly embryonic, whereas Nav1.2 expression is maintained at a high level throughout all developmental stages (18.Beckh S. Noda M. Lübbert H. Numa S.

Biophysically, the Nav1.2 channel shows marked differences compared with the Nav1.3 channel in terms of fast inactivation in Xenopus oocytes (23.Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Marshall J.

Through analysis of chimeric channels, we showed that the carboxyl terminus is required to transfer the inactivation characteristics of the donor channel. Through analysis of truncated channels, we identified a 60-residue region in the carboxyl terminus that was responsible for this modulation. Within this region, a single homologous amino acid residue (Glu1880 in Nav1.2 and Lys1826 in Nav1.3) was both necessary and sufficient for the specific inactivation of each channel.DISCUSSIONA number of previous reports have indicated a role for the sodium channel carboxyl terminus in fast inactivation (14.Spampanato J.

However, a clear mechanism of how the carboxyl terminus is involved in fast inactivation remains elusive. In this report, we have identified a homologous carboxyl-terminal amino acid that is important for fast inactivation differences between the Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 sodium channels. The critical amino acid (Lys1826 in Nav1.3 or Glu1880 in Nav1.2) is both necessary and sufficient for determining the differences in the voltage dependence and kinetics of inactivation.The carboxyl-terminal region is subdivided into a uniformly structured proximal half and a non-uniform distal half, as shown by structure-function studies of the Nav1.2, Nav1.4, and Nav1.5 channels (16.Deschênes I.

Therefore, alterations at this position are unlikely to directly disrupt the overall secondary structure of the pair of EF-hands that are formed by intermolecular interactions between side chains in the interface of helices I with IV and II with III (44.Cormier J.W.

Furthermore, the Nav1.3 K1826E and Nav1.2 E1880K mutations are unlikely to function as helix breakers because the replacement amino acids have higher helical propensities than the original amino acids (55.Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that these mutations disrupt the overall structure of the proximal half of the carboxyl terminus or the EF-hands.Inactivation stabilization was suggested to occur via a protein-protein interaction between the sixth helix in the carboxyl terminus and a P-rich motif in the III-IV linker (KPQPPIPRP), based on the finding that truncation of the sixth helix and mutations of this motif altered the level of persistent current (48.Motoike H.K.

However, it seems unlikely that Nav1.3 Lys1826 and Nav1.2 Glu1880 residues affect inactivation through CaM in oocytes because neither Nav1.3 nor Nav1.2 inactivation was affected by the presence of CaM in this system (data not shown).The positive charge at position 1826 is not a common feature in voltage-gated sodium channels, with glutamic acid present in all of the other isoforms (59.Goldin A.L. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 73-112Google Scholar). In fact, the lysine at position 1826 is unique to this clone of rat Nav1.3, with glutamic acid present in other Nav1.3 clones. For this reason, we believe that the presence of a positive charge at this position is not a normal mechanism of functional variation in sodium channels. However, the dramatic effect on inactivation resulting from the presence of the positive charge indicates that a negative charge at this position plays an important role in determining the normal kinetics and voltage dependence of fast inactivation in sodium channels.Based on the similar inactivation phenotypes of the Nav1.3 III-IV K1453E and carboxyl-terminal K1826E mutants, one possibility is that the interaction between these two residues is the basis of the inactivation differences. According to this hypothesis, Lys1453 in the III-IV linker and to a lesser extent flanking lysines would repulse Lys1826 in the carboxyl terminus, preventing these two regions from interacting in Nav1.3. Without this interaction, Nav1.3 would inactivate more slowly than Nav1.2. Reversing the charge at either of these positions (K1453E or K1826E) would enable the interaction, resulting in faster inactivation that resembled that of Nav1.2. The effects of the Nav1.2 E1880K mutant are consistent with this proposed mechanism in that it displayed slower inactivation kinetics. However, substituting negative charges in both the carboxyl terminus and III-IV linker of Nav1.3 did not mimic the inactivation properties of wild-type Nav1.3 with positive charges at both positions, suggesting that electrostatic repulsion between these sites cannot fully explain the effects on inactivation. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the charge substitutions have more local effects within each region of the channel. More detailed information about a direct interaction between these residues is necessary to distinguish between these alternatives to explain the fast inactivation differences between Nav1.2 and Nav1.3. IntroductionSodium channels depolarize the resting membrane of many excitable cell types to initiate and propagate action potentials by acting as the molecular pores for sodium ion influx (1.Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 75-78Google Scholar). The voltage-dependent activation and inactivation events basic to channel gating are highly regulated to ensure normal channel function, which is vital to skeletal muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and cardiac conduction. Small changes in channel inactivation lead to diseases such as myotonia, paralysis, epilepsy, long QT syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, heart failure, or other disorders (2.Bennett P.B.

Each channel consists of an ion-conducting α subunit associated with one or more accessory β subunits (15.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The α subunit is a 260-kDa four-domain transmembrane protein. Each domain contains six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), with the S4 segments acting as voltage sensors and the hairpin-like S5-S6P loops forming the channel pore. Fast inactivation is mediated by the intracellular loop between DIII and DIV, which occludes the inner pore following channel activation.Because of their roles in action potential firing, the multiple sodium channel isoforms could contribute to diversity in physiological functions. Numerous studies investigating the mechanisms underlying isoform-specific inactivation and the physiological effects of channelopathies have not yet yielded a consensus model concerning the role of the different isoforms. Chimeras created by the exchange of the carboxyl termini between Nav1.5 and Nav1.4 (16.Deschênes I. Trottier E. Chahine M. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and between Nav1.5 and Nav1.2 (17.Mantegazza M. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the results were mixed regarding how the carboxyl terminus determined channel-specific inactivation.In this report, we investigated two temporally distinct isoforms expressed in the central nervous system. Nav1.3 is mainly embryonic, whereas Nav1.2 expression is maintained at a high level throughout all developmental stages (18.Beckh S. Noda M. Lübbert H. Numa S.

Biophysically, the Nav1.2 channel shows marked differences compared with the Nav1.3 channel in terms of fast inactivation in Xenopus oocytes (23.Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Marshall J.

Through analysis of chimeric channels, we showed that the carboxyl terminus is required to transfer the inactivation characteristics of the donor channel. Through analysis of truncated channels, we identified a 60-residue region in the carboxyl terminus that was responsible for this modulation. Within this region, a single homologous amino acid residue (Glu1880 in Nav1.2 and Lys1826 in Nav1.3) was both necessary and sufficient for the specific inactivation of each channel."

PrPSc propagates by templating its conformation onto resident PrPC to generate new PrPSc. Although the nature of the PrPSc-PrPC complex is unresolved, certain segments or specific residues are thought to feature critically in its formation. The polymorphic residue 129 is one such site under considerable study. We combined transmission studies with a novel live cell yeast-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system that models the molecular association of PrP in a PrPSc-like state, as a way to explore the role of residue 129 in this process. We show that a reduction in efficiency of prion transmission between donor PrPSc and recipient PrPC that are mismatched at residue 129 correlates with a reduction in FRET between PrP-129M and PrP-129V in our yeast model. We further show that this effect depends on the different secondary structure propensities of Met and Val, rather than the specific amino acids. Finally, introduction of the disease-associated P101L mutation (mouse- equivalent) abolished FRET with wild-type mouse PrP, whereas mutant PrP-P101L displayed high FRET with homologous PrP-P101L, as long as residue 129 matched. These studies provide the first evidence for a physical alteration in the molecular association of PrP molecules differing in one or more residues, and they further predict that the different secondary structure propensities of Met and Val define the impaired association observed between PrPSc and PrPC mismatched at residue 129.

The prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders that result from the accumulation of a misfolded isoform (PrPSc) of the normally folded cellular prion protein (PrPC). The former is distinguished from the latter by its insolubility in non-ionic detergents and relative resistance to proteinase K (PK) 2The abbreviations used are: PKproteinase KFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGSSGerstmann-Straussler-ScheinkerCJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseTgtransgenicHuhumanWTwild-type. digestion (1.Prusiner S.B.

Once generated, PrPSc propagates by templating its conformation onto PrPC, leading to the accumulation of PrPSc and associated central nervous system pathologic features of neuronal death, gliosis, and vacuolation (2.Mastrianni J.A.

The PrPSc-PrPC interface has not been resolved, although a specific orientation is predicted, based on several lines of evidence suggesting that sequence homology between PrPSc and PrPC at key sites within the molecule are necessary for effective propagation of PrPSc, a feature that forms the basis for the well recognized species barrier to prion transmission (3.Moore, R.

The central region of PrP has been shown to feature prominently in defining the species barrier (4.Telling G.C. Scott M. Hsiao K.K. Foster D. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Sidle K.C. Collinge J. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Compared with the general population, homozygosity for either Met or Val is significantly more prevalent in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) (5.Owen F. Poulter M. Collinge J. Crow T.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 1215-1216PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the course of disease in 129MV patients is generally more protracted (7.Collinge J. Palmer M.S. Campbell T. Sidle K.C. Carroll D. Harding A.

Furthermore, all primary cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related variant (v) CJD are 129MM (9.Mead S. Poulter M. Uphill J. Beck J. Whitfield J. Webb T.E. Campbell T. Adamson G.

Thus, a key element that determines the efficiency of prion propagation appears to be whether residue 129 of PrPSc and PrPC are the same or different. However, whether this results from an inefficient or altered physical association of PrPSc with PrPC is not known, nor is it known whether the specific amino acids, Met and Val, or their physical properties, determine the nature of the PrPSc-PrPC association. To address these questions, we compared the results from transmission of sCJD to Tg(HuPrP-129M)Prnpo/o and Tg(HuPrP-129V)Prnpo/o mice, with those from co-expression of homologous and heterologous PrP molecules using a novel live cell yeast-based FRET system to model the molecular association of PrP in a PrPSc-like state (12.Norstrom E.M. Mastrianni J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27236-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We show that efficiency of sCJD transmission is enhanced when residue 129 of PrPSc and PrPC match and this correlates with a more ordered molecular association of PrPSc with PrPC, as assessed by FRET. We further find that the effect of 129 occurs in the presence and absence of at least one autosomal dominant mutation (P102L) and this property is determined by their predicted secondary structure propensities. The remarkable consistency of findings between our FRET system and in vivo transmission data support the utility of this system as a novel strategy with which to study the molecular determinants of prion propagation. Tissue samples were obtained from patients followed at the University of Chicago Memory Center, using an IRB approved protocol. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples or frozen brain sections obtained at autopsy, as previously described (13.Mastrianni J.A. Nixon R. Layzer R. Telling G.C. Han D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The entire coding segment of the PRNP gene was sequenced using Big Dye terminator chemistry, as previously described (14.Li X. Rowland L.P. Mitsumoto H. Przedborski S. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Peskind E. Johnson N. Siddique T. Mesulam M.M. Weintraub S. Mastrianni J.A. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 58: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on unpublished data, 3S. Mallik and J. A. Mastrianni, unpublished data. only samples carrying PrPSc-Type 1 were used. Fresh frozen frontal cortex from autopsied sCJD cases were used to prepare a 1% (w/v) brain homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline, as previously described (13.Mastrianni J.A. Nixon R. Layzer R. Telling G.C. Han D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), of which 30 μl was intracerebrally inoculated to each mouse. Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human PrPC with either Met (Tg440) or Val (Tg152) at residue 129 on a mouse PrP knock-out background (i.e. Tg(HuPrP-129M or V)Prnpo/o) were previously constructed and described elsewhere (4.Telling G.C.

Mice were anesthetized with a xylazine/ketamine mixture, the head fixed in a small animal stereotaxic instrument (Kopf) fitted with mouse ear bars, the scalp was swabbed with alcohol, and a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-cc syringe filled with inoculum was lowered 3 mm deep directly through the scalp into the parietal lobe. Disease was defined by the presence of at least two signs, including reduced spontaneous movement, scruffy coat, hunched back, or unsteady gait, at which time it was killed for analysis. Well over 20 Tg(HuPrP-129M)Prnpo/o and Tg(HuPrP-129V)Prnpo/o control mice have been inoculated with either 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline or normal brain homogenates and have not developed prion features or histopathological evidence of prion disease after >600 days.3 Brains were fixed in 4% formalin for 48 h, then immersed in 97% formic acid for 90 min, washed several times in 4% formalin, dehydrated in xylene and graded alcohol, and saturated with paraffin. The fixed brains were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for assessment of spongiform degeneration. The mouse PrP coding sequence, extending from residue 23 to 230, which excludes the N-terminal signal sequences for endoplasmic reticulum targeting and the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, was previously cloned into the pSP72 (Promega) cloning vector for construction of wild-type (WT) PrP23–230, using standard molecular biological techniques. To limit degradation by yeast cytoplasmic proteases, a serine was added to the N and C termini of the PrP construct. This construct was then subcloned into the p425 and p426 Gal-inducible yeast expression vectors (Promega), prior to mutation of mouse codon 128 using forward and reverse primers flanking codon 128 and the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Strategene). For FRET construct generation, the 128 mutants were constructed similarly from PrP23–230::CFP and PrP23–230::YFP templates, as previously described (12.Norstrom E.M. Mastrianni J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27236-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The mutations and primer pairs used to generate them are as follows: 128Val(ATG → GTG), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC GTG CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG CAC GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); 128Ile (ATG → ATT), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC ATT CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG AAT GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); 128Tyr (ATG → TAC), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC TAC CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG GTA GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); 128Leu (ATG → TTG), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC TTG CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG CAA GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); 128Ala (ATG → GCG), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC GCG CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG CGC GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); 128Lys (ATG → AAG), 5′-CTT GGT GGC TAC AAG CTG GGG AGC (+), 5′-GCT CCC CAG CTT GTA GCC ACC AAG (−); P101L (CCC → CTC), 5′-CCC CCC AAT CAG TGG AAC AAG CTC AGC AAA CCA AAA (+), 5′-TTT TGG TTT GCT GAG CTT GTT CCA CTG ATT GGG GGG (−). The yeast strain W303 (MATa ade2-can1-100 his3-12,16 leu2-3,112, trp1-1 ura 3-1) with a pep4− genotype, with decreased endogenous protease activity, was used. The p425 and p426 Gal vectors, selectable with medium lacking Leu and Ura, respectively, contain a regulatable element induced by galactose and restricted by glucose. For transformation, yeast colonies were picked from plates, grown overnight at 30 °C to mid-log phase, washed, then incubated with the construct of interest plus polyethylene glycol, LiAc, and carrier DNA for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by a 25-min heat shock at 42 °C, and then spread onto selection plates prepared from glucose dropout media. Yeast expressing the construct of interest were grown to mid-late log phase (A600 ∼0.7), centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, washed in 10 mm EDTA, and digested with 1 mg/ml of zymolyase 100T for at least 2 h at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in 200 μl of 10% Sarkosyl in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors for 5 min on ice. Insoluble PrP was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with 50 μl of 10% Sarkosyl, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 200 μl of 1% sulfobetaine in phosphate-buffered saline. Equal fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching FRET experiments were performed with an Olympus IX81 microscope using appropriate Chroma filters. PrP23–230::CFP donor was co-expressed with a PrP23–230::YFP acceptor and yeast were scanned for the presence of both cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) signals. CFP or CFP fusion proteins were detected by 436 nm excitation/480 nm emission, and YFP or YFP fusion proteins were detected by 500-nm excitation/535-nm emission filters. Photographs of yeast containing aggregates were taken at 5-s intervals with 100-ms exposure times under constant illumination for 2 min. Image series were saved in stacks and the illumination intensity profile of the aggregates were analyzed across the time (Z) series using ImageJ (NIH) software. The decay of the donor fluorescence signal was fit with a single exponential decay curve and Tau was generated using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) software using the equation Y0 = Aexp(−invτ*X). The presence of both YFP and CFP signals for a given sample was confirmed before analysis. Colocalized proteins were expressed in greater than 80% of aggregates. To control for differences in lamp intensity across data collection sittings, which can alter the absolute bleach rate of samples, only two donor/acceptor pairs were measured at a time. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 4 (Prism) software. All reported p values are based on one-way analysis of variance of the group data, followed by Dunn's Multiple Comparison post hoc test, unless otherwise stated. For yeast lysates, PK digestions were performed on samples from the 1% sulfobetaine resuspensions of the 16,000 × g pellet fractions of PrP. Approximately 400 ng of total protein was digested with 10–60 μg/ml of PK at 37 °C for 1 h. A mixture of protease inhibitors (chymostatin (60 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml)) were included in the reactions to protect against yeast proteases. For human and mouse brain, a 10% brain homogenate was prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) from frozen brain cortex, without protease inhibitors, and digested with 20 μg/ml of PK at 37 °C for 1 h. All reactions were terminated with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. PK-resistant PrP from brain homogenates was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 14% gel, as previously described (12.Norstrom E.M. Mastrianni J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27236-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with 3F4 antibody (gift of Richard Kascsak, Staten Island, NY) at a 1:3000 dilution. For PrP from yeast, a fraction of the yeast pellet resuspended in 1% sulfobetaine was separated on a 16% gel and probed with R1 antibody (InPro, South San Francisco, CA) at a 1:5000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce) was used to detect R1 and 3F4, respectively. Blots were treated with West Pico ECL (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and captured with a Bio-Rad Alpha Document Imager. We first compared the efficiency of transmission of human (Hu) 129M prions with 129V prions to Tg(HuPrP-129M)Prnpo/o and Tg(HuPrP-129V)Prnpo/o mice, hereafter referred to as Tg(129M) and Tg(129V), respectively. Four cases each of sCJD homozygous for either Met (i.e. 129MM) or Val (129VV) were prepared as 1% brain homogenates in phosphate-buffered saline and intracerebrally inoculated to an equal number (between 5 and 9) of Tg(129M) and Tg(129V) mice. The latency to disease onset, or incubation period, a surrogate measure of transmission efficiency, was determined. Disease was clinically defined by the appearance of at least two symptoms of prion disease in mice, as defined under “Materials and Methods,” and was confirmed by the histological presence of spongiform degeneration, and the biochemical detection of PK-resistant PrP. All mice inoculated with sCJD(129MM) developed disease, although the incubation period in Tg(129M) mice was significantly shorter than that in Tg(129V) mice that received the same inoculum (Table 1). For example, case 1 produced clinical disease in Tg(129V) mice after ∼294 days, compared with ∼201 days in Tg(129M) mice. Similarly, case 4 transmitted to Tg(129V) mice in ∼230 days and Tg(129M) mice in ∼162 days. Thus, although mice expressing human PrPC carrying either Met or Val at residue 129 were receptive to PrPSc-129M, a mismatch between PrPSc and PrPC at position 129 resulted in a significant delay in the onset of disease (Table 1). These results compare with those of others (10.Wadsworth J.D. Asante E.A. Desbruslais M. Linehan J.M. Joiner S. Gowland I. Welch J. Stone L. Lloyd S.E. Hill A.F. Brandner S. Collinge J.

Open table in a new tab To ensure that Tg(129M) mice are not inherently more susceptible to sCJD prions than Tg(129V) mice, we compared the incubation periods of Tg(129M) and Tg(129V) mice inoculated with sCJD(129VV). In this case, Tg(129V) mice were significantly more receptive to sCJD(129VV) compared with Tg(129M) mice. On average, the incubation periods were 48% shorter in Tg(129V) mice. For example, case 7 produced disease by ∼190 days in Tg(129V) mice, compared with ∼362 days in Tg(129M) mice (Table 1). To confirm prion disease, brain homogenates were prepared from more than 80% of mice from each group, and digested with 20 μg/ml of PK, submitted to 14% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the α- HuPrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (16.Kascsak R.J. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Rubenstein R. Carp R.I. Powers J.M. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar), to detect PK-resistant PrP (rPrPSc) (Fig. 1A). All symptomatic mice displayed rPrPSc. Interestingly, although mice were killed at a similar stage of disease and the samples were adjusted to the same total protein concentrations, the level of rPrPSc was generally higher in mice that carried the same residue 129 as the human inoculum, supporting a more efficient conversion with homologous PrPC. The pattern of rPrPSc recovered from mice displayed the same molecular phenotype as the human source inoculum. We used only sCJD carrying PrPSc-Type 1, defined primarily by a migration rate of 21 kDa of the unglycosylated fraction of rPrPSc, and this molecular phenotype was propagated in all affected Tg(129M) and Tg(129V). Histological examination of the brains of all mice confirmed the presence of spongiform degeneration. In general, the degree of spongiform degeneration was greater when the PrPC of recipient mice and the HuPrPSc inoculum carried matching residues at position 129 (Fig. 1B). The results of the transmission studies led us to question whether a mismatch between PrPSc and PrPC at residue 129 directly impacts the nature of their association. To address this, we employed a previously described heterologous yeast expression system that supports the generation of PrPSc-like protein (12.Norstrom E.M. Mastrianni J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27236-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17.Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When the N-terminal signal sequence for endoplasmic reticulum entry and the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor signal sequence are deleted, full-length PrP (i.e. PrP23–230) expression is diverted to the yeast cytosol, where it acquires the physical characteristics of PrPSc, including detergent insolubility and relative PK resistance. Because PrP expressed in the yeast cytosol produces aggregates that acquire PK resistance, newly synthesized PrPC is predicted to associate with the preformed aggregate and is converted to the PrPSc-like isoform. Thus, this model approximates the association of PrPC with PrPSc. Although we previously showed that PrP-129M acquires properties of PrPSc (12.Norstrom E.M. Mastrianni J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27236-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) it was necessary to determine whether PrP-129V also supports its production. Saccharomyces cerevesiae were transformed to express mouse PrP23–230 with either Met or Val at position 128 (the murine equivalent of residue 129 in HuPrP). After 16 h of growth, the yeast were detergent lysed, PrP was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and the insoluble fraction was subjected to a range of PK from 0 to 60 μg/ml. PrP23–230 bypasses the post-translational processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, resulting in a single unglycosylated ∼25-kDa fraction. The major fraction of PrP recovered from yeast expressing either PrP-128M or PrP-128V, was insoluble (Fig. 2A), and each PrP displayed PK resistance (Fig. 2B), supporting both to generate PrPSc-like protein in this system. As a necessary prerequisite to the FRET studies, we expressed PrP-128M and PrP-128V as fluorescent fusion proteins, to confirm their potential to form aggregates and associate. Whereas expression of either CFP or YFP alone produced a diffusely uniform signal throughout the yeast cytosol, they produced distinct puncta, consistent with aggregate formation, when linked to the C-terminal of PrP23–230. Although a detailed analysis of the kinetics of aggregate formation was not undertaken, we observed no obvious qualitative differences between PrP-128M and PrP-128V aggregates (Fig. 3). Next, homologous or heterologous PrP pairs were co-expressed and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Co-expression of the homologous pair (PrP-128M::CFP and PrP-128M::YFP), hereafter designated PrP(128M/M) or the heterologous pair (PrP-128M::CFP and PrP-128V::YFP), designated PrP(128M/V), resulted in co-aggregation of greater than 90% of aggregates, suggesting that heterologous PrPs display similar aggregative behavior as homologous PrPs (Fig. 3). However, to determine whether the visualized PrP co-aggregates represent a composite of tightly associated heterologous PrP molecules or a coalescence of smaller aggregates composed of tightly associated homologous PrP, we applied live cell donor photobleaching FRET to this system. By measuring the decay of the donor fluorescence signal (PrP::CFP) after excitation, and fitting it with a single exponential decay curve, a Tau (τ) can be generated. A higher τ corresponds to a slower decay curve, indicating a stronger association between two interacting proteins, as time to quench the donor molecule is greater. With each FRET pair analyzed, we determined the nonspecific background of a “non-FRET” pair, against which all FRET signals were compared. This was done by co-expressing CFP-tagged PrP-128M or PrP-128V with non-fused YFP, as YFP does not aggregate within the yeast cytosol nor is it predicted to specifically associate with PrP. Next, we measured FRET from yeast co-expressing PrP fused to YFP or CFP carrying the same (homologous pair) or different (heterologous pair) residues at 128. We found the τ for the homologous pair PrP(128M/M) was 3.39 ± 0.217, compared with 1.38 ± 0.062 for the non-FRET control pair PrP(128M/YFP), supporting a tight association of homologous PrP (Table 2, part A). In contrast, the τ for the heterologous PrP(128M/V) pair was 2.31 ± 0.159, lower (p < 0.01) than the homologous pair, yet higher (p < 0.001) than the negative control, suggesting a specific, but qualitatively different, association that formed between homologous PrPs (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Because the τ measured for the PrP(128V/V) pair was 3.37 ± 0.377, nearly identical to that measured for the PrP(128M/M) pair, the reduction in FRET observed with the PrP(128M/V) pair cannot be explained by a general alteration in the associative behavior of PrP-128V. These data, supported by the transmission data, clearly demonstrate an improved molecular association of misfolded PrP when residue 129 is homologous.TABLE 2FRET of all PrP pairsDonor PrP (128X):CFPAcceptor PrP(128X):YFPTau ± S.E.Relative Tau ± S.E.A.

Prior transmission studies showed that Tg mice expressing a mouse-human chimeric PrP were resistant to the prion subtype of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS), resulting from a P102L mutation of the PrP gene, whereas Tg mice that express low levels of PrP-P102L were susceptible to GSS(P102L), supporting homology at residue 102 as a necessary feature in the propagation of PrP-P102L prions (18.Telling G.C. Haga T. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1736-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To model this intramolecular association, mouse PrP-P101L,128M was co-expressed with PrP-128M and analyzed. Strikingly, this pair displayed a τ of 1.26 ± 0.109, which was not different from the non-FRET control pair (τ = 1.16 ± 0.101), suggesting either absent, or a highly disrupted, association between PrP-P101L and WT-PrP (Fig. 5). However, when PrP-P101L,128M was co-expressed with the homologous PrP-P101L,128M partner, the association was strong (τ = 3.09 ± 0.248), paralleling the findings of the transmission studies. We then assessed the influence of residue 129 in the association of this mutant PrP. When PrP-P101L was co-expressed with PrP-P101L carrying a mismatch at residue 128, FRET was reduced (τ = 2.28 ± 0.085) to a level consistent with that measured for the WT heterologous PrP(128M/V) pair (τ = 2.31 ± 0.159).

We now identify which of these directly influence Gc action. Interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII), and regulator of G-protein signaling 14 (RGS14) increased Gc transactivation, whereas sialyltransferase 4B (SIAT4B) had a negative effect. Amyloid β (A4) precursor-protein binding, family B, member 1 (APBB1/Fe65) and neural cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) were without effect. Only IFI16 potentiated Gc repression of NF-κB. In addition, IFI16 affected basal expression, and Gc induction of endogenous target genes. IFI16 did not affect glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, ligand-dependent repression of GR expression, or the ligand-dependent induction of GR phosphorylation on Ser-211 or Ser-203. Coimmuno-precipitation revealed an interaction, suggesting that IFI16 modulation of GR function is mediated by protein crosstalk. Transfection analysis with GR mutants showed that the ligand-binding domain of GR binds IFI16 and is the target domain for IFI16 regulation. Analysis of human lung sections identified colocalization of GR and IFI16, suggesting a physiologically relevant interaction. We demonstrate that IFI16 is a novel modulator of GR function and show the importance of analyzing variation in Gc sensitivity in humans, using appropriate technology, to drive discovery.—Berry, A., Matthews, L.

The gap complex has a surprisingly low minimum total site size, corresponding to ∼7 nucleotides of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), as compared with the site size of ∼20 nucleotides of the enzyme-ssDNA complex. The dramatic difference in stoichiometries indicates that the enzyme predominantly engages the strong DNA-binding subsite in interactions with the gap and assumes a very different orientation in the gap complex, as compared with the complex with the ssDNA. The helicase binds the ssDNA gaps with 4–5 nucleotides with the highest affinity, which is ∼3 and ∼2 orders of magnitude larger than the affinities for the ssDNA and double-stranded DNA, respectively. In the gap complex, the protein does not engage in cooperative interactions with the enzyme predominantly associated with the surrounding dsDNA. Binding of nucleoside triphosphate to the strong and weak nucleotide-binding sites of the helicase eliminates the selectivity of the enzyme for the size of the gap, whereas saturation of both sites with ADP leads to amplified affinity for the ssDNA gap containing 5 nucleotides and engagement of an additional protein area in interactions with the nucleic acid.

Two helicases in the E. coli cell, DnaB and PriA proteins, are engaged in the functioning of the primosome, by translocating the multiprotein complex along DNA during the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotide primers, which are then used to initiate synthesis of the complementary strand (4.Allen Jr., G.C.

Quantitative thermodynamic analyses showed that, in the complex with the ssDNA, the total DNA-binding site of the PriA helicase occludes ∼20 nucleotides of the nucleic acid (20.Jezewska M.J.

However, within the total DNA-binding site, the PriA helicase possesses a strong ssDNA-binding subsite, an area that has a high ssDNA affinity and engages in interactions only ∼5–8 nucleotides of the nucleic acid. The intrinsic affinity of the enzyme for the ssDNA is predominantly generated at the strong ssDNA-binding subsite, which is located in the central part of the enzyme molecule, on a structurally separated domain (20.Jezewska M.J.

The functional organization of the PriA helicase-ssDNA complex is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a.During the dsDNA unwinding reaction, the PriA helicase performs a complex free energy transduction process, where the binding and/or hydrolysis of NTPs regulate the enzyme activity, including the affinity toward different conformations of the DNA (8.Lee M.S.

Moreover, what makes the PriA protein different from other well studied helicases is that the enzyme possesses two nucleotide-binding sites, a strong and a weak binding site, which profoundly differ in their affinities for the cofactors and their effects on the intrinsic affinity of the protein for the ssDNA (25.Lucius A.L.

Furthermore, cooperative interactions between the two nucleotide-binding sites indicate an intricate communication between the sites (25.Lucius A.L. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7202-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Saturation of both nucleotide-binding sites with ADP induces the engagement of an additional area of the protein, possibly the N terminus domain, in interactions with the ssDNA (27.Lucius A.L.

The data indicate a surprisingly small minimum total site size of the enzyme in the gap complex, which is ∼7 nucleotides or bp. The low stoichiometry indicates that the helicase exclusively engages the strong DNA-binding subsite in the gap complex and assumes a very different orientation, compared with the complex with the ssDNA. The PriA helicase binds the ssDNA gaps with 4–5 nucleotides with the highest affinity without engaging in cooperative interactions with the enzyme molecules associated with the surrounding dsDNA. Binding of ADP to strong and weak nucleotide-binding sites of the enzyme profoundly affects the affinity and stoichiometry of the helicase-gapped DNA complex.

Two helicases in the E. coli cell, DnaB and PriA proteins, are engaged in the functioning of the primosome, by translocating the multiprotein complex along DNA during the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotide primers, which are then used to initiate synthesis of the complementary strand (4.Allen Jr., G.C.

The protein is involved in recombination and repair processes in the E. coli cell as a major factor that initiates the restart of the stalled replication fork at the damaged DNA sites. This happens, presumably, through the recognition of the DNA structure of the site, although the nature of this recognition reaction is unknown (10.Sandler S.J. McCool J.D. Do T.T. Johansen R.U. Mol.

This includes the unwinding reaction of the dsDNA, fueled by the hydrolysis of NTPs and the assembly of the primosome, which must be initiated by the recognition of the ssDNA gap of the damaged DNA by the enzyme (5.Ng J.Y.

Quantitative thermodynamic analyses showed that, in the complex with the ssDNA, the total DNA-binding site of the PriA helicase occludes ∼20 nucleotides of the nucleic acid (20.Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11002-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme has a total site size of 20 ± 3 nucleotides. However, within the total DNA-binding site, the PriA helicase possesses a strong ssDNA-binding subsite, an area that has a high ssDNA affinity and engages in interactions only ∼5–8 nucleotides of the nucleic acid. The intrinsic affinity of the enzyme for the ssDNA is predominantly generated at the strong ssDNA-binding subsite, which is located in the central part of the enzyme molecule, on a structurally separated domain (20.Jezewska M.J.

The functional organization of the PriA helicase-ssDNA complex is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a.During the dsDNA unwinding reaction, the PriA helicase performs a complex free energy transduction process, where the binding and/or hydrolysis of NTPs regulate the enzyme activity, including the affinity toward different conformations of the DNA (8.Lee M.S.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, unlike most of the helicases, the PriA protein has a significant affinity for the ssDNA in the absence of the nucleotide cofactor (20.Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol.

Activities of the PriA helicase in vivo are related to the ability of the enzyme to interact with both the ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and the dsDNA. This includes the unwinding reaction of the dsDNA, fueled by the hydrolysis of NTPs and the assembly of the primosome, which must be initiated by the recognition of the ssDNA gap of the damaged DNA by the enzyme (5.Ng J.Y.

Quantitative thermodynamic analyses showed that, in the complex with the ssDNA, the total DNA-binding site of the PriA helicase occludes ∼20 nucleotides of the nucleic acid (20.Jezewska M.J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11002-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme has a total site size of 20 ± 3 nucleotides. However, within the total DNA-binding site, the PriA helicase possesses a strong ssDNA-binding subsite, an area that has a high ssDNA affinity and engages in interactions only ∼5–8 nucleotides of the nucleic acid. The intrinsic affinity of the enzyme for the ssDNA is predominantly generated at the strong ssDNA-binding subsite, which is located in the central part of the enzyme molecule, on a structurally separated domain (20.Jezewska M.J.

The functional organization of the PriA helicase-ssDNA complex is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). During the dsDNA unwinding reaction, the PriA helicase performs a complex free energy transduction process, where the binding and/or hydrolysis of NTPs regulate the enzyme activity, including the affinity toward different conformations of the DNA (8.Lee M.S. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8345-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9.Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, unlike most of the helicases, the PriA protein has a significant affinity for the ssDNA in the absence of the nucleotide cofactor (20.Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W.

Moreover, what makes the PriA protein different from other well studied helicases is that the enzyme possesses two nucleotide-binding sites, a strong and a weak binding site, which profoundly differ in their affinities for the cofactors and their effects on the intrinsic affinity of the protein for the ssDNA (25.Lucius A.L. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7202-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26.Lucius A.L. Jezewska M.J. Roychowdhury A. Bujalowski W.

Furthermore, cooperative interactions between the two nucleotide-binding sites indicate an intricate communication between the sites (25.Lucius A.L. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7202-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Saturation of both nucleotide-binding sites with ADP induces the engagement of an additional area of the protein, possibly the N terminus domain, in interactions with the ssDNA (27.Lucius A.L. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7237-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although PriA helicase interactions with the ssDNA have been intensively studied, quantitative analysis of the enzyme interactions with the gapped DNA structure has never been addressed (20.Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27865-27873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W.

Nothing is known about the stoichiometries, intrinsic energetics, and cooperativity of the enzyme binding to the gapped DNAs. This is surprising in light of the fact that the PriA helicase must specifically recognize the ssDNA gap formed at the damaged DNA site (16.Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17.Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the role of two nucleotide-binding sites in the recognition process or the effect of the structure of the phosphate group of the nucleotides on the ssDNA gap recognition (25.Lucius A.L.

Elucidation of the PriA-gapped DNA interactions and the role of nucleotide cofactors in the reaction are of fundamental importance for understanding of the enzyme mechanisms in both replication and recombination processes (6.Marians K.J.

In this paper, we describe quantitative studies of the ssDNA gap recognition by the PriA helicase and the effect of the nucleotide cofactors on the recognition reaction. The data indicate a surprisingly small minimum total site size of the enzyme in the gap complex, which is ∼7 nucleotides or bp. The low stoichiometry indicates that the helicase exclusively engages the strong DNA-binding subsite in the gap complex and assumes a very different orientation, compared with the complex with the ssDNA. The PriA helicase binds the ssDNA gaps with 4–5 nucleotides with the highest affinity without engaging in cooperative interactions with the enzyme molecules associated with the surrounding dsDNA. Binding of ADP to strong and weak nucleotide-binding sites of the enzyme profoundly affects the affinity and stoichiometry of the helicase-gapped DNA complex.

Here we report the Ca2+-dependent, stoichiometric association of calmodulin (CaM) with the RUBV NS protease. Co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that both the P150 protein and a 110-residue minidomain within NS protease interacted directly with Ca2+/CaM. The specific interaction was mapped to a putative CaM-binding domain. A 32-mer peptide (residues 1152–1183, denoted as RUBpep) containing the putative CaM-binding domain was used to investigate the association of RUBV NS protease with CaM or its N- and C-terminal subdomains. We found that RUBpep bound to Ca2+/CaM with a dissociation constant of 100–300 nm. The C-terminal subdomain of CaM preferentially bound to RUBpep with an affinity 12.5-fold stronger than the N-terminal subdomain. Fluorescence, circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopic studies revealed a “wrapping around” mode of interaction between RUBpep and Ca2+/CaM with substantially more helical structure in RUBpep and a global structural change in CaM upon complex formation. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we further demonstrated that association of CaM with the CaM-binding domain in the RUBV NS protease was necessary for NS protease activity and infectivity.

Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 69-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The RUBV genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding five proteins after posttranslational proteolytic processing; two proteins (P150 and P90) involved in viral RNA replication are translated from the nonstructural protein ORF (NSP-ORF) and the three structural proteins that form the virus particle are translated from the structural protein ORF (SP-ORF). A cysteine protease domain situated at the C terminus of P150 and immediately upstream from the cleavage site within the NS-ORF precursor (P200) is responsible for the self-cleavage of P200 into P150 and P90 (2.Chen J.P.

Virol. 2006; 151: 1841-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratories have shown that this protease, termed the NS protease, is a papain-like protease with catalytic dyad of Cys1152 and His1273 (2.Chen J.P. Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Frey T.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4707-4713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (numbering refers to residues in P150). We recently showed that the NS protease contains a 29-residue EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif, which plays a structural role in stabilizing the protease at physiological temperatures (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J.

During a bioinformatic search for possible functional domains in the nonstructural proteins, we detected a putative 1-8-14 class calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD) in the RUBV NS protease domain by using the calmodulin (CaM) binding site search and analysis tool (7.Yap K.L.

CaM is a 148-residue acidic intracellular Ca2+ sensor protein that is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells. It consists of two globular and autonomous lobes, each of which contains two EF-hand motifs: motifs I and II in the N-terminal lobe and motifs III and IV in the C-terminal lobe (8.Linse S. Forsén S.

Through its binding to Ca2+ and the concomitant conformational changes that result, CaM is capable of transducing intracellular [Ca2+] changes into numerous cellular events by binding to more than 100 cellular proteins (7.Yap K.L.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus far, there are very few reports on the interaction between CaM and viral proteins. Examples include two HIV proteins, Nef (11.Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Jinbo Y. Titani K. Izumi Y. Matsushima N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12.Matsubara M.

The Ca2+-dependent association of CaM with gp160 has been shown to enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis in HIV-infected cells (14.Micoli K.J. Pan G. Wu Y. Williams J.P. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1233-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed the interaction of CaM with the NS protease domain of RUBV and characterized the interaction between CaM and a 32-residue peptide (aa 1152–1183 of P150, termed RUBpep) corresponding to the predicted CaMBD by using fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of how each lobe of CaM interacts with its target, we further investigated lobe-specific conformational changes and metal binding properties of CaM upon the binding to the peptide. The C-terminal lobe of CaM seems to be the major determinant driving the complex formation through its interaction with the N terminus of the CaMBD in the RUBV NS protease. Finally, we obtained evidence that the Ca2+/CaM-NS protease interaction is critical for the proteolysis of the P200 nonstructural precursor protein and, concomitantly, virus replication. To our knowledge, this is the only documentation of a viral protease that can be modulated through direct interaction with CaM. The potential CaM binding sites were predicted using the CaM target data base developed by Yap et al. (7.Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). A 32-mer peptide containing the predicted CaMBD in the RUBV NS protease (Ac-1152CWLRAAANVAQAARACGAYTSAGCPKCAYGRA1183-NH2, denoted as RUBpep) was then synthesized by the Proteomics Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and purified by preparative reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with purity > 95%. A scrambled peptide (Ac-WCTACAAKVCGAGLARAASCQAAPGANYYRRA-NH2) with the same amino acid composition, but predicted to be unable to interact with CaM, was also synthesized and used as a control. In addition, two mutant peptides with Arg1165 substituted with Gln or Asp were synthesized and purified to >85% purity (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA). The molecular weights of the synthetic peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The peptides were acetylated at their N termini and blocked at their C termini with amide groups to mimic their native protein environment. The N-terminal (aa 1–75 of CaM (CaM-(1–75)) and C-terminal (aa 76–148 of CaM (CaM-(76–148)) subdomains of CaM were created by using standard PCR and cloning techniques. Recombinant CaM and the two subdomains were expressed and purified as described previously (16.Zhou Y. Yang W. Lurtz M.M. Ye Y. Huang Y. Lee H.W. Chen Y. Louis C.F. Yang J.J. J. Biol.

For measurement of the peptide RUBpep binding to the full-length CaM or the two subdomains, 1–5 μm RUBpep was titrated with small aliquots of 0.5–1 mm CaM or CaM subdomain stock solutions in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, with 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA. In each titration, more than 15 data points over a protein-to-peptide molar ratio of 0:1 to 3:1 were collected with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm to minimize the fluorescence intensity contribution from CaM itself. For each point, the fluorescence intensity contribution from CaM or each subdomain was subtracted accordingly. The binding constant of the synthetic peptide to CaM and its subdomains was obtained by fitting the data to a single binding process with the equation, f=([CaM]T+[P]T+Kd)-([CaM]T+[P]T+Kd)2-4⋅[CaM]T[P]T2⋅[CaM]T(Eq. 1) where f is the fractional change of integrated areas of fluorescence intensity (300–450 nm), Kd is the dissociation constant for the peptide, and [P]T and [CaM]T are the total concentrations of the synthetic peptide and CaM (or its subdomains), respectively. For dansyl-CaM fluorescence measurement, RUBpep was added to 1–2 μm dansyl-CaM in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, with 5 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA. The fluorescence spectra were collected using an excitation at 335 nm and an emission between 400 and 600 nm with the slit width set at 4–8 nm. Fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out at 25 °C by adding aliquots of 4 m acrylamide to the sample solution containing 2 μm peptide or protein-peptide complexes. For Trp fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the emission spectra were acquired from 310 to 420 nm. The area of fluorescence intensity at 300–400 nm was used for data analysis by fitting to a revised Stern-Volmer equation, taking into account both of the static and dynamic quenching processes, F0F=(1+KSV⋅[Q]⋅e[Q]⋅V(Eq. 2) where KSV is the dynamic or collisional quenching constant, V is the static quenching constant, [Q] is the concentration of added acrylamide, and F0 and F are the integrated fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of acrylamide, respectively. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured with λex = 295 nm and λem = 328 nm for Trp fluorescence and λex = 335 nm and λem = 500 nm for dansyl fluorescence. An integration time of at least 20 s was used to record the signals, and all of the measurements were repeated at least three times. For the binding of CaM to RUBpep, 1–2 μm RUBpep was titrated with aliquots of 1 mm CaM stock solution. For the binding of RUBpep to dansyl-CaM, 1–2 μm dansyl-CaM was titrated with small aliquots of 1 mm peptide stock solution. All of the buffers consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The fluorescence anisotropy (R) was calculated as reported previously (19.LaPorte D.C. Keller C.H. Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3965-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Theoharis N.T. Sorensen B.R. Theisen-Toupal J. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by using the equation R=IVV−G⋅IVHIVV+2⋅G⋅IVH(Eq. 3) where G = IHV/IHH. IHV and IHH are fluorescence intensities for horizontally excited, vertically and horizontally emitted light, respectively; IVV and IVH are fluorescence intensities for vertically excited, vertically and horizontally emitted light, respectively. The equilibrium Ca2+ binding constants to CaM or the two subdomains were determined by monitoring lobe-specific intrinsic phenylalanine (λex = 250 nm, λem = 280 nm) or tyrosine fluorescence (λex = 270 nm, λem = 295 nm; to minimize the contribution from Trp in the peptide) in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm nitrilotriacetate, 0.05 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at 25 °C as described previously (21.Newman R.A.

The free ionized Ca2+ concentration at each point was determined with the Ca2+ dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-5N (0.2 μm; Kd = 21.7 ± 2.5 μm) (λex = 495 nm, λem = 520 nm). The ionized Ca2+ concentration was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+]free=Kd⋅F-FminFmax-F(Eq. 4) where F is the fluorescence intensity of the dye at each titration point, and Fmin and Fmax are the fluorescence intensities of the Ca2+-free and the Ca2+-saturated dye, respectively. The Ca2+ titration of CaM data was fit to the nonlinear Hill equation, f=[Ca2+]nKdn+[Ca2+]n(Eq. 5) where f is the relative fluorescence change observed during the experiment, [Ca2+] is the concentration of free ionized Ca2+, Kd stands for dissociation constants of Ca2+, and n is the Hill coefficient. Aromatic residue-sensitized Tb3+ luminescence energy transfer (Tb3+-LRET) experiments were carried out as described previously (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23.Ye Y. Lee H.W. Yang W. Shealy S. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3743-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μm Chelex-100-treated protein-peptide complexes were titrated by aliquots of Tb3+ stock in 20 mm PIPES, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 6.8 (to prevent precipitation). An equilibrium time of 15 min was used between each point. Tb3+ emission fluorescence spectra were acquired from 500 to 600 nm with excitation at 295 nm (one Trp in RUBpep) to minimize the contribution from aromatic residues in CaM or its subdomains (no Trp). The background energy transfer from CaM or the two subdomains independently was subtracted accordingly. The slit widths for excitation and emission were 8 and 12 nm, respectively. A glass filter was used to avoid secondary Raleigh scattering. Far UV (195–260 nm) CD spectra of full-length CaM and the two subdomains with and without RUBpep were acquired on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C (Jasco, Easton, MD). The measurements were made with a 0.1- or 1-cm quartz cuvette in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, with 5 mm EGTA or 5 mm CaCl2. Protein or peptide concentrations were 7.5 μm for far-UV CD measurements. All spectra were an average of at least 10 scans with a scan rate of 50 nm/min. The molar ellipticity ([θ], degree cm2 dmol−1) is converted to the molar absorption coefficient (ΔϵM, m−1 cm−1) as ΔϵM = [θ]/3300. The reported mean residue weighted molar absorption coefficient (ΔϵMRW) of a helical polypeptide at 222 nm (10 m−1 cm−1) was used to estimate the α-helical content (24.Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional (1H,15N)-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) with a spectral width of about 13 ppm in the 1H dimension and 36 ppm in the 15N dimension at 35 °C. 0.5 mm 15N uniformly labeled CaM with and without the addition of 2-fold molar excess of RUBpep was used in a buffer consisting of 10% D2O, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm Ca2+. The pH values of both sample solutions were carefully adjusted to 7.5 with a trace amount of 2 m KOH. NMR data were processed using the FELIX98 program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Chemical shift perturbations (Δδ) of the (1H,15N)-HSQC spectra of CaM before and after RUBpep binding were calculated using the weighted average chemical shift difference of main chain amide proton (Δδ1H) and amide nitrogen (Δδ15N) resonances (26.Pellecchia M.

Both contain an HA epitope tag at the upstream NotI site in the P150 gene. The mutations R1165Q and R1165E were introduced into RUBrep-HA/GFP using a PCR-based procedure described previously (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J.

Transfection of Vero cells with RUBrep-HA/GFP transcripts, determination of viability, and an in vivo NS protease cleavage assay were carried out as described previously (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Ye Y. Huang Y. Li S. Chen Y. Frey T.K. Yang J.J. Biochem.

For immunoprecipitation, Vero cells infected with Robo502/HA (multiplicity of infection = 1 plaque-forming unit/cell) were lysed at 3 days post-infection. The supernatant was incubated with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-CaM monoclonal antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Subsequently, protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. Following 1 h of incubation in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, the agarose beads were washed three times, and bead-protein-antibody complexes were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer to elute bound proteins. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the gel contents were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by probing with anti-HA antibody. Binary pulldown assays were performed as follows. For GST pulldown, 50 μg of GST-RUBCa, GST-RUBCa- R1165Q, GST-RUBCa-R1165D, or GST was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), incubated with purified CaM (100 μg) in 25 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT supplemented with either 1 mm EGTA (Ca2+-depeleted condition) or 1 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+-saturated condition) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then washed 10 times with the corresponding buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding. The CaM pulldown assay was carried out similarly, except that CaM-conjugated Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) was incubated individually with 50 μg of GST-RUBCa, GST-RUBCa-R1165Q GST-RUBCa-R1165D, or GST under Ca2+-depleted or -saturated conditions. After washing, the beads were incubated with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, centrifuged briefly, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 for visualization. CaM target sequences have been found to share features such as the distribution of hydrophobic and basic residues and the propensity to form a helical structure. These shared features were exploited to develop a CaM target prediction tool by Yap et al. (7.Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Using this tool, we identified a CaMBD with a high predictive score in the NS protease domain of RUBV, an enzyme that mediates the cleavage of a polyprotein precursor (P200) into two components, P150 and P90 (Fig. 1A), which are located N- and C-terminally, respectively, within the precursor. The NS protease is located at the C terminus of P150. Interestingly, the predicted CaMBD contains one member of the catalytic dyad of the NS protease Cys1152. The predicted CaMBD exhibited a 1-8-14 pattern of hydrophobic residue arrangement similar to those observed in well characterized CaM targeted proteins, such as smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK) (Fig. 1B) (7.Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 30.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we built a model structure of the RUBV NS protease and used it for the successful prediction of both Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding domains (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Ye Y. Huang Y. Li S. Chen Y. Frey T.K. Yang J.J. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). According to this model (Fig. 1A), the CaMBD has an intrinsic propensity to form a helical structure. A helical wheel representation of the predicted CaMBD sequence clearly shows the clustering of hydrophobic residues on one side and two charged residues on the other side (Fig. 1B), which is an invariant property of other CaM target sequences. To confirm the interaction between CaM and the RUBV NS protease in a physiological context, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using lysates of Vero cells infected with Robo502-HA, a virus with an HA epitope tag in the P150 protein. With 1 mm Ca2+ in the immunoprecipitation buffer, the HA-tagged NS protein P150, but not the precursor polypeptide P200, was immunoprecipitated by the anti-CaM antibody (Fig. 1C). P150 is a large (1300 aa) protein produced only in small amounts in infected cells. Thus, in our earlier studies, a bacterially expressed minidomain within the NS protease, RUBCa (aa 1143–1252; CaMBD is aa 1152–1183), was employed to study the metal binding properties of the RUBV NS protease (4.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Yang W. Zhou Y. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Frey T.K. Yang J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7517-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.Zhou Y. Tzeng W.P. Ye Y. Huang Y. Li S. Chen Y. Frey T.K. Yang J.J. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). According to the CaMBD prediction algorithm of Yap et al. (7.Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), substituting Arg1165 with a polar residue (Gln) or an oppositely charged residue (Asp) resulted in a zero predictive score. We thus introduced the mutations R1165Q and R1165D into the RUBCa minidomain, and both wild-type and mutant minidomains were expressed as GST fusion proteins, First, CaM conjugated to Sepharose (CaM-Sepharose) was used as prey to potential GST fusion targets under Ca2+-depleted (1 mm EGTA) or Ca2+-saturated (1 mm CaCl2) conditions. Both GST-RUBCa and the GST-RUBCa-R1165Q mutant bound to CaM-Sepharose in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, although the mutant showed less interaction than did the WT. In contrast, we did not detect an interaction between the second mutant, GST-RUBCa-R1165D, and CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1D). The reciprocal pulldown assay further confirmed this observation. CaM bound to GST-RUBCa and GST-RUBCa-R1165Q immobilized on glutathione beads, but not to the mutant GST-RUBCa-R1165D, in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1E). The interaction was independent of the GST tag, as there was no detectable association between GST and CaM in either of the pulldown assays. All of the input and the bound proteins could be visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining with no detectable background bands, demonstrating unambiguously the Ca2+-dependent direct protein-protein interaction between the minidomain within NS protease and CaM with no intermediary factors. Next, a 32-mer peptide corresponding to the predicted CaMBD was synthesized to examine its interaction with CaM; this peptide was termed “RUBpep.” The single Trp residue in RUBpep (there are no Trp residues in CaM) provides a convenient intrinsic probe to detect conformational changes of RUBpep during its association with CaM and its N-terminal (CaM-(1–75)) or C- terminal (CaM-(76–148)) subdomains. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, free RUBpep exhibited an emission maximum (λem) at 355 nm, indicating that the Trp residue in the peptide"

Previously, we have characterized the protective effects of moderate hyperoxia on cell viability of ischemic human cardiomyocytes and their mitochondrial membrane potential by transient addition of oxygenated perfluorocarbons to the cell medium. Now, we report that the activity and expression of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) after prolonged ischemia depend on the amount of oxygen delivered during reoxygenation. Transient hyperoxia during reoxygenation results in a decrease of COX activity by 62 ± 15% and COX expression by 67 ± 5%, when hyperoxic tensions of ≈300 mm Hg are reached in the cell medium. This decrease in COX expression is prevented by the inhibition of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Immunoblot analysis of ischemic human cardiomyocytes revealed that hyperoxic reoxygenation causes a 2-fold increase of iNOS, leading to a rise in nitric oxide production by 140 ± 45%. Hyperoxic reoxygenation is further responsible for a 2-fold activation of hydrogen peroxide production and an increase in cytosolic superoxide dismutase expression by 35 ± 10%. NADPH availability has no effect on the hyperoxia-induced decrease of superoxide.

Previously, we have characterized the effects of different hyperoxic conditions on cell viability of ischemic human cardiomyocytes and their mitochondria by the addition of oxygenated PFC to the cell medium (see Fig. 1). Mitochondria have a key function in cardiomyocyte survival after ischemia and reperfusion because mitochondrial respiration produces more than 90% of the heart's energy by oxidative phosphorylation (4Barth E. Stämmler G. Speiser B. Schaper J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1992; 24: 669-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Nitric oxide (NO) can inhibit oxidative phosphorylation reversibly by blocking cytochrome c oxidase (COX) of the electron transport chain (ETC) (10Brown G.C. Cooper C.E.

We have shown previously that hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α are stabilized after hyperoxic reoxygenation with oxygenated PFC and that their stabilization is protective for ischemic human cardiomyocytes (14Arab A.

However, it is unclear how hyperoxia affects NO production in ischemic cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the effects of hyperoxia on ischemic cardiomyocytes with regard to changes in oxidative phosphorylation and NO production and in particular by evaluating of the role of iNOS, COX, and the production of reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation.

Briefly, heart tissue from the right atrium was obtained from male, Caucasian patients undergoing cardiovascular bypass surgery. The tissue was carefully dissected and further softened by digestion with 0.1% collagenase VII. Tissue specimens were cultured in smooth muscle growth medium (PromoCell).

Pure PFC was ventilated with 100% carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2), added to the cell medium, and removed after 10 min. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the perfluorooctyl bromide-supplemented cell medium obeys Henry's law of partial pressures (Fig. 1) and was calculated as described previously (14Arab A. Kuemmerer K. Wang J. Bode C. Hehrlein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 325: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, we added liquid oxygenated PFC to ischemic cardiomyocytes cultured in cell medium to induce hyperoxic conditions around the cells. The increase of oxygen in the cell culture medium was verified with a GMH 3610 analyzer for dissolved oxygen from Greisinger Electronics (Regenstauf, Germany). Oxygen tensions were transiently elevated to hyperoxic values of ≈300 mm Hg for a period of 10 min. Cellular changes of ischemic cardiomyocytes were studied 3 h after reoxygenation. Cell viability was analyzed by fluorescent staining as reported previously (16Foglieni C. Meoni C. Davalli A.M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 115: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used a triple dye combination of acridine orange, Hoechst 33342, and propidium iodide that visualizes all cell viability states simultaneously on the basis of nuclear and cytoplasmic signals. Healthy cells showed green colored cytoplasms; early apoptotic cells dark rust-yellow cytoplasms; necrotic cells showed orange cytoplasms. Axiovision® 3.1 and KS 300® 3.0 software, both from Zeiss (Goettingen, Germany), were used for quantification. Hydrogen peroxide production was assessed by dichlorofluorescein, as described previously by Royall and Ischiropoulos (17Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were incubated in cell medium supplemented with 10 μm dichlorofluorescein for 45 min within the cell culture incubator, fixed in 3.7% formalin at 37 °C for 15 min, and counterstained with DAPI. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 2.5 μm diaminofluorescein and 200 μm l-arginine with or without 1 mm aminoguanidine hemisulfate in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were added. After incubation for further 2 h, the supernatants were transferred to black microplates, and the fluorescence was measured at 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission using a SpectraMax Gemini fluorometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Cardiomyocytes were lysed using the MEM-PER eukaryotic membrane protein extraction kit from Pierce. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as control. Protein aliquots were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted overnight with the indicated primary antibody and secondary antibody. The CDP-Star Reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences was used for detection. Superoxide production was analyzed by lucigenin chemiluminescence. Briefly, after incubating cardiomyocytes with 50 mm diethyldithiocarbamate for 10 min (18Omar H.A. Cherry P.D. Mortelliti M.P. Burke-Wolin T. Wolin M.S. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), cells were analyzed in HEPES buffer containing increasing concentrations of NADPH after the addition of lucigenin that emits light on reduction of superoxide (19Pagano P.J. Ito Y. Tornheim K. Gallop P.M. Tauber A.I. Cohen R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2274-H2280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence was determined using a TD-20/20 luminometer from Turner Designs (Sunnyvale, CA). Consecutively, cardiomyocytes were incubated in 1% formalin at 4 °C overnight, in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked for 1 h, and finally stained in 5% bovine serum albumin with the indicated primary antibody for 1 h and fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody for 4 h. Cardiomyocytes were visualized with an Axioplan 2 imaging® fluorescence microscopy from Zeiss. Mitochondria were extracted by homogenization and centrifugation with buffers of MITOISO® mitochondria isolation kit from Sigma following the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of mitochondria were used in a cytochrome c oxidase assay kit (Sigma) that measures the decrease in absorbance of ferrocytochrome c by its oxidation with COX. Absorbance at 550 nm was determined using a SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices. Vmax was derived from the maximal change in absorbance/second and was calculated by SoftMax Pro software from Molecular Devices. The mean value of change in absorbance was 2 × 10−4 for normoxic and 2 × 10−5 for hyperoxic reoxygenation. Hypoxic cardiomyocytes were reoxygenated during transient hyperoxia with and without iNOS inhibition by 1400W (5 μm). Cardiomyocytes were lysed in TRIzol, and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with a cDNA synthesis kit from Roche Diagnostics. Transcripts for isoform 1 of COX4 subunit were amplified by real-time PCR using specific primers that have been described previously (20Fukuda R. Zhang H. Kim J.W. Shimoda L. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Cell. 2007; 129: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using a LightCycler System and the corresponding FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). Ru(phen3)2+ is a fluorochrome that is used as an indicator of intracellular oxygen tension. Its fluorescence is inversely proportional to the cellular oxygen tension (21Victor V.M. Nuñez C. D'Ocón P. Taylor C.T. Esplugues J.V. Moncada S. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After reoxygenation with oxygenated PFC, Ru(phen3)2+ was added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 0.1 mm. 3 h after loading of Ru(phen3)2+, changes in the fluorescence of cardiomyocytes were documented with an Axioplan 2 imaging® fluorescence microscopy. Axiovision® 3.1 and KS 300® 3.0 software from Zeiss were used for densitometry analysis. Data are normalized for the amount of protein or number of cells engaged. All experiments were repeated at least four times. Data are given as percent from normoxic value, which was set at 100%, and are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made using unpaired an Student's t test or one-way ANOVA when appropriate. Results were considered to be significantly different when p < 0.05. We found that the cell viability of cardiomyocytes is decreased after 12 h of ischemia (by 29 ± 7%, p < 0.05; data not shown) compared with normoxic cells. Normoxic cells, not being exposed to ischemia and reoxygenation, do not behave differently from normoxic cells subjected to moderate hyperoxia (change in viability 3 ± 8%; data not shown). We investigated whether a brief treatment of ischemic cardiomyocytes inducing hyperoxic conditions in the cell medium during reoxygenation changes COX activity compared with normoxic conditions. After oxygen treatment, COX activity of ischemic cardiomyocytes showed a significant decrease (38 ± 15%, p < 0.05; data not shown). In addition, a significant decrease of pH was detectable (55 ± 17%, p < 0.05; data not shown). Fig. 2, A and B, shows that reoxygenated cardiomyocytes have decreased their oxygen consumption after exposure to hyperoxia. This decrease in oxygen consumption was quantified as shown in Fig. 2C and reflects the decrease in COX activity (40 ± 9%, p < 0.05). The role of NADPH in superoxide production was investigated by measuring superoxide chemiluminescence after exposing ischemic human cardiomyocytes to hyperoxic conditions during reoxygenation. Fig. 3 shows a decrease in superoxide production, after hyperoxia was applied. This decrease in superoxide production persisted throughout NADPH addition compared with superoxide levels of ischemic human cardiomyocytes after normoxic reoxygenation (75 ± 6%, p < 0.05). The contribution of hyperoxic conditions during reoxygenation on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was tested by assessing the distribution pattern of the fluorochrome dichlorofluorescein in the cytosol of ischemic cardiomyocytes. Fig. 4B shows an ischemic cardiomyocyte with an increased cytosolic H2O2 production after reoxygenation under hyperoxic conditions compared with a cardiomyocyte after normoxic reoxygenation in Fig. 4A. In Fig. 4C, densitometry analysis confirmed that H2O2 production increased significantly (210 ± 37%, p < 0.05) after reoxygenation of ischemic cardiomyocytes. The cytosolic signal of copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuSOD) was detectable by immunhistochemistry in ischemic cardiomyocytes as soon as 1 h after reoxygenation applying hyperoxic conditions (Fig. 5B) and compared with the CuSOD signal after normoxic reoxygenation (Fig. 5A). In Fig. 5C, densitometry analysis confirmed that CuSOD expression was significantly enhanced (135 ± 11%, p < 0.05) 1 h after employing hyperoxia. To address the role of NO, the expression of nitric-oxide synthase isoforms was studied after applying hyperoxic conditions during reoxygenation of ischemic cardiomyocytes. Already 1 h after hyperoxia, the expression of iNOS increased significantly (196 ± 17%, p < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 6A. But when we performed Western blot analysis of cardiomyoctes after 12 h of ischemia, we were not able to find significant amounts of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase or neuronal nitric-oxide synthase either with or without hyperoxic reoxygenation. NO production was determined by the fluorochrome diaminofluorescein, and the pattern of the NO production confirmed the results of iNOS expression (Fig. 6B). Subsequently, COX expression was decreased after transient hyperoxia as determined by real-time PCR in Fig. 6C (33 ± 5%, p < 0.05). When NO production was reduced by iNOS inhibitor 1400W, COX expression of ischemic cardiomyocytes showed a significant increase (194 ± 17%, p < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 6D. We report here that the level of NO depends on the oxygen concentration during reoxygenation of ischemic cardiomyocytes. Transient hyperoxic reoxygenation increases the production of NO and the NO-protective expression of cytosolic SOD. In our previous paper, we presented information about cell viability of ischemic cardiomyocytes (14Arab A. Kuemmerer K. Wang J. Bode C. Hehrlein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 325: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The rationale for using cardiomyocytes after prolonged ischemia in this model was to understand why patients with myocardial infarction subjected to normoxic reperfusion after 12 h often do not experience complete myocardial salvage. We showed that the viability of ischemic cardiomyocytes is significantly increased by reoxygenation using transient moderate hyperoxia. Now, we report that transient increases in oxygen tensions to moderate hyperoxic values of ≈300 mm Hg during reoxygenation induce mitochondrial respiration arrest and cytoprotective mechanisms such as NO production whereas normoxic conditions do not induce these processes and lead to a shortening of lifespan of ischemic cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7). It has been shown that reoxygenation of ischemic cardiomyocytes is associated with an up-regulation of iNOS and that expression of iNOS protects ischemic tissue during reoxygenation (22Chen H. Li D. Saldeen T. Mehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1035-H1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that transient hyperoxic conditions during reoxygenation increases iNOS expression and thereby may act cell protective by decreasing oxygen sensitivity of ischemic cardiomyocytes. Because this iNOS increase precedes all other effects we examined, we consider iNOS and its NO production to be the most important protective factors in our study. It is established that NO inhibits oxygen consumption of mitochondria by ETC inhibition of complex IV (23Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 24Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We show that cytochrome c oxidase activity is decreased after reoxygenation of ischemic cardiomyocytes with oxygen supplementation and that this effect can be overcome by iNOS inhibition, confirming that NO inhibits oxygen consumption at the level of COX (10Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The successive decrease of electron transport chain activity resulted in reduced oxidative phosphorylation and reduced proton consumption leading to a pH decrease after oxygen delivery. This result was consistent with previous findings after inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (25Evtodienko Y.V. Teplova V.V. Sidash S.S. Ichas F. Mazat J.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, NO inhibition of ETC has been proven protective for the mitochondrial membrane potential (12Beltrán B. Mathur A. Duchen M.R. Erusalimsky J.D. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that we have shown previously for oxygen delivery (14Arab A. Kuemmerer K. Wang J. Bode C. Hehrlein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 325: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thomas et al (26Thomas D.D. Liu X. Kantrow S.P. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NO inhibition of ETC might extend the zone of tissue oxygenation in vivo. Reversible NO inhibition of ETC results in reduced cytotoxicity from superoxide (27Wink D.A. Hanbauer I. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) and may help mitochondria to cope with oxidative stress (28Husain M. Bourret T.J. McCollister B.D. Jones-Carson J. Laughlin J. Vázquez-Torres A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7682-7689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We show that oxygen delivery results in a decrease in superoxide production that persists during stimulation of NADPH oxidase by NADPH, a major source of superoxide in myocytes (8Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). Increased oxygen tensions around ischemic cardiomyocytes during reoxygenation decreased superoxide production, which coincided with an augmented expression of antioxidant cytosolic SOD, thereby protecting NO from inactivation by superoxide (29Demchenko I.T. Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Piantadosi C.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the α-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is stabilized after optimized oxygen treatment by moderate hyperoxia. Fukuda et al. (20Fukuda R. Zhang H. Kim J.W. Shimoda L. Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Cell. 2007; 129: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 regulates COX activity by switching from the normoxic isoform 1 to the hypoxic isoform 2 of COX subunit 4, thereby increasing the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration and reducing H2O2 production. We speculate that moderate hyperoxia of ≈300 mm Hg during reoxygenation may delay the shift of mitochondrial respiration from hypoxic back to normoxic ETC activity. In summary, we have found that ETC activity after prolonged ischemia depends on the dose of oxygen supplementation during reoxygenation. Reoxygenation with elevated concentrations of oxygen results in decreased ETC activity and causes an increase of iNOS, leading to a rise in NO production. Reoxygenation using hyperoxic conditions is further responsible for an activation of H2O2 production and a decrease of superoxide independently of NADPH availability by an increase in cytosolic SOD expression that protects NO. These results indicate that oxygen applied in defined concentrations above physiological and ambient oxygen conditions can improve cell survival during reoxygenation by increasing NO levels and reducing ETC activity in ischemic cardiomyocytes."
