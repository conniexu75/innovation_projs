https://openalex.org/W2765817865,"Playing a musical instrument engages various sensorimotor processes and draws on cognitive capacities collectively termed executive functions. However, while music training is believed to associated with enhancements in certain cognitive and language abilities, studies that have explored the specific relationship between music and executive function have yielded conflicting results. As part of an ongoing longitudinal study, we investigated the effects of music training on executive function using fMRI and several behavioral tasks, including the Color-Word Stroop task. Children involved in ongoing music training (N = 14, mean age = 8.67) were compared with two groups of comparable general cognitive abilities and socioeconomic status, one involved in sports (“sports” group, N = 13, mean age = 8.85) and another not involved in music or sports (“control” group, N = 17, mean age = 9.05). During the Color-Word Stroop task, children with music training showed significantly greater bilateral activation in the pre-SMA/SMA, ACC, IFG, and insula in trials that required cognitive control compared to the control group, despite no differences in performance on behavioral measures of executive function. No significant differences in brain activation or in task performance were found between the music and sports groups. The results suggest that systematic extracurricular training, particularly music-based training, is associated with changes in the cognitive control network in the brain even in the absence of changes in behavioral performance."
https://openalex.org/W2761592537,"We were tasked by the South African Department of Health to assess the cost implications to the largest ART programme in the world of adopting sets of ART guidelines issued by the World Health Organization between 2010 and 2016.Using data from large South African ART clinics (n = 24,244 patients), projections of patients in need of ART, and cost data from bottom-up cost analyses, we constructed a population-level health-state transition model with 6-monthly transitions between health states depending on patients' age, CD4 cell count/ percentage, and, for adult first-line ART, time on treatment.For each set of guidelines, the modelled increase in patient numbers as a result of prevalence and uptake was substantially more than the increase resulting from additional eligibility. Under each set of guidelines, the number of people on ART was projected to increase by 31-133% over the next seven years, and cost by 84-175%, while increased eligibility led to 1-26% more patients, and 1-17% higher cost. The projected increases in treatment cost due to the 2010 and the 2015 WHO guidelines could be offset in their entirety by the introduction of cost-saving measures such as opening the drug tenders for international competition and task-shifting. Under universal treatment, annual costs of the treatment programme will decrease for the first time from 2024 onwards.Annual budgetary requirements for ART will continue to increase in South Africa until universal treatment is taken to full scale. Model results were instrumental in changing South African ART guidelines, more than tripling the population on treatment between 2009 and 2017, and reducing the per-patient cost of treatment by 64%."
https://openalex.org/W2766177559,"Researchers have previously reported that hazard proximity can influence risk perception among individuals exposed to potential hazards. Understanding this relationship among coastline communities at risk of flood events caused by storms and/or tsunamis, is important because hazard proximity, should be recognized when planning and implementing preparation and mitigation actions against these events. Yet, we are not aware of studies that have examined this relationship among coastline inhabitants facing the risk of a tsunami. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between hazard proximity and perceived risk from tsunamis among coastline inhabitants. Participants were 487 residents of the coastal city of Iquique, Chile. They completed a survey during the spring of 2013 that assessed their perceived risk from several natural and non-natural hazards. We found that hazard proximity maintains a negative relationship with the perception of tsunami risk among coastline inhabitants. While this result confirms the general trend obtained in previous studies, this one is conclusive and significant. In contradiction with previous findings, we found that participants from the highest socioeconomic status reported the highest levels of risk perception. This finding can be explained by the fact that most participants from the highest socioeconomic status live closer to the coastline areas, so their risk perception reflects the place where they live, that is in a tsunami inundation zone. Once again, hazard proximity proved to be a determinant factor of risk perception. Our findings have important implications for the development of plans and programs for tsunami preparedness and mitigation. These indicate that individuals do use environmental cues to evaluate their own risk and can potentially make correct choices when having or not to evacuate. Also suggest that preparedness should incorporate how hazard proximity is recognized by individuals and communities at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2765141445,"Background Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is disproportionally concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the odds of dying from TBI in Uganda more than 4 times higher than in high income countries (HICs). The objectives of this study are to describe the processes of care and determine risk factors predictive of poor outcomes for TBI patients presenting to Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), Kampala, Uganda. Methods We used a prospective neurosurgical registry based on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to systematically collect variables spanning 8 categories. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to determine significant predictors of mortality. Results 563 TBI patients were enrolled from 1 June– 30 November 2016. 102 patients (18%) received surgery, 29 patients (5.1%) intended for surgery failed to receive it, and 251 patients (45%) received non-operative management. Overall mortality was 9.6%, which ranged from 4.7% for mild and moderate TBI to 55% for severe TBI patients with GCS 3–5. Within each TBI severity category, mortality differed by management pathway. Variables predictive of mortality were TBI severity, more than one intracranial bleed, failure to receive surgery, high dependency unit admission, ventilator support outside of surgery, and hospital arrival delayed by more than 4 hours. Conclusions The overall mortality rate of 9.6% in Uganda for TBI is high, and likely underestimates the true TBI mortality. Furthermore, the wide-ranging mortality (3–82%), high ICU fatality, and negative impact of care delays suggest shortcomings with the current triaging practices. Lack of surgical intervention when needed was highly predictive of mortality in TBI patients. Further research into the determinants of surgical interventions, quality of step-up care, and prolonged care delays are needed to better understand the complex interplay of variables that affect patient outcome. These insights guide the development of future interventions and resource allocation to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2766064004,"The use of diversity metrics has a long history in population ecology, while population genetic work has been dominated by variance-derived metrics instead, a technical gap that has slowed cross-communication between the fields. Interestingly, Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RQE), comparing elements for 'degrees of divergence', was originally developed for population ecology, but has recently been deployed for evolutionary studies. We here translate RQE into a continuous diversity analogue, and then construct a multiply nested diversity partition for alleles, individuals, populations, and species, each component of which exhibits the behavior of proper diversity metrics, and then translate these components into [0,1]-scaled form. We also deploy non-parametric statistical tests of the among-stratum components and novel tests of the homogeneity of within-stratum diversity components at any hierarchical level. We then illustrate this new analysis with eight nSSR loci and a pair of close Australian marsupial (Antechinus) congeners, using both 'different is different' and 'degree of difference' distance metrics. The total diversity in the collection is larger than that within either species, but most of the within-species diversity is resident within single populations. The combined A. agilis collection exhibits more diversity than does the combined A. stuartii collection, possibly attributable to localized differences in either local ecological disturbance regimes or differential levels of population isolation. Beyond exhibiting different allelic compositions, the two congeners are becoming more divergent for the arrays of allele sizes they possess."
https://openalex.org/W2767110860,"MF59 is an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant approved for human influenza vaccination in European Union. The mode of action of MF59 is not fully elucidated yet, but results from several years of investigation indicate that MF59 establishes an immunocompetent environment at injection site which promotes recruitment of immune cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs), that are facilitated to engulf antigen and transport it to draining lymph node (dLN) where the antigen is accumulated. In vitro studies showed that MF59 promotes the differentiation of monocytes to dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Since after immunization with MF59, monocytes are rapidly recruited both at the injection site and in dLN and appear to have a morphological change toward a DC-like phenotype, we asked whether MF59 could play a role in inducing differentiation of Mo-DC in vivo. To address this question we immunized mice with the auto-fluorescent protein Phycoerythrin (PE) as model antigen, in presence or absence of MF59. We measured the APC phenotype and their antigen uptake within dLNs, the antigen distribution within the dLN compartments and the humoral response to PE. In addition, using Ovalbumin as model antigen, we measured the capacity of dLN APCs to induce antigen-specific CD4 T cell proliferation. Here, we show, for the first time, that MF59 promotes differentiation of Mo-DCs within dLNs from intranodal recruited monocytes and we suggest that this differentiation could take place in the medullary compartment of the LN. In addition we show that the Mo-DC subset represents the major source of antigen-loaded and activated APCs within the dLN when immunizing with MF59. Interestingly, this finding correlates with the enhanced triggering of antigen-specific CD4 T cell response induced by LN APCs. This study therefore demonstrates that MF59 is able to promote an immunocompetent environment also directly within the dLN, offering a novel insight on the mechanism of action of vaccine adjuvants based on emulsions."
https://openalex.org/W2766457869,"Plants are a promising alternative for the production of biotherapeutics. Manufacturing in-planta adds plant specific glycans. To understand immunogenic potential of these glycans, we developed a validated method to detect plant specific glycan antibodies in human serum. Using this assay, low prevalence of pre-existing anti-plant glycan antibodies was found in healthy humans (13.5%) and in glucocerebrosidase-deficient Gaucher disease (GD) patients (5%). A low incidence (9% in naïve patient and none in treatment experienced patients) of induced anti-plant glycan antibodies was observed in GD patients after up to 30 months replacement therapy treatment with taliglucerase alfa, a version of human glucocerebrosidase produced in plant cells. Detailed evaluation of clinical safety and efficacy endpoints indicated that anti-plant glycan antibodies did not affect the safety or efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in patients. This study shows the benefit of using large scale human trials to evaluate the immunogenicity risk of plant derived glycans, and indicates no apparent risk related to anti-plant glycan antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2765918969,"Gut dysbiosis is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, including obesity. Ophiopogonin D (OP-D), a steroidal glycoside and an active component extracted from the root of the plant Ophiopogon japonicus (also known as radix ophiopogonis), can regulate multiple physiologic processes. Here we show that OP-D administration reduces body weight, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance in male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Pyrosequencing of the V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes in mouse feces revealed a deviation of the gut microbiota in response to OP-D treatment. In particular, the decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios and endotoxin-bearing Proteobacteria levels indicated that OP-D reversed HFD-induced gut dysbiosis. More importantly, the effects of OP-D on modulation of obesity and microbiota were transferable via horizontal feces transfer from OP-D-treated mice to HFD-fed mice. Taken together, our results suggest that OP-D may be used as a prebiotic agent to treat obesity-associated gut dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome.—Chen, S., Li, X., Liu, L., Liu, C., Han, X.

https://openalex.org/W2765365439,"Evidence is emerging that systemic inflammation after trauma drives structural and functional impairment of cardiomyocytes and leads to cardiac dysfunction, thus worsening the outcome of polytrauma patients. This study investigates the structural and molecular changes in heart tissue 4 h after multiple injuries with additional hemorrhagic shock using a clinically relevant rodent model of polytrauma. We determined mediators of systemic inflammation (keratinocyte chemoattractant, macrophage chemotactic protein 1), activated complement component C3a and cardiac troponin I in plasma and assessed histological specimen of the mouse heart via standard histomorphology and immunohistochemistry for cellular and subcellular damage and ongoing apoptosis. Further we investigated spatial and quantitative changes of connexin 43 by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Our results show significantly increased plasma levels of both keratinocyte chemoattractant and cardiac troponin I 4 h after polytrauma and 2 h after induction of hypovolemia. Although we could not detect any morphological changes, immunohistochemical evaluation showed increased level of tissue high-mobility group box 1, which is both a damage-associated molecule and actively released as a danger response signal. Additionally, there was marked lateralization of the cardiac gap-junction protein connexin 43 following combined polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock. These results demonstrate a molecular manifestation of remote injury of cardiac muscle cells in the early phase after polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock with marked disruption of the cardiac gap junction. This disruption of an important component of the electrical conduction system of the heart may lead to arrhythmia and consequently to cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2765781338,"DNA secondary structures and methylation are two well-known mechanisms that regulate gene expression. The catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), is overexpressed in ∼90% of human cancers to maintain telomere length for cell immortalization. Binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to the first exon of the hTERT gene can down-regulate its expression. However, DNA methylation in the first exon can prevent CTCF binding in most cancers, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. The NMR analysis showed that a stretch of guanine-rich sequence in the first exon of hTERT and located within the CTCF-binding region can form two secondary structures, a hairpin and a quadruplex. A key finding was that the methylation of cytosine at the specific CpG dinucleotides will participate in quartet formation, causing the shift of the equilibrium from the hairpin structure to the quadruplex structure. Of further importance was the finding that the quadruplex formation disrupts CTCF protein binding, which results in an increase in hTERT gene expression. Our results not only identify quadruplex formation in the first exon promoted by CpG dinucleotide methylation as a regulator of hTERT expression but also provide a possible mechanistic insight into the regulation of gene expression via secondary DNA structures."
https://openalex.org/W2765734874,"Eastern North Pacific gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling from their summer feeding areas in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to their wintering areas in the lagoons of Baja California, Mexico. Although a significant body of knowledge on gray whale biology and behavior exists, little is known about their vocal behavior while migrating. In this study, we used a sparse hydrophone array deployed offshore of central California to investigate how gray whales behave and use sound while migrating. We detected, localized, and tracked whales for one full migration season, a first for gray whales. We verified and localized 10,644 gray whale M3 calls and grouped them into 280 tracks. Results confirm that gray whales are acoustically active while migrating and their swimming and acoustic behavior changes on daily and seasonal time scales. The seasonal timing of the calls verifies the gray whale migration timing determined using other methods such as counts conducted by visual observers. The total number of calls and the percentage of calls that were part of a track changed significantly over both seasonal and daily time scales. An average calling rate of 5.7 calls/whale/day was observed, which is significantly greater than previously reported migration calling rates. We measured a mean speed of 1.6 m/s and quantified heading, direction, and water depth where tracks were located. Mean speed and water depth remained constant between night and day, but these quantities had greater variation at night. Gray whales produce M3 calls with a root mean square source level of 156.9 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m. Quantities describing call characteristics were variable and dependent on site-specific propagation characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2765080810,"Many interaction partners of β-arrestins intervene in the control of mRNA translation. However, how β-arrestins regulate this cellular process has been poorly explored. In this study, we show that β-arrestins constitutively assemble a p70S6K/ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) complex in HEK293 cells and in primary Sertoli cells of the testis. We demonstrate that this interaction is direct, and experimentally validate the interaction interface between β-arrestin 1 and p70S6K predicted by our docking algorithm. Like most GPCRs, the biological function of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is transduced by G proteins and β-arrestins. Upon follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation, activation of G protein-dependent signaling enhances p70S6K activity within the β-arrestin/p70S6K/rpS6 preassembled complex, which is not recruited to the FSHR. In agreement, FSH-induced rpS6 phosphorylation within the β-arrestin scaffold was decreased in cells depleted of Gαs. Integration of the cooperative action of β-arrestin and G proteins led to the translation of 5' oligopyrimidine track mRNA with high efficacy within minutes of FSH input. Hence, this work highlights new relationships between G proteins and β-arrestins when acting cooperatively on a common signaling pathway, contrasting with their previously shown parallel action on the ERK MAP kinase pathway. In addition, this study provides insights into how GPCR can exert trophic effects in the cell.-Tréfier, A., Musnier, A., Landomiel, F., Bourquard, T., Boulo, T., Ayoub, M.

https://openalex.org/W2765415706,"The success of medical threatments with DNA and silencing interference RNA is strongly related to the design of efficient delivery technologies. Cationic polymers represent an attractive strategy to serve as nucleic-acid carriers with the envisioned advantages of efficient complexation, low cost, ease of production, well-defined size, and low polydispersity index. However, the balance between efficacy and toxicity (safety) of these polymers is a challenge and in need of improvement. With the aim of designing more effective polycationic-based gene carriers, many parameters such as carrier morphology, size, molecular weight, surface chemistry, and flexibility/rigidity ratio need to be taken into consideration. In the present work, the binding mechanism of three cationic polymers (polyarginine, polylysine and polyethyleneimine) to a model siRNA target is computationally investigated at the atomistic level. In order to better understand the polycationic carrier-siRNA interactions, replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to provide an exhaustive exploration of all the possible binding sites, taking fully into account the siRNA flexibility together with the presence of explicit solvent and ions. Moreover, well-tempered metadynamics simulations were employed to elucidate how molecular geometry, polycation flexibility, and charge neutralization affect the siRNA-polycations free energy landscape in term of low-energy binding modes and unbinding free energy barriers. Significant differences among polymer binding modes have been detected, revealing the advantageous binding properties of polyarginine and polylysine compared to polyethyleneimine."
https://openalex.org/W2765949005,"A method for grafting ethylenediamine to a magnetic graphene oxide composite (EDA-GO@Fe3O4) was developed for Cr(VI) decontamination. The physicochemical properties of EDA-GO@Fe3O4 were characterized using HRTEM, EDS, FT-IR, TG-DSC, and XPS. The effects of pH, sorbent dose, foreign anions, time, Cr(VI) concentration, and temperature on decontamination process were studied. The solution pH can largely affect the decontamination process. The pseudo-second-order model is suitable for being applied to fit the adsorption processes of Cr(VI) with GO@Fe3O4 and EDA-GO@Fe3O4. The intra-particle diffusion is not the rate-controlling step. Isotherm experimental data can be described using the Freundlich model. The effects of multiple factors on the Cr(VI) decontamination was investigated by a 25−1 fractional factorial design (FFD). The adsorption process can significantly be affected by the main effects of A (pH), B (Cr(VI) concentration), and E (Adsorbent dose). The combined factors of AB (pH × Cr(VI) concentration), AE (pH × Adsorbent dose), and BC (Cr(VI) concentration × Temperature) had larger effects than other factors on Cr(VI) removal. These results indicated that EDA-GO@Fe3O4 is a potential and suitable candidate for treatment of heavy metal wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2766176036,"Fetuin-A / α2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein (gene name Ahsg) is a systemic inhibitor of ectopic calcification. Due to its high affinity for calcium phosphate, fetuin-A is highly abundant in mineralized bone matrix. Foreshortened femora in fetuin-A-deficient Ahsg-/- mice indicated a role for fetuin-A in bone formation. We studied early postnatal bone development in fetuin-A-deficient mice and discovered that femora from Ahsg-/- mice exhibited severely displaced distal epiphyses and deformed growth plates, similar to the human disease slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The growth plate slippage occurred in 70% of Ahsg-/- mice of both sexes around three weeks postnatal. At this time point, mice weaned and rapidly gained weight and mobility. Epiphysis slippage never occurred in wildtype and heterozygous Ahsg+/- mice. Homozygous fetuin-A-deficient Ahsg-/- mice and, to a lesser degree, heterozygous Ahsg+/- mice showed lesions separating the proliferative zone from the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate. The hypertrophic growth plate cartilage in long bones from Ahsg-/- mice was significantly elongated and V-shaped until three weeks of age and thus prior to the slippage. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of laser-dissected distal femoral growth plates from 13-day-old Ahsg-/- mice revealed a JAK-STAT-mediated inflammatory response including a 550-fold induction of the chemokine Cxcl9. At this stage, vascularization of the elongated growth plates was impaired, which was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. Thus, fetuin-A-deficient mice may serve as a rodent model of growth plate pathologies including SCFE and inflammatory cartilage degradation."

To elucidate whether meat mediates MRSA transmission between animals and humans in Japan, this study examined MRSA isolates from retail meat (n = 8), cows with mastitis (n = 7), and humans (HA-MRSA = 46 and CA-MRSA = 54) by molecular typing, virulence gene analyses, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. MRSA isolates from retail meat were classified into sequence type (ST) 8/spa type t1767 (n = 4), ST8/t4133 (n = 1), ST59/t3385 (n = 1), ST88/t375 (n = 1), and ST509/t375 (n = 1). All seven MRSA isolates from cows with mastitis were ST8/t1767. 46 HA-MRSA were clonal complex (CC) 5, divided into t002 (n = 30), t045 (n = 12), and t7455 (n = 4). 54 CA-MRSA were classified into 6 different CCs: CC1 (n = 14), CC5 (n = 7), CC8 (n = 29), CC45 (n = 1), CC89 (n = 1), CC509 (n = 1), and into 16 different spa types including newly identified t17177, t17193, and t17194. The majority were CC8/t1767 (n = 16). CC of one CA-MRSA isolate (spa type t1767) was not classified. Among 41 CC8 MRSA (five from meat, seven from cows with mastitis, and 29 CA-MRSA), 14 ST8/SCCmec IVl isolates (three from meat, one from a cow with mastitis, and 10 CA-MRSA) had identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and similar spa type (t1767, t4133, and t17177), and were typed as CA-MRSA/J (ST8/SCCmec IVl, positive for sec + sel + tst but negative for Panton–Valentine leukocidin and the arginine catabolic mobile element).

https://openalex.org/W2765866280,"Transcriptional regulation, led by transcription factors (TFs) such as those of the WRKY family, is a mechanism used by the organism to enhance or repress gene expression in response to stimuli. Here, we report on the genome-wide analysis of the Theobroma cacao WRKY TF family and also investigate the expression of WRKY genes in cacao infected by the fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa. In the cacao genome, 61 non-redundant WRKY sequences were found and classified in three groups (I to III) according to the WRKY and zinc-finger motif types. The 61 putative WRKY sequences were distributed on the 10 cacao chromosomes and 24 of them came from duplication events. The sequences were phylogenetically organized according to the general WRKY groups. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that subgroups IIa and IIb are sister groups and share a common ancestor, as well as subgroups IId and IIe. The most divergent groups according to the plant origin were IIc and III. According to the phylogenetic analysis, 7 TcWRKY genes were selected and analyzed by RT-qPCR in susceptible and resistant cacao plants infected (or not) with M. perniciosa. Some TcWRKY genes presented interesting responses to M. perniciosa such as Tc01_p014750/Tc06_p013130/AtWRKY28, Tc09_p001530/Tc06_p004420/AtWRKY40, Tc04_p016130/AtWRKY54 and Tc10_p016570/ AtWRKY70.

We used this tribe, which are well characterised in regards to morphological diversity and evolutionary relationships, to test the efficacy of DNA barcoding methods. A reference library was generated that included 93.9% of species in Australia (408 individuals, [Formula: see text] = 3.7 individuals per species). Molecular data were generated for official plant barcoding markers (rbcL, matK) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. We investigated accuracy of specimen identifications using distance- (nearest neighbour, best-close match, and threshold identification) and tree-based (maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference) methods and applied species discovery methods (automatic barcode gap discovery, Poisson tree processes) based on molecular data to assess congruence with recognised species. Across all methods, success rate for specimen identification of genera was high (87.5-99.5%) and of species was low (25.6-44.6%). Distance- and tree-based methods were equally ineffective in providing accurate identifications for specimens to species rank (26.1-44.6% and 25.6-31.3%, respectively). The ITS marker achieved the highest success rate for specimen identification at both generic and species ranks across the majority of methods. For distance-based analyses the best-close match method provided the greatest accuracy for identification of individuals with a high percentage of ""correct"" (97.6%) and a low percentage of ""incorrect"" (0.3%) generic identifications, based on the ITS marker. For tribe Poeae, and likely for other grass lineages, sequence data in the standard DNA barcode markers are not variable enough for accurate identification of specimens to species rank. For recently diverged grass species similar challenges are encountered in the application of genetic and morphological data to species delimitations, with taxonomic signal limited by extensive infra-specific variation and shared polymorphisms among species in both data types."

The objective of this study was to explore the problem of late presentation in the country of Georgia. Data on adult persons newly diagnosed with HIV in Georgia between 2012 and 2015 were extracted from the national AIDS Health Information System. Late presenter was defined as a person diagnosed with HIV with a CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3 or an AIDS defining illness regardless of the CD4 cell count in the six months after HIV diagnosis. Late presenter with advanced disease was defined as a person diagnosed with HIV with a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 or an AIDS defining illness, regardless of CD4 cell count in the six months after HIV diagnosis. Among 2267 adults diagnosed with HIV in Georgia in 2012-2015, 1987 (87.6%) had CD4 cell count measured within 6 months of HIV diagnosis and were included in the analysis. Among them 1260 (63.4%) patients were classified as late presenters and 870 (43.8%) as late presenters with advanced disease. The proportion of late presenters declined from 71.1% in 2012 to 55.5% in 2015 (p<0.0001), while presentation late with advanced disease decreased from 56.6% in 2012 to 34.5% in 2015 (p<0.0001). Late presentation was most common among people who inject drugs (77.7%). Overall 186 patients died over the studied period. Mortality was higher both among late presenters (6.74 per 100 person-years vs. 1.08 per 100 person-years, p<0.0001) and late presenters with advanced disease (8.93 per 100 person-years vs. 1.34 per 100 person-years, p<0.0001). High prevalence of late presentation in Georgia reflects insufficiency in HIV testing services. Better testing strategies are needed to improve earlier diagnosis and disease outcomes."

These structures also show how rearrangements in both the active sites and the di-domain linker form catalytically competent active sites and provide insight on the evolution of the PMTs in plants, nematodes, and apicomplexans. Connecting conformational changes with catalysis in modular enzymes, like the PMT, provides new insights on interdomain communication in biosynthetic systems."

Although investigations into Ca2+ signaling have progressed rapidly and led to better understanding of bone biology, the Mg2+ signaling pathway and associated molecules remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of a potential Mg2+ signaling-related lysosomal molecule, two-pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2), in osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling. Previously, we found that under normal Mg2+ conditions, TPC2 promotes osteoclastogenesis. We observed that under low-Mg2+ conditions, TPC2 inhibited, rather than promoted, the osteoclast differentiation and that the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) signaling pathway played a role in the TPC2 activation under low-Mg2+ conditions. Furthermore, PI(3,5)P2 depolarized the membrane potential by increasing the intracellular Na+ levels. To investigate how membrane depolarization affects osteoclast differentiation, we generated a light-sensitive cell line and developed a system for the light-stimulated depolarization of the membrane potential. The light-induced depolarization inhibited the osteoclast differentiation. We then tested the effect of myo-inositol supplementation, which increased the PI(3,5)P2 levels in mice fed a low-Mg2+ diet. The myo-inositol supplementation rescued the low-Mg2+ diet–induced trabecular bone loss, which was accompanied by the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. These results indicate that low-Mg2+–induced osteoclastogenesis involves changes in the role of TPC2, which are mediated through the PI(3,5)P2 pathway. Our findings also suggest that myo-inositol consumption might provide beneficial effects in Mg2+ deficiency–induced skeletal diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2765345891,"Dapsone is recommended as a second line therapy in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but is underused because of its potential side effects. The medical charts of 42 ITP patients treated with dapsone (100 mg/day) were retrospectively reviewed in order to assess its efficacy and safety in daily clinical practice. The overall response rate was 54.8% (n = 22, with a complete response in 38.1%) with a median time to response of 29 days (24–41 days). Patients with complete response had shorter disease duration whereas no difference was observed between responders and non-responders regarding age, sex or previous treatments received. Importantly, after dapsone withdrawal, a sustained response was observed in 5 patients, representing 12% of the whole cohort. Twenty percent of patients (n = 8) relapsed on therapy after 8.1 (6.5–13.6) months. Side effects occurred in 31% (n = 13) of patients, and required dapsone withdrawal in 22% (n = 9) or dosage reduction in 10% (n = 4) of the cases. Side effects resolved in all but one case. Overall, these data support dapsone as an interesting second line therapy in ITP, with a good safety and efficacy profile at a low cost."

Translocation of secretory proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or the periplasm of bacteria is mediated by a highly conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex denoted Sec61 in eukaryotes and SecYEG in bacteria. To evaluate a possible modulation of the translocation efficiency by secondary structures of the nascent peptide chain, we performed a comparative analysis in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells. Strikingly, neither the bacterial SecY nor the eukaryotic Sec61 translocon was able to efficiently transport proteins entirely composed of intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs) or β-strands. However, translocation could be restored by α-helical domains in a position- and organism-dependent manner. In bacteria, we found that the α-helical domains have to precede the IDD or β-strands, whereas in mammalian cells, C-terminally located α-helical domains are sufficient to promote translocation. Our study reveals an evolutionarily conserved deficiency of the Sec61/SecY complex to translocate IDDs and β-strands in the absence of α-helical domains. Moreover, our results may suggest that adaptive pathways co-evolved with the expansion of IDDs in the proteome of eukaryotic cells to increase the transport capacity of the Sec61 translocon.

On the basis of considering the factors influencing urban transport development, the comprehensive assessment indexes were selected, including urban economical development, transport demand, environment quality and energy consumption, and the assessment system of sustainable urban transport development was proposed. In view of different influencing factors of urban transport development, the index weight was calculated through the entropy weight coefficient method. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted according to the actual condition. Then, the grade was obtained by using the credible degree recognition criterion from which the urban transport development level can be determined. Finally, a comprehensive assessment method for urban transport development was introduced. The application practice showed that the method can be used reasonably and effectively for the comprehensive assessment of urban transport development."
https://openalex.org/W2766237664,"Malaria causes about half a million deaths annually, with Plasmodium falciparum being responsible for 90% of all the cases. Recent reports on artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia warrant urgent discovery of novel drugs for the treatment of malaria. However, most bioactive compounds fail to progress to treatments due to safety concerns. Drug repositioning offers an alternative strategy where drugs that have already been approved as safe for other diseases could be used to treat malaria. This study screened approved drugs for antimalarial activity using an in silico chemogenomics approach prior to in vitro verification. All the P. falciparum proteins sequences available in NCBI RefSeq were mined and used to perform a similarity search against DrugBank, TTD and STITCH databases to identify similar putative drug targets. Druggability indices of the potential P. falciparum drug targets were obtained from TDR targets database. Functional amino acid residues of the drug targets were determined using ConSurf server which was used to fine tune the similarity search. This study predicted 133 approved drugs that could target 34 P. falciparum proteins. A literature search done at PubMed and Google Scholar showed 105 out of the 133 drugs to have been previously tested against malaria, with most showing activity. For further validation, drug susceptibility assays using SYBR Green I method were done on a representative group of 10 predicted drugs, eight of which did show activity against P. falciparum 3D7 clone. Seven had IC50 values ranging from 1 μM to 50 μM. This study also suggests drug-target association and hence possible mechanisms of action of drugs that did show antiplasmodial activity. The study results validate the use of proteome-wide target similarity approach in identifying approved drugs with activity against P. falciparum and could be adapted for other pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2767167775,"Objectives The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of abnormal cytological findings, high risk (HR)-HPV genotypes and to identify factors associated with an abnormal cytological findings in a cohort of HIV-infected males. Patients and methods Retrospective observational study on HIV-infected male patients who performed screening in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cytological abnormalities were classified as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade(LSIL) or high high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of having LSIL/HSIL. Results Among 875 pts, abnormal cytology findings were observed in 254 (29%, 95% CI: 26.1%-32.1%) subjects: 142 (16%) had LSIL and 49 (6%) HSIL. Overall, 581 (66%, 95%CI: 63.2%-69.5%) subjects had ≥1 HR-HPV type and 269 (31%) had ≥2 HR HPV types. Multivariate logistic regression showed that subjects with multiple HR-HPV genotypes (OR = 1.351, 95%CI: 1.005–2.111) and with HPV-16 type (OR = 2.032, 95%CI: 1.313–3.146) were more likely to have LSIL/HSIL in addition to a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio, a previous diagnosis of syphilis and a positive viral load. In another multivariate model, the presence of multiple HPV types in subjects with HPV-16 type was associated with the highest adjusted OR of having a LSIL/HSIL (OR = 2.598, 95%CI: 1.460–4.624). Conclusions In HIV-infected men, the prevalence of abnormal cytological findings was of 29% and of HR-HPV was 66%. The concomitant presence of HPV-16 and multiple HR genotypes was associated with an increased risk of abnormal cytological findings. These data highlight the importance of screening multiple HPV genotypes in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2765835738,"Background Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) comprise a highly prevalent chronic condition among the aging male population. Existing literature on the experiences of men with LUTS is scarce given that only a few studies explored medical care-seeking behaviors and coping strategies. The current understanding of the experiences of elderly males with LUTS is considerably limited. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the experiences of living with moderate-to-severe LUTS among community-dwelling Chinese ageing males and their coping strategies to facilitate the management of LUTS by healthcare providers. Methods and findings A qualitative exploratory design using thematic analysis was used. Semi-structured interviews with 24 Chinese ageing males with moderate-to-severe LUTS were conducted. According to the participants, LUTS adversely affect the physical aspects of their daily lives. Most of them were unwilling to seek social support and were even embarrassed to share this topic with their peers. A range of psychological responses could be observed from the participants that range from regarding the condition as a natural life course to loss of one’s self-esteem. Most of the interviewees lacked knowledge and held misconceptions toward LUTS, which prevented them from pursuing medical advice. Most of the participants also sought alternative treatments and developed self-help methods to cope with their symptoms. Conclusion LUTS affects the physical and social aspects of sufferers. The findings of this qualitative study can raise awareness about the life experiences, perceptions, misconceptions, and help-seeking behaviors of Chinese elderly with LUTS. Proper health education and advice can be provided for this population."
https://openalex.org/W2766954379,"Background Experimental models have been used extensively to evaluate pain using e.g., visual analogue scales or electroencephalography (EEG). Stimulation using tonic pain has been shown to better mimic the unpleasantness of chronic pain, but has mainly been evoked by non-clinical stimuli. This study aims to, evaluate the EEG during clinical pain in patients scheduled for total hip replacement with control and resting conditions. Methods The hip scheduled for replacement was moved by the examiner to evoke pain for 30 seconds while recording EEG. The control condition entailed movement of the opposite hip in a similar fashion and holding it for 30 seconds. In addition, EEG was recorded during the resting condition with open eyes. The relative spectral content was calculated from the EEG as well as functional connectivity using phase-lag index for frequency bands delta (1–4Hz), theta (4–8Hz), alpha (8–12Hz) and beta (12–32Hz). A mixed model was used for statistical comparison between the three recording conditions. Results Spectral content differed between conditions in all bands. Functional connectivity differed in delta and theta frequency bands. Post-hoc analysis revealed differences between the painful and control condition in delta, theta and beta for spectral content. Pain during the hip rotation was correlated to the theta (r = -0.24 P = 0.03) and beta (r = 0.25 P = 0.02) content in the EEG. Conclusion EEG differences during hip movements in the affected and unaffected hip appeared in the spectral beta and theta content. This was correlated to the reported pain perceived, pointing towards pain specific brain activity related to clinical pain."

Given that Lewy body pathology is frequently observed in the brains of patients with AD, we aimed to study factors associated with VHs in AD and examine their association with DLB features. This cross-sectional study enrolled a consecutive series of AD patients who visited the dementia clinic of a regional hospital. Clinically diagnosed possible or probable DLB cases were excluded. VH frequency and associated factors including age, sex, education, disease severity, DLB features, vascular risk factors, cognitive function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were compared between AD patients with VHs (VH+) and those without VHs (VH-). Among a total of 295 patients analyzed, 42 (14.2%) had VHs. After adjusting for age, sex, and disease severity, DLB features including fluctuations in cognition scores, rapid-eye-movement behavioral disorder (RBD), and severe neuroleptic sensitivity were more frequent in the VH+ group. Furthermore, depression score, total Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score, and total caregiver burden score as assessed by the NPI were higher in the VH+ group. Among neuropsychiatric symptoms, delusions, hallucinations in the non-visual domains, anxiety, and disinhibition were more frequent in the VH+ group. Conversely, none of the vascular risk factors (VRFs) or cognitive domains of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was associated with VHs in AD. In summary, VHs, albeit occurring at a low rate, had a high impact on AD. Diagnostic features of DLB, including fluctuations, RBD, and severe neuroleptic sensitivity were significantly associated with VHs in AD. AD patients with VHs tended to have more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and greater caregiver burden."

https://openalex.org/W2766205090,"Naïve CD4 T (NCD4T) cells post-activation undergo programming for inducible production of cytokines leading to generation of memory cells with various functions. Based on cytokine based polarization of NCD4T cells in vitro, programming for either ‘Th1’ (interferon-gamma [IFNg]) or ‘Th2’ (interleukin [IL]-4/5/13) cytokines is thought to occur via mutually exclusive expression and functioning of T-bet or GATA-3 transcription factors (TFs). However, we show that a high proportion of mouse and human memory-phenotype CD4 T (MCD4T) cells generated in vivo which expressed either Th1 or Th2 cytokines commonly co-expressed T-bet and GATA-3. While T-bet levels did not differ between IFNg-expressing and IL-4/5/13-expressing MCD4T cells, GATA-3 levels were higher in the latter. These observations were also confirmed in MCD4T cells from FVB/NJ or aged C57BL/6 or IFNg-deficient mice. While MCD4T cells from these strains showed greater Th2 commitment than those from young C57BL/6 mice, pattern of co-expression of TF was similar. Effector T cells generated in vivo following immunization also showed TF co-expression in Th1 or Th2 cytokine producing cells. We speculated that the difference in TF expression pattern of MCD4T cells generated in vivo and those generated in cytokine polarized cultures in vitro could be due to relative absence of polarizing conditions during activation in vivo. We tested this by NCD4T cell activation in non-polarizing conditions in vitro. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-mediated priming of polyclonal NCD4T cells in vitro without polarizing milieu generated cells that expressed either IFNg or IL-4/5/13 but not both, yet both IFNg- and IL-4/5/13-expressing cells showed upregulation of both TFs. We also tested monoclonal T cell populations activated in non-polarizing conditions. TCR-transgenic NCD4T cells primed in vitro by cognate peptide in non-polarizing conditions which expressed either IFNg or IL-4/5/13 also showed a high proportion of cells co-expressing TFs, and their cytokine commitment varied depending on genetic background or priming conditions, without altering pattern of TF co-expression. Thus, the model of mutually antagonistic differentiation programs driven by mutually exclusively expressed T-bet or GATA-3 does not completely explain natural CD4 T cell priming outcomes."

Surgeon 1 placed 329 SICace implants, and surgeon 2 placed 113 SICace implants and 115 Osstem implants. ISQ measurements were taken at T1 (immediately after implant placement) and T2 (before dental restoration). A multivariate linear regression model was used to analyze the influence of the following 11 candidate factors for stability prediction: sex, age, maxillary/mandibular location, bone type, immediate/delayed implantation, bone grafting, insertion torque, I-stage or II-stage healing pattern, implant diameter, implant length and T1-T2 time interval.The need for bone grafting as a predictor significantly influenced ISQ values in all three groups at T1 (weight coefficients ranging from -4 to -5). In contrast, implant diameter consistently influenced the ISQ values in all three groups at T2 (weight coefficients ranging from 3.4 to 4.2). Other factors, such as sex, age, I/II-stage implantation and bone type, did not significantly influence ISQ values at T2, and implant length did not significantly influence ISQ values at T1 or T2.These findings provide a rational basis for mathematical models to quantitatively predict the ISQ values of implants in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2765994320,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) contain N-glycans, which are important glycotargets for plant lectins, to induce immunomodulation. The lectin ArtinM obtained from Artocarpus heterophyllus interacts with TLR2 N-glycans to stimulate IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells and to drive the immune response toward the Th1 axis, conferring resistance against intracellular pathogens. This immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated by subcutaneously injecting (s.c.) ArtinM (0.5 μg) in infected mice. In this study, we evaluated the systemic implications of ArtinM administration in naïve BALB/c mice. The mice were s.c. injected twice (7 days interval) with ArtinM (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, or 5.0 μg), LPS (positive control), or PBS (negative control) and euthanized after three days. None of the ArtinM-injected mice exhibited change in body weight, whereas the relative mass of the heart and lungs diminished in mice injected with the highest ArtinM dose (5.0 μg). Few and discrete inflammatory foci were detected in the heart, lung, and liver of mice receiving ArtinM at doses ≥2.5 μg. Moreover, the highest dose of ArtinM was associated with increased serum levels of creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and globulins as well as an augmented presence of neutrophils in the heart and lung. IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 measurements in the liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and lung homogenates revealed decreased IL-10 level in the heart and lung of mice injected with 5.0 μg ArtinM. We also found an augmented frequency of T helper and B cells in the spleen of all ArtinM-injected naïve mice, whereas the relative expressions of T-bet, GATA-3, and ROR-γt were similar to those in PBS-injected animals. Our study demonstrates that s.c. injection of high doses of ArtinM in naïve mice promotes mild inflammatory lesions and that a low immunomodulatory dose is innocuous to naïve mice."
https://openalex.org/W2766055117,"Prison healthcare is an important public health concern given the increasing healthcare needs of a growing and aging prison population, which accumulates vulnerability factors and suffers from higher disease prevalence than the general population. This study identifies the key factors associated with outpatient general practitioner (GP), nursing or psychiatric healthcare utilization (HCU) within prisons. Cross-sectional data systematically collected by the prison medical staff were obtained for a sample of 1664 adult prisoners of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, for the year 2011. They contain detailed information on demographics (predisposing factors), diagnosed chronic somatic and psychiatric disorders (needs factors), as well as prison stay characteristics (contextual factors). For GP, nurse and psychiatric care, two-part regressions are used to model separately the probability and the volume of HCU. Predisposing factors are generally not associated with the probability to use healthcare services after controlling for needs factors. However, female inmates use higher volumes of care, and the volume of GP consultations increases with age. Chronic somatic and psychiatric conditions are the most important predictors of the probability of HCU, but associations with volumes differ in their magnitude and significance across disease groups. Infectious, musculoskeletal, nervous and circulatory diseases actively mobilize GP and nursing staff. Schizophrenia, illicit drug and pharmaceuticals abuse are strongly positively associated with psychiatric and nurse HCU. The occupancy rate displays positive associations among contextual factors. Prison healthcare systems face increasingly complex organizational, budgetary and ethical challenges. This study provides relevant insights into the HCU patterns of a marginalized and understudied population."

Two recent papers use the same dataset having wolf population characteristics and cattle depredation, but come to opposing conclusions concerning the link between wolf control and cattle depredation. Our paper aims to resolve this issue by using the same dataset and developing a model based on a causal association that would explain the nature of the relationship between wolf control and cattle depredation. We use the data on wolf population, number of cattle, number of wolves killed and number of cattle killed, from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services Interagency Annual Wolf Reports over the period of 1987–2012. We find a positive link between wolf control and cattle depredation. However, it would be incorrect to infer that wolf control has a positive effect on the number of cattle depredated. We maintain that this link comes from a growing wolf population, which increases cattle depredation, and in turn, causes an increase in the number of wolves killed. While the wolf population is growing, we see both wolf removal and cattle depredation simultaneously grow. It is not until the wolf population growth nears the steady state, that removal of wolves has a sufficient negative effect to reduce or stabilize the number of cattle depredated."

Furthermore, common ravens are paraphyletic with respect to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we explore the causes of mtDNA paraphyly by sequencing whole mitochondrial genomes of 12 common ravens from across the Northern Hemisphere, in addition to three Chihuahuan ravens and one closely related brown-necked raven (C. ruficollis) using a long-range PCR protocol. Our raven mitogenomes ranged between 16925-16928 bp in length. GC content varied from 43.3% to 43.8% and the 13 protein coding genes, two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs followed a standard avian mitochondrial arrangement. The overall divergence between the two common raven clades was 3% (range 0.3-5.8% in 16 regions including the protein coding genes, rRNAs and the control region). Phylogenies constructed from whole mitogenomes recovered the previously found mitochondrial sister relationship between the common raven California clade and the Chihuahuan raven (overall divergence 1.1%), which strengthens the hypothesis that mtDNA paraphyly in the common raven results from speciation reversal of previously distinct Holarctic and California lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2765612512,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are naturally occurring steroidal hormones that play diverse roles in various processes during plant growth and development. Thus, genetic manipulation of endogenous BR levels might offer a way of improving the agronomic traits of crops, including plant architecture and stress tolerance. In this study, we produced transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) overexpressing a BR-inactivating enzyme, Arabidopsis thaliana BR-related acyltransferase 1 (AtBAT1), which is known to catalyze the conversion of BR intermediates to inactive acylated conjugates. After putative transgenic plants were selected using herbicide resistance assay, genomic integration of the AtBAT1 gene was confirmed by genomic PCR and Southern blot analysis, and transgene expression was validated by northern blot analysis. The transgenic creeping bentgrass plants exhibited BR-deficient phenotypes, including reduced plant height with shortened internodes (i.e., semi-dwarf), reduced leaf growth rates with short, wide, and thick architecture, high chlorophyll contents, decreased numbers of vascular bundles, and large lamina joint bending angles (i.e., erect leaves). Subsequent analyses showed that the transgenic plants had significantly reduced amounts of endogenous BR intermediates, including typhasterol, 6-deoxocastasterone, and castasterone. Moreover, the AtBAT1 transgenic plants displayed drought tolerance as well as delayed senescence. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrate that overexpression of an Arabidopsis BR-inactivating enzyme can reduce the endogenous levels of BRs in creeping bentgrass resulting in BR-deficient phenotypes, indicating that the AtBAT1 gene from a dicot plant is also functional in the monocot crop."
https://openalex.org/W2756532837,"Experiments in synthetic biology and microbiology can benefit from protein expression systems with low cell-to-cell variability (noise) and expression levels precisely tunable across a useful dynamic range. Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology of microbial gene regulation, many experiments employ protein-expression systems exhibiting high noise and nearly all-or-none responses to induction. I present an expression system that incorporates elements known to reduce gene expression noise: negative autoregulation and bicistronic transcription. I show by stochastic simulation that while negative autoregulation can produce a more gradual response to induction, bicistronic expression of a repressor and gene of interest can be necessary to reduce noise below the extrinsic limit. I synthesized a plasmid-based system incorporating these principles and studied its properties in Escherichia coli cells, using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to characterize induction dose-response, induction/repression kinetics and gene expression noise. By varying ribosome binding site strengths, expression levels from 55-10,740 molecules/cell were achieved with noise below the extrinsic limit. Individual strains are inducible across a dynamic range greater than 20-fold. Experimental comparison of different regulatory networks confirmed that bicistronic autoregulation reduces noise, and revealed unexpectedly high noise for a conventional expression system with a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor. I suggest a hybrid, low-noise expression system to increase the dynamic range."

We examined the independent association between serum vitamin D and PTH with multiple subclinical markers of atherosclerosis.A total of 8,217 subjects who participated in the Dong-gu Study in Korea were included in the final analysis. The carotid artery structure, including intima-media thickness (IMT), plaques, and luminal diameter, was evaluated using a high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was determined using an automatic waveform analysis device, and the mean of the left and right baPWV was used.The PTH concentration was positively associated with carotid luminal diameter and baPWV, but not with carotid IMT and plaques. The mean carotid luminal diameter of individuals with PTH levels in the second, third, and fourth quartiles was significantly larger compared with those in the first quartile (P-trend < 0.01). The mean baPWV of individuals with PTH levels in the fourth quartile was significantly greater than those with PTH levels in the first quartile (P-trend = 0.01). However, there was no significant association between vitamin D and any atherosclerotic phenotypes, including carotid IMT, plaques, luminal diameter, and baPWV.This suggests that PTH might affect the development of atherosclerosis by altering vascular compliance."

We used Cox Proportional Hazard Models to investigate the association between residential road traffic noise at different time-windows, and overall and CRC-specific mortality. Furthermore, we investigated interaction with sex, age, prognostic factors, and comorbidity. Mortality Rate Ratios (MRR) were calculated in unadjusted models, and adjusted for railway noise, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic variables.During a median follow-up of 4 years, 594 patients died; 447 from CRC. We found no association between road traffic noise exposure and overall (MRR 1.00 (0.88-1.13) per 10 dB) or CRC-specific mortality (MRR 0.98 (0.85-1.13) per 10 dB) over the entire follow-up period, or 1 year preceding death. Results did not differ when examining colon and rectal cancer separately. Interaction analyses suggested that patients with less clinically advanced disease could be more susceptible to harmful effects of traffic noise.The present study suggests no overall association between residential road traffic noise and concurrent mortality in CRC patients. As it is the first study of its kind, with relatively limited power, further studies are warranted."

Hair-follicle-bulge-derived stem cells (HFBSCs) are promising candidates for this type of therapy, because they (1) have migratory properties, enabling migration after transplantation, (2) can differentiate into sensory neurons and glial cells, and (3) can easily be harvested in relatively high numbers. However, HFBSCs have never been used for this purpose. We hypothesized that HFBSCs can be used for cell-based repair of the auditory nerve and we have examined their migration and incorporation into cochlear modiolus explants and their subsequent differentiation. Modiolus explants obtained from adult wild-type mice were cultured in the presence of EF1α-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, constitutively expressing copepod green fluorescent protein (copGFP). Also, modiolus explants without hair cells were co-cultured with DCX-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, which demonstrate copGFP upon doublecortin expression during neuronal differentiation. Velocity of HFBSC migration towards modiolus explants was calculated, and after two weeks, co-cultures were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical staining. EF1α-copGFP HFBSC migration velocity was fast: 80.5 ± 6.1 μm/h. After arrival in the explant, the cells formed a fascicular pattern and changed their phenotype into an ATOH1-positive neuronal cell type. DCX-copGFP HFBSCs became green-fluorescent after integration into the explants, confirming neuronal differentiation of the cells. These results show that HFBSC-derived neuronal progenitors are migratory and can integrate into cochlear modiolus explants, while adapting their phenotype depending on this micro-environment. Thus, HFBSCs show potential to be employed in cell-based therapies for auditory nerve repair."
https://openalex.org/W2765890438,"The transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 (TRPV3) channel is a Ca2+-permeable thermosensitive ion channel widely expressed in keratinocytes, where together with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) forms a signaling complex regulating epidermal homeostasis. Proper signaling through this complex is achieved and maintained via several pathways in which TRPV3 activation is absolutely required. Results of recent studies have suggested that low-level constitutive activity of TRPV3 induces EGFR-dependent signaling that, in turn, amplifies TRPV3 via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK in a positive feedback loop. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism that increases TRPV3 activity through EGFR activation. We used mutagenesis and whole-cell patch clamp experiments on TRPV3 channels endogenously expressed in an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and in transiently transfected HEK293T cells and found that the sensitizing effect of EGFR on TRPV3 is mediated by ERK. We observed that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV3 alters its responsiveness to repeated chemical stimuli. Among several putative ERK phosphorylation sites, we identified threonine 264 in the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain as the most critical site for the ERK-dependent modulation of TRPV3 channel activity. Of note, Thr264 is in close vicinity to a structurally and functionally important TRPV3 region comprising an atypical finger 3 and oxygen-dependent hydroxylation site. In summary, our findings indicate that Thr264 in TRPV3 is a key ERK phosphorylation site mediating EGFR-induced sensitization of the channel to stimulate signaling pathways involved in regulating skin homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2766906150,"Due to recent advancements and appealing applications, the purchase rate of smart devices is increasing at a higher rate. Parallely, the security related threats and attacks are also increasing at a greater ratio on these devices. As a result, a considerable number of attacks have been noted in the recent past. To resist these attacks, many password-based authentication schemes are proposed. However, most of these schemes are not screen size independent; whereas, smart devices come in different sizes. Specifically, they are not suitable for miniature smart devices due to the small screen size and/or lack of full sized keyboards. In this paper, we propose a new screen size independent password-based authentication scheme, which also offers an affordable defense against shoulder surfing, brute force, and smudge attacks. In the proposed scheme, the Press Touch (PT)-a.k.a., Force Touch in Apple's MacBook, Apple Watch, ZTE's Axon 7 phone; 3D Touch in iPhone 6 and 7; and so on-is transformed into a new type of code, named Press Touch Code (PTC). We design and implement three variants of it, namely mono-PTC, multi-PTC, and multi-PTC with Grid, on the Android Operating System. An in-lab experiment and a comprehensive survey have been conducted on 105 participants to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2767092090,"There is a need to develop new techniques for quantitative measurement of receptors expression on particular vasculature cells types. Here, we describe and demonstrate a novel method to measure quantitatively and simultaneously the expression of endothelin B receptor (ETB) on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). We isolated cells from male rat tissues such as: brain pial, brain intraparenchymal and retina vessels. To analyze solid tissues, a single-cell suspension was prepared by a combined mechanic and enzymatic process. The cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye, followed by fixation, permeabilization and antibodies staining. The expression of ETB receptors on VSMC was measured by flow-cytometry and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. We obtained a high percentage of viable cells 87.6% ± 1.5% pial; 84.6% ± 4.3% parenchymal and 90.6% ± 4% retina after isolation of single cells. We performed a quantitative measurement of ETB receptor expression on VSMC and we identified two subpopulations of VSMC based on their expression of smooth muscle cells marker SM22α. The results obtained from pial vessels are statistically significant (38.4% ± 4% vs 9.8% ± 3.32%) between the two subpopulations of VSMC. The results obtained from intraparenchymal and retina vessels were not statistically significant. By specific gating on two subpopulations, we were able to quantify the expression of ETB receptors. The two subpopulation expressed the same level of ETB receptor (p = 0.45; p = 0.3; p = 0.42) in pial, parenchymal and retina vessels, respectively. We applied our method to the animals after induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There was statistically significant expression of ETB receptor (p = 0.02) on VSMC between sham 61.4% ± 4% and SAH 77.4% ± 4% rats pial vessels. The presented technique is able to quantitatively and selectively measure the level of protein expression on VSMC. The entire technique is optimized for rat tissue; however the protocol can also be adapted for other species."
https://openalex.org/W2765811818,"Due to its symmetric structure and abundance of carboxyl groups, mellitic acid (MA–benzenehexacarboxylic acid) has an uncommon capacity to form highly ordered molecular networks. Dissolved in water, MA dissociates to yield various mellitate anions with pronounced tendencies to form complexes with cations including protonated amines. Deprotonation of MA at physiological pH produces anions with high charge densities (MA5- and MA6-) whose influence on co-dissolved proteins has not been thoroughly studied. As electrostatic attraction between highly symmetric MA6- anions and positively charged low-symmetry globular proteins could lead to interesting self-assembly patterns we have chosen hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), a basic stably folded globular protein as a cationic partner for mellitate anions to form such hypothetical nanostructures. Indeed, mixing of neutral HEWL and MA solutions does result in precipitation of electrostatic complexes with the stoichiometry dependent on pH. We have studied the self-assembly of HEWL-MA structures using vibrational spectroscopy (infrared absorption and Raman scattering), circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM). Possible HEWL-MA6- molecular docking scenarios were analyzed using computational tools. Our results indicate that even at equimolar ratios (in respect to HEWL), MA5- and MA6- anions are capable of inducing misfolding and aggregation of the protein upon mild heating which results in non-native intermolecular beta-sheet appearing in the amide I’ region of the corresponding infrared spectra. The association process leads to aggregates with compacted morphologies entrapping mellitate anions. The capacity of extremely diluted mellitate anions (i.e. at sub-millimolar concentration range) to trigger aggregation of proteins is discussed in the context of mechanisms of misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2766396468,"Infectious diseases threaten marine populations, and the extent of their impacts is often assessed by prevalence of infection (the proportion of infected individuals). Changes in prevalence are often attributed to altered rates of transmission, although the rates of birth, recovery, and mortality also determine prevalence. The parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium perezi causes a severe, often fatal disease in blue crabs. It has been speculated that decreases in prevalence associated with high temperatures result from lower rates of infection. We used field collections, environmental sensor data, and high-temperature exposure experiments to investigate the factors that change prevalence of infections in blue crab megalopae (post-larvae). These megalopae migrate from offshore waters, where temperatures are moderate, to marshes where temperatures may be extremely high. Within a few days of arriving in the marsh, the megalopae metamorphose into juvenile crabs. We found a strong negative association between prevalence of Hematodinium infection in megalopae and the cumulative time water temperatures in the marsh exceeded 34°C over the preceding two days. Temperatures this high are known to be lethal for blue crabs, suggesting that higher mortality of infected megalopae could be the cause of reduced prevalence. Experimental exposure of megalopae from the marsh to a temperature of 34°C resulted in higher mortality for infected than uninfected individuals, and decreased the prevalence of infection among survivors from 18% to 3%."
https://openalex.org/W2765777820,"Based on the traditional Fast Retina Keypoint (FREAK) feature description algorithm, this paper proposed a Gravity-FREAK feature description algorithm based on Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensor to overcome the limited computing performance and memory resources of mobile devices and further improve the reality interaction experience of clients through digital information added to the real world by augmented reality technology. The algorithm takes the gravity projection vector corresponding to the feature point as its feature orientation, which saved the time of calculating the neighborhood gray gradient of each feature point, reduced the cost of calculation and improved the accuracy of feature extraction. In the case of registration method of matching and tracking natural features, the adaptive and generic corner detection based on the Gravity-FREAK matching purification algorithm was used to eliminate abnormal matches, and Gravity Kaneda-Lucas Tracking (KLT) algorithm based on MEMS sensor can be used for the tracking registration of the targets and robustness improvement of tracking registration algorithm under mobile environment."
https://openalex.org/W2766824012,"In species that require parental care, each parent can either care for their offspring or leave them in the care of the other parent. For each parent this creates three possible parental care strategies: biparental care, uniparental (male or female) care, and uniparental desertion by either the male or female. The burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, typically exhibits biparental care of offspring, and thus provides a unique system that allows us to compare the fitness benefits of these parental care strategies in an unconfounded way. In this study, we assess the lifetime fitness of biparental care, uniparental care, and uniparental desertion strategies in both male and female N. orbicollis. Specifically, we tested for increased fitness of the biparental care strategy compared to uniparental care strategies. Second, we test for equality of fitness between uniparental care and uniparental desertion strategies. Surprisingly, biparental care yields lower lifetime fitness for both parents compared to the other two strategies. Also, uniparental care and uniparental desertion strategies yielded equal fitness. The evolution of biparental care in this system is not consistent with the expectation of a mutual fitness benefit. We discuss other potential explanations for the evolution of biparental care in this system."
