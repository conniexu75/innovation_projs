https://openalex.org/W2013111251,"ABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma. Lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in very low plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL. Herein, we have used Abca1-/- mice to ask whether ABCA1 is involved in lipidation of HDL in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is the most abundant CNS apolipoprotein and is present in HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF. We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in both the cortex (80% reduction) and the CSF (98% reduction). CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol as well as small apoE-containing lipoproteins, suggesting abnormal lipidation of apoE. Astrocytes, the primary producer of CNS apoE, were cultured from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, and nascent lipoprotein particles were collected. Abca1-/- astrocytes secreted lipoprotein particles that had markedly decreased cholesterol and apoE and had smaller apoE-containing particles than particles from Abca1+/+ astrocytes. These findings demonstrate that ABCA1 plays a critical role in CNS apoE metabolism. Since apoE isoforms and levels strongly influence Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk, these data suggest that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target.

ABCA1 knock-out mice (Abca1-/-) have been produced, and the mice have a similar phenotype as patients with Tangier's disease (12McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L.

However, neither Tangier's disease patients nor Abca1-/- mice have been examined to determine whether ABCA1 plays a role in lipidation or metabolism of lipoproteins in the central nervous system (CNS). The most abundant apolipoprotein in the CNS is apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is produced within the CNS, primarily by astrocytes and to some extent microglia (13Linton M.F. Gish R. Hubl S.T.

By analyzing brain tissue, CSF, plasma, and primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, we determined that deletion of ABCA1 markedly affects metabolism of apoE and cholesterol in the CNS and in nascent lipoprotein particles secreted by cultured astrocytes. These findings have implications for neurological diseases involving apoE, such as Alzheimer's disease. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Mice heterozygous for the Abca1-null allele on a DBA background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME (strain name: DBA/1-Abca1tm1Jdm). These mice have similar abnormalities to those found in humans with Tangier's disease, such as greatly reduced plasma HDL (12McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The heterozygous mice were bred to one another to generate littermates with all Abca1 genotypes: wild type (Abca1+/+), heterozygous (Abca1+/-), and knock-out (Abca1-/-). All animals used for in vivo experiments were between 10 and 14 weeks old. For fluid and tissue analysis, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital, CSF was collected from the cisterna magna as described (21DeMattos R.B. Brendza R.P. Heuser J.E. Kierson M. Cirrito J.R. Fryer J. Sullivan P.M. Fagan A.M. Han X. Holtzman D.M. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and animals were perfused with PBS-heparin (3 units/ml). Regional brain dissection was performed, and brain samples were frozen on dry ice. ApoE ELISA—A sandwich ELISA for mouse apoE was developed with a sensitivity of ∼1 ng/ml. 96-well plates were coated overnight with 0.5 μg/well of a mouse monoclonal antibody (WU E-4) raised against apoE (22Krul E.S. Tikkanen M.J. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1309-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed with PBS, blocked with 1% milk in PBS, and then washed again. Brain samples were sonicated in 0.05% Tween in PBS with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (1× protease inhibitors) (Roche Applied Science), debris was pelleted by a 10,000 × g × 15 min spin, and the supernatant was diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween in PBS. Conditioned medium, plasma, and CSF were diluted directly into 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween in PBS. Standards were based on pooled plasma from C57/Bl6 mice containing 68 μg/ml apoE as reported previously (23Lusis A.J. Taylor B.A. Quon D. Zollman S. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7594-7604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following sample incubation, the plate was washed, and 3 μg/well of biotinylated goat anti-apoE was added. The antibody was from Calbiochem (catalog number 178479) and was biotinylated using a biotin-maleimide reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After incubation of the secondary antibody, the plate was washed, and poly-horseradish peroxidase streptavidin (Pierce) was added at 1:6000 and incubated. The plate was then washed, developed with tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma), and read at 650 nm with a Biotek 600 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Real-time RT-PCR for Mouse ApoE—Following the perfusion of the animals, samples of cortex were placed in an RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) and stored at 4 °C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy lipid tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with on-column DNase digestion. RNA was quantified with a Bio-Rad SmartSpec 3000 (Bio-Rad). The forward primer used for mouse apoE was 5′-CCGTGCTGTTGGTCACATTGCTGACAGGAT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GTTCTTGTGTGACTTGGGAGCTCTGCAGCT-3′. The 18 S primer/probe reagent used for normalization of RNA levels was from ABI (Foster City, CA). Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR master mix kit, 1-step (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reaction. Master mix and RT/RNase block mix were added to 1 μm forward and reverse primers and 1.5 μg/ml RNA. For both apoE and 18 S RT and PCR, the samples were cycled in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system at the following temperatures: 1) 50 °C for 30 min; 2) 95 °C for 10 min; 3) 96 °C for 30 s.; 4) 54 °C for 1 min; 5) 72 °C for 30 min; 6) repeat steps 3–5 40 times. Standard curves of critical threshold versus log concentration were plotted with RNA from wild type mouse cortex, and relative transcript levels were calculated using the ABI software that accompanied the Prism 7000. ApoJ Western Blot—Samples of cortex were sonicated in 1× radioimmune precipitation buffer with 1× protease inhibitors. Radioimmune precipitation buffer-insoluble material was removed by spinning at 10,000 × g × 15 min. 25 μg of total protein/well was run on a 10% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with a rabbit anti-apoJ antibody developed in our laboratory (24Han B.H. DeMattos R.B. Dugan L.L. Kim-Han J.S. Brendza R.P. Fryer J.D. Kierson M. Cirrito J. Quick K. Harmony J.A. Aronow B.J. Holtzman D.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), washed, and then probed with anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and imaged with a Kodak Image Station (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cholesterol and Phospholipid Analyses—Brain samples were prepared for cholesterol analysis by sonication in PBS. The homogenized whole brain suspension was then subjected to enzymatic analysis for total cholesterol using the Amplex Red cholesterol kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Results using the homogenized brain suspension were identical to those using chloroform-extracted lipids from brain (data not shown). CSF and astrocyte conditioned medium were diluted in the reaction buffer and assayed. Free cholesterol was measured using the same kit but omitting the cholesterol esterase enzyme. Esterified cholesterol was calculated as total cholesterol minus free cholesterol. Quantification of phospholipids species was performed with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as described previously (25Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Histological Analysis—Tissue sections were cut in the coronal plane at 50 μm on a freezing sliding microtome and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). For oil red O staining of neutral fat, slides were dipped consecutively into 70% ethanol for 1 s and then immersed for 5 min in 1% oil red O (Sigma), 35% ethanol and then 50% acetone. Slides were then washed in water, counterstained for 2 min in Harris' hematoxylin (Sigma), and washed in water. The slides were dipped in ammonia water (0.05% ammonium hydroxide) until blue, washed again, and mounted. Staining with cresyl violet to nuclei and Luxol fast blue to identify myelin were performed as described previously (26Holtzman D.M. Li Y.W. DeArmond S.J. McKinley M.P. Gage F.H. Epstein C.J. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Duerstock B.S. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 134: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Samples of CSF and astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) were mixed 1:1 with native sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 4–20% Tris glycine gel (Invitrogen). Proteins with known hydrated diameters were used as size standards (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17044501), and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For apoE immunoblotting, the membrane was probed with a goat anti-mouse apoE antibody at 1:100 (M-20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), washed, and probed with horse anti-goat IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 (Vector Laboratories). For apoA-I immunoblotting, the membrane was probed with a rabbit anti-mouse apoA-I antibody at 1:500 (Biodesign, Saco, ME), washed, and probed with goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 (Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Sigma) and imaged with a Kodak Image Station (Kodak). Primary Astrocyte Cultures—Primary cultures of forebrain astrocytes (>95% pure) were prepared from individual neonatal (1–3-day-old) mice as described previously (28Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. In Vitro Biological Methods: Methods in Toxicology. 1A. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 46-60Google Scholar). Astrocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Fungizone, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma). To obtain ACM, confluent astrocyte cultures were washed twice with sterile PBS. Serum-free medium was added (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12, 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Fungizone), and cells were incubated for 3 days. Media were then collected and spun at 2,000 × g × 10 min to remove cellular debris. 0.1% sodium azide and 1× protease inhibitors were added, and the ACM was stored at 4 °C until analysis. Following harvesting of ACM, astrocytes were scraped from the flasks, washed with PBS, pelleted, and sonicated in PBS. Fractionation of ACM—ACM was concentrated 40-fold with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off spin concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). 1 ml of concentrated ACM was subjected to gel filtration chromatography using a BioLogic system (Bio-Rad) with tandem Superose-6 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.15 NaCl, 0.001 EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide as described previously (29Fagan A.M. Younkin L.H. Morris J.C. Fryer J.D. Cole T.G. Younkin S.G. Holtzman D.M. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—Fraction 37 from Abca1+/+ ACM and fraction 51 from Abca1-/- were stored at 4 °C until AFM analysis. Samples were analyzed by in situ AFM as described previously (30Legleiter J. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. Colloid Interf. Sci. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Plasma and CNS Apolipoprotein Levels in Abca1-/- Mice— Previous studies have shown a near absence of plasma HDL and apoA-I in Abca1-/- mice consistent with a role for ABCA1 in cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux onto plasma HDL (12McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). As apoE is also a constituent of plasma HDL, we measured plasma apoE levels and found that they were decreased by 96 and 54% in Abca1-/- and Abca1+/- mice, respectively, as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 1A). Unlike plasma, which contains a variety of lipoprotein classes and in which apoA-I is the major apoprotein constituent of HDL, in the CSF, there are only HDL-like lipoproteins and apoE is the most abundant apoprotein. Further, apoE in CSF is derived from the CNS, not the plasma (13Linton M.F. Gish R. Hubl S.T. Butler E. Esquivel C. Bry W.I. Boyles J.K. Wardell M.R. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine whether ABCA1 plays a role in CNS apoE metabolism, we measured apoE levels in the CSF and brain of ABCA1-deficient mice. Interestingly, apoE levels in CSF were reduced to a similar extent as in plasma, with Abca1-/- mice having 98% and Abca1+/- mice having 46% reductions in apoE levels relative to wild type littermates (Fig. 1B). In brain tissue, apoE levels in cortex were reduced by 80 and 13% in Abca1-/- and +/- mice, respectively, as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 1C). Real-time RT-PCR of apoE mRNA was performed on cortex from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice to determine whether differences in apoE protein levels were related to gene expression. There were no differences in apoE mRNA levels between the three genotypes (Fig. 1D), suggesting that ABCA1 affects apoE levels post-transcriptionally in the CNS. The second most abundant apoprotein produced in the CNS is apolipoprotein J (clusterin), and it is present in HDL-like particles in the CSF (19LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To determine whether ABCA1 plays a role in the metabolism of apoJ in a similar manner to apoE, we measured apoJ levels in plasma, CSF, and cortex and found no significant differences among the different Abca1 genotypes (Fig. 1E and data not shown). ApoA-I is a major component of plasma HDL that is synthesized primarily in the periphery and enters the CNS in small quantities in relation to its very high plasma concentration (14Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Wilson E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Its levels were greatly decreased in both CSF and cortex of Abca1-/- mice (see Fig. 3B and also data not shown). Since apoA-I levels in the plasma of Abca1-/- mice are near zero (14Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Wilson E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and CNS apoA-I is derived mostly from plasma, this was an expected result. Lipids in CSF and Cortex of Abca1-/- Mice—Since the major function of ABCA1 outside the CNS is transport of cholesterol and phospholipids onto HDL, we examined whether ABCA1 deficiency altered the levels of cholesterol and phospholipids within the CNS. We found that total cholesterol in CSF was reduced by 24% in Abca1-/- mice as compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 2A). This is likely because ABCA1 deficiency results in decreased levels of HDL, the lipoprotein class that normally carries some proportion of cholesterol in the CSF. In contrast to CSF, total cholesterol levels in brain tissue (cortex) were not significantly different between Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice (Fig. 2B). Cholesterol esters in cortex represented less than 5% of the total cholesterol and were also not significantly different (data not shown). Anionic phospholipids, choline glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids were measured in cortex by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and did not vary significantly between Abca1-/- and +/+ mice (n = 5 in each group, data not shown). To determine whether there was any lipid buildup in brain, we stained 3-month-old Abca1-/- and +/+ brain sections with oil red O. There was no evidence of abnormal lipid deposition in the Abca1-/- mice (Fig. 2C). Standard histological staining methods including cresyl violet for nuclei and Luxol fast blue for myelin also revealed no abnormalities in the brains of Abca1-/- mice (data not shown). Lipoprotein Particles from CSF and Astrocyte Conditioned Media of Abca1-/- Mice—In addition to evaluating the effects of ABCA1 deficiency on the levels of lipids and apoE in the CNS in vivo, we studied apoE- and apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in CSF and nascent apoE-containing lipoproteins produced by astrocytes to examine how ABCA1 deficiency affected their properties. We determined the size distribution of apoE- and apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in mouse CSF by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. As we have described previously (21DeMattos R.B. Brendza R.P. Heuser J.E. Kierson M. Cirrito J.R. Fryer J. Sullivan P.M. Fagan A.M. Han X. Holtzman D.M. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), apoE in CSF of wild type mice was in HDL-like particles 10–17 nm in diameter with the most abundant sizes being between 13 and 16 nm (Fig. 3A). ApoE particles from Abca1+/- CSF were similar in size to wild type. However, in addition to apoE levels in CSF from Abca1-/- being markedly reduced, apoE was present within particles that had a size distribution that was different from wild type mice. In addition to having a population of particles between 13 and 16 nm in diameter, CSF from Abca1-/- mice also had a population of smaller apoE-containing particles that were 7–8 nm in diameter, suggesting that they were poorly lipidated. ApoA-I was also greatly reduced in CSF from Abca1-/- mice, and the small amount that was there was present in particles of ∼7.3 nm as compared with particles of 8–11 nm in CSF from Abca1+/+ mice (Fig. 3B). Because Abca1-/- mice have both very low CSF apoE levels and altered particle size distribution, this led us to investigate whether there was a primary alteration of nascently produced apoE-containing HDL from astrocytes, the cells that produce the majority of apoE in the CNS. We compared total cholesterol and apoE in ACM derived from primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice and found that total levels of apoE in ACM did not vary by Abca1 genotype (Fig. 3E). However, the levels of total cholesterol were significantly lower in Abca1-/- ACM (Fig. 3D). This suggests that apoE is secreted at normal levels by Abca1-/- astrocytes, but the apoE is not normally lipidated in the absence of ABCA1. To examine the extent of lipidation of apoE-containing particles, ACM was subjected to size analysis by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting for apoE. This demonstrated apoE-containing lipoprotein populations of ∼12, 11, and 8 nm in ACM from Abca1+/+ mice but much smaller lipoproteins in ACM from Abca1-/- mice of ∼7.3 and <7 nm (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that apoE-containing particles from Abca1-/- ACM were likely very lipid-poor. To analyze the lipid composition of astrocyte-secreted lipoproteins, ACM was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. ApoE ELISAs and cholesterol assays of the different fractions demonstrated that lipoproteins from Abca1-/- ACM contain less apoE, are smaller, and have markedly less cholesterol than Abca1+/+ ACM (Fig. 4, A and B). Lipoprotein-associated apoE was reduced in Abca1-/- ACM by 80% as compared with Abca1+/+ ACM. As expected, ∼75% of the apoE in the Abca1+/+ ACM was in fractions 31–41, corresponding to the HDL size range. However, ∼75% of the lipoprotein-associated apoE in the Abca1-/- ACM was in fractions 45–55, which corresponds to much smaller particles. These smaller lipoprotein particles derived from Abca1-/- astrocytes were very cholesterol-poor as compared with Abca1+/+ particles (0.69 μg of total cholesterol/μg of apoE for Abca1-/-versus 2.3 μg of total cholesterol/μg of apoE for Abca1+/+). To confirm the size and shape of the abnormal Abca1-/- particles, AFM was performed on the size exclusion chromatography fractions from Abca1+/+ and Abca1-/- ACM with the highest apoE levels. AFM is a tool of choice because it allows for characterization of the three-dimensional shape of nanoparticles under nearly physiological conditions. Its use to study lipoprotein particles and the protocols needed to obtain reliable volume measurements were recently described elsewhere (31Legleiter J. Czilli D.L. Gitter B. DeMattos R.B. Holtzman D.M. Kowalewski T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The AFM images obtained demonstrate that the most abundant apoE-containing particles in Abca1-/- ACM are significantly smaller than in Abca1+/+ ACM (Fig. 4C). In this study, we have analyzed brain tissue, CSF, plasma, and primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice to determine whether deletion of ABCA1 affects metabolism of apoE, cholesterol, and phospholipids in the CNS and in nascent lipoprotein particles secreted by astrocytes. We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in the plasma (96% reduction), CSF (98% reduction), and cortex (80% reduction) as compared with Abca1+/+ mice. The decreased apoE levels in plasma and brain that we observed are similar to those seen by others. 2Hirsch-Reinshagen, V., Zhou, S., Burgess, B. L., Bernier, L., McIsaac, S. A., Chan, J.

The decreased apoE levels in the CNS are not related to Apoe gene expression but likely result from increased catabolism of abnormally lipidated apoE-containing HDL lipoproteins produced in the CNS, as occurs with abnormally lipidated apoA-I and apoA-II that are secreted by the liver and are rapidly catabolized in the plasma of Tangier's disease patients (10Schaefer E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2124927590,"ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body. Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I. ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood. In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain. In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE. The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1-/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions. Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1-/- astrocytes and microglia. In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80% decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1-/- mice. Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS. ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body.

ABCA1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters that transport substrates across membranes (1Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J. Attie A. Kastelein J.J.P.

The importance of lipid homeostasis in the CNS is underscored by the fact that the brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, and contains ∼25% of total body cholesterol in only 2% of the total body weight (21Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Nearly all brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ, as quantitative analyses show that essentially no cholesterol crosses the blood-brain barrier (21Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In contrast, the brain cannot degrade cholesterol, and excess cholesterol must be delivered to the peripheral circulation for eventual excretion via the liver. Approximately 6-7 mg of cholesterol leaves the human brain each day after conversion to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which easily traverses the blood-brain barrier (22Björkhem I. Lütjohann D. Breuer O.

Astrocytes and microglia are the cells within the CNS that synthesize and secrete apolipoproteins that transport lipids within the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major apolipoprotein in the brain, and is also a component of several lipoproteins in the peripheral circulation including HDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (28Mahley R.W.

In humans, apoE exists as one of three allelic variants that contain either a cysteine or arginine residue at amino acids 112 and 158 (31Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 4725-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Liver transplantation experiments in humans have shown that the allelic variant of apoE in plasma is converted to that of the donor, whereas apoE in the CSF retains the allelic identity of the recipient, illustrating that CNS and non-CNS apoE pools are synthesized independently (32Linton M.F. Gish R. Hubl S.T. Butler E. Esquivel C. Bry W.I. Boyles J.K. Wardell M.R. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Additionally, brain perfusion experiments in guinea pigs have shown that radiolabeled apoE administered into the peripheral circulation demonstrates very low blood-to-brain transport (33Zlokovic B.V. Martel C.L. Mackic J.B. Matsubara E. Wisniewski T. McComb J.G. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

ApoJ is a second major CNS lipoprotein that, unlike apoE, easily traverses the blood-brain barrier and associates with HDL in the periphery (26Ladu M.J. Reardon C. Van Eldik L. Fagan A.M. Bu G.

ApoE and apoJ are synthesized and secreted from astrocytes and microglia, and expression of both apoE and apoJ are induced in response to CNS injury or disease (24Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H.

In contrast to apoE and apoJ, apoA-I is primarily taken up into the brain from outside the CNS, and is believed to be involved in the maturation of lipoprotein particles in the CSF (26Ladu M.J.

In 1993, apoE was discovered to be an important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a finding that has now been replicated in over 100 studies. Inheritance of apoE4 increases the risk of AD in a dosage-specific manner and may act by decreasing the age of onset of AD (40Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C.

Interestingly, replacement of the murine apoE with any of the human apoE isoforms completely suppresses Aβ deposition compared with wild-type mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (49Holtzman D.M.

Compared with apoE, the role of apoJ in AD is less well understood, although it is known that apoJ also binds Aβ and has been suggested to play a major role in transporting Aβ across the blood-brain barrier (33Zlokovic B.V.

Previous work has demonstrated that apoE is a robust acceptor of lipids from ABCA1 (59Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.D. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P.

Furthermore, antisense inhibition of ABCA1 has been observed to inhibit the secretion of apoE from monocyte-derived macrophages (61von Eckardstein A. Langer C. Engel T. Schaukal I. Cignarella A. Reinhardt J. Lorkowski S. Li Z. Zhou X. Cullen P. Assmann G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), raising a second question of whether ABCA1 may also regulate apoE synthesis or secretion in other apoE-producing cells such as astrocytes or microglia. To address these two questions, we sought to determine the relationship between ABCA1, cholesterol efflux and apoE metabolism specifically in glia. In this study, we report that ABCA1-deficient primary astrocytes and microglia are impaired in their ability to efflux lipids to exogenous apoE, which results in lipid accumulation under normal culture conditions. Furthermore, lack of ABCA1 expression decreases apoE secretion from glial cells in vitro. In vivo, this impairment of apoE secretion by astrocytes and microglia results in a decrease in apoE levels by ∼65% in whole brain lysates of ABCA1-deficient mice, with hippocampus and striatum being the most severely affected regions. Our observations show that ABCA1 plays key roles in cholesterol transport and apoE metabolism in the CNS. Mice—ABCA1-deficient mice were generously provided by Dr. Omar Francone of Pfizer Global Research and Development (Groton). Wild-type DBA1/J, C57Bl/6, apoE-deficient and apoA-I-deficient mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Animals were maintained on regular chow (PMI Lab Diet) for all experiments. All procedures involving experimental animals were performed in accordance with protocols from the Canadian Council of Animal Care and the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committees. Animal Tissues—Murine brains were harvested immediately after sacrifice, dissected into individual regions where indicated, and stored at -80 °C until use. Tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein concentration was determined by Lowry assay. Culture of Primary Astrocytes and Microglia—Primary mixed glial cultures were prepared from postnatal day 1-2 mice. Brains from individual animals were placed into ice-cold Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (Canadian Life Technologies) containing 6 mg/ml glucose and 10 mm HEPES. Meninges were removed, frontal cortices were dissected, and cells were dissociated by repeated passage through a series of wide to fine bored pipettes. Dissociated cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Canadian Life Technologies) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine (Canadian Life Technologies), and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Canadian Life Technologies) at one T75 flask per mouse. Cells were cultured in the presence of 5% CO2 for 14 days with 3 medium changes. After reaching confluence, microglia were isolated by gently tapping the culture flasks and collecting the medium with detached cells. Subsequently, attached microglia were separated from astrocytes by mild trypsinization as previously described (62Saura J. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. Glia. 2003; 44: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and added to the previously isolated cells. Microglia and enriched astrocytes were reseeded as needed. Immunofluorescence—Cells seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice more, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS, cells were blocked with 4% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with the astrocyte marker GFAP-Cy3 (1:250, Sigma) or the microglial marker F4/80 (1:200, Serotec) for 1 h. F4/80-stained cells were visualized after incubation with Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 30 min. Finally, cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), and coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The percentage of stained cells was determined over at least 200 cells. Cells were viewed under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and images were captured using a CCD camera equipped with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corporation) imaging software. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed through 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and immunodetected using a monoclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody raised against the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2 of ABCA1) (10Wellington C.L.

Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Bands were quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image J. Where applicable, apoE, apoJ, and ABCA1 levels were normalized to GAPDH levels to control for protein loading. Purification of Recombinant apoE Proteins—ApoE isoforms were purified from Escherichia coli harboring recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-apoE2, -apoE3, or apoE4 fusion proteins as described (63Mabile L.

https://openalex.org/W2051243229,"Recent reports emphasize the importance of mitochondria in white adipose tissue biology. In addition to their crucial role in energy homeostasis, mitochondria are the main site of reactive oxygen species generation. When moderately produced, they function as physiological signaling molecules. Thus, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species trigger hypoxia-dependent gene expression. Therefore the present study tested the implication of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in adipocyte differentiation and their putative role in the hypoxia-dependent effect on this differentiation. Pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation demonstrate a very strong and negative correlation between changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. Moreover, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species positively and specifically control expression of the adipogenic repressor CHOP-10/GADD153. Hypoxia (1% O2) strongly increased reactive oxygen species generation, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and CHOP-10/GADD153 expression, and inhibited adipocyte differentiation. All of these hypoxia-dependent effects were partly prevented by antioxidants. By using hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HIF-1α was shown not to be required for hypoxia-mediated CHOP-10/GADD153 induction. Moreover, the comparison of hypoxia and CoCl2 effects on adipocyte differentiation of wild type or HIF-1α deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggests the existence of at least two pathways dependent or not on the presence of HIF-1α. Together, these data demonstrate that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species control CHOP-10/GADD153 expression, are antiadipogenic signaling molecules, and trigger hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation.

White adipose tissue is the main energy store in adult mammals and displays great plasticity according to the energy needs of the organism. Adipocyte differentiation results from a subtle balance of sequential and interdependent transcription factors expression that activate or inhibit promoters of adipogenic genes. Three members of the CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer binding protein; CHOP-10/GADD153, C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage 153; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast(s); GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase; MnTBAP, manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin; H2-DCF, 6-carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein; H2-DCFDA, 6-carboxy-2 ′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, diacetoxymethylester. family, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and CHOP-10/GADD153 (C/EBP homologous protein also identified as growth arrest and DNA damage 153), are expressed early in the adipocyte differentiation process. By forming heterodimers with the other C/EBPs, CHOP-10/GADD153 acts as a dominant negative regulator of C/EBP (1Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). During the clonal expansion phase, CHOP-10/GADD153 expression falls and, simultaneously, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are transiently induced. This mediates the later expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ, subsequently triggering full-blown adipocyte differentiation (2Fajas L. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Adipogenic hormones and nutrients are well known to stimulate adipocyte differentiation (3Ailhaud G. Ann. Endocrinol. 1995; 562: 93-95Google Scholar). However, hypoxia strongly inhibits this process (4Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The involvement of mitochondria in adipose tissue plasticity has been neglected until now. Indeed, it was only recently demonstrated that mitochondrial apparatus was a fundamental aspect of white fat and adipocyte differentiation (5Prunet-Marcassus B. Moulin K. Carmona M.C. Villarroya F. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Wilson-Fritch L. Burkart A. Bell G. Mendelson K. Leszyk J. Nicoloro S. Czech M. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Thus, the concept that mitochondria could play an essential role in white adipose tissue development is now emerging. This is consistent with another study, which reports that genes encoding components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain play an essential role in lipid storage (7McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Avery L. Graff J.M. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 131-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Beside their key role in ATP production, mitochondria constitute the primary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in many cells. Indeed, during respiration, a small but significant proportion of O2 molecules are converted to superoxide anion radical ( O2·¯) by complex I and complex III according to their steady state reduction (8Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). This radical is subsequently diverted into secondary products such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (·OH) via O2·¯ dismutation and Fenton reaction, respectively. The continuous and high generation of mitochondrial ROS has generally been considered in the context of degenerative diseases and aging (9Cadenas E. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). However, the concept that according to the yield and the time course of mitochondrial ROS generation they also function as physiological signaling molecules is now accepted (10Casteilla L. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 12Nemoto S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For instance, various reports indicate that mitochondrial ROS act as a second messenger in the O2 sensing mechanism to trigger erythropoietin and vascular endothelium growth factor gene transcription via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (13Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that mitochondrial ROS influence the size of the white preadipocyte pool (14Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This led us to postulate that mitochondrial ROS could also participate in adipocyte differentiation. Using pharmacological strategies, first we confirmed this hypothesis. Second, we focused our investigation on CHOP-10/GADD153 transcription factor as a putative target of mitochondrial ROS. Indeed among the early expressed transcription factors, it is well known to be sensitive to ROS. Finally, we further tested whether hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation could be mediated by mitochondrial ROS generation. Chemicals—Mitochondrial inhibitors (antimycin, rotenone, and propofol), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), CoCl2, N-acetylcysteine, and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) was obtained from Calbiochem. Cell Culture Conditions—3T3-F442A preadipocytes were routinely cultivated (14Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in a 21% O2, 74% N2, and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For the different experiments, cells were seeded at 5500 cells/cm2 and were grown to confluence (day 0). At day 0, medium was changed, mitochondrial inhibitors were added as indicated, and cell cultures were stopped at different times. When cell cultures were maintained more than 2 days after day 0, medium without inhibitors (except when indicated) was replaced. In hypoxia experiments, confluent cells were maintained in hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 94% N2, 5% CO2; work station BugBox, Jouan S.A.) and cultures were stopped at different times. Cells were preincubated with antioxidants at day –1. In some experiments, an uncoupler (CCCP) was added 5 min before the addition of antimycin. Antioxidants and CCCP also were present during the incubation period. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were induced to differentiate 2 days after confluence with the same medium as for 3T3-F442A (14Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 μm rosiglitazone. Three days later, medium containing 1 μg/ml insulin and 5 μm rosiglitazone was replaced and then changed every day (4Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To evaluate the hypoxia or CoCl2 effects on adipogenesis, cells were treated 2 days after confluence. Determination of Intracellular ROS Generation—Intracellular ROS generation was assessed using 6-carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, diacetoxymethylester (H2-DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) (15Nègre-Salvayre A. Augé N. Duval C. Robbesyn F. Thiers J.C. Nazzal D. Benoist H. Salvayre R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This probe enters the cells and is hydrolyzed to 6-carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2-DCF). H2O2 and other peroxides cause oxidation of H2-DCF, yielding the fluorescent product DCF. Confluent cells were loaded with H2-DCFDA (2 μm) 30 min before the end of the incubation period (1 h in presence of the mitochondrial inhibitor). After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected in water to disrupt cell membranes. Fluorescence (excitation 493 nm, emission 527 nm) and protein content (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then were measured. The intensity of fluorescence was expressed as arbitrary units per milligram of protein. For ROS measurement in hypoxic conditions, cells were incubated with H2-DCFDA for 2 h while the head space was gassed with 1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2 (13Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Cells were immediately treated as described above. Data are normalized to values obtained from normoxic controls. Measurement of Glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GPDH) Activity and Triglyceride Content—GPDH activity was measured as described previously (17Pairault J. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5138-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is reflected by the disappearance of NADH, and results were expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein. Cellular triglyceride content was determined using a commercially available test combination (Triglycerides enzymatiques PAP 150, Biomerieux). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected on ice in 2 mm EDTA-phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 600 × g (4 °C, 10 min) pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7), containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). 40 μg of proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot. Antibodies used were: anti-CHOP-10/GADD153, anti-C/EBPβ (both diluted 1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-HIF-1α (diluted 1/500, Novus Biological Sciences). Immunostained proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from cells was extracted using Tripure isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science). 20 μg of total RNA were denatured, electrophoresed on 1.2 formaldehyde-agarose gels, and subjected to Northern blot analysis. PCR product of CHOP-10/GADD153 cDNA cloned into PGEM plasmid (primers were 5′-GGCACCTATATCTCATCCCC and 3′-TGGTCTACCCTCAGTCCTCTCCT, from position 267 to 789 of the coding phase, GenBank™ accession number BC013718) served as probe. Equal loading of gels was checked out by hybridization with 36B4 probe (18Krowczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Milan Panich Biomedical), using the Rediprime™ II (Amersham Biosciences) random prime labeling system. Unincorporated dNTPs were removed using Microspin S-200 HR columns (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Means ± S.E. were calculated, and statistically significant differences between two groups were determined by Student's t test at p < 0.05. Antimycin Reduces Adipocyte Differentiation—Antimycin, a well known inhibitor of complex III (Fig. 1B), was used at a concentration of 20 nm, which induces only slight inhibition (15%, data not shown) of cell respiration. At this concentration and as expected, antimycin induced an increase in ROS generation (Fig. 2A). Chronic treatment with antimycin for 4 days greatly inhibited GPDH activity (Fig. 2B) and triglyceride content (38 ± 3% versus control cells, p < 0.001, data not shown), two indexes of adipocyte differentiation. To identify a putative critical sensitivity period, confluent cells were transiently treated with 20 nm antimycin, and GPDH activity was later assessed on day 4. Fig. 2C shows that 8 or 24 h of transient exposure from confluence was sufficient to significantly inhibit GPDH activity. 48 h of treatment had a similar effect as the chronic treatment (96 h). These data demonstrate that adipocyte differentiation is inhibited by antimycin and that transient exposure to this molecule during commitment of preadipocytes to adipocytes is sufficient for inhibition. Treatment duration of 48 h was chosen for further investigations. Effects of Pharmacological Modulations of Mitochondrial ROS on Adipocyte Differentiation—As antimycin (and mitochondrial inhibitors in general) may affect not only ROS generation but also energetic status, complementary strategies (Fig. 1) were needed to demonstrate the specific effects caused by ROS. First, the prevention of antimycin effects by the addition of antioxidants was studied. MnTBAP, a superoxide dismutase mimetic with catalase-like activity, and PDTC, a thiol-reductive and iron-chelating agent, were used to counteract ROS generation (Fig. 1B). We chose concentrations of MnTBAP (50 μm) and PDTC (5 μm), which had no effect per se on ROS generation and GPDH activity (data not shown). As expected, an increase of DCF fluorescence induced by antimycin was significantly prevented when MnTBAP or PDTC were added to the culture medium (Fig. 3A). In parallel, GPDH activities in MnTBAP- and PDTC-supplemented cells were significantly higher compared with treatment with antimycin alone (Fig. 3D). Triglyceride content in MnTBAP- and PDTC-supplemented cells was also significantly higher compared with treatment with antimycin alone (97.2 ± 13.1% and 83.6 ± 15.37% versus 47.2 ± 5.8%, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively, data not shown). Second, it has been demonstrated (19Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) that an uncoupling agent, CCCP, is able to stimulate O2·¯ generation induced by antimycin (Fig. 1C). So, we tested the addition of CCCP on antimycin effects on ROS generation and adipocyte differentiation. ROS generation in 1 μm CCCP-supplemented cells was strongly and significantly increased compared with treatment with antimycin alone (Fig. 3B). At this concentration, CCCP alone had no effect (data not shown). This was associated with enhanced inhibition of GPDH activity when CCCP was added to the culture medium compared with treatment with antimycin alone (Fig. 3E). Moreover, triglyceride content was significantly lower in CCCP-supplemented cells compared with treatment with antimycin alone (40.2 ± 2% versus 48 ± 1.5%, p < 0.05) (data not shown). Last, to definitively demonstrate the involvement of mitochondrial ROS in adipocyte differentiation, we compared two inhibitors of complex I, rotenone and propofol (Fig. 1D). Propofol also has the ability to scavenge free radicals (21Green T.R. Bennett S.R. Nelson V.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 129: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As for antimycin, we used equiactive concentrations of rotenone (8 nm) and propofol (40 μm), which induce only a 15% decrease in cell respiration (data not shown). Fig. 3, C and F, show the opposite effects of rotenone and propofol on DCF fluorescence and GPDH activity. In these conditions, rotenone significantly increased ROS generation (Fig. 3C) and significantly decreased GPDH activity (Fig. 3F) and triglyceride content (76.7 ± 3%, p < 0.001, data not shown). On the contrary, propofol significantly decreased DCF fluorescence (Fig. 3C) and increased GPDH activity (Fig. 3F) and triglyceride content (111.4 ± 3.3%, p < 0.05, data not shown). Altogether, these three complementary strategies demonstrate a very strong and negative correlation between changes in mitochondrial ROS and adipocyte differentiation. Effects of Pharmacological Modulations of Mitochondrial ROS on CHOP-10/GADD153—The inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by mitochondrial ROS generated early in the differentiation process led us to focus on CHOP-10/GADD153, a transcription factor that is expressed early and is known to be ROS-sensitive (22Entingh A.J. Law B.K. Moses H.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Guyton K.Z. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Treatment of confluent cells with antimycin for 24 h strongly increased CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content. The addition of antioxidants, MnTBAP or PDTC, prevented the increase of CHOP-10/GADD153 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content was greatly enhanced when cells were treated with antimycin and CCCP together compared with treatment with antimycin alone (Fig. 4B). Finally, whereas CHOP-10/GADD153 was increased after rotenone treatment, no change was observed with propofol (Fig. 4C). Thus, in all tested conditions, changes in CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content were positively correlated with mitochondrial ROS generation and inversely correlated with adipocyte differentiation. To test the specificity of these changes, we evaluated the expression of C/EBPβ in the same conditions. Three isoforms of C/EBPβ are present in cells: 35- and 32-kDa proteins known as liver-enriched activating protein and a 20-kDa protein known as liver-enriched inhibitory protein. The three mitochondrial inhibitors (antimycin, rotenone, and propofol) induced a slight increase of the liver-enriched activating protein/liver-enriched inhibitory protein ratio (Fig. 4, A–C), but these modifications were not associated with those of ROS generation nor with inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS positively and specifically control CHOP-10/GADD153. Hypoxia-dependent Effects on Adipocyte Differentiation and CHOP-10/GADD153 Are Prevented by Antioxidants—Confluent cells submitted to hypoxia demonstrated a significant increase of ROS generation (Fig. 5A), which is time-dependent (data not shown). As expected, GPDH activity was significantly inhibited by hypoxia compared with normoxia (Fig. 5B). This was associated with a strong increase of CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content (Fig. 5C). MnTBAP addition partly but significantly prevented a hypoxia-dependent increase of ROS generation (Fig. 5A) as well as inhibition of GPDH activity (Fig. 5B) and an increase in CHOP-10/GADD153 (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained with a glutathione precursor, N-acetylcysteine (5 mm) (data not shown). Hypoxia induced an increase in liver-enriched activating protein and a decrease in liver-enriched inhibitory protein content, which was not prevented by MnTBAP addition (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that mitochondrial ROS generation and CHOP-10/GADD153 induction could specifically mediate hypoxia-dependent effects on adipocyte differentiation. Hypoxia-dependent Induction of CHOP-10/GADD153 Expression Requires a Transcriptional Mechanism—To elucidate the mechanism of hypoxia-dependent CHOP-10/GADD153 induction, Northern blotting experiments were performed. After hypoxia exposure, a very rapid increase of CHOP-10/GADD153 mRNA level was detected (Fig. 6). Addition of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), a transcription inhibitor, prevented CHOP-10/GADD153 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 6). In these conditions, no modification of 36B4 mRNA level was observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that hypoxia-dependent induction of CHOP-10/GADD153 requires a transcriptional mechanism. Hypoxia-dependent Induction of CHOP-10/GADD153 Does Not Require HIF-1α Expression—HIF-1 was described as mediating numerous hypoxia transcriptional effects (24Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Its activity depends on the interaction between aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT/HIF-1β) constitutively expressed and HIF-1α, stabilized under hypoxic conditions (24Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate its putative involvement in hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. In basal conditions, HIF-1α was not detected, and hypoxia induced the increase of HIF-1α protein content in preadipocytes (Fig. 7A). The addition of MnTBAP and N-acetylcysteine partly prevented this induction (Fig. 7A and data not shown, respectively) as it did for CHOP-10/GADD153 (Fig. 5C). Similar HIF-1α and CHOP-10/GADD153 variations under our experimental conditions suggest a putative link between both expressions. We compared hypoxia effects on MEF wild type cells (HIF-1α+/+) and cells deficient for the HIF-1α gene (HIF-1α–/–). HIF-1α detection by Western blotting analysis confirms the identity of the HIF-1α–/–cell line (data not shown). Hypoxia-dependent induction of CHOP-10/GADD153 was observed in both cell types (Fig. 7B) demonstrating that HIF-1α is not required for hypoxia-mediated CHOP-10/GADD153 induction. As CoCl2 is often used as a chemical hypoxia mimetic for its ability to stabilize HIF-1α protein, we investigated the effect of CoCl2 on CHOP-10/GADD153. As expected, CoCl2 (100 μm) strongly induced HIF-1α (data not shown). A small increase in CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content compared with that obtained after hypoxia was observed in 3T3-F442A cells (only 10% compared with hypoxia, data not shown). Moreover, CoCl2 treatment had no effect on CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content in both MEF cell types (data not shown). These results show that CoCl2 does not imitate the hypoxic conditions necessary for CHOP-10/GADD153 induction. Comparative Effects of Hypoxia and CoCl2 on GPDH Activities in HIF-1α+/+ and HIF-1α–/–MEF—Whereas CoCl2 (100 μm) significantly inhibited GPDH activity of HIF-1α+/+ cells (42 ± 12.7%, p < 0.01), the HIF-1α–/–cells were not significantly affected by CoCl2 treatment (106.25 ± 6.7%) demonstrating that CoCl2-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is totally dependent on HIF-1α expression (Fig. 8A). After hypoxia, GPDH activities of both HIF-1α+/+ and HIF-1α–/–cells types were significantly inhibited (49.5 ± 4%, p < 0.001 and 69 ± 8.4%, p < 0.01 respectively, Fig. 8B), with HIF-1α–/–cells less affected than the +/+ ones. These results show that hypoxia effects on adipocyte differentiation are not completely reproduced by CoCl2 and could be triggered by at least two signaling pathways, one HIF-1α-dependent and the other HIF-1α-independent. In this study, we provide strong evidence that mitochondrial ROS control CHOP-10/GADD153 expression and adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, we propose that this mechanism could be involved in hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Various mitochondrial inhibitors can be used to induce the accumulation of electrons inside the respiratory chain and increase ROS generation. Unfortunately, their use has side effects on energetic status. This led us to develop different complementary strategies to demonstrate the specific effects caused by mitochondrial ROS: (i) the putative prevention of antimycin (an inhibitor of complex III) effects by antioxidants; (ii) the putative accentuation of antimycin effects by the addition of an uncoupler, CCCP, as previously demonstrated in isolated mitochondria (19Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and in intact cells (20Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar); and (iii) comparison between rotenone and propofol effects at concentrations equiactive on respiration. This last point is very informative because rotenone generates ROS by inhibition of complex I whereas propofol, which also inhibits complex I, has the ability to powerfully scavenge free radicals at this site (21Green T.R. Bennett S.R. Nelson V.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 129: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whatever the strategies used, changes of mitochondrial ROS generation are systematically closely and inversely associated with the modulation of adipocyte differentiation. This clearly demonstrates a great sensitivity of adipocyte differentiation to mitochondrial ROS generation, which strongly participates in the control of this process. Contrary to the strong extracellular generation of ROS generally used, we induced only moderate changes in mitochondrial ROS generation by very faint alterations in mitochondria function. This is consistent with a role for mitochondrial ROS as physiological signaling molecules that control adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrated that transient mitochondrial ROS exposure at the time of commitment is sufficient to later inhibit adipocyte differentiation. This led us to postulate that transcription factors, which play a key role early in adipocyte differentiation, i.e. C/EBP transcription factors isoforms, may be targets for mitochondrial ROS. Among C/EBP transcription factor isoforms, CHOP-10/GADD153 expression has been shown to be regulated by various stimuli including extracellular H2O2 (22Entingh A.J. Law B.K. Moses H.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Guyton K.Z. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), mitochondrial stress (25Zhao Q. Wang J. Levichkin I.V. Stasinopoulos S. Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), as well as hypoxia (26Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3814-3817PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these data and demonstrate that in preadipocytes CHOP-10/GADD153 but not other C/EBP isoform expression was always strongly correlated to the yield of mitochondrial ROS generation. Furthermore, we also provide evidence for a close relationship between CHOP-10/GADD153 induction and inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. As its overexpression in such cells efficiently represses their differentiation toward the adipocyte phenotype (27Batchvarova N. Wang X.Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 1Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that CHOP-10/GADD153 could mediate the mitochondrial ROS-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Mitochondrial ROS are generated according to the constraints on respiratory chain components. They are proposed as a metabolic sensor to adapt the cell fate to the metabolic environment (12Nemoto S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) but also as a component of the O2 sensing mechanism. The relationship between hypoxia and ROS is controversial. In a first model, ROS are generated by a membrane-bound NADP(H) oxidase in direct proportion to the O2 concentration, and a decrease in ROS generation thus triggers hypoxia-dependent effects (28Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In a second model, hypoxia partially inhibits mitochondrial electron transport, producing redox changes in the electron carriers that increase ROS generation (13Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). One might assume that measurement of ROS levels could be sufficient to distinguish between the two models (29Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In our conditions, hypoxia induced an increase in ROS generation in confluent preadipocytes, validating the second model. Hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation was associated with an increase of HIF-1α and CHOP-10/GADD153 protein content. All these hypoxia effects were prevented by the addition of antioxidants suggesting that mitochondrial ROS must be at the origin of hypoxia signaling pathways in adipose cells. Concomitant HIF-1α and CHOP-10/GADD153 increases and the involvement of a transcriptional mechanism on CHOP-10/GADD153 induction under hypoxia suggest a putative causal link between both expressions. However, the use of HIF-1α-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that HIF-1α is not required for hypoxia-mediated CHOP-10/GADD153 induction. This agrees with a previous study that clearly identified a set of genes up-regulated by hypoxia in an HIF-1α-independent manner (30Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshert E. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of HIF-1α in hypoxia-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation was proposed (4Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The conclusion of the authors was achieved using a hypoxia chemical mimetic, i.e. CoCl2. Our observations agree with their experimental data. Indeed, CoCl2-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is totally dependent on the presence of HIF-1α. In such conditions, it is noteworthy that CoCl2 does not strongly up-regulate CHOP-10/GADD153 expression as hypoxia does as described on human cancer cells (31Ameri K. Lewis C.E. Raida M. Sowter H. Hai T. Harris A.L. Blood. 2004; 103: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypoxia-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation is only partly dependent on the presence of HIF-1α (GPDH activity in HIF-1α–/–cells is inhibited by hypoxia in a lesser extent than in the +/+ ones). Taken together, this clearly suggests the involvement of at least two independent pathways in the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, either dependent or independent of HIF-1α. This latter signaling pathway might be triggered by CHOP-10/GADD153. This study clearly demonstrates that mitochondrial ROS must be considered as antiadipogenic signaling molecules. We also suggest that mitochondrial ROS and CHOP-10/GADD153 belong to the intracellular O2 sensing mechanism of adipose cells. This signaling pathway could be involved in limiting growth of adipose tissue as described in other tissues (32Genbacev O. Zhou Y. Ludlow J.W. Fisher S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1669-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 33Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, ROS generation linked to mitochondrial dysfunction could be directly involved in adipose tissues alterations associated with metabolic disorders (34Schrauwen P. Hesselink M.K.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1412-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data emphasize the importance of mitochondria and ROS in white adipose tissue development and function. We thank Dr. C. Toulas and C.

https://openalex.org/W1973994630,"Vascular disruption following bony injury results in a hypoxic gradient within the wound microenvironment. Nevertheless, the effects of low oxygen tension on osteogenic precursors remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated in vitro osteoblast and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation following exposure to 21% O2 (ambient oxygen), 2% O2 (hypoxia), and <0.02% O2 (anoxia). Hypoxia had little effect on osteogenic differentiation. In contrast, short-term anoxic treatment of primary osteoblasts and mesenchymal precursors inhibited in vitro bone nodule formation and extracellular calcium deposition. Cell viability assays revealed that this effect was not caused by immediate or delayed cell death. Microarray profiling implicated down-regulation of the key osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 as a potential mechanism for the anoxic inhibition of differentiation. Subsequent analysis revealed not only a short-term differential regulation of Runx2 and its targets by anoxia and hypoxia, but a long-term inhibition of Runx2 transcriptional and protein levels after only 12-24 h of anoxic insult. Furthermore, we present evidence that Runx2 inhibition may, at least in part, be because of anoxic repression of BMP2, and that restoring Runx2 levels during anoxia by pretreatment with recombinant BMP2 rescued the anoxic inhibition of differentiation. Taken together, our findings indicate that brief exposure to anoxia (but not 2% hypoxia) down-regulated BMP2 and Runx2 expression, thus inhibiting critical steps in the osteogenic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal precursors and committed osteoblasts. Vascular disruption following bony injury results in a hypoxic gradient within the wound microenvironment.

It has long been known that hypoxia is a prominent component of the microenvironment in both bony and soft tissue injury (1Heppenstall R.B. Grislis G. Hunt T.K. Clin. Orthop. 1975; 106: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Knighton D.R. Silver I.A. Hunt T.K. Surgery. 1981; 90: 262-270PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brighton C.T. Ray R.D. Soble L.W.

J. Surg. 2003; 186: 259-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, the complex osteogenic regenerative response that ensues following injury begins in the setting of reduced oxygen (7Heppenstall R.B. Goodwin C.W. Brighton C.T. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1976; 58: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to inflammatory cell recruitment, matrix processing, and angiogenesis, the activity of mesenchymal osteoblast precursors is a key component of this cascade (6Gordillo G.M. Sen C.K. Am. J. Surg. 2003; 186: 259-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8Knighton D.R. Hunt T.K. Scheuenstuhl H. Halliday B.J. Werb Z. Banda M.J. Science. 1983; 221: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Both committed resident osteoblasts and recruited precursor cells are exposed to the hypoxic post-injury milieu. Given that normal osteoblast function is critical to the deposition of mineralized matrix, the hallmark of successful fracture repair, it is important to understand the response of osteoprogenitors to a hypoxic microenvironment. Recent investigations have yielded significant insights into the transcriptional regulation of osteogenic differentiation (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 10Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G.

Bone. 1999; 25: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Primary cell culture models and established cell lines that recapitulate osteoblast maturation in vitro have allowed the identification of closely regulated transcription factors (e.g. Runx2, Osx, and members of the Ets family) and osteogenic markers (e.g. collagens, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin) specific to each stage of the osteoblast life cycle (12Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Runx2, a member of the runt family of transcription factors, is both necessary and sufficient for osteoblast differentiation (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 13Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Runx2 activity promotes the expression of a number of osteogenic markers including collagen I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin by binding to responsive elements within the promoters of these genes (11Karsenty G. Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Bone. 1999; 25: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Its clinical significance is highlighted by the observation that humans or mice heterozygous for Runx2 mutations develop cleidocranial dysplasia, whereas postnatal impairment of Runx2 results in osteopenia (10Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The effect of reduced oxygen on genes involved in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation remains unclear, in part because of the sometimes conflicting results observed for primary cultures versus established cell lines and for different oxygen tensions. An early study of the immortalized osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1 exposed to chronic 10% O2 demonstrated a decrease in both cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase expression, an early to middle marker of osteoblast differentiation, relative to cells at 21% O2 (14Kubota M. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1989; 56: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Additional investigations in primary osteoblast-enriched cultures from rat calvaria and human periodontal ligament confirmed that hypoxic (5-10%) inhibition of alkaline phosphatase was not limited to the MC3T3-E1 line but was applicable to primary cells as well (15Tuncay O.C. Ho D. Barker M.K. Am. J. Orthod. Dentofacial Orthop. 1994; 105: 457-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Matsuda N. Morita N. Matsuda K. Watanabe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the effect seen in MC3T3-E1, an increase in proliferation was observed in both primary cell types, perhaps alluding to a reciprocal hypoxic effect on proliferation and differentiation in primary osteoblasts. Recently, a human osteosarcoma cell line continuously exposed to 2% O2 for up to 96 h was shown to express diminished levels of the transcription factor RUNX2 and the late bone marker osteocalcin (17Park J.H. Park B.H. Kim H.K. Park T.S. Baek H.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 192: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whereas this study on transformed cells provided important initial insight into the hypoxic regulation of osteogenic gene expression, a broad understanding of the hypoxic osteoblast transcriptional response remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, it may be difficult to extrapolate tumor cell line derived conclusions to primary osteoblasts given that Runx2 expression may be dissociated from osteogenic potential in immortalized cell lines such as MC3T3-E1 (18Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 19Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating that hypoxia regulates osteoblast-secreted growth factors implicated in the post-injury microenvironment. For example, cytokines potentially involved in osteoblast-endothelial interactions are oxygen-sensitive. Hypoxic osteoblasts exhibit increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor-A; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; QRT, quantitative real-time. perhaps the most potent and specific of the angiogenic cytokines (20Steinbrech D.S. Mehrara B.J. Saadeh P.B. Greenwald J.A. Spector J.A. Gittes G.K. Longaker M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C853-C860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-A appears to regulate osteoblast function by coupling ossification with cartilage resorption and angiogenesis during endochondral bone formation (21Gerber H.P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Additional hypoxia-regulated modulators of osteoblast function that also act as endothelial mitogens include members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), insulin-like growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor families (22Gerritsen M.E. Bloor C.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Steinbrech D.S. Mehrara B.J. Saadeh P.B. Greenwald J.A. Spector J.A. Gittes G.K. Longaker M.T. Ann. Plast.

Cell Res. 1994; 213: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Their elaboration by osteoblasts further suggests an important role for this cell type in regulating the angiogenic response that is critical to fracture repair (26Glowacki J. Clin. Orthop. 1998; 355: S82-S89Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Given that reduced oxygen is a major component of the fracture microenvironment, we sought to gain a better understanding of its effects on osteoblast gene expression and function. We first examined whether short-term hypoxic and anoxic insults, analogous to those observed in the post-fracture hypoxic gradient, would affect in vitro osteogenic differentiation of primary osteoblasts and multipotent mesenchymal precursors. We demonstrate that a 12-24-h reduction from 21 to <0.02% O2 suppressed long-term osteogenic differentiation without altering cell viability. In addition, we present evidence implicating differential regulation of Runx2 expression by anoxia as a potential mechanism for this effect. Calvarial Osteoblast, MC3T3-E1, and Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Cell Cultures—Primary mouse calvarial osteoblast cultures were established based on described techniques (27Owen M.E. Cave J. Joyner C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 731-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frontal and parietal bones from 6-day-old CD-1 mice were stripped of their pericranium and dura mater. Calvaria from five to six pups were pooled, minced, and washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Osteoblasts were released by five sequential 20-min digestions with 0.1% collagenase (Invitrogen). Digestions were stopped with 5 volumes of α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Fractions 2-5 were collected, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were allowed to attach and expand for 48 h, then replated for experimentation without further passaging. The osteoblast-like immortalized cell line MC3T3-E1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was maintained in subconfluent cultures in α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum plus pencillin/streptomycin. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in an undifferentiated state in manufacturer recommended medium (Poietics™ MSCGM™ Mesenchymal Stem Cell Medium) that was replaced every 2 days. Early passage (<3) cells were utilized for experimentation. All cells were maintained at 21% O2 and 5% CO2 in humidified incubators at 37 °C prior to hypoxia or anoxia experiments. Cell viability was assessed by Hoescht and propidium iodide staining as previously described (28Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoblasts and MSCs were incubated for 15 min with 2 μg each of bis-benzamide (Hoescht stain number 33342, Sigma) and propidium iodide (Sigma) per 1 ml of medium. The number of non-viable cells was determined by scoring three randomly selected low-magnification fields for double-stained cells (indicating loss of membrane integrity). The ratio of viable to total cells was then determined. For each sample, ∼500 cells were scored in a blinded fashion, and experiments were repeated three times. Viability data were confirmed by trypan blue exclusion and cell counts of trypsinized MSCs and osteoblasts. In addition, MSCs released by trypsinization were incubated with propidium iodide in conjunction with the TACS™ Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for flow cytometry-based detection of apoptotis according to the manufacturer's directions. Exposure to Ambient, Hypoxic, and Anoxic Conditions—At 95% confluence, calvarial osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 cells underwent media change with fresh α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. MSCs received fresh MSCGM™. After 6 h (to minimize the effects of medium replacement upon gene expression), cells were exposed to 21% (ambient oxygen), 2% (hypoxia), or <0.02% O2 (anoxia) for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Oxygen was supplanted by infusion of a 5% CO2, 95% nitrogen gas in 37 °C humidified hypoxia work stations (Bactron Anaerobic/Environmental Chamber, Sheldon Corporation, Cornelius, OR, and Ruskinn Microaerophilic Work station, Ruskinn Technology, Leeds, United Kingdom). These chambers employ an intermediate “pass-box” to minimize mixing of ambient air with the internal chamber environment as well as real-time temperature and oxygenation level monitoring. After hypoxic or anoxic treatments, cells underwent total RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or were returned to 21% O2 for long-term differentiation. For samples derived from cells at 2 or <0.02% O2, RNA collections were done within the hypoxia chamber to limit reoxygenation effects on gene expression. Long-term Differentiation Experiments and Bone Nodule Staining— Following exposure to 21, 2, or <0.02% O2, cells underwent in vitro osteogenic differentiation in 21% O2 via basal medium supplementation with 1 μm dexamethasone, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. Medium was replaced immediately after initial treatment with reduced or ambient oxygen, and every 2 days thereafter. For experiments in which osteoblasts were cytokine stimulated, we used a single dose of BMP2 (100 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), TGF-β2 (5 ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor-1 (20 ng/ml) or vehicle immediately prior to anoxic exposure for 24 h (all cytokines from R&D Systems). Cultures were maintained for 28 days for gene expression analysis or assessment of mineralized matrix deposition by bone nodule staining via 0.5% alizarin red or the von Kossa method for calcium phosphates, and digitally photographed at low and high magnifications. Low magnification (whole plate) von Kossa images were analyzed using Scion Image Software version 4.0.2 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) to determine the area of bone nodule staining. The values reported for 2 and <0.02% O2-treated plates represent relative staining compared with parallel cultures at 21% O2 that were normalized to a value of “one.” In the same manner, we quantified staining of the three cell types after 3, 6, 12, and 24hof <0.02% O2 relative to parallel cultures that had not been anoxia treated. We also performed a colorimetric determination of calcium concentration using a Calcium Reagent Set (Biotron Diagnostics, Hemet, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. This kit provides a quantitative assessment of calcium concentration based on the ability of calcium to react with cresolphthalein complexone in 8-hydroxyquinolone to form a complex purple in color that absorbs at 570 nm. Gene Profiling Using Microarrays—RNA from mouse calvarial osteoblasts exposed to 21, 2, or <0.02% O2 for 24 h was purified and reverse transcribed for microarray analysis on cDNA chips from the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Each array contains ∼42,000 mouse elements, representing over 30,000 unique genes. Detailed protocols for probe synthesis and hybridization are available on-line. Briefly, 30 μg of total RNA was used for single-stranded cDNA probe synthesis incorporating aminoallyl-dUTP, which was coupled with either Cy3 (for 21% O2 samples) or Cy5 (for 2 or <0.02% O2 samples). Type I experiments were performed in which 2 and <0.02% O2 samples were each hybridized with pooled 21% O2 reference samples for 16 h at 65 °C. Arrays were washed, scanned, and analyzed using a GenePix Scanner and software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). After gridding, array data were uploaded to the Stanford Microarray Data base or SMD (29Sherlock G. Hernandez-Boussard T. Kasarskis A. Binkley G. Matese J.C. Dwight S.S. Kaloper M. Weng S. Jin H. Ball C.A. Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cherry J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 152-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from three independent experiments was pooled for each array probe, and array hybridizations were performed in duplicate. Microarray Data Analysis—Using on-line software from SMD, data points that met the following spot quality criteria were selected for analysis: spot regression correlation >0.7, mean channel intensity >2.5 median background, and “spot flag” and “failed” filters = 0. These user-selectable criteria are intended to exclude spots with non-uniform, dim, or otherwise unreliable signals. Relative changes in gene expression were evaluated by -fold change (i.e. <0.02 or 2% O2 relative to 21% O2 reference) as determined from the log2 of red/green normalized ratio reported by SMD, as previously described (30Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T. Yu X. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore T. Hudson Jr., J. Lu L. Lewis D.B. Tibshirani R. Sherlock G. Chan W.C. Greiner T.C. Weisenburger D.D. Armitage J.O. Warnke R. Levy R. Wilson W. Grever M.R. Byrd J.C. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (8087) Google Scholar). Both the -fold change values and the standard deviation (S.D.) of -fold changes for a particular array have been used to determine whether expression changes are significantly different from array background (29Sherlock G. Hernandez-Boussard T. Kasarskis A. Binkley G. Matese J.C. Dwight S.S. Kaloper M. Weng S. Jin H. Ball C.A. Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cherry J.M.

Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (8087) Google Scholar). Describing the number of genes whose -fold changes fall outside the range of the mean ± 2 S.D. allows comparisons between populations that are not identical, e.g. those with different mean -fold changes or distributions. In contrast, reporting absolute -fold change allows comparison of the same gene across two populations (i.e. relative -fold change of gene A at <0.02 versus 2% O2) or two or more genes within the same populations (i.e. gene A versus gene B at 2 or <0.02% O2). The approach undertaken in this study was to use the ±2 S.D. criterion to identify a subset of genes with “significant” up- or down-regulation, and then to use comparisons of -fold change values to directly compare the responses at <0.02 and 2% O2 for specific genes and/or functional groupings of genes. The overall effect of oxygen level on transcriptional response was assessed by comparing the variances in -fold change at <0.02 and 2% O2 using Levine's test for homogeneity of variances. For PCR data, -fold change values in individual genes were compared via analysis of variance or paired t tests (with Bonferroni adjustments to control the Type I error rate). All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 5.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Quantitative Real-time PCR—For selective microarray confirmation and to investigate gene expression during the 28-day differentiation period, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). We obtained cDNA by reverse transcription of 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from each sample using random hexamer priming in 50-μl reactions according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Taqman® Reverse Transcription Reagent Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We proceeded with QRT-PCR using the Applied Biosystems Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System. A non-multiplexed SYBR® Green assay in which each cDNA sample was evaluated at least in triplicate 20-μl reactions was used for all target transcripts. Expression values were normalized to 18S or β-actin. QRT-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0.0 (Applied Biosystems) and tested to confirm appropriate product size and optimal concentrations. Western Blot Analysis—Mouse osteoblasts underwent osteogenic differentiation following exposure to 21 or <0.02% O2 as described above. Cells were lysed in 9 m urea, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 mβ-mercaptoethanol. After a brief sonication, lysates were centrifuged to remove debris and quantitated. Forty micrograms of protein were electrophoresed on 3-8% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed using commercial Runx2 and β-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anoxia Inhibits Bone Nodule Formation by Calvarial Osteoblasts and Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells— Both resident and recruited precursor populations involved in post-injury repair are transiently exposed to wound oxygen levels as low as 0-2% O2 (1Heppenstall R.B.

Am. 1976; 58: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Without the re-establishment of nutrient and O2 delivery, tissue regeneration is not possible and necrosis ensues. To investigate the effect of oxygen deprivation on osteoprogenitor cells, we exposed primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts to 24 h of 21, 2, or <0.02% O2. The cells were subsequently maintained in osteogenic differentiation media for 28 days at 21% O2 and assayed for bone nodule formation. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, a and b, von Kossa and alizarin red staining for the <0.02% O2 group were diminished relative to the 21 and 2% O2 groups. High magnification views revealed fewer and smaller mineralized nodules in the <0.02% O2 group than the two other groups (Fig. 1, c and d). Because primary cultures of calvarial osteoblasts likely include osteoprogenitors at different stages of commitment (31Liu F. Malaval L. Aubin J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether reduced O2 altered the long-term differentiation of uncommitted cells with osteogenic potential. Primary human bone marrow-derived MSCs have previously been shown to be capable of osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic differentiation (32Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar). We exposed MSCs to 24 h of 21, 2, or <0.02% O2 followed by osteogenic differentiation in 21% O2 for 28 days. Similar to the results obtained for primary osteoblasts, bone nodule formation as assayed by von Kossa, and alizarin red staining was diminished for the <0.02% O2 group relative to the 21 and 2% O2 groups (Fig. 2, a and b). Given that differences in response to hypoxia have been observed for primary versus immortalized cells, we exposed primary osteoblasts, MSCs, and the osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1 to 24 h of 21, 2, and <0.02% O2, followed by 28 days of differentiation at 21% O2. For each cell type, we estimated the degree of von Kossa staining for extracellular matrix deposition at 28 days using image analysis software. Relative staining of anoxia-treated cells was determined by dividing the calculated bone nodule area by that of parallel cultures that had not received anoxic treatment. In marked contrast to the anoxic inhibition of osteogenic differentiation observed for primary osteoblasts and MSCs, the MC3T3-E1 cell line did not reveal a significant decrease in bone nodule formation following anoxic treatment (Fig. 3a). As Little as 12 h of Anoxia Inhibits Long-term Osteogenic Differentiation—Because the severity of oxygen deprivation is a function of both duration and oxygen tension, we next examined whether a more brief period of anoxia would inhibit in vitro osteogenic differentiation. Osteoblasts, MSCs, and MC3T3-E1s were exposed to 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h of <0.02% O2 and subsequently differentiated for 28 days at 21% O2. We then estimated the bone nodule area as above (relative to cultures that had not been anoxia treated). Osteoblasts and MSCs exposed to 24 h of <0.02% O2 demonstrated an ∼70-80% reduction in bone nodule formation compared with cultures at 21% O2, whereas 12 h of anoxia resulted in a ∼60% reduction (Fig. 3b). Shorter anoxic exposure periods (3 to 6 h) did not inhibit bone nodule formation for osteoblasts and MSCs. Consistent with the results obtained above, bone nodule formation by MC3T3-E1 cells was not affected at any of the durations tested (Fig. 3b). In addition, using a cresolphthalein complexone-based colorimetric assay we quantitatively determined the calcium concentration in MSC cultures treated for 24 h with 21 or <0.02% O2 followed by up to 28 days of differentiation. Consistent with the bone nodule quantitation data, calcium concentration was 5-fold lower in anoxia-treated MSC cultu"
https://openalex.org/W2065404591,"In bacteria, a structurally simple type III polyketide synthase (PKS) known as 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthlene synthase (THNS) catalyzes the iterative condensation of five CoA-linked malonyl units to form a pentaketide intermediate. THNS subsequently catalyzes dual intramolecular Claisen and aldol condensations of this linear intermediate to produce the fused ring tetrahydroxynaphthalene (THN) skeleton. The type III PKS-catalyzed polyketide extension mechanism, utilizing a conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad in an internal active site cavity, is fairly well understood. However, the mechanistic basis for the unusual production of THN and dual cyclization of its malonyl-primed pentaketide is obscure. Here we present the first bacterial type III PKS crystal structure, that of Streptomyces coelicolor THNS, and identify by mutagenesis, structural modeling, and chemical analysis the unexpected catalytic participation of an additional THNS-conserved cysteine residue in facilitating malonyl-primed polyketide extension beyond the triketide stage. The resulting new mechanistic model, involving the use of additional cysteines to alter and steer polyketide reactivity, may generally apply to other PKS reaction mechanisms, including those catalyzed by iterative type I and II PKS enzymes.

In some fungi, THN is reduced to 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene and undergoes polymerization to form UV-protective 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (1Feng B. Wang X. Hauser M. Kaufmann S. Jentsch S. Haase G. Becker J.M. Szaniszlo P.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1781-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Filamentous bacteria of the genus Streptomyces utilize THN not only for melanin production (2Ueda K. Kim K.M. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but also incorporate the THN scaffold into pharmacologically active meroterpenoids such as neomarinone (3Kalaitzis J.A. Hamano Y. Nilsen G. Moore B.S. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 4449-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fungi and bacteria use dramatically different enzymatic systems to produce THN from five activated thioester-linked malonyl building blocks. In fungi, THN is synthesized by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS), which functions as a large (∼230-kDa) multidomain complex (4Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8853-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whereas type I PKSs and their fatty acid synthase ancestors have been intensely studied, their three-dimensional domain organization remains obscure due to their size and complexity. In stark contrast, bacteria use a structurally simple type III PKS architecturally organized as a homodimeric condensing enzyme (∼40 kDa) to synthesize THN from five coenzyme A (CoA)-tethered malonyl units, without the use of additional enzymes or catalytic domains (5Funa N.

Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), each type III PKS monomer utilizes a Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad (Fig. 1B) within an internal active site cavity that is connected to the surrounding aqueous phase by a narrow CoA-binding tunnel. The catalytic triad and the buried active site cavity condense an acetyl unit (derived from the decarboxylation of a malonyl-CoA) to a preloaded starter molecule attached by a thioester bond to the catalytic cysteine (18Lanz T. Tropf S. Marner F.J. Schröder J. Schröder G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9971-9976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent structure-guided mutagenic and biochemical studies of CHS provided a clear picture of the conserved type III PKS polyketide extension mechanism (Fig. 1B) (19Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Jez J.M. Noel J.P. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 275: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Type III PKSs are both iterative and multifunctional, having evolved to catalyze an impressive repertoire of functionally divergent and mechanistically complex reactions. These remarkable enzymes typically perform three polyketide extensions of their preferred CoA-activated starter molecules (ranging in size from acetyl- to caffeoyl-CoA), prior to catalyzing six-membered ring formation via intramolecular Claisen-, aldol-, or lactone-forming cyclization reactions (11Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Mutagenic analyses of plant PKSs based upon homology with CHS or upon the more recent crystal structures of daisy 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) (22Jez J.M. Austin M.B. Ferrer J. Bowman M.E. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 919-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and pine stilbene synthase (STS) (23Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), facilitated identification of much of the structural and mechanistic underpinnings for plant type III PKS substrate specificity and catalysis (11Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the structural and mechanistic basis for the bacterial THNS reaction pathway remains frustratingly obscure. Whereas most type III PKSs cyclize linear tetraketide intermediates to form phloroglucinol- or resorcinol-based products, THNS uniquely catalyzes two successive intramolecular carbon-carbon cyclization reactions of an all malonate-derived pentaketide chain (Fig. 1A). How THNS controls chain length and reactivity while avoiding the many possible derailment reactions available to its carboxylated polyketide intermediate is one of this enzyme's most intriguing features. Furthermore, it is unclear which of several possible cyclization routes to THN are utilized by the enzyme (Fig. 1C), despite the perpetuation in the literature of a hypothetical STS-like initial C-2 → C-7 intramolecular aldol condensation (5Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our recent structural and mechanistic analysis of STS (23Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J. Schröder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), considered in light of earlier biomimetic studies (24Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Pure Appl. Chem. 1986; 58: 283-294Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), instead implicates the C-1 thioester carbonyl and the C-10 methylene (activated by the C-11 carboxylate moiety) as the most likely electrophile and nucleophile, respectively, for intramolecular cyclization. Thus, an initial CHS-like C-6 → C-1 Claisen condensation could lead to a prearomatic phloroglucinol-like intermediate, or a C-10 → C-5 aldol condensation could lead to the corresponding resorcinol-like intermediate (Fig. 1C). It is also possible that the THNS active site may juxtapose these two reactive carbons, C-1 and C-10, to first facilitate an unprecedented C-10 → C-1 Claisen condensation. Although the resulting 10-membered polyketide ring seems energetically unfavorable relative to a more stable six-membered ring, in the context of the THNS active site, it could form and rapidly collapse via any one of five symmetric intramolecular aldol condensations to form the two stable fused six-carbon rings of the THN product (Fig. 1C). Significantly, no on-pathway monocyclic intermediates or their stable aromatic derivatives have ever been observed to result from the THNS-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that the unknown initial cyclic intermediate must indeed strongly facilitate enzymatic formation of the second ring. Although homology-based analysis of bacterial THNSs predicts a number of unusual active site residues (11Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 25Moore B.S. Hertweck C. Hopke J.N. Izumikawa M. Kalaitzis J.A. Nilsen G. O'Hare T. Piel J. Shipley P.R. Xiang L. Austin M.B. Noel J.P. J. Nat. Prod. 2002; 65: 1956-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), including four or five exposed cysteine side chain thiol groups that might contribute to these enzymes' unusual physiological reaction, sequence divergence between bacterial CHS-like enzymes and the structurally characterized plant PKSs increases the likelihood of significant model bias and error in homology models derived from distantly related plant PKS structures. In order to illuminate the mechanistic features responsible for these enzymes' catalytic pathway, we undertook a structural and biochemical analysis of THNS from the model actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2Ueda K. Kim K.M. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D.

Parkhill J. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). Toward this end, we present here the 2.2-Å crystal structure of THNS from S. coelicolor A3 (2Ueda K. Kim K.M. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), accompanied by additional mutagenic and biochemical investigations into the complicated THNS reaction mechanism. Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis—The construction and characterization of the S. coelicolor THNS construct in the pHIS8 vector was previously reported (8Izumikawa M. Shipley P.R. Hopke J.N. O'Hare T. Xiang L. Noel J.P. Moore B.S. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using mutagenic oligonucleotides (Table I) and the QuikChange (Stratagene) system. The entire coding sequences of mutant constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (8Izumikawa M. Shipley P.R. Hopke J.N. O'Hare T. Xiang L. Noel J.P. Moore B.S. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 30: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For crystallization, THNS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pLysS plasmid (Invitrogen), purified, buffer-exchanged, and concentrated as described for CHS (19Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), resulting in final enzyme concentrations of 5–50 mg/ml in 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol.

The crystallization buffer contained 14% (w/v) PEG 8000, 200 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Na+-MOPSO buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% (w/v) sucrose. A 30-s crystal soak prior to freezing employed a cryogenic solution differing from the crystallization buffer due to an increased PEG 8000 concentration (16% (w/v)) and the inclusion of 20% (v/v) glycerol. For heavy atom derivatization, native THNS crystals were soaked overnight in crystallization buffer differing from the crystallization solution due to an increased PEG 8000 concentration (16% (w/v)) and the inclusion of 0.1 mm K2PtCl4 prior to cryogenic freezing as before. Several unsuccessful heavy atom soaks were screened for anomalous diffraction at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, whereas the 2.2-Å native and 2.9-Å K2PtCl4 derivative data sets were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Images were indexed and integrated with DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), reflections were merged with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and data reduction was completed with CCP4 programs (28Dodson E.J. Winn M. Ralph A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 620-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). THNS crystallizes in the P2(1) space group, with unit cell dimensions of a = 76.68 Å, b = 69.68 Å, c = 81.14 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 95.42°. Structure Determination and Refinement—The S. coelicolor THNS structure was solved from the 2.9-Å platinum derivative data set. Experimental multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phases were obtained using SOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), based upon two K2PtCl4 sites. The experimental electron density maps were improved by bulk solvent density modification and automated building with RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Inspection of electron density maps and subsequent model building were performed in O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains one physiological THNS dimer. Two copies of a monomeric THNS homology model, generated by MODELLER (31Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

Following the success of a single round of refinement in CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) of this rebuilt protein model against the same 2.9-Å platinum derivative data set, subsequent iterative rounds of refinement in CNS utilized the higher quality 2.2-Å native data set (Table II). Coordinate and parameter files for the PEG and glycerol ligands were obtained from the HIC-Up (Hetero-compound Information Centre-Uppsala) site on the World Wide Web (x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/). PROCHECK (in CCP4) analysis of the final refined crystal structure (see Table II) revealed 86.6% of residue conformations to be in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, with 11.2% in additional allowed, 2.2% in generously allowed, and no residues in disallowed regions. THNS residues in generously allowed conformations are located in poorly ordered surface loops. Coordinates and structure factors for THNS have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (1U0M).

Reversed-phase TLC analysis of flaviolin/TAL product ratios were obtained from standardized 50-μl room temperature reactions containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 10 μm THNS, and 20 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were quenched with 5 μl of concentrated HCl and extracted twice with 50 μl of ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried, dissolved in 10 μl of MeOH, applied to Merck C18-silica TLC plates, developed in MeOH/H2O/AcOH (60:40:1, v/v/v), and visualized with radiography film. Apparent kinetic constants kcat and Km for THN production (Table III) were determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots, using an average of three or more independent assays (8Izumikawa M. Shipley P.R.

Following induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and the addition of 120 mg of [1,2-13C]AcONa (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.), cultures were shaken at 28 °C overnight, with additional 120-mg aliquots of [1,2-13C]AcONa added 3 and 6 h after induction for a total of 360 mg of labeled acetate. Cells were removed by centrifugation. The media supernatant was acidified with concentrated HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The crude organic extract was concentrated and separated by oxalic acid-treated silica flash chromatography employing a stepwise chloroform to methanol gradient. The 90% methanol fraction was further purified by preparative HPLC (YMC ODS-AQ 10 × 250-mm reversed-phase column with a linear solvent gradient of 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid in water to methanol over 60 min; flow rate = 2.0 ml/min). 2.5 mg of enriched flaviolin in Me2SO-d6 was analyzed by 13C INADEQUATE NMR on a Bruker 600-MHz spectrometer. THNS Crystal Structure—We were unable to solve the THNS crystal structure by molecular replacement using a 2.2-Å native data set and homology models based on plant type III PKS structures. Moreover, the in vivo incorporation of selenomethionine into the E. coli-expressed S. coelicolor THNS did not result in stable and active protein preparations. Fortunately, a 2.9-Å data set of a K2PtCl4 soak of our native crystals produced an anomalous signal suitable for phasing the structure using multiple anomalous diffraction with SOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Two platinum sites producing strong peaks on anomalous difference Patterson maps permitted phasing as well as phase extension and phase improvement by density modification using RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The quality of the phase information deteriorated significantly beyond 3.9 Å, but the initial figure of merit-weighted 2Fo - Fc electron density map was interpretable. Whereas RESOLVE automatic model building using this low resolution phasing information produced only a few erroneous polyalanine chains, their symmetrical distribution in the asymmetric unit facilitated identification of electron density corresponding to the THNS conserved type III PKS αβαβα-fold core domain and expected physiological homodimeric interface (11Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). A CHS-derived THNS homology model was then globally positioned in this experimental electron density map, and each residue with interpretable electron density was individually repositioned using O. Following a single round of successful CNS refinement of our manually placed and partially rebuilt model against the 2.9-Å derivative data, the resulting 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps indicated a number of regions needing to be rebuilt. In order to move rapidly and achieve a higher quality final model, subsequent rounds of refinement utilized our original native data set extending to 2.2-Å resolution. Portions of the model with no apparent electron density (discussed below) were initially deleted, but most were eventually replaced, since later electron density maps greatly improved following iterative rounds of building and refinement using the 2.2-Å native data set. Although previous plant PKS-based homology modeling failed to predict the many subtle backbone differences observed throughout this first bacterial type III PKS crystal structure reported here, there are no drastic rearrangements of the conserved αβαβα-fold or dimer interface in THNS. Our crystal structure shows that homology-based assignments of the THNS catalytic triad and other active site residues are essentially accurate, as previously supported by in vitro assays of Streptomyces griseus THNS point mutants (7Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 781-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, THNSs feature unusual (∼25-residue) extensions of their C termini, not found in plant or most other bacterial CHS-like sequences examined to date. These additional residues may facilitate in vivo protein-protein interactions with upstream and downstream enzymes, including the P450 or ORF3 proteins encoded next to the THNS gene in several gene clusters obtained from Streptomyces species (2Ueda K. Kim K.M. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Cortes J. Velasco J. Foster G. Blackaby A.P. Rudd B.A.M. Wilkinson B. Mol.

However, the mechanisms underlying such senescence-related morphological alterations have not been well studied. To investigate this situation, we characterized the senescence-dependent changes of cellular structural determinants in terms of their levels and activities. These determinants included integrins, focal adhesion complexes, and small Rho GTPases, and special emphasis was placed on their relationships with caveolin-1 status. We observed that the expression integrin β1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were increased and that the phosphorylations of FAK and paxillin, hallmarks of focal adhesion formation, were also increased in senescent human diploid fibroblast cells. Moreover, the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 were found to be highly activated in senescent cells. In addition, focal adhesion complexes and Rho GTPases were up-regulated in the caveolin-rich membrane domain in the senescent cells. Activated Rac1 and Cdc42 directly interacted with caveolin-1 in senescent cells. Interestingly, caveolin-1 knock-out senescent cells, achieved by using small interfering RNA and antisense oligonucleotide, showed disrupted focal adhesion formation and actin stress fibers via the inactivation of FAK, which resulted in morphological adjustment to the young cell-like small spindle shape. Based on the results obtained, we propose that caveolin-1 plays an important role in senescence-associated morphological changes by regulating focal adhesion kinase activity and actin stress fiber formation in the senescent cells.

Morphologic changes are characteristic features of the senescent phenotype that occur at both the cellular and organism level. Senescent cells show morphologically flattened and enlarged cell shapes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such morphological alterations in senescent cells have not been elucidated; instead, this phenotype has become an accepted phenomenon. Without doubt, such structural changes can limit functional efficiency. Therefore, it may be assumed that the functional deterioration of senescent cells may be intimately associated with such morphological changes. In our previous study, we observed that the senescent phenotypes can be reversed by simply reducing caveolin-1 status, at least functionally, in terms of mitogenic signaling and DNA synthesis reentry (1Cho K.A. Ryu S.J. Park J.S. Jang I.S. Ahn J.S. Kim K.T. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27789-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). During this study, we observed that the modulation of caveolin status in senescent cells may induce morphological changes. Therefore, in this work, we focused on the possibility of morphological adjustment in association with caveolin status modulation. To study the structural changes of senescent cells, we examined the cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, i.e. Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, and the integrins and integrin-mediated focal adhesion complex molecules. Associations between these molecules were traced with respect to their roles in the determination of agingspecific structural phenotypes. The activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 leads to the formation of actin stress fibers, which results in the formation of membrane ruffles/lamellipodia and filopodia. They are also involved in the network of integrin-mediated focal adhesion complexes (2Kolyada A.Y. Riley K.N. Herman I.M. Am. J. Physiol.

Biosci. 2002; 7: d143-d150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). FAK obtains its kinase activity through autophosphorylation and phosphorylates other focal adhesion molecules, such as paxillin (5Roy S. Ruest P.J. Hanks S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the morphological changes of senescent HDF cells involve the activation of Rb family proteins, the enhancement of actin stress fibers, and the redistribution of focal adhesion proteins (9Chen Q.M. Tu V.C. Catania J. Burton M. Toussaint O. Dilley T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the α-chain of integrins was suggested to be associated laterally with the oligomeric membrane protein caveolin-1 (10Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Caveolin, the principal component of caveolae, is a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein. Caveolin-1 has a scaffolding domain within its NH2-terminal region. Through this domain, caveolin-1 interacts with G-protein α-subunits, H-Ras, Src family tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C isoforms, EGF-R, Neu, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (11Bucci M.

Moreover, the targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 would be sufficient to drive the transformation of cells and to hyperactivate the Erk kinase cascade (14Razani B. Altschuler Y. Zhu L.

In contrast, senescent HDFs show high levels of caveolin expression and of its colocalization with EGF-R. The overexpression of caveolin-1 in young HDFs suppresses the activation of Erk-1/2 upon EGF stimulation, indicating that caveolin has a direct role in EGF signaling, which results in premature cellular senescence in primary cultures of murine fibroblasts transgenically overexpressing caveolin-1 (16Park W.Y.

Moreover, the down-regulation of caveolin-1 can restore Erk and Elk activation and can lead to the re-initiation of DNA synthesis upon EGF stimulation (1Cho K.A. Ryu S.J. Park J.S. Jang I.S. Ahn J.S.

These results demonstrate that caveolin-1 has a central role in the process of cellular senescence. Therefore, it might be of significance to identify the role of caveolin in aging-related morphological change, to establish its relationship with small GTPases and cytoskeletal modulating molecules, and to determine its role in aging-related functional efficiency. Reagents—Human diploid fibroblasts were isolated from foreskin. Monoclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 (C43420), phosphocaveolin-1 (Y14), FAK (F15020), paxillin (P13520), flotillin-1 (F65020), Rac1 (R56220), and RhoA (R73920) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies against phospho-FAK (sc11765-R), Cdc42 (8401), and actin (sc-1616) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal antiphosphopaxillin (Tyr-118) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. Secondary horseradish peridase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; chemiluminescent detection systems were from Pierce, and other biochemical reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human diploid fibroblasts were kept in a 100-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were passed serially in vitro, and young cells, proliferating cells, and senescent or near-senescent cells were collected at population doublings 15 and 60. Cellular senescence was confirmed by delayed population doubling times and by using a senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay (20Dimri G.P. Campisi J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For studies on the Rho GTPases, young cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected with active mutant RhoA-V12, Rac1-V12, or Cdc42-V12 by using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium. Four h after transfection, the cells were placed in complete medium in a CO2 incubator for 2 days before harvest. Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Staining—Senescent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 3∼5 min (at room temperature) in 3% formaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). Sixteen h later, senescent cells were identified under a light microscope. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells cultured on glass coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Nonspecific protein binding sites were then saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with polyclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 or monoclonal antibodies against paxillin. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used to stain the actin cytoskeleton. Unbound proteins were removed by washing, and cells was incubated with Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Nuclei were then fluorescently labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). The coverslips were then washed and mounted on glass slides. Fluorescent images were obtained using a confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% cholic acid, 1 mm protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and immunoprecipitated. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 7,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Cell lysates were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml monoclonal anticaveolin-1 antibody for 15 h at 4 °C and then with 10 μl of protein G-agarose for3hat4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed in washing buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), resuspended in 250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 357.7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol (5× sample buffer), and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitated proteins, gradient fractions, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies, i.e. anticaveolin-1 monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), anti-FAK (1.25 μg/ml), antiphospho-FAK (1.25 μg/ml), antipaxillin (1.25 μg/ml), antiphosphopaxillin (1.25 μg/ml), antiflotillin-1 (1.25 μg/ml), anti-Cdc42 (1 μg/ml), anti-Rac1 (1.25 μg/ml), anti-Rho (1.25 μg/ml), and antiactin antibody (0.4 μg/ml). The density of the visualized band was quantified using an image analyzer (Bio-Rad, model GS-700). At least three independent experiments were conducted. Purification of Caveolin-rich Membrane Fractions—Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. Homogenization was performed using a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), a Polytron (three 10-s bursts; output, 50), and a sonicator (three 10-s bursts). The homogenate was then adjusted to a 40% sucrose concentration by adding 2 ml of 80% sucrose solution prepared in MBS buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and placed in an Ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% (w/v) discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above, with both gradients in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate, and was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm (200,000 × g) for 16 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 5–30% sucrose interface confirmed the presence of caveolin. From the top of each gradient, 12 1-ml fractions were collected. The protein concentrations of the gradient fractions were determined by Bradford assay. RNA Interference and Transfection—Synthetic siRNA duplexes were used as described by Elbashir et al. (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). A synthetic siRNA duplex corresponding to the caveolin-1 mRNA sequence 5′-AACCAGAAGGGACACACAGUU-3′ was used to inhibit caveolin-1 protein expression (1Cho K.A. Ryu S.J. Park J.S. Jang I.S. Ahn J.S. Kim K.T. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27789-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a synthetic siRNA duplex corresponding to the firefly luciferase (GL2) mRNA sequence 5′-AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA was used as a negative control. The siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) as duplexed 2′ unprotected, desalted, and purified siRNA. Transfection of 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes was carried out using Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Two days before transfection, the cells were trypsinized and counted (5 × 104 cells/100-mm dish) so that they were 50% confluent on the day of transfection. siRNA-transfection reagent complexes were prepared as prescribed by the manufacturer. The cells were then transfected with 0.5 nmol (7 μg) of siRNA and Oligofectamine™ reagent in serum-free medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Following incubation, the cells were supplied with growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested 48 or 72 h later for further assay. Activity Analysis of the Rho Family GTPases—RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activity assays were performed as described previously (22Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The relative amount of active GTPases was determined by measuring the amount of GTPases sedimented by the glutathione S-transferase-Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain of p21-activated kinase or by the glutathione S-transferase-RhoA-binding domain of rhotekin relative to the amount in whole-cell lysates. Bound proteins were resolved by 15 or 17.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, or anti-Cdc42 antibodies. Morphological Changes of Senescent Cells Caused by Caveolin-1 Down-regulation—Senescent cells were confirmed by using senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining as a biomarker (Fig. 1A) and showed irregular large flat shapes versus young cells and increased levels of focal adhesion, lamellipodia, and filopodia (Fig. 1B). Previously, we reported that the caveolin level is significantly increased in senescent cells (16Park W.Y. Park J.S. Cho K.A. Kim D.I. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20847-20852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that a simple reduction in the caveolin-1 status, as determined by the siRNA method, induced in senescent cells morphological changes corresponding to the young cell-like shape, i.e. a small and spindle shape (Fig. 1, C and D). These data suggest that caveolin-1 might be actively involved in the morphogenesis of HDF cells during the cellular aging process. Colocalization of Caveolin-1 and Focal Adhesion Complex—Caveolin-1 is associated with focal adhesion complex by binding to integrin in the membrane (23Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The activity of the focal adhesion kinase is significantly reduced by caveolin-1 down-regulation (25Teixeira A. Chaverot N. Schroder C. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. Cazaubon S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of caveolin in senescence-associated morphological changes, young and senescent HDF cells in culture were fractionated by sucrose gradient density centrifugation in the absence of detergent, a procedure widely used to isolate caveolae-enriched membrane domains (26Song K.S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the fractions showed that the majority of the caveolin was present at the low density, 5%/30% sucrose interface of the gradient (Fig. 2B, Fractions 5–8). Protein amounts in each fraction showed that the senescent cells contained higher levels of protein in the caveolae domain (Fig. 2A). A significant proportion of focal adhesion molecules, e.g. FAK and paxillin, was recruited to the caveolae fractions in senescent cells, whereas flotillin, a membrane lipid raft marker, was similar in young and senescent HDF cells (Fig. 2B). These data showed that two kinds of microdomains differentially existed in young and senescent cells. When young and senescent cells were co-immunostained with antipaxillin and anticaveolin-1 antibodies (Fig. 2C), paxillin was found to be colocalized with caveolin-1 in the membrane of senescent cells but not in young cells. Although the expression level of paxillin was not increased in senescent HDF cells, it was recruited to a focal adhesion region in the senescent cell membrane. These data suggest that the observed increase in focal adhesion proteins might be related to the up-regulation of caveolin-1. Focal Adhesion and Cytoskeletal Proteins in Senescent HDF Cells—To confirm the roles of the focal adhesion complex in the senescent phenotype, young and senescent cells were examined for focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation. Confocal microscopic analysis indicated that focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation, monitored by antipaxillin antibody (green) and phalloidin (red), respectively, were significantly increased in senescent cells (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, senescent HDF cells showed higher expressions of integrin β1, FAK, and caveolin-1 than young cells but did not show higher expression of paxillin. However, in senescent cells, the phosphorylation statuses of FAK and paxillin were increased (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting increased focal adhesion formation. These data indicate that an increase of integrin and FAK in senescent cells recruits paxillin into the focal adhesion and that FAK, after being activated by integrin, phosphorylates paxillin. Inactivation of FAK and the Disruption of Focal Adhesion and Actin Stress Fiber Formation by the Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 in Senescent Cells—To explore the importance of caveolin-1 in senescent morphological changes via focal adhesion formation and Rho GTPases, senescent HDF cells were transfected with siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides of caveolin-1. Although the expression of FAK was not significantly changed, the phosphorylation of FAK was dramatically reduced by the down-regulation of caveolin-1 in caveolin siRNA-transfected senescent cells versus the control firefly luciferase siRNA-transfected senescent cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and of the other signaling molecules responsible for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell spreading after ligand engagement of β1 integrins may depend on interactions between FAK and Src family kinases. Because caveolin-1 has been shown previously to interact with c-Src (27Cao H. Courchesne W.E. Mastick C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8771-8774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), it may be presumed that the integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is affected by caveolin-1 status. In addition, focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation were reduced in caveolin siRNA-transfected senescent cells (Fig. 4C). Reductions of focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation via the inactivation of FAK by caveolin-1 status reduction resulted in morphological alterations toward the young cell phenotype (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that morphological changes shown by senescent cells via focal adhesion complexes and actin stress fibers could be modulated by caveolin-1 status. The Role of Rho Family GTPases in Senescent HDF Cells—Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, regulate the morphogenesis and cytoskeletal reorganization of cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, senescent cells showed higher levels of focal adhesion and of lamellipodia and filopodia formation. These results suggest that Rho GTPases might play important roles as morphological determinants in senescent cells. Fig. 5, A and B, showed increased Rac1 and Cdc42 expressions and activities in senescent HDF cells but did not show such increases for RhoA. Rho family proteins cycle between inactive GDP-bound forms and active GTP-bound forms and serve as molecular switches for a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. When young and senescent cell lysates were subjected to activity analysis using GST-p21-activated kinase and GST-rhotekin, respectively, senescent HDF cells showed elevated Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activity (Fig. 5C). To confirm the roles of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the production of the senescent phenotype, we transfected active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 into young HDF cells. The active mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 5D) were found to be able to induce morphological changes similar to those of senescent HDF cells. These results indicate that the activated Rho GTPases, especially Rac1 and Cdc42, might regulate the morphological alterations associated with the cellular aging process. Linkage of Caveolin-1 with Rac1 and Cdc42 in Senescent Cells—Because Rho GTPases regulate morphological changes via cytoskeletal reorganization, we examined the localization of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the interaction between caveolin-1 and Rac1 and Cdc42 in young and senescent HDF cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, Rho GTPases were recruited into caveolin fractions and were directly linked with caveolin-1 in senescent HDF cells by immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 6B). This result suggests that the activations of Rac1 and Cdc42 require their colocalization and interaction with caveolin-1 in the caveolin-rich membrane to facilitate senescence-associated morphological alteration. Senescent cells show morphological changes, such as a flat large cell shape in addition to functional decay and growth arrest (28Linskens M.H. Harley C.B. West M.D. Campisi J. Hayflick L. Science. 1995; 267: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Hayflick L. Clin. Geriatr. Med. 1985; 1: 15-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In various cellular processes, morphological changes play an important role in the cellular function. Recently, it was reported that the structural alterations of senescent cells are intimately related with an increase in focal adhesion and Rb family protein expression (9Chen Q.M. Tu V.C. Catania J. Burton M. Toussaint O. Dilley T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the basic mechanism for this aging-associated morphological change has not been well studied. In this study, we found that the morphologies of senescent cells became young cell-like simply by down-regulation of caveolin-1 status (Fig. 1D). This result suggests that caveolin-1 is involved in the morphological implications of the cellular aging process. Caveolin-1 is associated with focal adhesion complex through integrin in the membrane and controls the activity of focal adhesion kinase (10Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 23Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These results indicate that caveolin can play an important role in focal adhesion formation and thereby participate in the adhesion signal cascade as well. We observed that the formation of focal adhesion and the formation of actin stress fiber are both increased and tend to be anchored in the membrane after interaction with caveolin-1 in senescent cells (Figs. 2 and 3). In addition, caveolin-1 down-regulation caused the inactivation of FAK, which led to the disruption of focal complexes and actin stress fibers (Fig. 4). These findings show that the simple reduction of caveolin-1 in senescent cells can reverse their morphological form and that they revert to small, spindle-shaped cells via the modulation of focal adhesion complexes. As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of focal adhesion molecules, such as integrin β1 and FAK, were elevated in the caveolin-rich membrane, suggesting the possibility of their interaction. Interaction between integrin and caveolin-1 has been suggested previously (10Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and it is well known that integrins activate various protein tyrosine kinases, including FAK and Src family kinases (8Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that the strong interaction between caveolin-1 and integrins and focal adhesion complex molecules determines the morphology of senescent cells. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases act as intracellular molecular switches that transduce signals from extracellular stimuli to the actin cytoskeleton and the nucleus (30Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 31Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). The most characteristic function of Rho GTPases is that they act as regulators of various aspects of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in fibroblasts (2Kolyada A.Y. Riley K.N. Herman I.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1116-C1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Kaibuchi K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The activations of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 result in the formation of focal adhesion, actin stress fibers, membrane ruffles/lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, in senescent HDF cells Rac1 and Cdc42 were up-regulated in terms of their expressions and activities. To confirm the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the determination of senescent morphologic changes, young HDF cells were transfected with their respective constitutive active mutants, and this was found to result in senescence-like changes (Fig. 5, C and D). Therefore, we suggest that the morphological changes of senescent cells that occur via increased focal adhesion, actin stress fiber, and membrane ruffles can be explained by increased Rac1 and Cdc42 activity in the cellular aging process. We found that the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 are related to caveolin-1 status in senescent cells by analyzing the colocalization and interaction between caveolin-1 and Rho GTPases. As shown in Fig. 6, activated Rac1 and Cdc42 were enriched in caveolae-related membrane and directly interacted with caveolin-1 in senescent cells. These results probe a novel relationship between caveolin-1 and Rho GTPases with respect to the morphogenesis of cellular senescence. The role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis, including migration, polarity, axon growth and guidance, dendrite elaboration and plasticity, and synapse formation, has been elaborated previously (32Luo L. Hensch T.K. Ackerman L. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1996; 379: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms of Rac1 and Cdc42 have not been elucidated clearly. Based on the results of the present study, we suggest that caveolin might be involved in the activations of Rac1 and Cdc42 during cellular processes such as senescence and differentiation. The novel role of caveolin in aging-associated morphologic differentiation might be explained in terms of its regulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities and the subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data show the increased expression and phosphorylation of FAK in senescent cells (Fig. 3). Although the expression level of paxillin did not change, paxillin was recruited to focal complexes, and this resulted in the assembly of actin stress fibers in senescent cells. Because active Rho GTPases, especially Rac1 and Cdc42, induce morphological changes via the regulation of focal adhesion and actin cytoskeletal reorganization (33Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar, 34Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the recruitment of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the caveolin-rich membrane fractions and their interaction with caveolins in senescent cells (Fig. 6) may imply that the aging-associated morphological alterations are influenced by caveolin-1 status. Therefore, it seems likely that a reduction of caveolin-1 status in senescent cells could disrupt the aging-associated morphological alterations. In other words, caveolin-1 status might play a prime role as a determinant of the phenotypic morphological changes associated with senescence. In addition, we have suggested previously that caveolin-1 status may modulate the functional efficiency of senescent cells exposed to mitogenic signals (1Cho K.A. Ryu S.J. Park J.S. Jang I.S. Ahn J.S. Kim K.T. Park S.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, it appears that caveolin-1 status may be a principle determinant of the senescent phenotype not only in terms of functional deterioration but also in terms of morphological alteration, as if it plays the role of a gatekeeper at the boundary between the cell and the external environment. Taken together, our results indicate the possibility that the senescent phenotype is capable of flexible adjustment and that caveolin-1 status is a determinant of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2018792951,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of endoproteinases, are implicated in cardiac remodeling. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is increased in the heart following myocardial infarction, increases expression and activity of MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and -9 (gelatinase B) in cardiac fibroblasts. Previously, we have shown that IL-1β activates ERK1/2, JNKs, and protein kinase C (PKC). However, signaling pathways involved in the regulation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity are not yet well understood. Using adult rat cardiac fibroblasts, we show that inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNKs inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9, not MMP-2, expression and activity. Chelerythrine, an inhibitor of PKC, inhibited activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs and expression and activity of both MMPs. Selective inhibition of PKC-α/β1 using Gö6976 inhibited JNKs activation and the expression and activity of MMP-9, not MMP-2. Inhibition of PKC-θ and PKC-ζ using pseudosubstrates inhibited IL-1β-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs and the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9. Inhibition of PKC-ϵ had no effect. IL-1β activated NF-κB pathway as measured by increased phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκB-α. Inhibition of ERK1/2, JNKs, and PKC-α/β1 had no effect on NF-κB activation, whereas inhibition of PKC-θ and PKC-ζ inhibited IL-1β-stimulated activation of NF-κB. SN50, NF-κB inhibitor peptide, inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity. These observations suggest that 1) activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs plays a critical role in the regulation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, expression and activity; 2) PKC-α/β1 act upstream of JNKs, not ERK1/2; 3) PKC-ζ and -θ, not PKC-ϵ, act upstream of JNKs, ERK1/2, and NF-κB; and 4) activation of NF-κB stimulates expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9.

Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α, increase expression of MMP-2 and -9 (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol.

Although both MMP-2 and -9 are activated in the heart during myocardial remodeling, the temporal changes in the expression of these enzymes are different (14Tao Z.Y. Cavasin M.A. Yang F. Liu Y.H. Yang X.P. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MMP-9 activity increases 1 day after MI, whereas MMP-2 activity starts to increase within 4 days after MI. Furthermore, MMP-9 abundance increases in both ischemic and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas the abundance of MMP-2 increases only in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (9Spinale F.G.

These observations suggest differential regulation of MMP-2 and -9 in the heart. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α are increased during chronic heart failure (15Ukimura A. Terasaki F. Fujioka S. Deguchi H. Kitaura Y. Isomura T. Suma H. J.

We have also provided evidence that IL-1β activates PKC, specifically PKC-ζ, in cardiac fibroblasts and that activation of PKC plays a critical role in the regulation of MMP-2 and -9 (12Xie Z.

In addition to the activation of MAPKs and PKC, IL-1β has been shown to activate NF-κB in several different cell types (19Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 20Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate the signaling pathways, including MAPKs (ERK1/2 and JNKs), PKC (α, β1,ζ, θ, and ϵ), and NF-κB, involved in the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9 in response to IL-1β in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. The data presented here suggest that different isoforms of PKC differentially activate ERK1/2, JNKs, and NF-κB and that activation of ERK1/2, JNKs, and NF-κB differentially modulates the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-c-Jun, anti-phospho-IKKα/IKKβ, and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-IκB-α antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-phospho-JNK antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas monoclonal anti-MMP-2 and MMP-9 antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Research (Boston, MA). The myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (PKC-ζ-PS) was purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Chelerythrine, Gö6976, PKC-ϵ translocation inhibitor peptide (PKC-ϵ-TIP), myristoylated PKC-θ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKC-θ-PS), PD98059, SP600125, and SN50 (peptide inhibitor of NF-κB translocation) were purchased from Calbiochem. Rat Cardiac Fibroblast Culture and Treatment—Adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the supernatant of adult rat cardiac myocytes as described (13Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Bond B.R. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved for 48 h before use. Cells from the first and second passages were used for all the experiments. The cells were treated with IL-1β (4 ng/ml) for 48 h to measure MMP activity or for 15 min to measure activation of MAPKs, IKKα/β, and IκB-α. To study the role of MAPKs, PKC isoforms, or NF-κB, cells were pretreated with PD98059 (10 μm), SP600125 (10 μm), chelerythrine (5 μm), Gö6976 (5 or 10 nm), PKC-ϵ-TIP (5 μm), PKC-θ-PS inhibitor peptide (50 μg/ml), PKC-ζ-PS (25 μm), or SN50 (100 μg) for 30 min followed by treatment with IL-1β. Western Blot Analyses—Activation of MAPKs (ERK1/2 and JNKs), IKKα/β, and IκB-α was studied using Western blot analyses as described (18Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and protein contents were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then probed with phospho-specific ERK1/2, JNKs, c-Jun, IKKα/β, or IκB-α antibodies. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibody and analyzed as described (18Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein loading of each sample was verified by staining the membrane with 0.1% Ponceau S solution. Protein levels for MMP-2 and -9 were measured in the conditioned media using monoclonal anti-MMP-2 and anti-MMP-9 antibodies. In-gel Zymography—MMP activity in conditioned media was measured as described (13Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Bond B.R. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Briefly, the media were collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove cells and debris, and lyophilized to dryness. The pellet was resuspended in water, and protein content was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples (500 ng of protein) were loaded under non-reducing conditions onto 4% stacking, 10% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel polymerized with 1 mg/1 ml gelatin (type A from porcine skin, Sigma) as a substrate and electrophoresed at 15–20 mA. Following electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min with gentle shaking followed by a 30-min wash in distilled water. The gels were incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3), stained in Coomassie Blue (R-250), and then destained using 7% acetic acid and 40% methanol solution. Clear and digested regions representing MMP activity were quantified using a Kodak gel documentation system (Eastman Kodak Co.), and molecular weights were estimated using prestained molecular weight markers. Statistical Analyses—The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Tukey's test. Probability (p) values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. Inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNKs Inhibits MMP-9, Not MMP-2, Expression and Activity—Members of the MAPK superfamily (ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 kinase) are known to regulate MMP activity in various cell types (22Gurjar M.V. DeLeon J. Sharma R.V. Bhalla R.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Mori T. Jung J.C. Fini M.E. Lo E.H. J. Neurotrauma. 2002; 19: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that IL-1β activates ERK1/2 and JNKs, but not p38, in cardiac fibroblasts (18Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs plays a role in the regulation of MMP expression and activity, cells were pretreated with PD98059 (PD, a selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway, 10 μm) or SP600125 (SP, a selective inhibitor of JNKs, 10 μm) for 30 min followed by treatment with IL-1β for 48 h. Analysis of conditioned media demonstrated that PD98059 significantly inhibits MMP-9 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 3.7 ± 0.04; IL-1β + PD, 1.9 ± 0.2, p < 0.001; n = 4; Fig. 1, A and B) but has no significant effect on MMP-2 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 1.8 ± 0.3, IL-1β + PD, 1.7 ± 0.2, p = not significant; n = 4; Fig. 1, A and C). Western blot analysis of conditioned media demonstrated that IL-1β increases MMP-2 and -9 protein levels. Pretreatment with PD98059 inhibited MMP-9 protein but had no significant effect on MMP-2 levels (Fig. 1D). Inhibition of JNKs using SP600125 also significantly inhibited MMP-9 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 4.0 ± 0.1; IL-1β + SP, 1.6 ± 0.06, p < 0.001; n = 4; Fig. 2, A and B) but had no significant effect on MMP-2 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 1.8 ± 0.3; IL-1β + SP, 1.6 ± 0.1; p = not significant; n = 4; Fig. 2, A and C). Western blot analysis of conditioned media demonstrated that pretreatment with SP600125 inhibits MMP-9, not MMP-2, protein levels (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Inhibition of JNKs inhibits MMP-9 activity. Confluent cultures of cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated with SP (10 μm) for 30 min followed by stimulation with IL-1β (4 ng/ml) for 48 h. MMP activity and protein levels in conditioned media were measured using in-gel zymography and Western blot analysis, respectively. A is a representative zymogram demonstrating the changes in MMP activities. CTL, control. B and C represent MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities, respectively, expressed as -fold increase versus control (n = 4); *, p < 0.001 versus control; #, p < 0.01 versus IL-1β.

The experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we have shown that PD98059 and SP600125 specifically inhibit IL-1β-stimulated increases in ERK1/2 and JNKs activity, respectively. SP600125 from 2–20 μm concentration had no effect on IL-1β-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 (18Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility of whether a combination of PD98059 and SP600125 could be effective in the inhibition of MMP-2 activity and protein expression, cells were pretreated with PD98059 + SP600125 (PD + SP) followed by treatment with IL-1β for 48 h. In-gel zymography and Western blot analyses indicated that inhibition of both ERK1/2 and JNKs together significantly inhibits IL-1β-stimulated MMP-9 activity and protein levels but has no significant effect on MMP-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Inhibition of PKC Inhibits IL-1β-stimulated Activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs—Recently, we have shown that IL-1β-stimulated activation of PKC plays an important role in the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9 (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48546-48552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Activated PKC may act upstream in the activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs (24Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, cells were pretreated with chelerythrine (5 μm) for 30 min followed by stimulation with IL-1β for 15 min. Analysis of cell lysates using phospho-specific antibodies indicated that inhibition of PKC almost completely inhibits IL-1β-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4A) and JNKs (Fig. 4B, as reflected by the phosphorylation of c-Jun). Chelerythrine is a specific (but not isoform-selective) PKC inhibitor and represents a unique class of PKC inhibitors that competitively interfere with the phosphate acceptor site and non-competitively inhibits the ATP-binding site (25Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To identify PKC isoforms involved in the activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs, we used isoform-specific inhibitors of PKC. Gö6976, a selective inhibitor for PKC-α and -β1 (IC50 = 2.3 and 6.2 nm, respectively) at 5 and 10 nm, inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in c-Jun phosphorylation but had no significant effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D). PKC-ϵ translocation inhibitor peptide (PKC-ϵ-TIP) had no significant effect on IL-1β-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs (Fig. 4, C and D). PKC pseudosubstrates (PS) are specific inhibitory peptides and are known to suppress PKC activity by interacting with the substrate-binding pocket in the catalytic domain (26House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with PKC-ζ-PS completely inhibited IL-1β-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs (as reflected by c-Jun phosphorylation), whereas PKC-θ-PS exhibited a partial effect (Fig. 4, C and D). PKC Isoforms Differentially Modulate Expression and Activity of MMP-2 and -9 —To determine the role of PKC isoforms on MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity, cells were pretreated with Gö6976 (5 and 10 nm), PKC-ϵ-TIP, PKC-ζ-PS, and PKC-θ-PS for 30 min followed by treatment with IL-1β for 48 h. In-gel zymographic analysis of conditioned media demonstrated that Gö6976 almost completely inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9 (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 4.0 ± 0.6; IL-1β + Gö6976, 1.0 ± 0.4; p < 0.01; n = 4; Fig. 5A) activity but had no significant effect on MMP-2 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 2.0 ± 0.1; IL-1β + Gö6976, 1.6 ± 0.2; p = not significant; n = 4; Fig. 5A). PKC-ϵ-TIP had no significant effect on IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 or -9 activity. Both PKC-ζ-PS and PKC-θ-PS almost completely inhibited IL-1β-stimulated activation of MMP-9 (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 4.0 ± 0.6; IL-1β + PKC-ζ-PS, 0.2 ± 0.1; IL-1β + PKC-θ-PS, 0.8 ± 0.5; p < 0.05; n = 4; Fig. 5A) and -2 (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 2.0 ± 0.1; IL-1β + PKC-ζ-PS, 0.2 ± 0.07; IL-1β + PKC-θ-PS, 0.9 ± 0.07; p < 0.05; n = 4; Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis of conditioned media demonstrated that Gö6976 also reduces MMP-9, not MMP-2, protein levels (Fig. 5B). Pretreatment with PKC-ζ-PS and PKC-θ-PS almost completely inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9 and -2 protein levels, although PKC-ζ-PS seemed more effective than PKC-θ-PS since it also inhibits the basal protein levels of MMP-2. PKC-ζ and -θ Act Upstream of NF-κB, and Inhibition of NF-κB Inhibits IL-1β-stimulated Expression and Activity of MMP-2 and-9 —Inflammatory cytokines are known to activate NF-κB in different cell types (19Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 20Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-1β activates NF-κB and the role of PKC in the activation of NF-κB, we studied phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκB-α. Western blot analysis demonstrated that IL-1β increases phosphorylation of both IKKα/β and IκB-α within 15 min of treatment, suggesting activation of NF-κB (Fig. 6, A–D). Pretreatment with Gö6976 and PKC-ϵ-TIP failed to inhibit IL-1β-stimulated increases in IKKα/β and IκB-α phosphorylation. PKC-ζ-PS completely inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in IKKα/β and IκB-α phosphorylation, whereas PKC-θ-PS only exhibited a partial effect (Fig. 6, A and B). To test whether IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB is mediated through MAPKs, cells were pretreated with PD98059 and SP600125. Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 and SP600125 alone or in combination had no effect on IL-1β-stimulated increases in IKKα/β and IκB-α phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). To determine the role of NF-κB in the regulation of IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and -9 activity and protein levels, cells were pretreated with SN50, an inhibitor of NF-κB. In-gel zymographic analysis of conditioned media indicated that SN50 almost completely inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9 (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 4.0 ± 0.3; IL-1β + SN50, 0.5 ± 0.3; p < 0.001; n = 4; Fig. 7, A and B) and MMP-2 activity (-fold increase versus control; IL-1β, 1.8 ± 0.2; IL-1β + SN50, 0.8 ± 0.02; p < 0.05; n = 4; Fig. 7, A and C). Western analysis demonstrated similar decreases in MMP-9 and -2 protein levels (Fig. 7D). IL-1β activates ERK1/2 and JNKs, not p38 kinase, in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (18Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that IL-1β activates PKC and that activation of PKC plays a critical role in the regulation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48546-48552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The major new findings of this study are that 1) activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs plays a critical role in the regulation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, expression and activity; 2) PKC-α/β1 act upstream of JNKs, not ERK1/2; 3) PKC-ζ and -θ, not PKC-ϵ, act upstream of ERK1/2, JNKs, and NF-κB; and 4) activation of NF-κB stimulates expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9. MMPs are proposed to play a critical role in myocardial remodeling process following MI (10Ducharme A. Frantz S. Aikawa M. Rabkin E. Lindsey M. Rohde L.E. Schoen F.J. Kelly R.A. Werb Z. Libby P. Lee R.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). IL-1β, increased in the heart following MI, increases expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9 in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48546-48552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we show that inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNKs alone or in combination significantly, but partially, inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9, not MMP-2, protein levels and activity. These data suggest the involvement of MAPK-independent pathway(s) in the regulation of both MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity. These findings are consistent with the observations that inducible MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, and MMP-13) contain one or more AP-1-binding site(s) in their promoter, whereas the promoter region of constitutive MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-11) does not contain an AP-1-binding site (27Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 28Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The transcription factor AP-1 is formed by dimerization of different members of Fos and Jun protein family members. The expression of Fos and Jun is mainly regulated via the activation of ERK1/2 and JNKs, respectively. It is interesting to note that activation of ERK1/2 pathway is shown to play a critical role in the regulation of MMP-2 activity in transformed cells (29Kurata H. Thant A.A. Matsuo S. Senga T. Okazaki K. Hotta N. Hamaguchi M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The possibility of involvement of MAPK-independent pathway(s) and that transcription factors, other than AP-1, are involved in the regulation of both MMP-2 and -9 is supported by our recently published data that inhibition of PKC using chelerythrine completely inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and -9 expression and activities (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48546-48552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Human MMP-9 promoter has a binding site for transcription factor polyoma enhancer activator-3 (PEA-3), which is regulated by PKC (28Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 30Reifel-Miller A.E. Conarty D.M. Valasek K.M. Iversen P.W. Burns D.J. Birch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21666-21671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The human MMP-2 promoter contains AP-2 and SP-1 transcription factor-binding sites. In hepatoma cells, activation of PKC and protein kinase A activated AP-2 and MMP-2 gene expression (28Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 31Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). PKC activation is suggested to be necessary for the induction of MMP gene expression in response to proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in non-cardiac fibroblasts and tumor cell lines (32Mackay A.R.

PKC comprises a large family of serine-threonine kinases and plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular functions. The documented 12 members of the PKC family are classified according to their structure and substrate requirements (24Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Mol. Cell.

In this study, using PKC isoform-selective inhibitors, we show that PKC-α/β1 play a critical role in the regulation of MMP-9 expression and activity, whereas activation of PKC-ζ and PKC-θ plays a critical role in the regulation of expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9. The data presented here suggest that different isoforms of PKC differentially regulate the expression and activity of MMPs in cardiac fibroblasts in response to IL-1β. Various isoforms of PKC are known to modulate various signaling pathways (24Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, endothelin-1 stimulated activation of ERK1/2 is selectively mediated via PKC-ϵ, whereas PKC-δ preferentially activated JNKs and p38 kinase (38Heidkamp M.C. Bayer A.L. Martin J.L. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Strait III, J.B. Martin J.L. Bayer A. Mestril R. Eble D.M. Samarel A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H756-H766PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that PKC-α and -β1 act upstream of JNKs, whereas PKC-ζ and -θ act upstream of both ERK1/2 and JNKs. Activation of neither ERK1/2 nor JNKs requires PKC-ϵ. The differential effects of PKC isoforms on the regulation of MAPK activity in different cell types may reflect differences in activation of different isoforms of PKC and their downstream coupling. Of note, IL-1β has been shown to activate ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 kinase via PKC-independent pathways in intestinal myofibroblasts (40Mifflin R.C. Saada J.I. Di Mari J.F. Adegboyega P.A. Valentich J.D. Powell D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C824-C834Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding of this study is that PKC-ζ and -θ, not PKC-α, -β1, or -ϵ, act upstream in the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and that inhibition of NF-κB inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP (MMP-2 and -9) expression and activity. Here, activation of NF-κB was studied using increased phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκB-α kinase as an index. Increased phosphorylation and activation of IKKα/β increases phosphorylation of IκB-α. Upon phosphorylation, the IκB-α protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, thereby allowing NF-κB to enter into the nucleus (41DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNKs failed to inhibit IL-1β-stimulated increases in phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκB-α, suggesting activation of NF-κB independent of MAPK pathways. The data presented here suggest both PKC-ζ and -θ are involved in the activation of NF-κB. However, the effect of PKC-ζ seemed more prominent than PKC-θ. These data are consistent with the findings of Anrather et al. (42Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in which PKC-ζ has been shown to be essential for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in endothelial cells. NF-κB has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of MMP expression (43Esteve P.O. Chicoine E. Robledo O. Aoudjit F. Descoteaux A. Potworowski E.F. St Pierre Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35150-35155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 44Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Wu H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal stimulatory region of the MMP-9 promoter has a functional NF-κB site (28Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is shown to be required for the inducibility of MMP-9 production in smooth muscle cells in response to cytokines (45Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar, 46Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T. Rainville M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activation using SN50 inhibits MMP-9 expression and activity induced by IL-1β in adult cardiac fibroblasts. However, our data that NF-κB activity plays an essential role in the regulation of IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 in cardiac fibroblasts are interesting because no consensus NF-κB-binding site has been identified in MMP-2 promoter (28Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Activation of latent MMP-2 is regulated by membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) in conjunction with tissue inhibitors of MMPs (47Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP has an NF-κB-binding site in its promoter (44Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Wu H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that IL-1β-stimulated activation of NF-κB increases MMP-2 activity indirectly via the increased expression of MT1-MMP. It is also possible that NF-κB directly modulates MMP-2 expression and activity via its interaction with other transcription factors that regulate MMP-2 expression. The later possibility is supported by our data that inhibition of NF-κB also inhibits protein levels as well as activity of MMP-2. The data presented here indicate differential regulation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and activity in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. PKC-α/β1 activates JNKs, leading to increased protein levels and activity of MMP-9, whereas PKC-θ and PKC-ζ activate JNKs, ERK1/2, and NF-κB, resulting in increased protein levels and activity of both MMPs (Fig. 8). Thus, IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-9 expression and activity involve PKC-α/β1, PKC-θ, PKC-ζ, ERK1/2, JNKs, and NF-κB signaling molecules, whereas IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 expression and activity are regulated via PKC-θ, PKC-ζ, and NF-κB pathways. Although these observations are made in vitro, activation of PKC, NF-κB, and AP-1 has been observed in the non-infarcted myocardium of rats after MI (48Simonis G. Honold J. Schwarz K. Braun M.U. Strasser R.H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Frantz S. Fraccarollo D. Wagner H. Behr T.M. Jung P. Angermann C.E. Ertl G. Bauersachs J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). NF-κB and AP-1 are also activated in congestive heart failure due to ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy (49Frantz S. Fraccarollo D. Wagner H. Behr T.M. Jung P. Angermann C.E. Ertl G. Bauersachs J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have observed increased phosphorylation of PKC-ζ in mice after MI (12Xie Z. Singh M. Siwik D.A. Joyner W.L. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48546-48552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas others have shown increased expression of PKC-α and PKC-δ, not PKC-ϵ, in rat after MI (48Simonis G. Honold J. Schwarz K. Braun M.U. Strasser R.H. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2002; 97: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings raise the possibility that activation of these signaling pathways could contribute to pathologic remodeling of the heart by differentially regulating the expression and activity of MMP-2 and -9. A better understanding of the regulation of individual MMP is essential for the development of pharmacological strategies for the prevention of excessive matrix degradation and remodeling during chronic heart failure and after MI."

Conserved from bacteria to humans, these proteins are implicated in the control of gene silencing, metabolism, apoptosis, and aging. Here we examine the role of NAD+ metabolites/derivatives and salvage pathway intermediates as activators, inhibitors, or coenzyme substrates of Sir2 enzymes in vitro. Also, we probe the coenzyme binding site using inhibitor binding studies and alternative coenzyme derivatives as substrates. Sir2 enzymes showed an exquisite selectivity for the nicotinamide base coenzyme, with the most dramatic losses in binding affinity/reactivity resulting from relatively minor changes in the nicotinamide ring, either by reduction, as in NADH, or by converting the amide to its acid analogue. Both ends of the dinucleotide NAD+ are shown to be critical for high selectivity and high affinity. Among the NAD+ metabolites tested none were able to allosterically activate, although all led to various extents of inhibition, consistent with competition at the coenzyme binding site. Nicotinamide was the most potent inhibitor examined, suggesting that cellular nicotinamide levels would provide an effective small molecule regulator of protein deacetylation and generation of OAADPr. The presented findings also suggest that changes in the physiological NAD+:NADH ratio, without a change in NAD+, would yield little alteration in Sir2 activity. That is, NADH is an extremely ineffective inhibitor of Sir2 enzymes (average IC50 of 17 mm). We propose that changes in both free nicotinamide and free NAD+ afford the greatest contribution to cellular activity of Sir2 enzymes but with nicotinamide having a more dramatic effect during smaller fluctuations in concentration.

Substrates and potential functions of the remaining mammalian homologs have not been demonstrated. Sir2 has been linked to increased longevity in yeast (17Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L.

The molecular basis for aging has not been established; however, it does appear that increased Sir2 activity is required. This has led to the investigation of regulatory mechanisms that might control Sir2 activity. Currently, there are two schools of thought: one that proposes the cellular NAD/NADH ratio is critical (19Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L.

Resveratrol is found in red wine and has been linked to the health benefits of consuming such drinks. Several other related compounds also appear to activate Sir2 in vitro, suggesting that not only might Sir2 be the functional target of resveratrol and similar compounds but that the cell may regulate Sir2 activity through the binding of other naturally occurring allosteric regulators.

This pathway (see Fig. 1) conserves the pyridine ring of nicotinic acid/nicotinamide to regenerate β-NAD+ and is distinct from the β-NAD+ biosynthetic pathway. Anderson et al. (24Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that increased dosage of several salvage pathway genes in yeast results in increased gene silencing and life span extension. Moreover, altering the levels of cellular nicotinamide, either genetically or by exogenous addition to yeast cells, decreased gene silencing and accelerated aging in a Sir2-dependent manner (25Bitterman K.J.

Here we examine the role of NAD+ metabolites/derivatives and salvage pathway intermediates as activators, inhibitors, or coenzyme substrates of Sir2 enzymes using three distinct Sir2 homologs and a variety of in vitro assays. Also, we probe the coenzyme binding site using inhibitor binding studies and alternative coenzyme derivatives as substrates. The presented findings have important implications for the role of cellular NAD/NADH ratios and free nicotinamide concentrations in controlling Sir2 activity, as well as provide the mechanistic basis for coenzyme specificity. Reagents—Synthetic 11-mer H3 peptide and acetylated H3 peptide (AcH3), corresponding to the 10 amino acid residues surrounding lysine 14 of histone H3, H2N-KSTGGK(Ac)APRKQ-CONH2, were purchased from SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA). 3H-Labeled acetyl-H3-peptide ([3H]AcH3) was prepared as reported previously (10Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 3-hPAD+ was made enzymatically by utilizing the nicotinamide exchange reaction of yeast HST2 and 3-hydroxypyridine as described previously (28Jackson M.D. Schmidt M.T. Oppenheimer N.J. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50985-50998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available and were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Fisher Scientific and were used without further purification. Expression and Purification of His-tagged HST2, hSIRT2, and ySIR2—The procedure used in the expression and purification of histidine-tagged full-length HST2 has been reported previously (10Jackson M.D. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18535-18544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with only minor changes and was applied to the purification of the SIR2 enzymes. Fractions containing protein greater than 90% purity, based upon densitometry, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 37 °C), 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. For yeast SIR2 (ySIR2), 800 mm NaCl was also included in the final dialysis. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford et al. (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). Charcoal Binding Assays—Charcoal binding assays were performed as reported previously (28Jackson M.D. Schmidt M.T. Oppenheimer N.J. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50985-50998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70-μl reaction volumes containing [3H]AcH3 were quenched by adding to charcoal slurry (1 volume of activated charcoal to 2 volume of 2.0 m glycine buffer (pH 9.5)). The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged. The [3H]acetate is liberated from the product OAADPr under these conditions and remains in the supernatent. The supernatent was collected and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Rates of deacetylation are obtained from the ratio of free [3H]acetate in the supernatent to total radioactivity in the reaction mixture. Inhibition Reactions—Inhibition reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-Cl or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5 at 37 °C) with 50 μm NAD+, 225 μm3H-acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 0.2-0.5 μm HST2, inhibitor concentrations from 5 μm to 100 mm, in a total volume of 80 μl. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C from 0 to 6 min (within the linear range of product formation under steady-state conditions), and quenched with activated charcoal. Inhibition was determined by comparing the rate of product formation between inhibited and non-inhibited reactions. Equation 1 was used to fit initial velocities at various inhibitor concentrations (28Jackson M.D. Schmidt M.T. Oppenheimer N.J. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50985-50998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The resulting Ki(app) is reported as an IC50 value; the νapp and νmax are represented by percent deacetylase activity, where νmax is 100% and νapp is percent activity at the given [I]. Reported values are the average of at least three independent experiments. Fits were obtained using Kaleidagraph (Synergy software, Reading, PA). νapp=νmax[1−([I]/(Ki(app)+[I]))](Eq. 1) Analysis of NAD+Analogues as Substrates for the Formation of OAADPr or Its Respective Analogue—NAD+ analogues were used as an alternate substrate for NAD+ in HST2-catalyzed deacetylase reactions. For saturation curves of NAD+, NAAD+, 3-AcPAD+, NGD+, and NHD+, reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-Cl or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5 at 37 °C), with 129-300 μm3H-acetylated H3 peptide, 1 mm DTT, 1-100 μm HST2, in a total volume of 80 μl. NAD+ analogue concentrations ranged from 150 μm to 14 mm. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, incubated at 37 °C from 0 to 6 min (within the linear range of product formation under steady-state conditions), and quenched with activated charcoal. To obtain the kinetic parameters of Table II, initial velocity data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear least squares analysis (Kaleidagraph software) (see Equation 2). In the case of 3-hPAD+, the rate increased linearly with substrate concentration up to 6.2 mm. The data were fit to a line using linear least squares regression and the slope reported as the kcat/Km. Two NAD+ analogues, NADP+ and thio-NAD+, were subjected to a bisubstrate kinetic analysis, where both [AcH3] and [NAD+ analogue] were varied. Peptide concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 50 μm for thio-NAD+ assays and 225 μm to 1 mm for NADP+ assays. [Thio-NAD+] ranged from 50 μm to 1.5 mm and [NADP+] from 300 μm to 3 mm. Since it has been shown that SIR2 enzymes follow a sequential mechanism (30Borra M.T. Langer M.R. Slama J.T. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9877-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the initial velocity data were fitted to the equation for a sequential mechanism (see Equation 3) using KinetAssyst software (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) and algorithms of Cleland (31Cleland W.W.

Open table in a new tab Evaluation of Potential NAD+-derived Regulators of Sir2 Enzymatic Activity—Given the requirement for the coenzyme NAD+ and the genetic evidence for NAD+ metabolites controlling Sir2 activity, we first investigated whether a variety of NAD+ metabolites could directly modulate these enzymes, either by direct competition with NAD+, allosteric binding, or as a substrate surrogate of NAD+. Although NADH and nicotin-amide have been suggested to directly regulate Sir2 enzymes (19Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 20Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y. Hoffman E. Veech R.L. Sartorelli V. Mol.

Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), a comprehensive and quantitative analysis including these and other NAD+ derivatives was lacking. We tested yeast NAD+ salvage pathway intermediates (nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, β-NAMN, β-NAAD (Fig. 1)) and other NAD+ metabolites (β-NADH, β-NMN, and α-NAD) as potential regulators of the in vitro Sir2 reaction (Table I). The yeast Sir2 homolog HST2 was used as the primary test case; however, ySir2 and human SIRT2 were also examined to confirm general trends observed with HST2. The rate of OAADPr product formation was monitored under steady-state conditions at varying concentrations of these potential regulators. Substrate concentrations were both fixed: 50 μm NAD+ (4-fold above Km) and 225 μm AcH3 (saturating). Of the compounds examined, none stimulated the forward reaction (Table I). Instead, all compounds inhibited the reaction to varying extents. Interestingly, nicotinamide was the most potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.126 mm), while nicotinic acid (IC50 = 250 mm) was the worst inhibitor, displaying almost a 2000-fold difference in efficiency (Table I and Fig. 2). It is notable that three of the worst inhibitors (IC50 ∼26-250 mm) tested were the three acid analogues (β-NAMN, β-NAAD, and nicotinic acid) of the nicotinamide amide. Although an IC50 of 250 mm for nicotinic acid was determined, the uncertainty for this value is likely greater as a consequence of the lack of data points above the IC50, which was experimentally impractical. Of the mononucleotides, NAMN+ inhibited ∼60-fold less effectively than its amide analogue, NMN+. Of the three dinucleotides tested α-NAD+ ranks the best (IC50 = 1.08 mm), inhibiting about 10-fold less effectively than nicotinamide but >20-fold better than either NADH or β-NAAD+. Given the poor inhibition of HST2 by NADH, and its proposed role in directly regulating ySir2, we examined NADH inhibition with ySir2 as well as human SIRT2 under identical assay conditions. NADH was a poor inhibitor of both human SIRT2 and ySir2, yielding IC50 values of ∼11 and 15 mm, respectively. These findings were quite similar to the IC50 of 28 mm obtained with HST2, indicating that Sir2 enzymes bind NADH with extremely low affinity.Table IInhibitory effects of NAD+ analogues and salvage pathway intermediates on the formation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose Open table in a new tab Probing the Coenzyme Binding Site—To probe the coenzyme binding site of Sir2 enzymes, we determined whether structurally diverse mono- and dinucleotides, including some NAD+ salvage pathway intermediates, could support the deacetylase reaction when substituted for NAD+. Ten different NAD+ analogues were analyzed as coenzyme substrates for HST2. Formation of OAADPr (or the respective analogue) was monitored, and when possible, the steady-state kinetic values of kcat, Km, and kcat/Km were determined for each compound tested (Table II). The values of kcat represent the maximal rate of the reaction, and the Km value represents the concentration of substrate at ½ the maximal velocity. The values of kcat/Km are the apparent second-order rate constant for the reaction between free enzyme and free substrate and include all processes up to and including the first irreversible step in the overall reaction. Therefore, the kcat/Km is a direct measure of the specificity of an enzyme toward a given substrate, as it reflects both substrate binding and the first chemical step in the reaction, the cleavage of the nicotinamide-ribosyl bond. We and others (28Jackson M.D. Schmidt M.T. Oppenheimer N.J. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50985-50998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Borra M.T.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9249-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have shown that nicotinamide release, under steady-state conditions, is the first irreversible step in the overall reaction. The kinetic constants obtained with the various coenzymes were determined from substrate saturation curves (Fig. 3) and compared with those derived from an NAD+ saturation curve at high [AcH3 peptide]. As substrates, the two best NAD+ analogues tested were NADP+ and thio-NAD+. The kinetic parameters for both analogues were determined using bi-substrate kinetic analysis where both [AcH3 peptide] and [coenzyme] were varied. NADP+ exhibited a kcat/Km value 130-fold lower than that of NAD+ while yielding the same kcat and an increased Km, suggesting that the lower kcat/Km is due to poor binding affinity for NADP+ (Table II). Compared with NAD+, thio-NAD+ exhibited a kcat/Km value 235-fold lower, with a 4-fold decrease in kcat and a 60-fold increase in Km (Table II; Fig. 4). Although small, the 4-fold change in kcat may reflect a significantly decreased rate of the thio-nicotinamide-ribosyl bond cleavage or slowed thio-nicotinamide release. Thus, the kcat/Km for thio-NAD+ represents both lower binding affinity and a slower step at or before thio-nicotinamide release. As a result of the extremely low activity, kinetic parameters for additional analogues were determined by constructing co-enzyme saturation curves at high but constant [AcH3 peptide]. Of the two NAD+ salvage pathway intermediates, NAAD+ and NAMN+, only NAAD+ yielded measurable product with a kcat/Km nearly 1.4 × 106-fold lower than with NAD+. Both kcat and Km were affected, making NAAD+ the worst product-forming dinucleotide substrate tested (Table II). NAMN+, along with its amide analogue NMN+, yielded no measurable product (3 mm substrate, 100 μm HST2, 20 min). As might be predicted with stereo-selective enzymes, α-NAD+ yielded no product (20 mm α-NAD+, 0.5 μm HST2, 6 min) as the nicotinamide group is in the opposite orientation compared with β-NAD+. However, as an inhibitor, α-NAD+ bound with reasonable affinity (IC50 = 1 mm). Four additional dinucleotide substrates were tested: two were NAD+ analogues with respect to the nicotinamide base, and two were NAD+ analogues with respect to the adenine base. Of the two nicotinamide base analogues, 3-AcPAD+ and 3-hPAD+, the former exhibited a kcat/Km value nearly 1300-fold lower compared with NAD+, effecting both kcat and Km values (Table II). The 3-hPAD+ substrate displayed a 6 × 105-fold decrease in kcat/Km. Because the reactions with 3-AcPAD+ and 3-hPAD+ proceed in identical fashion to that of NAD+ after the base is released, the observed change in the kinetic constants represents a change in any or all of the following: initial coenzyme binding, cleavage of the glycosidic bond, and/or nicotinamide analogue release. NGD+ and NHD+ displayed kcat/Km values 1400- and 2400-fold lower than with NAD+, respectively, and both displayed kcat and Km changes. The significant decrease in kcat (10-60-fold) here implies that a chemical step and/or release of product is affected, since the final product is an analogue of OAADPr. The dramatic decrease in kcat/Km suggests that coenzyme binding is weak and/or nicotinamide-ribosyl bond breakage is slowed. Implications for Regulation of Sir2 Enzymatic Activity by NAD+Metabolites—Over the last couple of years, there has been a growing debate on how Sir2 enzymes are regulated within the cell.

https://openalex.org/W1999903313,"MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP)-3 is a cytoplasmic dual specificity protein phosphatase that specifically binds to and inactivates the ERK1/2 MAP kinases in mammalian cells. However, the molecular basis of the cytoplasmic localization of MKP-3 or its physiological significance is unknown. We have used MKP-3-green fluorescent protein fusions in conjunction with leptomycin B to show that the cytoplasmic localization of MKP-3 is mediated by a chromosome region maintenance-1 (CRM1)-dependent nuclear export pathway. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of MKP-3 seen in the presence of leptomycin B is mediated by an active process, indicating that MKP-3 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The amino-terminal noncatalytic domain of MKP-3 is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear export of the phosphatase and contains a single functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). Even though this domain of the protein also mediates the binding of MKP-3 to MAP kinase, we show that mutations of the kinase interaction motif which abrogate ERK2 binding do not affect MKP-3 localization. Conversely, mutation of the NES does not affect either the binding or phosphatase activity of MKP-3 toward ERK2, indicating that the kinase interaction motif and NES function independently. Finally, we demonstrate that the ability of MKP-3 to cause the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 requires both a functional kinase interaction motif and NES. We conclude that in addition to its established function in the regulated dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinase, MKP-3 may also play a role in determining the subcellular localization of its substrate. Our results reinforce the idea that regulatory proteins such as MKP-3 may play a key role in the spatio-temporal regulation of MAP kinase activity."

The data provide insights into factors influencing the affinity and specificity of the interactions between albumins from different animal species and bacterial albumin-binding proteins, with interesting evolutionary implications. The structure might also prove useful in the study of HSA in the context of structure-aided drug design. Purification and Complex Formation—HSA was purchased from Octapharma AG (Sweden) and purified according to the protocol of Curry et al. (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) to remove dimers and multimers. The protein was concentrated to 100 mg/ml with a Millipore spin filter (10,000 Da cutoff) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl and subsequently frozen in aliquots at -85 °C. Purified and lyophilized GA module protein (residues 213–265 of protein PAB) was purified as described (16Johansson M.U. Nilsson H. Evenäs J. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. Wikström M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1083-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For crystallization, a mixture of HSA and GA module (molar ratio 1:1) was incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature. Crystallization of the HSA-GA Complex—Crystallization was achieved by vapor diffusion at 18 °C using the hanging drop method with a crystallization solution consisting of 2.2 m (NH4) 2SO4 and 0.1 m citrate, pH 6. The crystals belong to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 96.3 Å, b = 134.8 Å, c = 122.5 Å, and α = β = γ = 90° and one complex per asymmetric unit. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen using mineral oil as a cryoprotectant. Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Determination— Data statistics are summarized in Table I. The data were indexed using Denzo and XdisplayF and scaled with Scalepack (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement search in MOLREP (18Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) using chain A of the apo form of HSA (Protein Data Bank entry 1AO6) as a search model gave the solution for the albumin part of the complex with an R-factor of 48.9 and a correlation coefficient of 56.2. After cycles of rigid body refinement in REFMAC5 (19Mushudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar), maps were generated using xdlMAPMAN (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Manual inspection of normalized positive difference density maps (|Fo| - |Fc|) at a σ level of 3 in the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) indicated the location of the GA three-helix bundle. The minimized average NMR structure of the GA module (Protein Data Bank entry 1PRB) was manually built into the positive difference density. The resulting complex was subsequently subjected to several cycles of restrained refinement in REFMAC5 using the CCP4i interface (22Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding in O. Toward the end of model building, TLS refinement in REFMAC (version 5.2) was also carried out. Attempts were made to refine the model without geometric restraints. However, at this limited resolution such attempts not only result in fitting to noise (higher free R-factor), but also to improbable torsion angles for the main chain and side chains. Therefore, the restraints were kept throughout the refinement. The model is available through the Protein Data Bank, accession code 1TF0 (RCSB022596). An additional map calculation was performed using ARP/wARP (23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Model validation was carried out using PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

The complex crystallizes in the centered orthorhombic space group C2221, a crystal form previously unreported for HSA. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, and the resulting model of the complex was refined using TLS and restrained refinement to a resolution of 2.7 Å. TLS refinement of the complex proved to be beneficial and was carried out using four TLS groups, with HSA residues 1–197 in the first, residues 198–385 in the second, residues 386 to 569 in the third, and GA residues 1–53 in the fourth TLS group. The HSA chain is disordered between residues 77 and 88 and beyond residue 573. These regions have been omitted from the model. The protein has satisfactory bond angles and bond lengths, and 87.9% of the residues in the complex fall within core regions in the Ramachandran plot. The two residues in the disallowed regions, Lys-541 in HSA and Asp-3 in GA, are involved in crystal packing interactions, which may account for the unusual torsion angles. The data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The GA module binds to HSA at a site in domain II of the albumin molecule close to a cleft bounded by helices 2 and 3 in domain IIA, helices 7 and 8 in domain IIB, and the loop region before helix 7 in IIB (Fig. 2A). In the GA module, residues from the second helix and the two loops surrounding it are involved in binding. The GA helices pack outside the cleft at an angle of ∼60° against HSA helix 3 in domain IIA. Although this arrangement is almost identical to the orientation reported for the all α-helical affibody-ZSPA complex (26Högbom M. Eklund M. Nygren P.A. Nordlund P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3191-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the respective binding sites on the Z domain and the GA module do not overlap. The three-helix bundle Z domain of protein A and the GA module share a striking similarity in their overall structure. Even so, it is helix 1 of the Z domain that packs against the affibody helices, not the second and third as in the HSA-GA case. This illustrates the versatility inherent in an all-helical binding surface. The Structure of the Albumin Molecule—Binding the GA module leaves the albumin chain largely unchanged compared with a fatty acid complex of HSA (PDB code 1BJ5), apart from local side chain rotations. The model of the complex also contains two molecules of fatty acid, which had been co-purified with the albumin prior to complex formation and crystallization. Judging from the markedly lower quality of the electron density in domain I of the HSA molecule, this region seems to be more flexible and disordered than the rest of the complex. The Structure of the GA Module—No significant conformational changes in GA occur upon HSA binding, as judged by comparison of the present crystal structure and the previously reported solution structure (27Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The three helices of the GA module form a tight three-helix bundle with a distinct hydrophobic core. Both the N and C terminus of the GA module are well ordered in the crystal. The N-terminal residue Thr-1 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of a symmetry-related Lys-536, whereas the penultimate residue at the C-terminal end, His-52, is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the main chain oxygen of Ala-21 in the GA module. The main chain of GA helix 1 was corrected, and side chain orientations throughout the entire chain also had to be amended. The rebuilding resulted in that almost 90% of the GA residues in the crystal structure came within core regions in the Ramachandran plot, compared with 64% in the NMR solution structure. The HSA-GA Interface—The interface is a predominantly flat surface of ∼700 Å2 involving one-fourth of the total GA surface area (Fig. 2B). The binding surface consists of a hydrophobic core flanked by two hydrogen bond networks. The hydrophobic core of the interface is lined with residues Phe-228, Ala-229, Ala-322, Val-325, Phe-326, and Met-329 from HSA and residues Phe-27, Ala-31, Leu-44, and Ile-48 from GA. In this context it is worth mentioning the phenyl side chain of Phe-27, which is buried in a cleft formed by the HSA residues Phe-309, Phe-326, and Met-329 (Fig. 2C). In addition, this interaction extends the aromatic cluster of HSA domain II, which consists of Phe-309, Phe-326, Phe-330, Phe-374, Phe-377, Tyr-334, and Tyr-353, to also include Phe-27 and Tyr-28 of GA. Adjacent to the hydrophobic core of the interface is a hydrogen bond network between helix 7 in the HSA domain IIB and the loop preceding helix 2 in GA (Fig. 3A). HSA residue Glu-321 forms two hydrogen bonds, one each with the main chain nitrogens of Thr-24 and Ser-25 in GA. Furthermore, the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-25 in GA forms another hydrogen bond with the side chain oxygen of Asn-318 from HSA. The main chain oxygen of Asn-318 is, in turn, involved in a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr-28 in the GA module. At the opposite end of the binding interface, a second hydrogen bond network is formed between residues in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3 in GA and residues in helices 2 and 3 in HSA domain IIA (Fig. 3B). Here, HSA residues Glu-230 and Asn-267 form hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen and the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-37, respectively. Glu-230 also interacts with the main chain oxygen of Ala-35. A Fatty Acid in the Binding Interface—An additional hydrogen bond at the HSA-GA interface occurs between GA residue Glu-47 in helix 3 and HSA residue Lys-212. Adjacent to this region, in the tunnel-shaped cavity previously described as fatty acid binding site 6, we observed density compatible with a medium-length fatty acid. Two molecules of the saturated ten-carbon fatty acid decanoate were built into the model in a linear tail-to-tail orientation. In the final model, the carboxylate head of one of the fatty acids is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Ser-232 (Fig. 4A). The fatty acid is thereby brought within 4.5 Å from the side chain of Glu-47 in GA. Local side chain rotations occur in HSA upon binding of the fatty acid molecules and the GA module simultaneously. The side chain of Lys-212, which in defatted HSA forms a 3.6-Å salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Glu-208, rotates slightly, pushed by the fatty acid so that its terminal amine group forms a tighter, 2.6-Å ion pair bond to the glutamic acid side chain (Fig. 4B). One molecule of decanoate was also built in fatty acid site 7. To account for density in Sudlow site I, one molecule of citrate was built into this site. Comparison with Previous Binding Experiments—Residues adjacent to the hydrogen bond network at the loop between GA helices 2 and 3 were implicated in albumin binding in the previously reported NMR experiment on an HSA-complexed GA module. The same NMR experiment also suggested that the N terminus of the GA module was involved in binding, which is not visible in the crystal structure. However, because the N terminus of the GA module can be seen participating in crystal packing interactions, a transient association between the GA module and HSA might explain the observed interaction. A Fatty Acid at the Binding Interface—The presence of fatty acid in the HSA-GA binding interface might influence complex formation, although its precise role in that case is not evident because it is not within hydrogen bonding distance from any of the GA module side chains. However, binding of GA might be influenced indirectly, because the binding of the fatty acid causes the side chain of Lys-212 to be pushed aside slightly into a position that allows it to form a hydrogen bond to GA. Whether completely defatted HSA would be able to bind GA is not known. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the presence of a fatty acid is required for or only tolerated in the binding of GA. Structural Basis for Species Specificity—The GA module in this study is homologous to an ABD of protein G of group G streptococci as a result of it being transferred by exon shuffling from protein G to protein PAB. The binding site for protein G on HSA has been suggested to be located on the second and third domain of HSA and involves a single site consisting of a segment spanning residues 330 to 548 (28Falkenberg C. Björck L. Åkerström B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that HSA residues 212, 309, 318, 321, 326, and 329 are important for GA binding, indicating that there is at least partial overlap between the two sites. Despite the high sequence homology between the two domains, the wide species affinity displayed by ABD is not retained in the GA module. Whereas affinities for human and rhesus monkey albumin are similar in GA and ABD, the affinity of GA for mouse albumin is more than a hundred times lower than that of ABD (29Johansson M.U. Frick I.-M. Nilsson H. Kraulis P.J. Hober S. Jonasson P. Linhult M. Nygren P.-A. Uhlén M. Björck L. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Wikström M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8114-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Considering that the interaction in the hydrophobic core of the interface between Phe-27 in the GA module and Met-329 in HSA is crucial, we suggest a structural basis for the difference in species selectivity between ABD and the GA module. A superposition of the α carbons in the structures of ABD (Protein Data Bank entry 1GJS) and GA shows that the phenylalanine in GA position 27 corresponds to Tyr-39 in the ABD (not shown). Furthermore, a sequence alignment of albumins of different species shows that the methionine in HSA position 329 corresponds to polar or charged side chains such as serine and lysine in albumins of other species (Fig. 5). As other interactions at the surface seem to be conserved across species, the bootstrapped hydrophobic Met-Phe interaction emerges as a crucial interaction at the HSA-GA interface, and we stipulate that it plays a major part in the species specificity observed for the GA module compared with that of ABD. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group in Tyr-39 of the ABD domain enables it to interact with the range of polar side chains displayed by the albumins from different species, whereas its GA counterpart, Phe-27, is restricted to interact with a hydrophobic side chain, i.e. methionine in the case of human and rhesus monkey albumin. The superpositioning of the ABD domain and the GA module also reveals that the inserted GA residue Thr-24 is situated in a key position in the hydrogen bond network at the loop between GA helices 1 and 2. It has no counterpart in the ABD domain, and although its interactions with HSA can be conserved for albumins of other species (not shown), the possibility that the inserted residue alters affinity by causing a change in the dynamic properties of the interface residues cannot be excluded. Biological Implications—In 1979, Kronvall et al. (30Kronvall G. Simmons A. Myhre E. Jonsson S. Infect. Immun. 1979; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first described the binding of HSA to bacterial surface structures and found that groups A, C, and G streptococci specifically absorbed HSA from plasma. Subsequently, some strains of F. magna were also found to bind HSA (31Myhre E. J. Med. Microbiol. 1984; 18: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the case of groups C and G streptococci, protein G is responsible for albumin binding, whereas the corresponding protein of F. magna is called PAB. Analysis of the gene encoding protein PAB revealed that the HSA binding domain had been transferred from the protein G gene by the action of a conjugational plasmid from a third bacterial species, Enterococcus faecalis (7de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding represents the first described case of contemporary module shuffling, and the fact that PAB-expressing strains of F. magna are tetracycline resistant 2I.-M. Frick and L. Björck, unpublished results. suggests that antibiotics provide the selective pressure behind the evolution of this novel HSA-binding protein. As mentioned above, F. magna is part of the normal human bacterial flora, but strains that express protein PAB are mostly isolated from patients with localized suppurative infections, suggesting that the binding of HSA to the bacterial surface increases the pathogenic potential of F. magna. The study by de Château et al. (8de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) did indeed show that HSA enhances the growth rate of streptococcal and F. magna strains expressing HSA-binding surface proteins, and the structural data of the present work indicate that the binding of HSA to the GA module could provide growing bacteria with fatty acids and, possibly, other nutrients transported by HSA. Whereas group C and G streptococci infect most mammalian species, F. magna has been isolated only from humans. This finding is reflected also in the albumin binding properties of proteins G and PAB, where protein G has a much broader specificity than PAB, which binds preferentially primate albumins. This observation represents an unusually clear and beautiful example of microbial adaptation to its host(s) at the molecular level. As described in the previous paragraph, the sequence differences between the ABDs of proteins G and PAB and between different albumins, in relation to the HSA-GA interface, help to explain the structural basis for this adaptation. Implications for the Rational Design of Albumin Ligands—In this study we have obtained reasonably well diffracting crystals of HSA that endure cryoconditions during data collection. This might prove useful, especially in the context of minimizing the HSA affinity of drug molecules by structure-based design. We speculate that the readily available, cryo-enduring HSA-GA complex could be an entry point to enabling high throughput structure determination in the study of HSA-drug interactions. Further studies will be performed to investigate the consistency of HSA binding ligands in the presence of the GA module. Based on the molecular interactions in the HSA-GA interface, it might be possible to design and screen for compounds that will interfere with the binding of HSA to bacterial surfaces in vivo. Several observations have shown that the binding of HSA adds selective advantages to the bacteria and increases their virulence, suggesting that such compounds could be used to treat infections caused by HSA binding bacterial pathogens.

We also thank Dr. Karin Valegård and Prof. Janos Hajdu for valuable discussions and help."

Mutations were inserted using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Transcription of cRNAs and handling of oocytes was performed as described previously (19Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar).To generate an inducible stable cell line, a cDNA fragment encoding an NH2-terminal His-tagged hEAAT2 was subcloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/To vector (Invitrogen). Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/To-HisNTEAAT2 and pOG44 (Invitrogen) using the calcium phosphate method, and oligoclonal cell lines were obtained by selection for the antibiotic hygromycin (Invitrogen). After 28 days, hygromycin-resistant clones were picked and tested for uptake of radioactive l-[3H]glutamate after 24 h of incubation with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Six cell lines were positive, and one was used for the experiments reported here.Electrophysiological Examination of Injected Xenopus Oocytes and Stably Transfected Mammalian Cells—EAAT-associated currents in oocytes were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp using a CA1 amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). Oocytes were held at –30 mV, and currents elicited by 200-ms voltage steps between –130 and +40 mV were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized with a sampling rate of 10 kHz using a Digidata AD/DA converter (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The standard external solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the glutamate-containing solution was supplied with 0.5 mm l-glutamate. Anion currents were determined after exchanging the external solution to 96 mm NaSCN, 4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm external glutamate without any current subtraction procedure (12Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anion currents were normalized by dividing current amplitudes by the Glu/Na+/H+/K+ uptake current amplitude measured at –140 mV. Glutamate uptake currents in mammalian cells were measured through standard whole-cell patch clamp recordings using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) amplifier as described previously (12Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized with a sampling rate of 50 kHz using a Digidata (Axon Instruments). Cells were clamped to 0 mV for at least 2 s between test sweeps. The intracellular solution contained 115 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. To elicit glutamate transport-associated currents, cells were moved into a stream of an external solution supplemented with 0.5 mm l-glutamate. The glutamate uptake current was determined as the difference between the current amplitude in the presence and in the absence of glutamate measured at a test step to –175 mV. Data were analyzed using pClamp (Axon Instruments) and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) programs.Purification of [35S]Methionine-labeled Protein Form Xenopus Oocytes and Mammalian Cells—cRNA-injected and non-injected control oocytes were incubated for the indicated time with Revidue™ l-[35S]methionine (>37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at ∼25 MBq/ml (∼0.1 MBq/oocyte) in frog Ringer's solution at 19 °C for metabolic labeling. Either immediately after the pulse or after an additional chase period, the radiolabeled oocytes were extracted with digitonin (1.0%) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. His-tagged proteins were isolated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Köln, Germany) chromatography as detailed previously (19Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) with the modification that iodoacetamide was routinely included at 10 mm and 1 mm in the lysis and washing buffers (20Sadtler S. Laube B. Lashub A. Nicke A. Betz H. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Flp-In T-Rex HEK293 cells stably expressing the His-EAAT2 transporter were cultured at a range of tetracycline concentrations (0–1 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C, then starved for 30 min in methionine- and serum-free minimum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and subsequently metabolically labeled with Revidue™ l-[35S]methionine at ∼4 MBq/ml in methionine- and serum-free minimum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 37 °C. His-EAAT2 was natively purified from digitonin extracts of these cells by Ni2+-NTA chromatography as described above.Chemical Cross-linking—His-tagged proteins bound to Ni2+-NTA beads (packed volume, ∼15 μl) were washed twice with imidazole-free sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.2% digitonin. The Ni2+-NTA beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.2 m triethanolamine/HCl (pH 8.5), 0.5% digitonin. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by adding dimethyl adipimidate (DMA·2HCl, Pierce) or dimethyl suberimidate (DMS·2HCl, Pierce) from a freshly prepared stock solution in distilled water or Me2SO, respectively. After 60 min at the indicated temperature, the cross-linking reaction was terminated by washing the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads once with imidazole-free sodium phosphate buffer, 0.2% digitonin. Bound protein was released from the beads with the non-denaturing elution buffer.SDS-PAGE and Blue Native (BN)-PAGE Analysis—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were denatured for 10 min at 56 °C with SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol and electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow, Amersham Biosciences) on linear SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To investigate the glycosylation status of the proteins, samples were treated for 1–2 h with either endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of reducing SDS sample buffer and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 to counteract SDS inactivation of PNGase F. BN-PAGE was performed as described by Nicke et al. (19Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) immediately after protein purification. Molecular mass markers (Combithek II, Roche Applied Science) were run in two different lanes of the gel and subsequently visualized by Coomassie and silver staining. Gels containing purified ecgltP were stained with silver. Radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using BioMax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –70 °C. Both SDS- and BN-polyacrylamide gels were fixed and dried. For quantification, the dried gels were exposed to a Phosphor-Imager screen and scanned using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Individual bands were quantified with the ImageQuant software.Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution of ecgltP—The pASK-ecgltP construct was generated by subcloning the cDNA encoding ecgltP into a pASK-IBA5 (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) vector to add an NH2-terminal strep tag. Transformed BL-21 (DE-3) E. coli bacteria were induced with 200 μg/l anhydrotetracycline at 37 °C for 2 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C until use. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor. The protein was extracted by solubilization in 15 mm dodecylmaltoside (DDM) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. ecgltP was purified in one step by strep-tactin™ (IBA) affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. Western blots were carried out using a strep-tag AP detection kit™ (IBA) following the manufacturer's instructions.Strep-ecgltP was reconstituted into liposomes using standard methods (21Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Mes, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 6) and incubated for 2 h on ice. The uptake was initiated by diluting 25 μl of the proteoliposomes in 650 μl of buffer B (120 mm Mes, 100 mm NaOH, 5 mm MgSO4, 2 μm l-[3H]glutamate, pH 6) at room temperature (22Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed with vesicles without ecgltP or by diluting the proteoliposomes in 650 μl of buffer A supplemented with 2 μm l-[3H]glutamate. 100-μl probes were taken after various time periods and then poured into a 10-fold excess of ice-cold 0.1 m LiCl solution, followed by immediate filtration over cellulose nitrate filters. After washing with 0.1 m LiCl, filters were assayed for radioactivity.RESULTSHis-tagged hEAAT2 Transporters Exhibit Unaltered Functional Properties—We added an NH2- or a COOH-terminal hexahistidine tag to hEAAT2 and ecgltP to purify the transporters by a single Ni2+-metal affinity chromatography step. To test whether these sequence alterations affect transport functions, WT and His-tagged transporters were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and currents were examined with a two-electrode voltage clamp. We performed experiments in two distinct external anion compositions to separate the current components of the stoichiometrically coupled transport of glutamate Na+, H+, and K+ from the pore-mediated anion conductance. In Cl–-based external solution, the conductance of the hEAAT2-associated anion channel is very small (9Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and the Glu/Na+/H+/K+ current amplitudes can therefore be approximated to the difference between currents in the presence and absence of external glutamate substrate. The so-calculated current amplitudes are similar in magnitude and voltage dependence for WT and His-tagged hEAAT2 (Fig. 1A). In a SCN–-based external solution, hEAAT2 exhibited anion currents that largely exceeded the Glu/Na+/H+/K+ current component allowing to directly measure anion currents (12Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For all tested hEAAT2 constructs, a comparable constitutive anion current was observed in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 1B) that was about 2-fold increased by external glutamate (12Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We conclude that the addition of the His tag does not alter the coupled and the uncoupled current amplitudes of hEAAT2. Neither glutamate-induced inward currents nor glutamate-induced increases of anion currents were observed in oocytes injected with WT or His-tagged ecgltP cRNA.SDS-PAGE Analysis and Glycosylation of Glutamate Transporters Heterologously Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—His-tagged hEAAT2 and ecgltP transporters expressed in Xenopus oocytes were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, extracted with 1% (w/v) digitonin, and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Both proteins expressed at high levels in Xenopus oocytes and were metabolically stable during a sustained chase. When denatured by SDS and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, the hEAAT2 and the ecgltP polypeptides both migrated at 10–20% lower masses than calculated from the amino acid sequences (48 kDa for ecgltP and 63 kDa for hEAAT2) (Fig. 1C). However, a Ferguson analysis determining the apparent molecular mass in SDS-polyacrylamide gels for several acrylamide concentrations (23Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) yielded molecular masses of 46 kDa for the His-tagged ecgltP and 69 kDa for His-hEAAT2 when extrapolated to high acrylamide concentration (Fig. 1D) demonstrating that the observed differences between the apparent and the calculated masses are caused by anomalous migration.Membrane proteins are often N-glycosylated when expressed in eukaryotic cells. As oligosaccharide side chains are sequentially processed from a high mannose form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the complex-glycosylated form in the Golgi apparatus, the presence of complex oligosaccharides can be used to monitor the efficiency of the exit of the protein from the ER. The hEAAT2 sequence encompasses two glycosylation sequences, 206NATS and 216NETV, which are both located on the predicted large ectodomain (residues 143–239) between transmembrane regions TM3 and TM4 (16Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). Complete deglycosylation of newly synthesized hEAAT2 polypeptide in Xenopus oocytes during a 4-h pulse period resulted in a 3-kDa decrease of the molecular mass (Fig. 1E, lanes 1–2), corresponding to the mass of one single N-glycan. Moreover, glutamine substitution of only one of the two asparagine residues resulted in polypeptides migrating at the same position as the WT hEAAT2 (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 5) suggesting that one of the two glycosylation sites remains unused in WT EAAT2 presumably because of the small distance of only 10 amino acids. No mass shift by PNGase F was observed when the asparagines residues of both N-glycosylation sequons were replaced by glutamine (Fig. 1E, lanes 7 and 8).Posttranslational processes during a 36-h chase interval led to the occurrence of a prominent broad band (75–95 kDa) well above that of the core-glycosylated hEAAT2 polypeptide (∼60 kDa) (Fig. 1E). This band could be reduced to the hEAAT2 apoprotein by incubation with PNGase F (∼57 kDa in Fig. 1E, lane 3), but not with Endo H. Resistance to Endo H treatment distinguishes high mannose from complex oligosaccharides and attributes the higher molecular weight band to the mature complex-glycosylated hEAAT2 polypeptide. Quantification by phosphorimaging analysis demonstrated that 66% of the total hEAAT2 protein leaves the ER within the 36-h chase interval. We conclude that the majority of hEAAT2 subunits are in a mature state located in post-ER compartments including the plasma membrane after the chase interval. The prokaryotic ecgltP polypeptide does not exhibit glycosylation sites precluding such an analysis for this particular transporter.hEAAT2 Transporters Migrate as Trimers in Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gels—BN-PAGE analysis (24Schägger H. von Jagow G.

Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or the homotrimeric P2X1 receptor (19Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J.

These molecular masses are well above those of the respective monomers suggesting that hEAAT2 transporters exist exclusively as an homogenous population of multimers in Xenopus oocytes.Fig. 2Oligomeric state of EAAT2 transporters in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells determined by BN-PAGE.A, autoradiography of a BN-polyacrylamide gel containing EAAT2 purified from Xenopus oocytes.

A reliable approach to determine the number of polypeptide chains incorporated in one transporter complex is to dissociate protein complexes into lower order intermediates by weakening non-covalent subunit interactions by heat or low concentrations of SDS (19Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 26Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For hEAAT2, a 1-h incubation at 56 °C both in the presence (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and absence (lane 5) of Coomassie dye generated a ladder-like pattern of three protein bands. Incubation in the additional presence of increasing concentrations of SDS (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10) led to a gradual disappearance of the ∼200-kDa protein and an enhanced appearance of two additional proteins with masses of ∼130 and ∼65 kDa. At ≥0.05% SDS, the ∼65-kDa band became the predominant one (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). Fig. 2B shows PhosphorImager analysis of the gel shown in Fig. 2A. All dissociating conditions caused the appearance of a total of three bands with masses corresponding to the assembly of three, two, and one unit with the monomer becoming the dominant species at increasing SDS concentrations (Fig. 2A). The complex-glycosylated hEAAT2 transporter also exhibits a trimeric structure as revealed by BN-PAGE (data not shown). The virtual absence of aggregated proteins and other multimerization states (Fig. 2) indicates that trimerization of hEAAT2 monomers occurs efficiently in oocytes during or shortly after synthesis of the individual subunits. A productive assembly process is further illustrated by the efficient exit of the hEAAT2 transporters from the ER inferred from the acquisition of complex-type carbohydrates (see above).Oligomerization of EAAT transporters might be affected by the cellular environment or by unphysiologically high expression levels. To address these possibilities, we generated an inducible mammalian cell line that stably expresses NH2-terminal His-tagged hEAAT2 (Fig. 2, C and D). This cell line allowed us to study oligomerization of hEAAT2 at different protein expression levels by simply varying the tetracycline concentration added to the culture medium 24 h prior to the experiment. hEAAT2 transporters expressed in mammalian cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, extracted with 1% (w/v) digitonin, and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Incubation of the cells with inducing tetracycline concentration between 0 and 1000 ng/ml resulted in pronounced changes in the amount of the purified hEAAT2 protein and glutamate uptake currents. BN-PAGE analysis demonstrates that the hEAAT2 protein exists exclusively in a trimeric sta"

The Caenorhabditis elegans gene clk-1 was one of the first reported gerontogenes, i.e. a gene that when mutated increases the life span of the worm. clk-1 mutants appear healthy, but many developmental processes and behavior patterns on a strict biological clock in the wild type are deregulated in the mutant. Hence, the name of the gene; clk stands for clock (1Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lakowski B. Hekimi S.

Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The best known function of ubiquinone is to serve as a redox carrier for two electrons and two protons between complex I or II and complex III of the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane (see Fig. 2) (4Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Regardless of the port of entry, all electrons are normally shuttled through ubiquinone. Ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q (CoQ), is composed of a redox-competent modified benzoquinone headgroup and a lipophilic polyisoprenyl tail (Fig. 1). The number of isoprenyl units forming the tail is species-specific. For C. elegans, this number is 9 (CoQ9, as is the case in mice and rats), whereas the principal species is CoQ8 in Escherichia coli (5Poon W.W. Davis D.E. Ha H.T. Jonassen T. Rather P.N. Clarke C.F.

Electron donor substrates for the respiratory chain are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by different carriers. Pyruvate uses the pyruvate carrier; glutamate uses the amino acid carrier; malate and succinate each use the dicarboxylate carrier. In the matrix, electrons from pyruvate, glutamate, and malate are transferred to NAD+ by substrate-specific dehydrogenases and enter the respiratory chain via complex I. Succinate dehydrogenase is an integral activity of complex II. Electrons from complexes I and II are transferred to complex III by the common shuttle CoQ. The electrons reach oxygen, the terminal acceptor, via cytochrome c and complex IV. Electron transport down the respiratory chain (flat gray arrows) is absolutely linked to proton extrusion by complexes I, III, and IV (flat white arrows). The proton gradient across the inner membrane drives phosphorylation. ATP synthetase allows protons to re-enter the matrix and uses the energy released in this process to synthesize ATP. The substrates for phosphorylation, ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), enter the matrix via the ADP/ATP translocase (adenine nucleotide translocase) and the phosphate carrier. Respiration is high when the ATP synthetase is stimulated by the presence of ADP (state 3) and decreases when ADP is limiting (state 4). In cases in which the inhibition of phosphorylation is the cause for low respiration, respiration can be restored by adding a protonophore (such as DNP), allowing protons to re-enter the matrix without passing through ATP synthetase. The quinol analog DHQ can reduce complex III directly, whereas electrons from ascorbate are shuttled to cytochrome c by the redox carrier TMPD. Both artificial electron donors are useful to bypass substrate and electron transport upstream of coenzyme Q. Measuring respiration thus allows us not only to asses the integral function of mitochondria, but by varying electron donors, ADP conditions, and the use of DNP, it can also be used to locate the site of a mitochondrial defect.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) clk-1 mutants cannot produce CoQ9; instead, they accumulate large quantities of the precursor demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ9) 1The abbreviations used are: DMQ, demethoxyubiquinone; DHQ, duroquinol; RQ, rhodoquinone; ETC, electron transport chain; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; DCIP, dichlorophenol-indophenol; RCR, respiratory control ratio. and small amounts of rhodoquinone (RQ9) as well as dietary CoQ8 from E. coli (6Miyadera H.

In particular, considerable effort has gone into defining the relative contributions of CoQ8 and DMQ9 to electron transport. Nonetheless, it is not yet known which of the quinone species is the mitochondrial electron carrier in clk-1. Initially, it was hypothesized that the clk-1 defect in CoQ9 synthesis prolonged life span by slowing the metabolic rate of the mutant (2Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 2001; 272: 1010-1013Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 3Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, Braeckman et al. (12Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. De Vreese A. Vanfleteren J.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 493-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. Brys K. Lenaerts I. De Vreese A. Van Eygen S. Raes H. Vanfleteren J.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported conflicting results about oxygen consumption of intact clk-1 animals relative to wild type (N2). This discrepancy has not been resolved (14Van Voorhies W.A. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. Vanfleteren J.R. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The overwhelming majority of respiration in animals occurs in mitochondria, yet no measurements have been done of the integrated activity of mitochondria from clk-1 animals. The measurement of oxidative phosphorylation is a test of mitochondrial functional integrity and overall function as it relies on the ability of the organelle to effectively transport substrates, transfer electrons to the electron transport chain, reduce electron acceptors (such as CoQ), and shuttle electrons to their ultimate electron acceptor, oxygen. Measurements done under conditions that require the coupling of the process to the formation of ATP therefore also necessitate an intact mitochondrial membrane. We isolated mitochondria from N2 and clk-1 animals to assess their fully integrated function by measuring oxidative phosphorylation. All of the endogenous components of the electron transport chain (ETC) were present. Using this approach, we found that complex I-dependent oxidative phosphorylation in clk-1 mitochondria is profoundly decreased, whereas complex II-dependent oxidative phosphorylation is normal. The presence of a defect in oxidative phosphorylation represents a change that may explain the aging phenotype of clk-1. To further localize the defect causing the decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, we measured the activity of specific steps of the electron transport chain. We identified a defect in electron transport between complexes I and III of the electron transport chain when the endogenous quinone species were present. By contrast, under the same conditions, electron transport between complexes II and III was normal. We found no difference between N2 and clk-1 in the activity of any of the individual complexes of the ETC. These results indicate a difference in the relationship of complex I and complex II with the pool of quinones present in the long-lived mutant clk-1. The results uncover the potential importance of complex I activity in affecting life span. The power of mutational analysis in a simple animal model opens new avenues for the study of integrated mitochondrial function. Nomenclature—The conventions for C. elegans nomenclature have been followed throughout (16Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene names are italicized three-letter abbreviations followed by a hyphen and a number, e.g. clk-1, the gene. This designation can also specify worms homozygous for a mutation in this gene, e.g. clk-1, the mutant worm. Individual allele names are represented by a combination of one or two letters and a number, either alone or added in parentheses, e.g. as in qm30 or clk-1(qm30). Nematode Culture and Mitochondria Preparation—The wild type strain N2, the missense mutant clk-1(e2519), and the deletion mutant clk-1(qm30) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. Stocks were maintained on nematode growth media (NGM) plates with a lawn of E. coli OP50 as food source. The gram amounts of nematodes necessary for mitochondria preparations were grown in liquid culture and fed with the wild type E. coli, K12. OP50 is a K12-derived uracil auxotroph. Both bacteria strains produce ubiquinone CoQ8. Culture conditions, separation of worms from remaining E. coli, and preparation of mitochondria were performed as described previously (17Kayser E-B. Morgan P.G. Hoppel C.L. Sedensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20551-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Kayser E-B. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M. M Mech. Ageing. Dev. 2004; 125: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oxidative Phosphorylation Assays—Oxygen uptake of intact mitochondria was measured polarigraphically with a Clark electrode as described previously (19Hoppel C.L. DiMarco J. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4164-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The external electron donor substrates malate, glutamate, or pyruvate with malate were used to drive complex I-dependent electron transport. C. elegans mitochondria differ from mammalian mitochondria in that malate is capable of fueling complex I by itself. We have previously reported this in our studies of oxidative phosphorylation in the C. elegans mutant, gas-1 (17Kayser E-B. Morgan P.G. Hoppel C.L. Sedensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20551-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The presence of the gloxylate pathway in C. elegans mitochondria suggests a pathway for respiration of malate (20Liu F. Thatcher J.D. Barral J.M. Epstein H.F. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Liu F. Thatcher J.D. Epstein H.F. Biochem. 1997; 36: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each of the three complex I-dependent substrates employs a different transporter to cross the mitochondrial membrane. Succinate was used as the electron donor for complex II. Succinate uses the same dicarboxylate transporter as malate to cross the mitochondrial membrane (22Chappell J.B. Bucher T. Sies H. Cell Research. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1969: 335-350Google Scholar, 23Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, by comparing the effects of these substrates on oxidative phosphorylation, one can also determine whether the absence of a specific transporter plays a role in causing defects in respiration. Duroquinol (DHQ), an electron donor that supplies electrons directly to complex III, was used to measure the distal steps of electron transport that are common to both complex I- and complex II-dependent electron flow (24Hoppel C.L. Kerr D.S. Dahms B. Roessmann U. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Krahenbuhl S. Talso C. Wiesmann U. Hoppel C.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). At the end of each oxidative phosphorylation experiment, uncoupled respiration through complex IV was measured using N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) (TMPD)/ascorbate. This serves as a quality control for mitochondrial function during every assay performed. ETC Assays—Freshly prepared mitochondria were solubilized with cholate, and zero order rates were determined spectrophotometrically for the following enzyme activities: citrate synthase, rotenone-sensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, antimycin A-sensitive succinate cytochrome c reductase, antimycin A-sensitive decylubiquinol cytochrome c reductase, NADH ferricyanide reductase, rotenone-sensitive NADH decylubiquinone reductase, malonate-sensitive succinate-DCIP reductase, and duroquinone-stimulated malonate-sensitive succinate DCIP reductase. The first order rate constant was determined for cytochrome c oxidase. Assays and calculations were performed as described by Hoppel and co-workers (24Hoppel C.L. Kerr D.S. Dahms B. Roessmann U. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Krahenbuhl S. Talso C. Wiesmann U. Hoppel C.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of note, for complex II, complexes II-III, and succinate dehydrogenase activities, the complexes were exposed to phosphate buffer and additional succinate prior to measuring activity. Progress curves were followed for 10 min to ensure that maximum rates were attained. Statistics—Data are presented in the form of averages with S.D.s of at least three independent mitochondria preparations. Averages are compared using analysis of variance (26Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1968: 271-275Google Scholar). Significance is taken as p < 0.05. The measurement of oxidative phosphorylation provides a unique physiologic tool to examine the integrated function of the intact mitochondrion (Fig. 2). This process requires the function of membrane transporters and substrate dehydrogenases, as well as membrane integrity, a functional ETC, and ATP synthetase. The ratio of state 3 respiration (ADP present) to state 4 respiration (ADP-limiting), termed the respiratory control ratio (RCR), reflects the dependence of oxidation of the mitochondrial substrates upon the availability of the phosphate acceptor, ADP. By varying those substrates that are fuels for NADH formation (malate, glutamate, pyruvate), the different transporters within the inner mitochondrial membrane are assessed, as well as different dehydrogenases that generate NADH. Electrons from NADH enter the ETC at complex I and utilize complexes III and IV (1Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brass E.P. Hiatt W.R. Gardner A.W. Hoppel C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H603-HH609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar manner, succinate oxidation utilizes the mitochondrial dicarboxylate transporter (the same one as malate), but the dehydrogenase is an integral part of complex II. Electrons are then passed through complexes II-IV. Complex V (ATP synthetase) uses the proton gradient formed to drive ATP synthesis. CoQ is the crucial molecule serving as the electron acceptor for either complex I or II, passing electrons from either to complex III. CoQ is considered to be unrestricted in its availability to both complex I and complex II (4Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Malate—Using malate as a substrate, state 3 rates (ADP present in nonlimiting amounts) in mitochondria from two clk-1 alleles, e2519 (missense) and qm30 (deletion), are 22 and 31%, respectively, of those in mitochondria from the wild type (N2) (Table I). State 4 rates are not significantly decreased in clk-1 as compared with N2. In clk-1, “high ADP” rates, determined in the presence of 10 times as much ADP as that used to measure state 3 respiration, are decreased to the same extent as state 3 rates (Table I, Fig. 3A). With malate as the substrate, the RCR of clk-1 is 1.5 as compared with 3.0 for N2 (Table I). The decrease of the RCR results purely from the decrease of state 3 respiration. For complex I-dependent substrates, the functional maximum for ADP/O is about 2.5 (29Hinkle P.C. Kumar M.A. Resetar A. Harris D.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The fact that we measured 2.8 ± 0.3 as the actual ADP/O for wild type mitochondria indicates that our preparation protocol leaves the inner membrane intact. The lack of a clear transition between state 3 and state 4 respiration in clk-1 animals makes determination of the ADP/O ratio less accurate in the mutants. Our previous work with N2 and gas-1 (a complex I mutant) also showed high ADP/O and RCR values, indicating that the isolation procedures do not damage the mitochondrial membrane (9Hihi A.K. Gao Y.

Chem. 2001; 277: 2202-2206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Table IOxidative phosphorylation assayElectron donorconditionclk-1(qm30)clk-1(e2519)N2meanS.D.NmeanS.D.NmeanS.D.N(None)196152091610513MalateState 338*12527*117124306State 425952013643146RCR1.50.251.50.363.00.46ADP/O1.60.251.80.662.80.26GlutamateState 329*7426*557064State 4236419752214RCR1.20.151.40.253.20.44ADP/O1.70.741.50.552.50.24Pyruvate/malateState 343*11536*84146283State 431105261046623RCR1.40.151.50.442.20.43ADP/O1.50.351.50.341.90.43SuccinateState 311027599217139306State 4691955910789196RCR1.60.151.70.271.60.16ADP/O1.10.151.10.371.50.26DHQState 32803652223973231003State 4189285146287196613RCR1.50.151.50.271.60.23ADP/O0.60.150.70.271.10.33TMPD/ascorbate°DNP41310314313592133118614 Open table in a new tab Since respiration and phosphorylation are coupled, low respiratory rates in clk-1 during state 3 or high ADP could result from the inhibition of ATP synthetase or failure of transport of ADP or phosphate into the mitochondrion. However, the addition of the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) to mitochondria did not increase oxygen consumption, neither in the mutants nor in the control (Table I, Fig. 3B). Failure of DNP to release the depressed high ADP respiration in clk-1 rules out a defect in the adenine nucleotide translocase or the ATP synthetase as the underlying mechanism. In order for malate to generate NADH, the mitochondrial membrane dicarboxylate transporter must transport malate into the mitochondrial matrix in which malate dehydrogenase transfers electrons to NAD+ to generate NADH (Fig. 2). The depression seen when using malate as a substrate could occur at either of these steps or downstream in the electron transport chain. To determine whether the malate transporter or dehydrogenase was defective, we substituted glutamate or pyruvate plus malate as substrates. Both of these substrates also generate NADH, but each is dependent on a different transporter and dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). Glutamate—When glutamate was used as a substrate, state 3 rates for both clk-1 alleles, e2519 and qm30, were depressed (37 and 41% of normal, respectively), whereas state 4 respiration remained roughly the same (Table I). High ADP rates with glutamate were also depressed as seen for malate (Fig. 3A). DNP-uncoupled rates, as well as the coupling parameters RCR and ADP/O, were also similar between the two substrates (Table I, Fig. 3B). Pyruvate—A third complex I-specific donor, pyruvate, uses a third transporter and dehydrogenase. When pyruvate was used as a substrate, state 3 rates for both clk-1 alleles, e2519 and qm30, were depressed (to 25 and 29% of normal, respectively). The data for pyruvate are similar to those for glutamate and for malate (Table I, Fig. 3). Since oxidative phosphorylation is decreased for all three substrates, specific membrane transporters or dehydrogenases are eliminated as causative for the changes seen in clk-1 mitochondria. Again, uncoupling studies indicate that the defect is not in the adenine nucleotide translocase or in the ATP synthetase. Rather, the inhibition must lie downstream of the production of NADH, i.e. in the electron transport chain. Succinate—Succinate is the specific substrate for complex II and uses the same dicarboxylate transporter as malate (22Chappell J.B. Bucher T. Sies H. Cell Research. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1969: 335-350Google Scholar, 23Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Results for succinate (Table I, Fig. 1) show that rates for state 3, high ADP, and state 4 respiration are not significantly decreased in clk-1 as compared with rates for N2. These results also confirm that the dicarboxylate transporter is not the cause of the decrease seen with malate as a substrate. All other parameters of respiration, including measurements of coupling (RCR and ADP/O), are similar for clk-1 and N2. Thus, clk-1 mitochondria are capable of normal complex II-dependent respiration. These results indicate that the integrated function of complex II, quinones, and complexes III, IV, and V is normal. The coupling results also indicate that the inner mitochondrial membrane of the mutant is intact and that the isolation procedure did not selectively damage the clk-1 mitochondria in any functional manner. Duroquinol—The reduced form of the CoQ analog duroquinone (DHQ or duroquinol) donates electrons directly into the respiratory chain at complex III, thus bypassing all upstream elements of the respiratory chain, including complex I, complex II, and endogenous quinone species. Using DHQ as an electron donor, none of the measured parameters shows a marked difference between mitochondria from clk-1 and N2 (Fig. 1, Table I). Thus, the inhibition of electron transport seen with the complex I-dependent electron donors must occur upstream of complex III. Data obtained with DHQ are consistent with the results obtained with the complex II-dependent substrate, succinate. TMPD/Ascorbate—TMPD donates electrons to the respiratory chain via cytochrome c. TMPD/ascorbate was added at the end of each oxidative phosphorylation assay (after uncoupling with DNP). The resulting respiration rates were similar in clk-1 mutants to those observed in N2 (Table I), indicating that, for this point of entry, electron transport capacities are equal for the mutants and wild type. The defect seen with malate, glutamate, and pyruvate is therefore located upstream of cytochrome c, congruent with the results for duroquinol and succinate. Cytochrome c is easily lost from mitochondria with damaged outer membranes. High respiration rates with TMPD/ascorbate without added external cytochrome c are therefore another indicator that our preparation leaves the mitochondria intact. Furthermore, assuming that the respiration rate with TMPD/ascorbate is limited by the amount of cytochrome c in the assay, this rate can be used as a measure for the actual amount of mitochondria in each assay. The above results unequivocally demonstrate a profound functional defect in integrated oxidative phosphorylation in clk-1 when NADH is the electron donor. The clk-1 gene is required for the biosynthesis of CoQ9, which is expected to transport electrons from both complex I and complex II to complex III. However, the identified defect is only associated with complex I, whereas the integrated function of complexes II-V is normal. To dissect the molecular basis of this defect, we measured the activities of individual components of the ETC. It is important to note that the following studies of the ETC complement the studies of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation represents the intact, fully integrated function of the mitochondria with endogenous quinone species. The ETC studies localize the defects seen in oxidative phosphorylation by assaying specific mitochondrial components. Classically, characterization of the electron transport chain is done in several steps. First is the use of primary assays. Citrate synthase and complex IV are used as primary mitochondrial marker enzymes. Secondly, the two arms of the initial part of the electron transport chain, complexes I-III and complexes II and III, are studied. Citrate Synthase—Citrate synthase is a soluble enzyme of the mitochondrial matrix and serves as a mitochondrial marker for an intact inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria isolated from mutant animals were comparable with those from wild type animals in citrate synthase activity (Table II) and did not suffer damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane with resulting leakage of the matrix.Table IIMitochondrial marker enzymesEnzymatic activityclk-1(qm30)clk-1(e2519)N2meanS.D.NmeanS.D.NMeanS.D.NSuccinate dehydrogenase62*19559*2092523Cytochrome c oxidase235805159269233183Citrate synthase145048051430260915503903 Open table in a new tab Complex IV—Complex IV activity was measured as the first order rate constant. As compared with the activity in N2, it was normal for qm30 and e2519 (Table II). Thus, the downstream portions of the ETC are normal in clk-1. Complexes I-III—Electron transport from complex I to complex III via endogenous quinones is measured as rotenone-sensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity (Fig. 4). This activity in the clk-1 mutants is only 20% that of N2 (Fig. 5). The percentage of decrease of electron transport for complexes I-III is similar to the decrease seen in the complex I-dependent oxidative phosphorylation assays in clk-1 mitochondria. Thus, by two independent methods, complex I-dependent function, using endogenous quinones, is defective.Fig. 5Electron transport chain assay. Mitochondria from clk-1(qm30), clk-1(e2519), and wild type N2 were solubilized with cholate, and electron transport activities were measured as follows: I-III, rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase; II-III, antimycin A-sensitive succinate-cytochrome c reductase; I, rotenone-sensitive NADH-decylubiquinone reductase; II, malonate-sensitive succinate-DCIP reductase using either the endogenous quinone s"
https://openalex.org/W2126094269,"Human mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the oxidative phosphorylation system is a multiprotein assembly comprising both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded subunits. Deficiency of this complex is associated with numerous clinical syndromes ranging from highly progressive, often early lethal encephalopathies, of which Leigh disease is the most frequent, to neurodegenerative disorders in adult life, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Parkinson disease. We show here that the cytosolic Ca2+ signal in response to hormonal stimulation with bradykinin was impaired in skin fibroblasts from children between the ages of 0 and 5 years with an isolated complex I deficiency caused by mutations in nuclear encoded structural subunits of the complex. Inhibition of mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange by the benzothiazepine CGP37157 completely restored the aberrant cytosolic Ca2+ signal. This effect of the inhibitor was paralleled by complete restoration of the bradykinin-induced increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and ensuing ATP production. Thus, impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during agonist stimulation is a major consequence of human complex I deficiency, a finding that may provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches to this disorder.

Several hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of OXPHOS diseases have been investigated of which the most consistent are (a) increased production of reactive oxygen species (9Pitkänen S. Robinson B.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), (b) decreased potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane (10Moudy A.M. Handran S.D.

In agreement with the reactive oxygen species hypothesis (a), we found that metallothioneins were up-regulated in all of the genetically characterized complex I-deficient cell lines (14Van der Westhuizen F.H. van den Heuvel L.P.

Pilot experiments with these cell lines furthermore revealed that human complex I deficiency was associated with altered cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis. This encouraged us to undertake a detailed analysis of ATP production and calcium handling in a skin fibroblast cell line derived from a Leigh disease patient harboring a homozygous missense mutation (G364A) in the nuclear NDUFS7 gene (4Triepels R.H. van den Heuvel J.P.

Expression of this specific mutation in Yarrowia lipolytica confirmed the deleterious effect on complex I enzyme activity (15Ahlers P.M. Garofano A. Kerscher S.J. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The human NDUFS7 protein is one of the most conserved subunits of complex I and plays a central role in the interaction with the electron acceptor ubiquinone and in the proton-translocating mechanism (16Weidner U. Geier S. Ptock A. Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Ahlers P.M. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol.

Here we show that altered cytosolic Ca2+ handling in complex I-deficient cells with a mutation in the NDUFS7 gene is associated with reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and consequent ATP synthesis. An acute rescue of the defects was achieved following treatment with CGP37157, a benzothiazepine specifically inhibiting mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Chemicals—Culture material was obtained from Invitrogen, and fluorescent dyes were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). CGP37157 was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Avonmouth, Bristol, UK), and all other reagents were from Sigma. Patient Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts were derived from skin biopsies of four healthy subjects and eight patients in the age range of 0–5 years in whom an isolated enzymatic complex I deficiency had been confirmed in both muscle tissue and cultured fibroblasts.

Skin fibroblasts were cultured in M199 medium containing 5 mg/liter Tween 20 and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Fluorescence Imaging of Cytosolic Ca2+—Fibroblasts were seeded on 22-mm glass coverslips, grown to subconfluence for 24 h, and loaded with Fura-2 in the presence of 3 μm Fura-2/AM for 25 min at 37 °C. After removal of excess dye, the coverslip was mounted in a thermostatic (37 °C) perfusion chamber placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot). Dynamic video imaging was carried out using the MagiCal hardware and Tardis software as described previously (18Koopman W.J.H. Bosch R.R. van Emst-de Vries S.E. Spaargaren M. De Pont J. J. H.H.M.

Cells were perfused with Hepes-Tris medium (132 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), supplemented with an amino acid mixture according to Eagle, and challenged with 1 μm bradykinin to increase the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]C). The Fura-2 fluorescence emission ratio at 492 nm was monitored as a measure of [Ca2+]C after alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The kinetics with which the fluorescence emission ratio decreased was fitted to a monoexponential equation, R(t) = R(t = 0)·e–λ· t + R(P), where λ is the decay constant (in s) and R(P) is the poststimulatory level to which R declines. From λ the half-time (t½) was calculated using the equation t½ (s) = –ln(0.5)·λ. Luminescence Monitoring of Cytosolic ATP, Endoplasmic Reticular Ca2+, and Mitochondrial Ca2+and ATP—Because primary human skin fibroblasts are refractory to most conventional transfection protocols, we used an adenoviral system to express mitochondrially targeted aequorin (AdCMVmAq), mitochondrially targeted luciferase (AdCMVmLuc), and cytosolic luciferase (AdCMVcLuc) (19Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S162-S170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a baculoviral system was used to express endoplasmic reticulum-targeted aequorin (BvCMVeAq). The latter system, which is normally used for protein production in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 insect cells, was made suitable for protein expression in mammalian cells by first removing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase polyadenylation signal from the pFastBacTMDual vector (Invitrogen) using AccI and XhoI, by next, after blunting and ligation, removing both the p10 and polyhedron promoter with SmaI and XbaI, and by replacing it with the coding region of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter digested from the pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen) using NruI and XbaI. Finally, the cDNA of ER-targeted aequorin was digested from the erAEQmut/pcDNA1 vector described by Montero et al. (21Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with KpnI and NsiI and ligated behind the CMV promoter in the KpnI and PstI restriction sites of the modified baculovirus vector. Approximately 25,000 cells were spotted on a 13-mm coverslip, and after 24 h cells were infected with the appropriate virus and cultured for another 48 h. In case of baculoviral infection, the culture medium contained 1.75 mm sodium butyrate for proper expression of the photoprotein. Luciferase luminescence was monitored continuously using a photomultiplier tube (Thorn EMI Electron tubes, Ruislip, Middlesex, UK) (19Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were perfused (2 ml·min–1) with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (KRB; 140 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) containing 5 μm beetle luciferin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C. Emitted light was collected with a photoncounting board using the supplier's software (Thorn EMI) (22Rutter G.A. Theler J.M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Light output was recorded at 1-s intervals after which the traces were smoothed off-line by using a 5-point moving average (Origin Pro 6.1, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Typically, light output from a coverslip of virally infected fibroblasts was 1,000–25,000 counts·s–1versus a background of 10 counts·s–1. The same system was used to monitor aequorin luminescence. Mitochondrial aequorin was reconstituted with 5 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes) in KRB for 1 h at 37 °C. Light output was recorded at 1-s intervals, and at the end of each experiment the signal was calibrated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin and 10 mm CaCl2 to determine the total photoprotein content. Aequorin photon emission was converted off-line into [Ca2+] values using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wild-type aequorin (23Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For measurements of endoplasmic reticulum aequorin, we first reduced the Ca2+ content of this organelle by incubating the cells with a reversible inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPase, BHQ (10 μm), in Ca2+-free KRB (no CaCl2 added and 0.5 mm EGTA present) for 10 min. After washing, endoplasmic reticulum aequorin was reconstituted with 5 μm coelenterazine n (Molecular Probes) in Ca2+-free KRB containing 10 μm BHQ for 1.5 h at room temperature. Next, the glass coverslip was placed in the luminometer, and cells were initially perfused with Ca2+-free KRB for 5 min at 37 °C to remove BHQ. To determine the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)-mediated Ca2+ uptake activity, cells were perfused with a Ca2+-free intracellular medium (10 mm Hepes, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, pH 7.05) containing 20 μg/ml saponin for 2 min at 37 °C to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (24van de Put F.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake into the ER was started by perfusing with intracellular medium containing 0.55 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 μm). The luminescence data were calibrated as described previously by Alvarez and Montero (25Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔψM)— Fibroblasts were loaded with 0.5 μm JC-1 for 10 min. Next, coverslips (22 mm) were mounted in a perfusion chamber and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 M, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×40, 1.3 NA F Fluar objective. Cells were perfused with KRB. JC-1 was excited at 488 nm using a monochromator (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Fluorescence light was directed by a 505DRLPXR dichroic mirror (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) through either a 535AF26 (JC-1 monomers, green emission) or a 565ALP emission filter (JC-1 aggregates, red emission) (Omega) onto a CoolSNAP HQ monochrome CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Vianen, The Netherlands). All hardware was controlled with Metafluor 6.0 software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA) running under Windows XP Professional on a personal computer equipped with 1-gigabyte random access memory (RAM). Images were digitalized, and the amount of J-aggregates/cell was automatically counted using Image Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Determination of ATP Levels in Cell Homogenates—Pellets containing ∼300,000 cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline on ice. For determination of the total ATP content, a commercial kit was used based on luciferase (Roche Applied Science). Bioluminescence signals were measured with a Berthold MicroLumat Plus LB 96-V luminometer and expressed per mg of protein as determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Data Analysis—Numerical values were visualized using Origin Pro 6.1 (OriginLab Corporation), and values from multiple experiments were expressed as average ± S.E. Statistical significances were assessed by Student's t test. Impaired Cytosolic Ca2+Handling in Complex I-deficient Human Fibroblasts—The present study was aimed at establishing the consequences of complex I deficiency on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the context of the genetic background of the patient. Skin fibroblasts from four control individuals and eight patients with isolated enzymatic complex I deficiency caused by nuclear DNA mutations were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 for monitoring of the bradykinin-induced changes in [Ca2+]C in individual cells using digital imaging microscopy. An increase in [Ca2+]C is reported by an increase in the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensities at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Control fibroblasts displayed resting emission ratios of 0.48 ± 0.02 (n = 24), 0.48 ± 0.02 (n = 31), 0.54 ± 0.03 (n = 30), and 0.52 ± 0.02 (n = 29) that were not significantly different between the four individuals. Immediately after stimulation with bradykinin (1 μm) the cells displayed a sharp rise in [Ca2+]C (see also Fig. 3D). Maximum increases in the emission ratio were 4.47 ± 0.15 (n = 24), 4.71 ± 0.19 (n = 31), 4.89 ± 0.19 (n = 30), and 4.74 ± 0.15 (n = 29) × base line and did not statistically differ. The amplitude of the [Ca2+]C rise was independent of extracellular Ca2+, demonstrating that Ca2+ ions entered the cytosolic compartment from the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ store. After having reached its maximum, [Ca2+]C more gradually declined again to prestimulatory levels. The decrease in fluorescence emission ratio was fitted monoexponentially, and half-times (t½) were 12.6 ± 0.5s(n = 24), 13.4 ± 0.5 s (n = 31), 13.4 ± 0.5 s (n = 30), and 14.1 ± 0.6 s (n = 29), suggesting the involvement of one major Ca2+ removal process. The t½ values did not significantly differ between the four healthy individuals. On average, control fibroblasts (n = 114) displayed an emission ratio of 0.50 ± 0.01 at rest that increased to 4.71 ± 0.09 × base line following stimulation with bradykinin and subsequently decreased with a t½ of 13.4 ± 0.3 s. Patient and control fibroblasts did not differ with respect to the resting [Ca2+]C (see also Fig. 3D). However, the bradykinin-induced peak increase in [Ca2+]C was significantly decreased in four patients, whereas the rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal was significantly, but to a variable degree, slowed down in all patients as indicated by an increase in half-time (Fig. 1). Fibroblasts with a mutation in either the NDUFS4 (Fig. 1, C316T; n = 23 and n = 18 for patients a and b, respectively) or NDUFS7 (G364A; n = 21) gene displayed both a marked reduction in peak [Ca2+]C (∼20%; p < 0.001) and a large increase in t½ (1.6-fold; p < 0.001). The NDUFS1 mutation (C1668T/G1854A; n = 16) showed a moderate reduction in peak height (∼10%; p < 0.05) and a moderate increase in t½ (1.3-fold; p < 0.001), whereas the two NDUFS2 mutations, C686A (n = 20) and T1237C (n = 22), displayed only a moderate increase in t½ (1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively; p < 0.001). Finally, the NDUFS4 (471 AAGTC insertion; n = 31); and NDUFV1 (C175T/C1268T; n = 20) mutations displayed a small increase in t½ (1.1-fold; p < 0.05) and no change in peak height. A significant (p < 0.01) correlation was observed between peak height and Ca2+ removal rate, indicating a common cause for their reduction in human complex I deficiency (Fig. 1). Because of the marked effects observed with fibroblasts carrying a G364A mutation in the NDUFS7 gene, we used these cells in a series of experiments conducted to gain insight into the mechanism(s) underlying the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ handling in human complex I deficiency. Reduced Filling State of the Endoplasmic Reticular Ca2+Store in Unstimulated Complex I-deficient Fibroblasts—The bradykinin-induced [Ca2+]C transients in fibroblasts are likely to be shaped mainly by the relative rates of (i) Ca2+ release from the ER into the cytoplasm, (ii) Ca2+ uptake and subsequent release by mitochondria, and (iii) cytosolic Ca2+ removal via SERCAs and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases. To investigate whether the ER Ca2+ content is altered in resting patient fibroblasts with a G364A mutation in the NDUFS7 gene, cells were loaded with Fura-2 and subsequently treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Measurements were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to prevent capacitative Ca2+ entry in response to Ca2+ store depletion. Ionomycin (1 μm) transiently increased [Ca2+]C in both control and patient fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The area under the peak was ∼20% lower in patient fibroblasts (Fig. 2A, 79 ± 2%, n = 19; p < 0.001), indicating that the Ca2+ content of the ER is significantly reduced in complex I deficiency. Reduction of the ER Ca2+ content may point to a decreased rate of Ca2+ uptake or an increased rate of Ca2+ leakage. To determine possible differences in SERCA number and/or transport properties, fibroblasts expressing ER-targeted aequorin were first permeabilized with saponin in a Ca2+-free intracellular medium containing 2.5 mm ATP. Next, SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake was started by increasing the free [Ca2+] of the perfusion medium to 0.1 μm, which equals the cytosolic free [Ca2+] in unstimulated cells. Both control and patient fibroblasts showed a rapid increase in [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2B). The maximal rate of [Ca2+]ER increase was not different between control (13 ± 1 μm·s–1, n = 6) and patient (12 ± 1 μm·s–1, n = 6) fibroblasts. Similarly, the peak [Ca2+]ER, which was reached after ∼60 s, was not different between control (442 ± 22 μm, n = 6) and patient fibroblasts (449 ± 17 μm, n = 6). These findings demonstrate that under conditions in which ATP is not rate-limiting, both the SERCA activity and the physical size of the ER Ca2+ store are the same for control and patient fibroblasts. To address the possibility that Ca2+ leakage from the ER is increased in patient fibroblasts, cells were loaded with Fura-2 and subsequently treated with the SERCA inhibitor BHQ in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both in control and patient fibroblasts, BHQ (10 μm) evoked an immediate increase in [Ca2+]C (Fig. 2C). The maximal rate of [Ca2+]C increase was not significantly different between control (0.016 ± 0.001 arbitrary unit·s–1, n = 13) and patient (0.016 ± 0.001 arbitrary unit·s–1, n = 16) fibroblasts. In contrast, the peak [Ca2+]C was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in patient (1.42 ± 0.01 × base line) as compared with control fibroblasts (1.58 ± 0.01 × base line). The latter finding is compatible with a decreased ER Ca2+ content in resting complex I-deficient fibroblasts. Finally, measurement of the total ATP content in whole cell lysates using a luciferase-based assay revealed a small (5%) but statistically insignificant decrease in patient fibroblasts (p = 0.08; n = 4 for both control and patient fibroblasts). Decreased Mitochondrial Ca2+Accumulation in Bradykinin-stimulated Complex I-deficient Fibroblasts—It has been shown previously that agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]C lead to parallel increases in the total (26Assimacopolous-Jeannet F.

Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) concentration of Ca2+ in mitochondria ([Ca2+]M). To investigate whether mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is altered in complex I deficiency, patient fibroblasts were infected with adenoviruses expressing mitochondrially targeted aequorin. The cells (∼25,000) were challenged with 1 μm bradykinin, and the changes in [Ca2+]M were monitored. The peak increase in [Ca2+]M, which was observed at ∼12 s after the onset of stimulation, was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased from 4.23 ± 0.21 μm (n = 6) in control cells to 3.36 ± 0.20 μm (n = 6) in patient cells (Fig. 3A). The t½ values of the [Ca2+]M decrease did not differ between control (6.0 ± 0.5 s) and patient (6.5 ± 0.3 s) fibroblasts. Pretreatment of the cells with the protonophore FCCP (1 μm, 2 min) completely abolished the bradykinin-induced increase in [Ca2+]M. In contrast, the drug inhibited the bradykinin-induced peak increase in [Ca2+]C only by 25% (see also Fig. 4A). This demonstrates that aequorin was exclusively present in the mitochondrial compartment. Reduced Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Complex I-deficient Fibroblasts—Studies using suspensions of isolated mitochondria have suggested that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is mediated by an electrogenic “low affinity” uniporter (K0.5 = 5–10 μm) driven by the large electrical gradient (ΔψM ≈ –160 mV) created by the respiratory chain (29Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar).

The gene affected in this disorder is UBE3A, the gene encoding the E6-associated protein (E6AP) ubiquitin-protein ligase. Most patients have chromosomal deletions that remove the entire maternal allele of UBE3A. However, a small subset of patients have E6AP point mutations that result in single amino acid changes or short in-frame deletions that still allow translation of a full-length protein. By studying these point mutations in E6AP, we found a strong correlation between Angelman-associated mutations and a loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Interestingly the point mutations affect E6AP activity in different ways. Some mutant proteins cannot form thiol ester intermediates with ubiquitin, others retain the thiol ester formation activity but cannot efficiently transfer ubiquitin to a substrate, and still others are unstable in cells. Our results suggest that the loss of E6AP catalytic activity and likely the improper regulation of E6AP substrate(s) are important in the development of Angelman syndrome.

The UBE3A locus is imprinted in certain regions of the brain such that only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed (4Albrecht U. Sutcliffe J.S. Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Armstrong D. Eichele G.

Approximately 70% of patients possess maternal specific deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, which encompasses the UBE3A locus, 3-4% of patients have two paternal copies of the chromosome, and another 3-4% have defects in which the maternal chromosome possesses the paternal imprint such that no functional maternal copy of UBE3A is present in brain (1Laan L.A. van Haeringen A. Brouwer O.F. Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1999; 101: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Although the deletion of other genes in 15q11-13, such as the γ-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter receptor β genes, may contribute to the severity of Angelman symptoms (7DeLorey T.M. Handforth A. Anagnostaras S.G. Homanics G.E. Minassian B.A. Asatourian A. Fanselow M.S. Delgado-Escueta A. Ellison G.D. Olsen R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the identification of UBE3A point mutations in numerous patients provides the most compelling evidence for E6AP being the Angelman gene (2Kishino T.

The majority of these mutations result in frameshifts and/or premature truncations, but some are missense mutations or short in-frame deletions that still allow the translation of a full-length (or nearly full-length) protein (8Malzac P. Webber H. Moncla A. Graham J.M. Kukolich M. Williams C. Pagon R.A. Ramsdell L.A. Kishino T. Wagstaff J. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 1999; 8: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).E6AP was initially identified as the cellular factor that cooperates with the human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein to stimulate the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 (10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In this process, the E6·E6AP complex comprises the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in a ubiquitin thiol ester cascade (11Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). E6AP was the first identified member of a family of ubiquitin ligases called hect proteins, all of which contain a domain homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (12Huibregtse J. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). These are modular proteins in which the conserved hect domains catalyze ubiquitin transfer, whereas other divergent domains confer substrate specificity.Because E6AP is a ubiquitin ligase, it is likely that the improper regulation of E6AP substrate(s) causes Angelman syndrome, although no disease-relevant E6AP targets have yet been identified. Recent structural data show that several of the Angelman-associated point mutations actually map to the E6AP catalytic cleft (13Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and may affect E6AP ubiquitin ligase activity. Other Angelman-associated point mutations map to the E6AP amino terminus and are outside the catalytic domain. These mutations might affect E6AP in a manner distinct from ubiquitin transfer perhaps by compromising substrate binding, altering E6AP subcellular localization, or destabilizing the protein. To determine whether the loss of E6AP catalytic activity correlates with Angelman syndrome, we examined the activities of the non-truncating point mutations identified in Angelman patients.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification—His6-E6AP (wild type and mutant) baculoviruses were generated using the BaculoGold system (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E6AP proteins were purified from two T175 flasks (Corning) of baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Pharmingen)). Lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the lysates were incubated with a 200-μl bed volume of Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with 20 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm DTT) and 20 column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted in 0.1-ml fractions of the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled; dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT; concentrated in Centricon YM-30 devices (Amicon); and stored at -80 °C.UbcH7 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Midlog phase cultures (2 liters) were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 26 °C. Cells were pelleted and frozen at -80 °C. Pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in 25 ml of TDE (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated until bacteria were lysed. MgCl2 and DNase were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and 20 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated until DNA was digested. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 30 min) and passed over Q Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TDE. The flow-through was then loaded onto S Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TDE. UbcH7 was eluted stepwise with TDE containing increasing concentrations of NaCl, and UbcH7-containing fractions were concentrated in a Centricon YM-10 device (Amicon). UbcH7 was further purified on a Superdex 200 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, and 125 mm NaCl. UbcH7-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated as above, and frozen in 10% glycerol. E1 was purchased from Boston Biochem Inc. Ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma.GST-hect proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Midlog phase cultures (500 ml) were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 15 °C. Lysates were prepared as above. Soluble proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a 500-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Beads were washed with 200 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT. GST-HA hect wild type was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The GST tags were removed from the MYC-hect proteins by cleaving with Precission protease (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved proteins were dialyzed in TDE and further purified by gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with TDE buffer. Pooled fractions were concentrated and frozen as above.In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—HHR23A was in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega). Assays were done in 50-μl volumes containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 2 μl of in vitro translated HHR23A, ∼20 ng of E1, 125 ng of UbcH7, 300 ng of insect-cell expressed E6AP, and 4 μg of bovine ubiquitin. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and stopped in Laemmli buffer.For assays using in vitro translated E6AP, His6-E6AP was translated from pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) with or without [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in 50-μl volumes. The lysate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a 30-μl bed volume of Q Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TDE. Beads were washed five times with 500 μl of TDE containing 20 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with TDE containing 500 mm NaCl. The lysate was adjusted to 10 mm imidazole, and the proteins were incubated with a 10-μl bed volume of Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) equilibrated in the same buffer. Beads were washed five times with 500 μl of TDE containing 1 m NaCl and then three times with 500 μl of TDE containing 50 mm NaCl. Ubiquitylation reactions were performed as above except that they contained either one-tenth or one-fourth of the bead-bound E6AP as the E3 source, and the reactions were rotated for 2 h at 30 °C.Thiol Ester Assay—E6AP hect domains were in vitro translated from pET23a in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Assays were done in 50-μl volumes containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 5 μl of the in vitro translated hect domain, ∼20 ng of E1, 125 ng of UbcH7, and 4 μg of bovine ubiquitin. Reactions were incubated for 1, 2, and 4 min; split in two; and stopped in reducing (25 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) or non-reducing (25 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 4 m urea, 10% glycerol) buffer as described previously (14Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase Experiments—E6AP-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (15Miura K. Kishino T. Li E. Webber H. Dikkes P. Holmes G.L. Wagstaff J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar) stably expressing wild type or mutant E6AP were plated in 6-well dishes. The cells were starved in medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 1 h before being pulsed with the same medium supplemented with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for an additional hour. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and chased in medium containing excess cold methionine and cysteine for 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. Cells were harvested in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (prepared as above), and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay reagent (Bio-Rad). 500 μg of each lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-E6AP antiserum, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography.Plasmid Preparations—A plasmid for E6AP isoform III in the pGEM-1 vector has been described (17Kao W.H. Beaudenon S.L. Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6408-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All mutants were generated by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using E6AP/pGEM-1 as a template. Primers used for mutagenesis are available by request. E6AP and mutants were excised from pGEM-1 by digesting with BamHI and HindIII. The fragments were ligated into BamHI/HindIII-digested pIND (Invitrogen). The NotI/PmeI fragment was then ligated into pAcHLT-A (Pharmingen) for baculovirus production. For mammalian expression and in vitro translation, E6AP constructs were excised from pIND (Invitrogen) using BamHI and PmeI and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRV sites of pDNA4/HisMax-C (Invitrogen).Wild type E6AP hect domain with an amino-terminal MYC or HA tag was generated from the E6AP/pGEM-1 template by PCR and encoded from residue 491 to the end (according to E6AP isoform I) of the hect domain. The amplified products were digested with BamHI/SmaI and ligated into pET23a (Novagen). The MYC-tagged C820A and Angelman mutant fragments were amplified from the E6AP/pIND templates by PCR, cut with BamHI/SmaI, and ligated into the BamHI/HincII sites of pET23a (Novagen) and the BamHI/SmaI sites of pGEX 6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for in vitro translations and bacterial expression, respectively. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing.For stable cell lines, all E6AP constructs were cloned as follows. The BamHI/NotI fragments were excised from the pcDNA4 constructs described above and ligated into the BamHI/NotI sites of pBluescript (Stratagene). The SalI/NotI fragments were then ligated to the XhoI/NotI sites of pOZ-C, which also contains the interleukin-2 receptor gene under control of an internal ribosomal entry site. Cells were transduced with retroviruses, and stably expressing cells were sorted using magnetic beads (Dynal) coated with anti-interleukin-2 antibody.Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly E6AP constructs were cloned into the SalI/NotI sites of pPC97 such that they were fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. HHR23A and UbcH7 cloned into pPC86 and fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain have been described previously (18Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Yeast were co-transformed with two of the plasmids by the lithium acetate procedure and selected by plating on SD-Leu-Trp-. Single colonies were then grown in SDLeu-Trp- broth to midlog phase, and aliquots in 10-fold dilutions were spotted on both SD-Leu-Trp- and SD-Leu-Trp-His-.E2 Binding/Competition Assay—Bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) was biotinylated using the BiotinTag microbiotinylation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 0.5 μg of GST-HA hect wild type (WT) was used in ubiquitylation assays performed as described above with the following exceptions: the ubiquitin was biotinylated, the reaction time was 30 min, and the assays were performed in the presence of increasing amounts of competitor protein, 0.3, 1, or 3 μg of bovine serum albumin or MYC-hect (WT or mutant) in which the GST was removed by cleavage with Precission protease (Amersham Pharmacia). Reactions were stopped in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized with Extravidin-peroxidase (Sigma) and anti-MYC antibody (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA).RESULTSThere Is a Strong Correlation between Angelman-associated Mutations and the Loss of E6AP Ubiquitin Ligase Activity—E6AP ubiquitylation activity consists of several discrete steps. E6AP must bind to an E2 enzyme, accept ubiquitin from the E2 in the form of a thiol ester linkage, and transfer the ubiquitin to a substrate (14Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We first tested whether the Angelman-associated E6AP point mutants could ubiquitylate a model substrate, reasoning that E6AP mutants that retained this activity must be able to bind to E2 enzymes and form ubiquitin thiol esters. Mutants impaired in substrate ubiquitylation were then studied further to determine the biochemical activity affected by the mutation.To examine E6AP ubiquitin ligase activity, we performed in vitro ubiquitylation assays using full-length wild type and mutant E6AP proteins purified from insect cells (Fig. 1). The in vitro substrate was HHR23A, which had been identified previously as an E6AP-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (19Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled HHR23A was generated by in vitro translation in wheat germ extract, which lacks endogenous E6AP activity (20Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The addition of wild type E6AP to the reaction induced the formation of a high molecular weight ladder of HHR23A (Fig. 1A, lane 2), whereas addition of the catalytically inactive C820A mutant E6AP (14Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) had no effect (Fig. 1A, lane 3).To compare the activities of the Angelman-associated E6AP point mutants to the wild type protein (Fig. 1B), we performed ubiquitylation assays using the amount of E6AP equivalent to the lowest concentration of wild type E6AP needed to catalyze the conversion of 99% of the HHR23A starting material into ubiquitylated forms. The positions of the mutants are shown schematically in Fig. 1B. Most of the Angelman-associated mutations lie within the carboxyl-terminal hect domain of the protein, whereas two lie in the non-catalytic amino-terminal portion. We predicted that the former mutations might affect E6AP enzymatic activity, whereas the amino-terminal mutations might affect substrate binding, subcellular localization, or protein stability.The crystal structure of the hect domain reveals it to be an L-shaped molecule consisting of two lobes, the interface of which forms the catalytic cleft (13Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Two Angelman-associated mutations, L502P and E550L, lie in the amino-terminal lobe of the hect domain and were completely inactive in HHR23A ubiquitylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7). Glu-550 forms a salt bridge with a nearby arginine residue (13Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar); therefore, the E550L mutation may affect a critical structural element of the hect domain.The other mutations map to the carboxyl-terminal lobe of the hect domain, two of which were also severely impaired in HHR23A ubiquitylation. They are the F782Δ mutation (Fig. 1B, lane 9), which removes a residue from the hydrophobic core of the hect domain (13Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and an insertion at residue Lys-836 (Fig. 1B, lane 10). The latter mutation introduces a frameshift downstream of the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys-820) that inserts several amino acids and prematurely truncates much of the carboxyl-terminal α-helix of the protein.Two other hect domain mutations consistently had partial defects in HHR23A ubiquitylation. One is the in-frame deletion of Lys-801 (Fig. 1B, lane 4), a mutation that has been identified in two unrelated patients, and the other is a missense mutation that changes Ile-804 for a lysine (I804K) (Fig. 1B, lane 8). Another patient possesses a mutation causing the insertion of an isoleucine at position 803 (I803ins). This mutation had no discernible effect on E6AP-mediated HHR23A ubiquitylation (Fig. 1B, lane 5).The remaining two mutations reside in the non-catalytic amino terminus of E6AP. One mutant, C21Y, retained wild type activity in the HHR23A ubiquitylation assay (Fig. 1B, lane 3) whereas the other, S349P, was largely insoluble when expressed in insect cells. As an alternative source of E6AP S349P protein, we translated a His6-tagged version in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and purified it by affinity chromatography to separate the in vitro translated E6AP from the endogenous E6AP in the reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1C). Unprogrammed rabbit reticulocyte lysate subjected to the same purification scheme lacked activity (Fig. 1C, lane 1), but His6-wild type E6AP efficiently ubiquitylated both itself and the HHR23A substrate (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-5). Ubiquitylated wild type E6AP appeared as a slightly slower migrating form, due to the addition of one ubiquitin, and a high molecular weight smear, indicative of polyubiquitylation. The appearance of both the monoubiquitylated form and the smear required that ubiquitin be supplemented in the reaction (data not shown), indicating that these are indeed ubiquitylated forms. Furthermore the high molecular smear could be collapsed to approximately five distinct species by the addition of methylated ubiquitin (data not shown). This indicates that the smear is due to polyubiquitylation (21Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that E6AP places ubiquitin on approximately five of its own lysine residues. The HHR23A substrate was modified by several ubiquitins, most clearly indicated by including a reaction in which His6-E6AP WT was translated in the presence of cold methionine so that HHR23A was the only radiolabeled protein (Fig. 1C, lane 5) in the reaction.In vitro translated His6-E6AP S349P, however, was severely impaired in its ability to ubiquitylate HHR23A (Fig. 1C, lanes 11-13), identifying it as the first non-hect domain mutation to affect E6AP catalytic activity. The defect was not due to a loss of binding between E6AP S349P and HHR23A because they still interacted in a yeast two-hybrid experiment (see Fig. 3B). Overall there was a strong correlation between the loss of substrate ubiquitylation activity and the occurrence of Angelman syndrome-associated E6AP mutations (Table I).Fig. 3Substrate ubiquitylation-defective Angelman mutants retain self-ubiquitylation activity and substrate binding.A, in vitro translated His6-tagged 35S-labeled or cold E6AP proteins were purified and incubated with 35S-labeled HHR23A under standard ubiquitylation conditions. Lanes 1, 5, and 10, input E6AP proteins after purification. The amount of HHR23A used in each reaction is equivalent. The amount of cold E6AP used was equivalent to the higher concentration of 35S-labeled E6AP (e.g. the amounts of E6AP in lanes 3 and 4 are equivalent). Open arrows indicate ubiquitylated HHR23A. All reactions were stopped in Laemmli buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. B, plasmids encoding E6AP point mutants, hect domain only, or empty vector (fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain) were co-transformed with HHR23A (fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain) into yeast (see “Materials and Methods”). Transformants were grown to midlog phase in medium lacking Leu and Trp. Equal numbers of cells were spotted in serial 10-fold dilutions on plates either lacking Leu, Trp, and His or lacking only Leu and Trp. Interactions are scored as growth on the former. Relative protein levels were determined by resolving equal amounts of whole cell yeast extracts by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-E6AP antiserum.

Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). To qualitatively determine whether the defect in the ubiquitylation-defective Angelman-associated mutants was in this activity, we tested them in an in vitro thiol ester formation assay. We used in vitro translated, radiolabeled hect domains, which are sufficient for thiol ester formation (22Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant hect domains were incubated under standard ubiquitylation conditions in the presence of GST-ubiquitin and analyzed for the presence of the hect-GST-ubiquitin thiol ester adduct. The thiol ester bond is sensitive to reducing agents, so it is only detectable when the reaction is stopped in the absence of DTT. Under non-reducing conditions, the hect domain appeared as multiple species (Fig. 2A), which likely correspond to different oxidation states of the protein. After 1 min of reaction, a slowly migrating, DTT-sensitive polypeptide appeared that was the hect-GST-ubiquitin thiol ester (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4). As a negative control, a hect domain possessing the C820A mutation, which cannot form a ubiquitin thiol ester (14Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), was included (Fig. 2B). An additional p"
https://openalex.org/W2051473500,"Previously, the role of YidC in the membrane protein biogenesis of the F(0) sector of the Escherichia coli F(1)F(0) ATP synthase was investigated. Whereas subunits a and c of the F(1)F(0) ATP synthase were strictly dependent on YidC for membrane insertion, subunit b required YidC for efficient insertion (Yi, L., Jiang, F., Chen, M., Cain, B., Bolhuis, A., and Dalbey, R. E. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 10537-10544). In this paper, we investigated other protein components and energetics that are required in the membrane protein assembly of the F(0) sector subunits. We show here that the Sec translocase and the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway are required for membrane insertion of subunits a and b. In contrast, subunit c required neither the Sec machinery nor the SRP pathway for insertion. While the proton motive force was not required for insertion of subunits b and c, it was required for translocation of the negatively charged periplasmic NH(2)-terminal tail of subunit a, whereas periplasmic loop 2 of subunit a could insert in a proton motive force-independent manner. Taken together, the in vivo data suggest that subunits a and b are inserted by the Sec/SRP pathway with the help of YidC, and subunit c is integrated into the membrane by the novel YidC pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2061680908,"The structure of the proton-pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) from bovine brain clathrin coated vesicles was analyzed by electron microscopy and single molecule image analysis. A three-dimensional structural model of the complex was calculated by the angular reconstitution method at a resolution of 27 Å. Overall, the appearance of the V0 and V1 domains in the three-dimensional model of the intact bovine V-ATPase resembles the models of the isolated bovine V0 and yeast V1 domains determined previously (Wilkens, S., and Forgac, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 44064–44068; Zhang, Z., Charsky, C., Kane, P.M., and Wilkens, S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 47299–47306). To determine the binding position of subunit H in the V-ATPase, electron microscopy and cysteine-mediated photochemical cross-linking were used. Difference maps calculated from projection images of intact bovine V-ATPase and a V-ATPase preparation in which the two H subunit isoforms were removed by treatment with cystine revealed less protein density at the bottom of the V1 in the subunit H-depleted enzyme, suggesting that subunit H isoforms bind at the interface of the V1 and V0 domains. A comparison of three-dimensional models calculated for intact and subunit H-depleted enzyme indicated that at least one of the subunit H isoforms, although poorly resolved in the three-dimensional electron density, binds near the putative N-terminal domain of the a subunit of the V0. For photochemical cross-linking, unique cysteine residues were introduced into the yeast V-ATPase B subunit at sites that were localized based on molecular modeling using the crystal structure of the mitochondrial F1 domain. Cross-linking was performed using the photoactivatable sulfhydryl reagent 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone. Cross-linking to subunit H was observed from two sites on subunit B (E494 and T501) predicted to be located on the outer surface of the subunit closest to the membrane. Results from both electron microscopy and cross-linking analysis thus place subunit H near the interface of the V1 and V0 domains and suggest a close structural similarity between the V-ATPases of yeast and mammals.

The complex is found in both the endomembrane system of subcellular organelles and the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells. The function of the V-ATPase is to pump protons across the membrane bilayer, a process powered by hydrolysis of ATP. The V-ATPase is a large, multisubunit complex that can be divided into three domains: a water-soluble V1, which is responsible for binding and hydrolysis of ATP; a membrane embedded V0, which contains the proton translocation pore; and a stalk domain, which functions as a structural and functional connection between the V1 and V0. The subunit composition of the bovine V-ATPase has been determined by quantitative amino acid analysis to be A3B3CDEFG2H2 for the V1 and a(cc′)4–5c″d for the V0 (5Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Overall, the structure and mechanism of the V-ATPase is similar to the structure and mechanism of the related F1F0-ATPsynthase (7Wilkens S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J Exp Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the current mechanistic model of V-ATPase function, ATP hydrolysis taking place on the V1 A subunits drives rotation of a central domain composed of subunits D, F, d, and the ring of proteolipids against the remainder of the complex (9Imamura H.

Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277Google Scholar). Proton translocation occurs at the interface of the membrane bound domain of the V0a subunit and the lipid exposed glutamate sidechains from the c subunits. As in the F-ATPase motor, a peripheral stalk prevents rotation of the static domain during enzyme functioning. However, electron microscopy studies conducted with the bacterial (11Boekema E.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13115-13121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) enzyme have suggested that there are at least two, possibly three peripheral stalks in the V-ATPase. Based on biochemical studies, it has been proposed that one of the stators contains subunits E and G (14Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and another one the N-terminal domain of subunit a, possibly together with subunit H (16Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike in the F-ATPase, the in vivo proton pumping activity of the eukaryotic V-ATPase is regulated by a dissociation into V1 and V0 (17Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this regulation is well studied in the yeast and insect enzyme, and it has been shown that the dissociation is reversible and substrate-dependent and that the regulation is employed by the organism to preserve ATP in periods of limited nutrient availability. An important aspect of this regulation is that the dissociated components are enzymatically inactive in vivo. The isolated V0 is sealed to protons (19Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the isolated V1 is inhibited by Mg-ATP (20Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is again different from the F-ATPase, in which dissociation of the enzyme results in a highly active Mg-ATPase, F1, and a passive proton pore, F0. Despite virtually no sequence homology between the accessory V- and F-ATPase subunits, it has been shown that almost all of the V-ATPase polypeptides have functional homologues in the F1F0-ATPsynthase except for subunits d, H, C, and the large cytoplasmic domain of the V0 subunit a. It has been proposed that subunit C and the cytoplasmic domain of subunit a are involved in the mechanism of reversible dissociation (21Kane P.M. Parra K.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 81-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kawasaki-Nishi S. Bowers K. Nishi T. Forgac M. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47411-47420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas subunit d might have a structural role (23Yokoyama K. Nagata K. Imamura H. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Tamakoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42686-42691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subunit H, on the other hand, is the only subunit that is not strictly required for assembly (24Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown that subunit H can be removed from the enzyme without subsequent dissociation of the complex into V1 and V0 (6Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a peripheral binding location for this subunit. It is interesting that although there have been reports that subunit H is required for Mg-ATPase activity of intact V-ATPase (6Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the situation in the membrane detached V1 seems to be the opposite, in that the homologous subunit in yeast (Vma13p) is an inhibitor of Mg-ATPase activity in the V1-ATPase (26Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, subunit H has been identified to be responsible for the interaction of the V-ATPase with other cellular proteins such as HIV-Nef (27Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that there is one copy of each isoform bound in the complex, both of which seem to be required for enzyme activity in the intact complex (6Xu T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); based on these studies and the available biochemical data as well as the enzyme's similarity to the F-ATPase, a structural picture of the V-ATPase is now emerging. However, the arrangement of the stalk subunits is still poorly understood and remains a matter of ongoing controversy. In the present study, we have used electron microscopy together with computer-assisted image analysis to determine a low resolution three-dimensional structural model of the bovine V-ATPase. Overall, the model of the intact bovine enzyme is similar to the previously determined models of the bovine V0 (32Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and yeast V1 (33Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding site(s) of subunit H in the bovine and yeast V-ATPase complex were determined by electron microscopy and photochemical cross-linking. The data indicate that subunit H is binding at the bottom periphery of the V1, in the interface between the V1 and V0 domains, near the cytoplasmic domain of the V0a subunit. Materials and Strains—All reagents were from Sigma Chemical unless noted otherwise. The V-ATPase from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles was purified as described previously (34Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subunit H was removed from intact, purified V-ATPase by extended dialysis in the presence of the oxidizing agent cystine. This procedure leads to the removal of the majority of both subunit H isoforms as well as a residual 50-kDa subunit of the AP-2 adapter complex (AP-2), which has a molecular mass similar to that of subunit H (6Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Zymolase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America Inc., and 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone (MBP) was from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody 13 D11 against the yeast subunit B was purchased from Molecular Probes. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against subunit H was the kind gift of Dr. Tom Stevens. Yeast strains disrupted in the endogenous gene encoding the V-ATPase B subunit (vma2Δ) expressing mutant forms of Vma2p in which the endogenous cysteine at position 188 was replaced with serine and a unique cysteine was introduced were constructed as described previously (14Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The following single-cysteine containing mutants of subunit B were tested for photochemical cross-linking using MBP as described below: A15C, K45C, E106C, D199C, D341C, A424C, E494C, and T501C. Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, protein at a concentration of between 20 and 50 μg/ml was applied to glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids. Grids were washed once with buffer or water, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and air dried. Grids were examined in a Philips CM300 transmission electron microscopes operating at 100 kV. Images were recorded in low-dose mode on Kodak SO163 film that was developed in D19 developer for 12 min at room temperature. Images of stained samples were recorded with an underfocus of between 382 and 576 nm and an electron optical magnification of 47,000×, placing the first zero of the contrast transfer function at around 1/20 Å–1. Analysis of the V1V0-H images—Electron micrographs recorded at 47,000× were digitized on an Optronics drum scanner with a sampling rate of 18.75 μm corresponding to 4 Å/pixel on the specimen level. 6950 individual molecular images were selected interactively from 45 micrographs. Images were analyzed with the IMAGIC 5 software package (35van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (12Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The images were normalized and band pass filtered to remove low (<0.015 Å–1) and high (>0.1 Å–1) spatial frequencies. The data set was then analyzed by the “alignment by classification” (alignment by classification (36Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)) procedure leading to sets of initial references which were used in a first multi reference alignment step. The multireference alignment was iterated until no further improvement in the class sums was obtained. The analysis of two data sets of intact V-ATPase has been described previously (12Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Reconstruction of Intact V-ATPase—One of the data sets described in Ref. 12Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar served as a starting point for the three-dimensional reconstruction. The data set was sorted into 80 classes, and initial angles were assigned assuming 3-fold symmetry along the long axis of the complex. All further refinement steps were calculated assuming no (C1) symmetry. After eight rounds of refinement, the model did not improve significantly anymore, but because virtually all projections were seen perpendicular to the long axis of the complex (the variation in the Euler angles β at this stage was approximately ±15°), angle assignment was fluctuating for many of the projections. The number of images in the data set was therefore increased to ∼17,200, including images from 12 micrographs recorded with the specimen tilted at an angle of 45° (total number of micrographs = 54). The model after the eighth refinement iteration was forward-projected along 120 directions uniformly distributed on the Euler sphere between β-angles of 45° and 135°, and the resulting projections were used as references in a multireference alignment. The aligned data set was sorted into 100 classes, and angles were assigned to 80 of these using 144 forward projections of the model after the eighth iteration as an anchor set. The procedure was iterated with up to 176 forward projections as references in the final refinement step. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated by the Fourier shell correlation method. The resolution was 27 Å using the 0.5 criterion (37Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and 18 Å using the 3 σ measure (38Schatz M. Orlova E.V. Dube P. Jager J. van Heel M. J. Struct. Biology. 1995; 114: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The final model was filtered to a resolution of 1/24 Å–1 using a Gaussian filter. Three-dimensional Reconstruction of Subunit H-depleted V-ATPase— The final 3-D model of the intact V-ATPase was projected along 80 directions uniformly distributed between β-angles of 80° and 100° on the Euler sphere. The resulting projections then served as references to align the data set of subunit H-depleted molecules. The aligned data set was divided into 80 classes based on the cross-correlation coefficient obtained during the multireference alignment with the 80 projections of the intact V-ATPase complex. The classes were averaged and used to calculate a three-dimensional model of the subunit H-depleted complex. Difference Mapping—To localize the density corresponding to subunit H in the images of the intact V-ATPase, difference images from two-dimensional projections and the three-dimensional models were calculated. Before calculation of difference images, the projections were aligned to each other and normalized to give an average density of zero and a standard deviation of 10. In general, images of subunit H-depleted V-ATPase were subtracted from images of intact V-ATPase so that the position of additional protein mass in the intact complex was indicated by positive (white) density. Photochemical Cross-linking of the V-ATPase Using MBP—Vacuolar membranes were prepared from the vma2Δ strain expressing each of the single cysteine-containing mutants of Vma2p (A15C, K45C, E106C, D199C, D341C, A424C, E494C, and T501C) as described previously (14Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking using MBP was performed by a modification of the procedure previously employed (15Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Vacuolar membrane vesicles (200 μg of protein) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and then resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. The samples were reacted with MBP at 50 μm for 30 min at 23 °C in the dark. Unreacted MBP was quenched by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and vacuolar membranes were washed twice with the above buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer. The samples were irradiated for 5 min at 4 °C with a long-wavelength ultraviolet light (365 nm) and then solubilized with 2% C12E9. The V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal antibody 13D11 against the yeast subunit B and protein A-Sepharose, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels as described previously (14Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose and Western blotting (14Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the mouse monoclonal antibody against subunit B and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against subunit H. Three-dimensional Reconstruction of the Intact V-ATPase— To start up the three-dimensional reconstruction of the intact V-ATPase, a three-fold symmetry was imposed in the first angle assignment step based on the pseudo three-fold symmetry of the catalytic A3B3 core. The model was subsequently refined assuming no symmetry at all. Images recorded at a tilt angle of 45° were included to improve the accuracy of the angle assignment by the common line method. Surface representations of the final 3-D model of the intact V1-ATPase are shown in Fig. 1B. A selection of final input projections (images 1, 3, 5, and 7) and the corresponding re-projections (images 2, 4, 6, and 8) is shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1C shows contoured cross-sections of the 3-D model from top to bottom as indicated by the white lines on the left side of image 1 in Fig. 1B. Overall Features of the Three-dimensional Model of the Intact V-ATPase—Overall, the three-dimensional model of the bovine V-ATPase has a very similar appearance for the V1 and V0 portions compared with the three-dimensional models of the isolated V0 (32Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and V1 (33Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) domains. Starting at the luminal side of the complex (Fig. 1C, image 16) is the well defined density corresponding to subunit Ac45 followed by the ring of proteolipids (Fig. 1C, images 15–12). As in the model for isolated bovine V0, the individual c subunits are not resolved, but the putative subunit a C-terminal domain can be seen at the periphery of the ring (see arrowheads in images 15–12). Fig. 1C, image 11, shows the cross-section through the density sitting in the cytoplasmic opening of the proteolipid ring and as in the isolated V0 (32Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the density has a clear three domain appearance (see small arrows). In the previously determined three-dimensional model of the bovine V0, the putative N-terminal domain of subunit a is seen to interact with the protein density bound in the cytoplasmic opening of the proteolipid ring. This is different in the intact bovine V-ATPase, which shows the protein density emerging from the membrane surface in a straight fashion (Fig. 1C, images 11–9, arrowheads), stretching the entire length of the stalk region to interact at the bottom of the V1 domain. In the stalk region, six major protein densities can be identified (image 10), including a central, spherical mass (asterisk) which is surrounded by five densities. Two of the five densities are well defined and near the spherical protein in the center (image 10, long arrows) whereas the two densities at the periphery of the stalk are weaker (image 10, short arrows). The density between the two peripheral ones is the putative subunit a N-terminal domain (image 10, arrowhead). The two weak densities that are pointed out in images 9 and 10 by short arrows are visible in the three-dimensional model, but they seem not to be connected to the main structure by protein density at the contour level chosen (Fig. 1B, images 1 and 2, long arrows). The arrowheads in image 8 point to the bottom of three of the large subunits of the V1. The typical pseudo trigonal arrangement of the (AB)3 hexagon is seen most clearly in images 7–5 (see alternating arrows and arrowheads in image 6). A similar pseudo three-fold symmetry is seen in the yeast V1-ATPase model (Zhang et al., 2003) and the crystal structure of the F1-ATPase (39Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Structure at 2.8 Å resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria.Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar). The projection images and the surface representations seen in Fig. 1, A and B respectively, show the previously described “knob” and “elongated” densities at the top of the V1-domain (see arrowheads and short arrows in images A1, 3, and 5 and B1–3, respectively). From the cross-section shown in image 4 of Fig. 1C, the knob-like densities seem less well resolved in the model of the intact V-ATPase (see arrowheads in image 4) compared with the yeast V1 ATPase (33Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This might be explained by the absence of pure top views in the set of input projections used for calculating the three-dimensional reconstruction of the bovine enzyme. Nevertheless, rotation of the three-dimensional volume in steps of 60° (see arrows in images B, 1–3 in Fig. 1) shows the alternating knob-like densities s"

Here we demonstrate that this lesion can be directly demethylated in vitro by bacterial and human DNA dioxygenases. The Escherichia coli AlkB and human ABH3 proteins repaired 3-methylthymine in both single-stranded and double-stranded polydeoxynucleotides, whereas the human ABH2 protein preferred a duplex substrate. Thus, the known substrates of these enzymes now include 3-methylthymine in DNA, as well as 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine, which all have structurally similar sites of alkylation. Repair of 3-methylthymine by AlkB and ABH3 was optimal at pH 6, but inefficient. At physiological pH, 3-methylthymine, which is a minor methylated lesion, was more slowly repaired than the major lesion generated in single-stranded DNA, 3-methylcytosine. Our data suggest that 3-methylthymine residues in DNA will be repaired inefficiently in vivo and therefore may occur at a low steady-state level, but the residues should not gradually accumulate to high levels in long lived cells.

The accumulation of toxic and miscoding DNA lesions in long lived cells of mammals could be a contributing factor to cancer and cellular aging (1Hasty P. Campisi J. Hoeijmakers J. van Steeg H.

To avert mutagenesis, DNA damage resulting from endogenous and environmental agents must be efficiently repaired. Major damaged DNA bases that have the potential to directly miscode, such as 8-hydroxyguanine and O6-methylguanine (O6-meG), 1The abbreviations used are: O6-meG, O6-methylguanine; 3-meT, 3-methylthymine; 3-meC, 3-methylcytosine; 3-meA, 3-methyladenine; 7-meG, 7-methylguanine; 1-meA, 1-methyladenine; 7-meA, 7-methyladenine; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MeI, methyl iodide; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; O2-meC, O2-methylcytosine. are rapidly removed; therefore, minor DNA lesions that are chemically stable and refractory to repair may contribute disproportionately to the accumulation of mutations (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Such lesions that block the progression of DNA replication may persist and result in mutagenesis if bypassed by error-prone translesion DNA polymerases (4Friedberg E.C. Wagner G. Radman M. Science. 2002; 296: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 5Goodman M.F. Tippin B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, accumulation of DNA lesions in non-dividing cells may generate mutant proteins (6Viswanathan A. You H.J. Doetsch P.W. Science. 1999; 284: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two methylated bases, 3-methylthymine (3-meT) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC), for which no DNA repair process was known, were proposed previously as possible candidates for persistent lesions (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). However, 3-meC is now known to be corrected by a new mechanism of oxidative demethylation catalyzed by DNA dioxygenases (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 9Duncan T.

In this work, we examine whether the minor stable lesion 3-meT is a substrate of such enzymes or whether this lesion is refractory to DNA repair. Methylating agents can generate base adducts at ring nitrogens and exocyclic oxygens (11Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens: Reactions of Directly Acting Agents with Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which most of these lesions are repaired are now well characterized (12Sedgwick B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The major harmful lesions formed in double-stranded DNA are O6-meG and 3-methyladenine (3-meA). O6-meG, a directly miscoding lesion, is rapidly demethylated by O6-meG-DNA methyltransferases, which are conserved from bacteria to man. These proteins transfer the methyl group onto one of their own active cysteine residues resulting in their self-inactivation (13Demple B. Sedgwick B. Robins P. Totty N. Waterfield M.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Daniels D.S. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 3-meA in DNA blocks DNA replication and is a cytotoxic lesion, but it may occasionally generate mutations when bypassed by translesion DNA polymerases that have flexible base-pairing properties. To prevent the harmful effects of 3-meA, it is excised from DNA by ubiquitous 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylases in the initial step of the base excision-repair pathway (15O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 7-meG is an abundant lesion that is relatively innocuous; it is slowly lost from DNA by spontaneous hydrolysis and also by very slow excision by 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylases (15O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Several minor adducts induced in double-stranded DNA, including 3-methylguanine, O2-methylthymine, and O2-methylcytosine, are excised by the AlkA 3-meA-DNA glycosylase in Escherichia coli, and O4-methylthymine is demethylated by O6-meG-DNA methyltransferases in E. coli and human cells (for review, see Ref. 12Sedgwick B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). 1-Methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-meC are induced in single-stranded regions of DNA, where they are the main alkylation lesions formed (11Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens: Reactions of Directly Acting Agents with Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar, 16Bodell W.J. Singer B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2860-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a consequence, these non-coding lesions probably arise in vivo at DNA replication forks and transcription bubbles, where they will block the progression of DNA and RNA polymerases (17Boiteux S. Laval J. Biochimie (Paris). 1982; 64: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). 1-meA and 3-meC are chemically stable lesions that do not appear to be liberated by a DNA glycosylase (19Dinglay S. Trewick S.C. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2097-2105PubMed Google Scholar); instead, a novel DNA repair mechanism is used to destabilize the methyl group (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E.

Genome Biol. 2001; 2Crossref Google Scholar). α-Ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases are a superfamily of enzymes that couple oxidative decomposition of α-ketoglutarate to hydroxylation of their target substrates (22Hausinger R.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The E. coli AlkB and human ABH2 and ABH3 DNA dioxygenases are members of this family and use iron-oxo intermediates to hydroxylate the methyl groups of 1-meA and 3-meC in DNA. The resulting hydroxymethyl groups are unstable and are released catalytically as formaldehyde, with the damaged bases reverting to the unmodified form (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44348-44354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AlkB and ABH3 can also slowly repair these lesions in methylated RNA, but the biological significance of this activity is unclear (10Aas P.A. Otterlei M. Falnes P.O. Vagbo C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjoras M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E. Krokan H.E. Nature. 2003; 421: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 24Krokan H.E. Kavli B. Slupphaug G. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 280-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A minor methylated base for which no DNA repair process has been described yet is 3-meT (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 25Sedgwick B. Lindahl T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8886-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The 3-meT lesion is of particular interest because of its great chemical stability (11Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens: Reactions of Directly Acting Agents with Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar). The 3-position of thymine is normally involved in base pairing; thus 3-meT (like 3-meC and 1-meA) is predicted to be a non-coding lesion. Indeed, both 3-meT and 3-ethylthymine in synthetic polymers completely block DNA synthesis by E. coli DNA polymerase I or the Klenow fragment of this enzyme (26Saffhill R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1985; 53: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Huff A.C. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12843-12850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bhanot O.S. Grevatt P.C. Donahue J.M. Gabrielides C.N. Soloman J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10357-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consequently, unrepaired 3-meT in DNA could be a threat to cell viability or may result in mutagenesis if bypassed by translesion DNA polymerases. It was therefore of interest to determine whether this lesion can be actively repaired by DNA dioxygenases. At present the only known methylated substrates of these enzymes are 1-meA and 3-meC in DNA (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 9Duncan T.

Sedgwick B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2097-2105PubMed Google Scholar), so their substrate range appears to be restricted. They do not demethylate 3-meA, 7-meA, 7-meG (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E.

A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), 5-methylcytosine, or thymine (5-methyluracil) in DNA (see below). The 3-meC and 1-meA bases differ from 3-meT in being positively charged at neutral pH and having an amino group adjacent to the methylated site, and such structural features could be essential for substrate recognition by DNA dioxygenases (Fig. 1). To further analyze the specificity of these enzymes, we have investigated whether the E. coli AlkB and human ABH2 and ABH3 dioxygenases can demethylate 3-meT residues in DNA. Non-radiolabeled Heavily Methylated Poly(dT)—0.25 mg of poly(dT) (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5 ml of 200 mm Na2HPO4, pH 10.8, was exposed to 5 μl of dimethylsulfate (DMS) at 20 °C for 6 h. During this reaction the pH falls; therefore, 50 μlof1 m NaOH and a further 5 μlof DMS were added, and the incubation continued for a further 16 h. The methylated poly(dT) was ethanol-precipitated twice. HPLC analysis of acid hydrolysates showed that 70% of the thymine bases had been converted to 3-meT. [14C]MeI-treated Polymers—0.75 mg of poly(dT) in 1 ml of 200 mm Na2HPO4, pH 10.8, was added to 1 mCi of ice-cold [14C]MeI (54 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 20 °C for 6 h. To remove the unreacted [14C]MeI, the methylated polymer was ethanol-precipitated three times and dialyzed against water. HPLC analysis showed that ∼3% of the thymine bases were methylated to generate [14C]3-meT. The specific activity of the 14C-methylated poly(dT) substrate was 1580 cpm/μg of poly(dT) and 118 cpm/pmol of 3-meT. To prepare a double-stranded substrate, the 14C-methylated poly(dT) was annealed to poly(dA) at 20 °C for 1 h. 14C-Methylated poly(dC) was prepared as described previously by treatment of poly(dC) with [14C]MeI at pH 7 for 6 h (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The specific activity of this substrate was 890 cpm/μg of polymer and 125 cpm/pmol of 3-meC. HPLC Analysis—Thymine residues were released from methylated poly(dT) by hydrolysis in 90% formic acid in sealed glass vials at 180 °C for 40 min. The samples were evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 100 μl of water, and filtered through an Amicon Ultrafree-MC filtration unit (10,000 nominal molecular weight limit). After re-evaporation, the samples were resuspended in 100 μl of water, and 10 μl was analyzed by HPLC on a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro reverse phase column (dimensions, 4.6 × 250 mm) in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. After 5 min, a linear gradient of 0–50% methanol was applied over 20 min. The retention times of thymine and 3-meT were 19.5 and 26.2 min, respectively. When analyzing radiolabeled substrates, fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals, and radioactive methylated bases were detected by scintillation counting. When using non-radiolabeled substrates, methylated and unmethylated bases were detected by A260 measurements. The absorption maxima at pH 4 of thymine and 3-meT are 264 and 260 nm, respectively (29Singer B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1975; 15: 219-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The 3-meT marker was prepared by depyrimidination of 3-methylthymidine (obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repositories) in 90% formic acid at 180 °C for 40 min. After evaporation to dryness, the hydrolysate was resuspended in water. HPLC analysis revealed a single UV light-absorbing peak of 3-meT. Protein Purification—His6-tagged AlkB protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). His6-tagged ABH2 and His6-tagged ABH3 were overexpressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells as described previously (23Koivisto P. Duncan T. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44348-44354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The method was slightly modified; after loading the cell extracts onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), the column was washed with buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted in buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Purity of both the recombinant ABH2 and ABH3 proteins was ∼98% as observed by SDS-PAGE. Assays of AlkB, ABH2, and ABH3—AlkB, ABH2, or ABH3 (10 or 20 pmol) was added to the [14C]MeI poly(dT) substrate (800–3000 cpm) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH or MES-HCl, 75 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm α-ketoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 10 mm, and the polynucleotide substrate was ethanol-precipitated in the presence of carrier calf thymus DNA. Two-thirds of the ethanol-soluble radioactive material was monitored by scintillation counting. When determining the optimum pH for activity on methylated poly(dT), 50 mm MES-HCl or 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer was used with pH values between 5 and 6.5 or between 7 and 8.5, respectively. Methylation of Poly(dT)—3-meT is a minor product when single- or double-stranded DNA is treated with methyl methanesulfonate, DMS (Sn2 agents), or methylnitrosourea (Sn1 agent) at neutral pH, constituting up to 0.8% of the total alkylated residues (for review, see Ref. 11Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens: Reactions of Directly Acting Agents with Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar). The yield of 3-meT is increased when DNA is treated with methylnitrosourea in alkaline conditions (30Loveless A. Hampton C.L. Mutat. Res. 1969; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or when free thymidine is exposed to DMS at high pH (31Singer B. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4353-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, to prepare a DNA substrate containing 3-meT, poly(dT) was treated with DMS at pH 10.8. The methylated polymer was hydrolyzed with formic acid, and the released pyrimidine bases were analyzed by HPLC. After treatment of poly(dT) with 100 mm DMS at pH 10.8, ∼70% of the thymine bases were converted to 3-meT (Fig. 2). Other possible minor methylation products of thymine are O2-methylthymine and O4-methylthymine. However, O-alkyl base derivatives are dealkylated by acid hydrolysis (32Kusmierek J.T. Singer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and would not be detected by the procedures used here. In any case, O-methylated bases would be very minor products because Sn2 agents such as MeI and DMS rarely alkylate oxygens in DNA (11Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens: Reactions of Directly Acting Agents with Nucleic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1983: 45-96Crossref Google Scholar). To prepare a substrate containing radiolabeled 3-meT, poly(dT) was treated with [14C]MeI at pH 10.8 to convert an estimated 3% of the thymine residues to a methylated form. Repair of 3-Methylthymine in Poly(dT) by AlkB—Repair of 1-meA in DNA by E. coli AlkB protein was assayed previously by the release of [14C]formaldehyde from [14C]MeI-treated poly(dA) as ethanol-soluble radiolabeled material (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The ability of AlkB to repair 3-meT in 14C-methylated poly(dT) was therefore initially examined using the same assay. In conditions that are optimal for AlkB to catalyze repair of 1-meA in DNA (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), no detectable release of ethanol-soluble radiolabeled material from the 14C-methylated poly(dT) was observed. AlkB repairs 1-meA in DNA with a sharp pH optimum of 8 (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 33, Trewick, S. C. (2003) Oxidative Demethylation of DNA Damage by Escherchia coli AlkB and Its Human Homologs ABH2 and ABH3. Ph.D. thesis, University College London, LondonGoogle Scholar). The possibility that AlkB may repair 3-meT with a different pH optimum was tested, and activity was observed initially at pH 6.5. The [14C]3-meT bases remaining in the substrate were quantitated by HPLC and showed that 3-meT was actively removed by AlkB (Fig. 3). AlkB directly reverses 1-meA and 3-meC in DNA to adenine and cytosine. To determine whether AlkB reverts 3-meT to thymine, AlkB was incubated with the heavily methylated non-radiolabeled poly(dT) under standard assay conditions at pH 6.5. HPLC analysis of the substrate and integration of the peak areas showed that AlkB catalyzed the stoichiometric reversion of 3-meT lesions directly back to thymine (Fig. 4). Because the peak of thymine increased in the presence of AlkB, we can also conclude that AlkB does not demethylate thymine (5-methyluracil) itself.Fig. 4Direct reversion of 3-meT to thymine by AlkB. Heavily methylated poly(dT) (0.1 μg) was incubated with 20 pmol of AlkB or boiled AlkB in standard assay conditions but at pH 6.5 for 30 min. The bases remaining in the polymer were released by formic acid hydrolysis and analyzed by HPLC and A260 measurements. A, with boiled AlkB (T, thymine; O2meT, O2-methylthymine; O4meT, O4-methylthymine). B, with active AlkB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By assaying ethanol-soluble material released from 14C-methylated poly(dT) at various pH values, AlkB was shown to repair 3-meT in DNA with a pH optimum of 6 (Fig. 5). Even at this optimal pH, AlkB repaired 3-meT inefficiently, with 10 pmol of the protein removing only 1.4 pmol of 3-meT in 30 min. To verify that AlkB was acting as an α-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase and therefore repairing 3-meT by oxidative demethylation, the activity was shown to be completely dependent on α-ketoglutarate and inhibited by 0.2 mm EDTA. In the presence of EDTA, the addition of 0.7 mm Fe(II) regenerated the activity (data not shown). Repair of 3-Methylthymine in Poly(dT) by Human ABH2 and ABH3—Like AlkB, ABH3 has a sharp pH optimum of 8 for repair of 1-meA in DNA, whereas ABH2 has a broader optimum of pH 7–7.5 (9Duncan T. Trewick S.C. Koivisto P. Bates P.A. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 33, Trewick, S. C. (2003) Oxidative Demethylation of DNA Damage by Escherchia coli AlkB and Its Human Homologs ABH2 and ABH3. Ph.D. thesis, University College London, LondonGoogle Scholar). The ability of these human proteins to demethylate 3-meT in DNA was examined over a range of pH values using the 14C-methylated poly(dT) substrate. Similarly to AlkB, ABH3 repaired 3-meT in the single-stranded polymer with an acidic pH optimum of 5.5–6.5 (Fig. 5). Both these enzymes repair 1-meA and 3-meC in single- and double-stranded DNA but prefer the single-stranded substrate (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 8Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 9Duncan T.

Vagbo C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjoras M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E. Krokan H.E. Nature. 2003; 421: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). This is also the case for 3-meT residues, and both AlkB and ABH3 repaired 3-meT in a double-stranded poly(dT)·poly(dA) substrate at 20–30% of the rate observed with single-stranded poly(dT) (data not shown). ABH2 activity was not detectable on a single-stranded polynucleotide substrate (Fig. 5). ABH2 repairs 1-meA and 3-meC more efficiently in double-stranded than in single-stranded DNA (10Aas P.A. Otterlei M. Falnes P.O. Vagbo C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjoras M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E. Krokan H.E. Nature. 2003; 421: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The possibility that ABH2 might preferentially repair 3-meT in a double-stranded substrate was therefore examined. ABH2 slowly released [14C]ethanol-soluble material from 14C-methylated poly(dT) annealed to poly(dA) (Fig. 6A), and the repair of 3-meT in this double-stranded polydeoxynucleotide also had a low pH optimum of 6.5 (Fig. 6B). Repair of 3-meT and 3-meC at Physiological pH—The optimal pH for in vitro repair of 3-meT by E. coli AlkB, human ABH2, and human ABH3 is pH 6–6.5, whereas 3-meC is repaired optimally by these proteins at pH 7.5–8 (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 33, Trewick, S. C. (2003) Oxidative Demethylation of DNA Damage by Escherchia coli AlkB and Its Human Homologs ABH2 and ABH3. Ph.D. thesis, University College London, LondonGoogle Scholar). To assess the relative significance of these activities at physiological pH, the abilities of AlkB and ABH3 to repair 3-meT and 3-meC were compared at pH 7.4 (Fig. 7). At this pH, both AlkB and ABH3 repaired 3-meC more efficiently than 3-meT. Repair of 3-meT at pH 7.4 occurred but was extremely inefficient, requiring ∼30 pmol of either protein to repair 1 pmol of 3-meT during a 10-min incubation. Prior to this work, known substrates of E. coli AlkB and human ABH2 and ABH3 were 3-meC, 1-meA, and 1-ethyladenine in DNA, and within this limited set of substrates the larger 1-ethyladenine lesion was inefficiently repaired by the human enzymes (9Duncan T. Trewick S.C. Koivisto P. Bates P.A. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). E. coli AlkB may be more versatile as in vivo observations suggest that it also dealkylates hydroxyethyl, propyl, and hydroxypropyl lesions (23Koivisto P. Duncan T. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44348-44354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have extended the substrate range of all three enzymes to include the minor methylation lesion 3-meT. Comparable with the repair of 1-meA and 3-meC, ABH2 primarily repaired 3-meT in double-stranded DNA, whereas AlkB and ABH3 demethylated this lesion more efficiently in single-stranded than in double-stranded DNA. During the course of this work, we also tested whether two other stable methylated bases, N2-ethylguanine and 5-methylcytosine, were substrates of these dioxygenases. N2-Ethylguanine is generated in DNA upon exposure to acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol and a possible initiating event in alcohol-induced cancer (34Fang J.-L. Vaca C.E. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is a stable lesion for which no specific DNA repair process is known. Using oligonucleotides containing a single lesion, we have observed that N2-ethylguanine is not detectably dealkylated by E. coli AlkB. 2P. J. Brooks, P. Koivisto, B. Sedgwick, and T. Lindahl, unpublished data. Because human ABH2 and ABH3 only inefficiently repair 1-ethyladenine residues (9Duncan T. Trewick S.C. Koivisto P. Bates P.A. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that N2-ethylguanine would be a substrate of these activities. Possibly, the bulky N2-ethylguanine can be excised by an alternative process such as nucleotide excision-repair. The naturally occurring methylated base 5-methylcytosine may have a reversible role in the epigenetic control of gene expression in mammalian cells (35Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which 5-methylcytosine is actively demethylated is uncertain. The possibility that this could occur by oxidative demethylation catalyzed by a dioxygenase has been suggested (7Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, neither of the human DNA dioxygenases ABH2 and ABH3 nor AlkB detectably demethylated radiolabeled 5-methylcytosine in DNA in in vitro assays under a variety of conditions (data not shown). Other related but as yet uncharacterized dioxygenases could possibly be involved in 5-methylcytosine demethylation. Methylated bases that are not substrates of AlkB, ABH2, and ABH3 are now known to include 3-meA, 7-meG, 7-meA, thymine (5-methyluracil), 5-methylcytosine, and N2-ethylguanine. The sites alkylated on these bases are different, whereas those on 1-meA, 3-meC, and 3-meT are structurally equivalent, although numbered differently on the purine and pyrimidine rings (Fig. 1). Compared with 3-meC and 1-meA, 3-meT was a poor substrate of all three dioxygenases. Consequently, the exocyclic amino group adjacent to the methyl adduct or the positive charge on 1-meA and 3-meC (Fig. 1), although not essential features of the substrate, may be critical for efficient recognition or repair. It is also noteworthy that the different pH optima for repair of these lesions (pH 6–6.5 for 3-meT versus pH 7.5–8 for 3-meC and 1-meA) by AlkB, ABH2, and ABH3 may reflect a necessity for protonation of the substrate or of the metalloenzymes themselves and may influence the structure/ activity relationship of the proteins (36Messerschmidt A. Prade L. Kroes S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3443-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Future determination of the three-dimensional structure of these proteins together with their substrates should clarify this issue. The restricted substrate range of AlkB, ABH2, and ABH3 can be contrasted with the diverse substrates of the 3-meA-DNA glycosylases that excise not only structurally unrelated alkylated bases such as 3-meA, 7-meA, and O2-meC but also non-alkylated base derivatives including hypoxanthine and ethenoadenine. The methyl group on the substrates of these enzymes apparently makes little contribution to substrate recognition (15O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The inefficient correction of 3-meT by DNA dioxygenases observed here is not surprising, as repair enzymes that act on several different DNA lesions are usually most efficient with their major substrates. For comparison, the major mutagenic DNA lesion O6-meG induced by Sn1-methylating agents is much more efficiently repaired by O6-meG-DNA methyltransferases than the minor lesion O4-methylthymine (37Sassanfar M. Dosanjh M.K. Essigmann J.M. Samson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2767-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The important point with regard to 3-meT is that this chemically highly stable lesion is actively repaired at all. Thus, it would not be expected to slowly accumulate to high levels in the DNA of long lived human cells over a period of many years and decades. In view of the sluggish repair of the lesion, it could still be present at a relevant but low steady-state level in DNA in vivo, interfering with transcription and replication or being bypassed by an error-prone DNA polymerase in translesion synthesis. This argument can also be made for other minor but chemically stable DNA lesions that are actively but only slowly repaired, such as the S-diastereoisomer of 5′, 8-cyclodeoxyadenosine generated by oxygen free-radicals; this bulky endogenous DNA lesion is an exceptionally poor substrate for human nucleotide excision-repair and is not removed by any other known repair process (38Kuraoka I. Bender C. Romieu A. Cadet J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3832-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The inefficient repair of 3-meT and other stable DNA lesions therefore might lead to a gradual deterioration of the integrity of cellular DNA and conceivably affect cellular aging. We thank M. Biggerstaff for protein purification."

The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and used to probe the enzyme's mechanism, structure, and inhibition profile in a series of kinetic experiments. The mechanism of the C. parvum enzyme involves the random addition of substrates and ordered release of products with rate-limiting hydrolysis of a covalent enzyme intermediate.

Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the most common causes of waterborne infectious disease in the United States. In 1993, an outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, involved an estimated 403,000 cases of symptomatic illness, resulting in a significant number of deaths (1MacKenzie W.R. Schell W.L. Blair K.A. Addiss D.G. Peterson D.E. Hoxie N.J. Kazmierczak J.J. Davis J.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 21: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cryptosporidiosis is marked by watery diarrhea, causing pronounced dehydration, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Treatment is currently limited to fluid and electrolyte replacement to prevent dehydration (2Mead J.R. Drug Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The symptoms of acute cryptosporidiosis can be severe but are usually limited to 1–2 weeks duration, after which patients develop protective immunity, and the disease resolves spontaneously. However, patients with weakened immune systems suffer from persistent chronic disease that often becomes life-threatening (3DuPont H.L. Chappell C.L. Sterling C.R. Okhuysen P.C. Rose J.B. Jakubowski W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 4Hunter P.R. Nichols G. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Effective drug treatment is urgently needed for the management of cryptosporidiosis, especially in AIDS patients. The nucleotide biosynthetic pathways provide the precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis and are a rich source of drug targets. Fast replication rates make microbes especially sensitive to drugs affecting the nucleotide pools. Recent genomic and experimental studies suggest that Cryptosporidium parvum uses a minimal set of enzymes in highly streamlined nucleotide biosynthetic pathways. Whereas most parasitic protozoa salvage purines from the host and synthesize pyrimidines de novo, C. parvum relies on salvage for both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (5Striepen B. Pruijjsers A.J.P. Huang J. Li C. Gubbels M.J. Umejiego N.N. Hedstrom L. Kissinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). C. parvum scavenges adenosine from the host cell via adenosine kinase to produce AMP (Fig. 1A). AMP enters the adenine nucleotide pool or is converted to GMP by the sequential action of AMP deaminase, inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), 1The abbreviations used are: IMPDH, inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase; XMP, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate; β-CH -TAD, β-methylene thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; TAD, thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide; APAD, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide; NHD, nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide; APADH, reduced 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide; NHDH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; MZP, mizoribine monophosphate; MPA, mycophenolic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and GMP synthase. C. parvum lacks the enzymes required to salvage purine bases and will therefore be highly susceptible to the inhibition of any step in this pathway. The IMPDH inhibitors ribavirin and mycophenolic acid (MPA) block C. parvum development in tissue culture (5Striepen B. Pruijjsers A.J.P. Huang J. Li C. Gubbels M.J. Umejiego N.N. Hedstrom L.

Lett. 1998; 168: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ribavirin is effective in the neonatal mouse model, 2J. R. Mead and B. Striepen, unpublished results. which validates IMPDH as a target for treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Moreover, IMPDH is a well developed target for antiviral and immunosuppressive therapy, and several inhibitors of human IMPDH are already in clinical use (7Franchetti P. Grifantini M. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 599-614PubMed Google Scholar, 8Streeter D.G. Witkowski J.T. Khare G.P. Sidwell R.W. Bauer R.J. Robins R.K. Simon L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. Rev. 1993; 136: 5-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), so the design of parasite-specific IMPDH inhibitors will be greatly facilitated by the ability to “piggy-back” on existing drug development programs. The IMPDH reaction is unusual in that it involves a large conformational change in midcatalytic cycle (Fig. 1D). In the rapid redox phase of the reaction, IMP and NAD bind randomly, the active site Cys attacks IMP, and hydride is transferred to NAD, producing E-XMP* (Fig. 1, B and D) (11Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NADH is released, and a flap moves into the vacant site, changing the enzyme into a hydrolase. E-XMP* is hydrolyzed, and XMP is released. The hydrolysis of E-XMP* is at least partially rate-limiting in all IMPDH reactions studied so far (12Wang W. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8479-8483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Xiang B. Markham G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15388-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Kerr K.M. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13365-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several inhibitors compete with the flap for the vacant NADH site, thus preventing the hydrolysis of E-XMP* (Fig. 1, C and D). The selectivity of these inhibitors is determined by both the structure of the NADH binding site and the dynamic properties of the flap. For example, MPA traps the E-XMP* intermediate by binding in the nicotinamide portion of the vacant NADH site. Two residues in the nicotinamide site are not conserved; mammalian enzymes contain Arg322 and Gln441 (human type 2 numbering), which favor MPA binding, whereas microbial enzymes contain Lys and Glu at these positions (see Fig. 5). In addition, the open conformation is favored in mammalian enzymes, whereas the closed conformation of the flap is favored in microbial enzymes (14Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15388-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Gan L. Petsko G.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13309-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, MPA is a potent inhibitor of mammalian IMPDHs but a poor inhibitor of microbial enzymes. In contrast, MZP binds in the IMP site and induces the closed conformation (16Gan L. Petsko G.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13309-13317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, although the residues of the IMP site are highly conserved, the dynamic properties of the flap make MZP a more potent inhibitor of microbial enzymes. We have recently isolated the gene coding for C. parvum IMPDH (17Striepen B. White M.W. Li C. Guerini M.N. Malik S.B. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Liu C. Abrahamsen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6304-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that this gene groups consistently with eubacteria, although C. parvum is clearly a eukaryote (17Striepen B. White M.W. Li C. Guerini M.N. Malik S.B.

This observation suggests that the IMPDH gene was transferred from a bacterium, a process that plays an unexpectedly important role in the evolution of the C. parvum metabolism (5Striepen B.

Parasitol. 1987; 24: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), so the divergent phylogenetic origins of host and parasite enzymes present a promising opportunity for the development of parasite-specific inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the gene coding for C. parvum IMPDH in Escherichia coli, purified recombinant protein to homogeneity, and subjected the enzyme to a series of kinetic experiments probing its mechanism, structure, and inhibition. These analyses reveal pronounced differences between the C. parvum and human IMPDH and suggest a strategy for the design of parasite-specific inhibitors. Materials—IMP, ADP, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate, NADH, GMP, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), and Trizma base were purchased from Sigma. NAD+ was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Dithiothreitol was purchased from Research Organics, Inc. Glycerin, EDTA, and KCl were purchased from Fisher. Molecular Methods—The coding sequence of C. parvum IMPDH was amplified by PCR, generating artificial flanking restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII using primers 5′-CGTAGGATCCATGGGTACAAAAAACATAGGAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-TACGAAGCTTCTATTTACTATAATTCATTACTT-3′ and plasmid pCpIMPDHComp as template. This plasmid was originally obtained from a complemented T. gondii clone obtained in a genetic screen using a C. parvum genomic library (17Striepen B. White M.W. Li C. Guerini M.N. Malik S.B. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Liu C. Abrahamsen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6304-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The plasmid contained a 1387-bp insert including the entire C. parvum IMPDH coding region (17Striepen B. White M.W. Li C. Guerini M.N. Malik S.B. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Liu C. Abrahamsen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6304-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting molecule was purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII, and ligated into plasmid pTactac digested with the same enzymes (23Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The resulting expression plasmid pTacCpIMPDH was characterized by restriction mapping and complete sequencing of the insert. Expression and Purification of C. parvum IMPDH—pTacCpIMPDH was transformed into E. coli strain TX685, which lacks endogenous IMPDH due to a deletion in the GuaB locus (24Tiedeman A.A. Smith J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1303-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test for complementation, bacteria were plated on LB and minimal medium agar plates containing glucose, essential salts, and amino acids but lacking guanine nucleotides. For enzyme production, cells carrying the pTacCpIMPDH plasmid were grown overnight and diluted 10-fold into 1 liter of fresh LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After shaking at 37 °C for 1 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a concentration of 1 mm to induce overexpression of IMPDH. The cells were allowed to grow for 16 h, at which time they were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A, and frozen at –20 °C. Cells were later thawed on ice, supplemented with 2.5 ml of reconstituted protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the cleared supernatant (IMPDH activity = 0.08 μmol of product/min/mg) was applied to a Sigma Cibacron blue agarose column previously equilibrated with buffer A at 4 °C (21Zhou X. Cahoon M. Rosa P. Hedstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21977-21981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IMPDH was eluted in a linear gradient of 0–2 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing IMPDH activity were pooled (IMPDH activity = 0.41 μmol of product/min/mg) and applied to an IMP affinity chromatography column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (25Ikegami T. Natsumeda Y. Weber G. Life Sci. 1987; 40: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The column was washed with buffer A supplemented with KCl to the concentration of the pooled blue agarose fractions (typically 0.5 m KCl). IMPDH was eluted with 0.5 mm IMP in buffer A. Fractions containing IMPDH were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A overnight to remove IMP, and stored at –20 °C (IMPDH activity = 1.4 μmol of product/min/mg). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad assay using IgG as a standard. The final preparation was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (Tufts Medical School Protein Sequencing Facility), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (University of Georgia Proteomics Resource facility). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Purified recombinant C. parvum IMPDH was applied to a 30-cm Sepharose 6 HR gel filtration column. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, and 3 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with a mixture of thyroglobulin, γ-globulin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12 (molecular masses 670, 158, 44, 17, and 1.4 kDa, respectively; Bio-Rad). Enzyme Kinetics—IMPDH assays were performed in 100 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (assay buffer). Activity was routinely assayed in the presence of 250 μm IMP, 500 μm NAD, and 34 nm IMPDH at 25 °C. NADH production was monitored either by following absorbance change at 340 nm using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (ϵ = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1) or by following fluorescence change on a BMG Labtechnologies Floustar Galaxy (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 460 nm). For crude extracts, the production of XMP was monitored by absorbance at 290 nm (ϵ = 5.4 mm–1 cm–1). The production of APADH and NHDH was followed at 363 nm (ϵ = 9.1 mm–1 cm–1) and 340 nm (ϵ = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1), respectively. The concentrations of IMP, NAD, and various analogs were varied. Using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.), initial velocity data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), the uncompetitive substrate inhibition equation (Equation 2), and the random Bi-Bi equation (Equation 3) as follows, v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) v=Vm/(1+Km/[S]+[S]/Kii)(Eq. 2) v=Vm[A][B]/(KiaKb+Kb[A]+Ka[B]+[A][B])(Eq. 3) where v represents the velocity, Vm is the maximal velocity, S is the substrate concentration, Km is the Michaelis constant, Kii is the intercept inhibition constant (26Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A and B are substrates, Kia is the dissociation constant for A, and Ka and Kb are their respective Km values. The inhibition of C. parvum IMPDH by MPA, βCH2-TAD, and ADP was assayed at saturating IMP (250 μm) and varying concentrations of NAD (25–250 μm) and inhibitor (0.5 μm to 32 mm). The inhibition of IMPDH by GMP was monitored at fixed NAD (500 μm) and varying concentration of IMP (10–100 μm) and inhibitor (0.5–1.5 mm). GMP inhibition was also measured at saturating IMP (250 μm) and varying concentration of NAD (25–250 μm) and inhibitor (0.5–1.5 mm). Data were fit to the following equations using the SigmaPlot program: the competitive inhibition equation (Equation 4), the uncompetitive inhibition equation (Equation 5), and the noncompetitive inhibition equation (Equation 6), v=Vm[S]/(Km(1+[I]/Kis)+[S])(Eq. 4) v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S](1+[I]/Kii))(Eq. 5) v=Vm[S]/(Km(1+[I]/Kis)+[S](1+[I]/Kii))(Eq. 6) where Kii and Kis represent the intercept and slope inhibition constants, respectively. Multiple inhibitor experiments with tiazofurin (1–9 mm) and ADP (4–16 mm) were performed at 250 μm IMP and 250 μm NAD. Data were fit to the multiple inhibitor equation using the SigmaPlot program as follows, v=v0/(1+[I]/Ki+[J]/Kj+[I][J]/αKiKj)(Eq. 7) where v0 represents the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor, I is the inhibitor concentration of the first inhibitor for which Ki is the apparent inhibition constant, J is the concentration of the second inhibitor for which Kj is the apparent inhibition constant, and α is the interaction constant. MZP is a slow tight binding inhibitor, so enzyme was preincubated with MZP in the absence of substrates. Complex formation was complete within 15 min, and the reaction was initiated with the addition of IMP (20–100 μm) and NAD (500 μm) (15Kerr K.M. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13365-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ishikawa H. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 575-597PubMed Google Scholar). Varying IMP concentration had no effect on the extent of inhibition, which demonstrates that the E·MZP complex does not dissociate during the assay. The initial velocity data were fit to a simple binding model using Dynafit software (28Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant C. parvum IMPDH—The goal of this study was to establish whether the prokaryotic origin of C. parvum IMPDH is reflected in its catalytic properties and to evaluate the potential for pathogen-specific inhibition. To generate sufficient amounts of enzyme for purification and biochemical characterization, the parasite gene was expressed in E. coli. The coding sequence of C. parvum IMPDH was amplified by PCR and introduced into a bacterial plasmid under control of the inducible TacTac promoter (23Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was used to transform E. coli strain TX685 that lacks endogenous IMPDH activity due to a deletion in the GuaB locus (24Tiedeman A.A. Smith J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1303-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A complementation assay was performed to test whether the C. parvum enzyme expressed under these conditions is biologically active. TX685 bacteria grow well on rich LB medium but cannot proliferate on guanine-free minimal medium (Fig. 2A). Transformation with the plasmid expressing the C. parvum IMPDH restores growth of the mutant on minimal medium, demonstrating functional complementation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, crude lysate prepared from liquid cultures of pTacCpIMPDH-transformed bacteria contained IMPDH activity absent from the mutant and control strain (data not shown). Initially, C. parvum IMPDH was purified from crude cell lysate by chromatography over Cibacron blue agarose followed by IMP affinity resin (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fractions containing enzymatic activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2B, the final preparation contained a single homogenous protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa. The experiments that follow utilized enzyme purified by this protocol. Subsequently, IMP affinity chromatography alone was found to be sufficient for isolation of >90% homogeneous enzyme with equivalent specific activity in 32% yield. We obtained 14 mg of purified IMPDH from a 2 liters culture using this streamlined protocol. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The sequence Gly-Thr-Lys-Asn-Ile-Gly-Lys-Gly-Leu-Thr established by Edman degradation corresponds to the predicted N-terminal sequence of C. parvum IMPDH after posttranslational removal of the initial methionine. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry detected a single molecular species with a molecular mass of 42,904 Da (Fig. 2C), which is in good agreement with the predicted size of the recombinant protein of 42,950 Da calculated using the Ex-PASy-ProtParam tool. Finally, the purified enzyme eluted as a single peak in close proximity to the 158-kDa standard during gel filtration chromatography, indicating that the active enzyme is a homotetramer, as previously reported for IMPDH enzymes from other organisms (Fig. 2D) (20Hedstrom L. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady State Kinetic Parameters—Initial velocity data were collected under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The initial velocity versus varying concentrations of IMP at fixed NAD (500 μm) is well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), with values of Km = 20 ± 3 μm and kcat = 1.3 ± 0.2 s–1(Fig. 3A). In contrast, substrate inhibition is observed when varying the concentration of NAD at a fixed saturating IMP (250 μm; Fig. 3B). This NAD inhibition is commonly observed in IMPDH and is attributed to the formation of an E-XMP*·NAD complex (11Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The data were fit to an equation describing uncompetitive substrate inhibition (Equation 2) (11Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Zhou X. Cahoon M. Rosa P. Hedstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21977-21981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The apparent value of Km for NAD is 110 ± 20 μm, kcat = 1.6 ± 0.3 s–1, and the value of Kii is 2.9 ± 0.7 mm. To further probe the kinetic mechanism of C. parvum IMPDH, initial velocity was measured at varying concentrations of IMP and varying fixed concentrations of NAD. The concentrations of NAD were less than 0.1 × Kii so that substrate inhibition would be negligible. The double reciprocal plot displayed an intersecting line pattern indicating formation of an E·IMP·NAD complex (Fig. 3C). The data were fit to an equation describing a random addition of substrates (Equation 3): kcat = 3.3 ± 0.2 s–1, Km(IMP) = 29 ± 3 μm, Km(NAD) = 150 ± 20 μm, in good agreement with the preliminary experiments described above. These values are significantly different from the kinetic parameters of the human isozymes (Table I), demonstrating that the active site of the parasite enzyme is functionally different from the human enzymes.Table IComparison of the kinetic parameters of C. parvum, human, and E. coli IMPDHsParameterC. parvumHuman type 2Human type 1E. colikcat (s-1)3.3 ± 0.20.4aSee Ref. 12; assays performed at 25 °C.1.8bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.13cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Km(IMP) (μm)29 ± 34aSee Ref. 12; assays performed at 25 °C.14bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.61cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Km(NAD) (μm)150 ± 206aSee Ref. 12; assays performed at 25 °C.42bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.2000cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Kii(NAD) (mm)2.9 ± 0.70.59aSee Ref. 12; assays performed at 25 °C.ND2.8cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Kis(GMP) (μm) (C, IMP)46 ± 3100dSee Ref. 32; isozyme undetermined.100dSee Ref. 32; isozyme undetermined.86cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Kis(MZP) (nm) (C, IMP)11 ± 33.9bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.8.2bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.0.5cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Kii(MPA) (nm) (UC, NAD)9300 ± 3006bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.11bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.≥10,000fSee Refs. 20 and 34.Kii(CH2-TAD) (nm) (UC, NAD)600 ± 4060eSee Ref. 35; assays performed at 25 °C.95bSee Ref. 30; assays performed at 37 °C.8500cSee Ref. 15; assays performed at 25 °C.Ki(ADP) (mm) (NAD)42 ± 6 (NC)8.8 (C)eSee Ref. 35; assays performed at 25 °C.NDNDKi(tiazofurin) (mm) (NAD)1.5 ± 0.1gApparent Ki at 250 μm IMP and 250 μm NAD.1.3 (NC)eSee Ref. 35; assays performed at 25 °C.NDNDα0.2 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.3eSee Ref. 35; assays performed at 25 °C.NDNDa See Ref. 12Wang W.

Open table in a new tab Probing the Mechanism of C. parvum IMPDH with NAD Analogs—APAD is a good substrate for C. parvum IMPDH, as is observed for IMPDHs from most organisms. At saturating IMP concentrations (250 μm), the initial velocity versus APAD data are well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation (data not shown) with values of Km(APAD) = 175 μm and kcat = 1.4 s–1 (Table II). This value is very similar to the value of kcat for the reaction with NAD determined under similar conditions (see above). APAD has a much higher reduction potential than NAD, so the rate of the hydride transfer step should be much faster than for NAD. Since the value of kcat is the same for the reactions of APAD and NAD, hydride transfer is not the rate-limiting step in the reaction of C. parvum IMPDH. Likewise, the similarity of the values of kcat for the two dinucleotides suggests that the rate of NADH release is not rate-limiting, since this rate should be different for reduced APADH. Therefore, the hydrolysis of E-XMP* is the most likely rate-limiting step (11Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Wang W. Hedstrom L.

In the studies reported here the functional significance of EGR-1 expression during liver regeneration was examined by characterizing the hepatic regenerative response to partial hepatectomy in Egr-1 null mice. The results of these studies showed that liver regeneration in Egr-1 null mice is impaired. Although activation of interleukin-6-STAT3 signaling, regulation of expression of hepatic C/ebpα, C/ebpβ, cyclin D, and cyclin E and progression through the first wave of hepatocellular DNA synthesis occurred appropriately following partial hepatectomy in Egr-1 null mice, subsequent signaling events and cell cycle progression after the first round of DNA synthesis were deranged. This derangement was characterized by increased activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibition of hepatocellular metaphase-to-anaphase mitotic progression. Together these observations suggest that EGR-1 is an important regulator of hepatocellular mitotic progression. In support of this, microarray-based gene expression analysis showed that induction of expression of the cell division cycle 20 gene (Cdc20), a key regulator of the mitotic anaphase-promoting complex, is significantly reduced in Egr-1 null mice.

The liver regenerates in response to many forms of injury (1Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Diehl A.M. Rai R. Schiff E.R. Sorrell M.F. Maddrey W.C.

Liver regeneration is important for recovery from the functional hepatic deficits induced by such injuries and for host health and viability. Following injury, hepatic regeneration is precisely regulated in its initiation and proceeds only until the original liver mass is restored. This process does not depend upon a stem cell population; rather, all of the normally quiescent mature cellular populations of the liver have the potential to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Hepatocytes are the first to replicate, followed sequentially by biliary epithelial, Kupffer, stellate, and sinusoidal endothelial cells (3Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar). Normal liver architecture, distorted during the regenerative response, is then restored. Regeneration continues until normal hepatic function, mass, and structure are restored, and then it is precisely terminated as hepatocytes re-enter their pre-replicative state of quiescence. Although some aspects of the molecular machinery that control this carefully orchestrated response to injury are now known, many of the mechanisms involved in regulating liver regeneration remain incompletely understood. Elucidation of these signaling pathways in greater detail offers the potential to increase our understanding of the hepatic regenerative response in acute and chronic liver diseases, and may ultimately lead to novel therapeutic strategies for enhancing liver regeneration after hepatic injury. Furthermore, such studies could provide a paradigm for analyses of tissue regeneration in other organ systems. Partial hepatectomy has been an important model system for investigating the molecular signaling pathways that regulate the hepatic regenerative response (4Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch.

J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGR-1, which is also known as NGFI-A, KROX-24, ZIF268, and TIS8, is a zinc finger transcription factor induced as part of the immediate-early gene expression program in the regenerating liver (15Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17Peng Y. Du K. Ramirez S. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4513-4520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EGR-1 was first identified based on its rapid induction in rat PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor (18Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that EGR-1 expression is induced in a variety of models of cellular proliferation during the transition from G0 to G1 and also in models of cellular differentiation (19Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T.

Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar); however, the specific functional role of EGR-1 in these models has not been defined. In fact, analyses of Egr-1-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells indicate that EGR-1 activity is not required for ES cell proliferation or differentiation, and Egr-1 null mice exhibit a normal growth rate and lack any obvious defects in cellular differentiation (23Lee S.L. Tourtellotte L.C. Wesselschmidt R.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9971-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether EGR-1 expression is required for normal liver regeneration, the response of Egr-1 null mice to partial hepatectomy was evaluated. The results of these analyses showed that EGR-1 deficiency is associated with an impaired hepatic regenerative response that is characterized by delayed hepatocellular progression through the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. These data provide evidence for a novel functional role for EGR-1 in hepatocellular mitotic progression during liver regeneration. Animal Husbandry—Egr-1 null mice were derived from heterozygous (Egr-1 +/-) mating pairs on a C57Bl/6 background (provided by Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt, Washington University School of Medicine). The derivation of these mice has been described previously (24Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Wild type (+/+) sibling offspring were used as controls. Mice were maintained on 12-h dark/light cycles and on a standard diet of ad libitum mouse chow and water before and after surgery. All experiments were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University and conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the criteria outlined in the “Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (National Institutes of Health publication 86-23). Animal Surgery—Egr-1 null (-/-) and wild type (+/+) mice were subjected to partial hepatectomy or sham surgery under methoxyflurane anesthesia as described previously (4Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar, 9Rudnick D.A. Perlmutter D.H. Muglia L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8885-8890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All surgeries were performed between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. Animals aroused within 30 min of surgery and were returned to their cages with ad libitum access to food and water. At serial times after the surgery animals were sacrificed, and their livers were harvested either into formalin fixative for histological evaluation of hepatocellular proliferation or snap-frozen into liquid nitrogen for mRNA preparation for gene expression analyses or cellular lysate generation for immunoblot analyses. Two BrdUrd labeling strategies were employed for analyses of hepatocellular proliferation. In the first, sustained release BrdUrd-containing osmotic pumps (Alza, Newark, DE) were implanted into animals at the time of surgery, thereby labeling all hepatocytes that replicated over the entire course of the experiment. For this approach, the BrdUrd-containing pumps, which delivered a flow rate of BrdUrd of 1 μl/h (20 μg/ml, 20 μg/h), were placed intraperitoneally at the time of the surgery. In the second method, animals were injected with 100 mg/kg BrdUrd 1 h before sacrifice at serial times after partial hepatectomy, thereby labeling only those hepatocytes that were dividing at the time of sacrifice. Histology—Liver tissue was fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and prepared for histological analysis. Paraffin-embedded sections of liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and for immunohistochemical assessment of hepatocellular BrdUrd incorporation (using the BrdUrd Immunohistochemistry kit, Oncogene, Boston). For each tissue section, the frequency of hepatocellular nuclear BrdUrd labeling as well as mitotic body frequency was determined by examination of at least three different random ×400 fields and at least 300 cells and nuclei. Mitotic bodies were classified as pre-anaphase or anaphase/post-anaphase based on histomorphological evidence for the absence or presence of chromatid segregation. Serum IL-6 Determination—Serum IL-6 was determined by ELISA as described (9Rudnick D.A. Perlmutter D.H. Muglia L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8885-8890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were made from snapfrozen liver as described previously (9Rudnick D.A. Perlmutter D.H. Muglia L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8885-8890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Twenty five μg of total cellular protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. Filters were probed with primary antibody (EGR-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; p38, phospho-p38, phospho-MKK 3/6, STAT3, phospho-STAT3, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed with Scion Image data analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). RNA Preparation—Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver tissue using Triazol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification using the RNeasy total RNA clean-up protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity was assessed by formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by 260 nm absorbance. Real Time RT-PCR-based Gene Expression Analysis—The mRNA expression of C/ebpα, C/ebpβ, cyclin D, cyclin E, Egr-1, Prl-1, and Cdc20 was evaluated by using real time RT-PCR. For these studies, total mRNA, prepared as described above from wild type and Egr-1 null mouse liver harvested at serial time points after partial hepatectomy, was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by the SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen). For each gene analyzed, an aliquot of cDNA was added to a reaction mixture containing gene-specific forward and reverse primers (C/ebpα, forward primer, 5′-CCTGAGAGCTCCTTGGTCA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GAAACCATCCTCTGGGTCTC-3′; C/ebpβ, forward primer, 5′-ACGACTTCCTCTCCGACCT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GAGGCTCACGTAACCGTAGTC-3′; cyclin D, forward primer, 5′-GAAGGAGACCATTCCCTTGA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTTCACCAGAAGCAGTTCCA-3′; cyclin E, forward primer, 5′-CTCGGGTGTTGTAGGTTGCT-3′, and reverse primer: 5′-CTGTTGGCTGACAGTGGAGA-3′; Egr-1, forward primer, 5′-GGCGATGGTGGAGACGAGT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CGGCCAGTATAGGTGATGGG-3′; Prl-1, forward primer, 5′-ATTGCTGTCCATTGTGTCGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CACCTTCAATTAATGCTAGGGCA-3; Cdc20 forward primer, 5′-GAGCTCAAAGGACACACAGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCACAACCGTAGAGTCTCA-3′), deoxynucleotides, TaqDNA polymerase, and SYBR (Bio-Rad). Quantification of cDNA was based on monitoring increased SYBR fluorescence during exponential phase amplification in a real time PCR Machine (Bio-Rad) and determination of the PCR cycle number at which the amplified product exceeded a defined threshold (the “crossing threshold”). These data were standardized to the expression of β2-microglobulin, a constitutively expressed transcript commonly used as a reference mRNA in analyses of gene expression during hepatic regeneration (15Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the standardized data were used to calculate fold differences in gene expression (User Bulletin 2, ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specificity of this assay was verified for each analyzed gene by confirmation of predicted product size and uniformity using melt curves and agarose electrophoresis of the PCR products. Specificity was further confirmed by simultaneous analysis of a “reverse-transcribed” reaction mixture containing all components except reverse transcriptase. cDNA Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis—Total hepatic mRNA was recovered from regenerating wild type or Egr-1 null mouse livers harvested 48 h after partial hepatectomy as described above. For each genotype, equal quantities of purified mRNA from replicate animals were pooled, and 10 μg of this mixture was submitted to the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center Genomics Core Facility (Washington University School of Medicine) for cDNA microarray-based gene expression analysis. From each of the pooled samples, single-stranded cDNA probes containing either unique Cy3- (for wild type RNA) or Cy5 (for Egr-1 null RNA)-binding oligonucleotide extensions were synthesized using the 3DNA Array350 Expression Array Detection kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These probes were mixed, purified, concentrated, and hybridized to the NIA mouse 20k cDNA Microarray (25Tanaka T.S. Jaradat S.A. Lim M.K. Kargul G.J. Wang X. Grahovac M.J. Pantano S. Sano Y. Piao Y. Nagaraja R. Doi H. Wood III, W.H. Becker K.G. Ko M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9127-9132Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), after which the detection reagent containing primer-coupled Cy3 and Cy5 was prepared, mixed, and hybridized to the chip. After chip hybridization and washing performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, the microarrays were scanned by the GenePix Array Scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The resulting image data were captured, converted to numerical fluorescence signal output, and imported into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). As for the real time RT-PCR analyses described above, gene expression data were normalized to β2-microglobulin. The data set was filtered by removal of genes whose expression fell below a threshold level of fluorescence intensity (absolute fluorescence intensity <300) in both samples or were “flagged” based on nonuniform fluorescence intensity. For the remaining genes, expression in the wild type liver was compared with that in Egr-1 null mouse liver, and genes that were induced or suppressed at least 3-fold were identified. These criteria were selected based on experience indicating that they have a high probability of identifying differences in gene expression that can be independently validated by other methods of analysis. 2D. A. Rudnick and B. K. Dieckgraefe, unpublished observations. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using Sigma Plot software (SPSS, Chicago). Analysis of variance for multiple groups was used to determine statistical significance for BrdUrd labeling, mitotic body frequency, gene expression, and densitometry data. Results are reported as means ± S.E. p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Hepatocellular Proliferation during Liver Regeneration in Egr-1 Null Mice—In order to determine whether EGR-1 expression is required for normal liver regeneration, the hepatic regenerative response to partial hepatectomy in wild type and Egr-1 null mice was examined. First, mice were subjected to partial hepatectomy and simultaneously implanted with a BrdUrd-containing sustained release osmotic pump at the time of surgery. The animals were allowed to recover, then sacrificed, and their livers harvested at 48 and 72 h after surgery. These times for analysis were chosen because they correspond to completion of this first wave of hepatocellular DNA synthesis (48 h) and of the majority of hepatocellular DNA synthesis (72 h), respectively, during murine hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy (9Rudnick D.A. Perlmutter D.H. Muglia L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8885-8890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Liver tissue was analyzed for hepatocellular BrdUrd incorporation which, with this methodology, provides an integrated measure of hepatocellular proliferation over the time course of the experiment. The data from this analysis showed that there is comparable hepatocellular proliferation in wild type and Egr-1 null mice 48 h after partial hepatectomy (62 ± 10% versus 42 ± 9%, p = 0.12), indicating that progression through the first wave of hepatocellular DNA synthesis is not significantly delayed in Egr-1 null mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of liver harvested 72 h after partial hepatectomy showed that hepatocellular proliferation continues to increase from 48 to 72 h in wild type mice (p < 0.01) but not in Egr-1 null mice (p = 0.42), and that at 72 h after partial hepatectomy such proliferation is significantly greater in the wild type compared with the null mouse liver (82 ± 4% versus 53 ± 7%, p < 0.001; Fig. 1, A and B). In order to determine whether this abnormality in hepatic regeneration in Egr-1 null mice results from a delay before or after the first wave of hepatocellular DNA synthesis, another series of experiments was performed in which mice were subjected to partial hepatectomy, allowed to recover, and then injected with BrdUrd 1 h prior to sacrifice at 36 and 48 h after partial hepatectomy. In this case, analysis of hepatocellular BrdUrd incorporation identifies only those hepatocytes undergoing replication at the time of sacrifice. These time points of analysis were selected because they correspond to the peak of the initial wave (36 h) and the beginning of the second wave (48 h) of hepatocellular DNA synthesis following partial hepatectomy (6Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The data from this experiment showed that hepatocellular proliferation is comparable between wild type and Egr-1 null mice at 36 h after partial hepatectomy (37 ± 12% versus 34 ± 7%, p = 0.82) but significantly reduced in Egr-1 null mice at 48 h after surgery (22 ± 2% versus 12 ± 2%, p < 0.04, Fig. 2, A and B). Taken together, these data show that in Egr-1 null mice liver regeneration proceeds relatively normally through the first round of hepatocellular DNA synthesis but that thereafter hepatocellular cell cycle progression is significantly delayed.Fig. 2Hepatocellular proliferation in wild type and Egr-1 null mice after partial hepatectomy using the BrdUrd injection methodology.A, percentage of hepatocytes that label with BrdUrd at 36 and 48 h after partial hepatectomy in wild type and Egr-1 null mice (3–6 animals for each time point and genotype; *, p = 0.82 versus 36 h wild type; **, p < 0.04 versus 48 h wild type.

Original magnification ×200.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Early Signaling Events during Liver Regeneration in Egr-1 Null Mice—A number of early molecular signaling events induced by partial hepatectomy and required for appropriate initiation of hepatocellular proliferation during liver regeneration have been identified. For example, the tumor necrosis factor-α-IL-6-STAT3 cytokine signaling pathway is necessary for normal initiation of hepatic regeneration, with induction of serum IL-6 and activation of hepatic STAT3 peaking 4–6 h after partial hepatectomy (6Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 26Li W. Liang X. Kellendonk C. Poli V. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28411-28417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Another early signaling event characteristic of and necessary for normal liver regeneration is the induction of hepatic expression of C/ebpβ (14Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This occurs at the same time that hepatic C/ebpα expression is suppressed. These and other early signaling events direct the induction of expression of the G1 cyclins D and E, which peak 48 h after partial hepatectomy and regulate hepatocellular G1-S progression and DNA synthesis (1Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to provide further evidence that the disruption of hepatic regeneration in Egr-1-deficient animals is downstream of the first wave of hepatocellular DNA synthesis, the regulation of these early signaling events was evaluated in Egr-1 null mice. First, the induction of IL-6 and activation of STAT3 were investigated by ELISA and immunoblot, respectively. The results showed that each of these signals is comparably induced 6 h after partial hepatectomy in Egr-1 null and wild type mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, changes in hepatic expression of C/ebpα and C/ebpβ were evaluated by real time RT-PCR, and the results showed identical changes in the expression of each of these transcription factors 6 h after partial hepatectomy in Egr-1 null versus wild type mice (Fig. 3C). Finally, the regulation of expression of cyclins D and E was determined, and again the results showed that the induction of each of these G1-S cell cycle regulators occurs appropriately 48 h after partial hepatectomy in Egr-1 null mice. Together, these data demonstrate that the early signaling events leading up to the initial round of hepatocellular G1-S progression occur normally in Egr-1 null mice. Regulation of Hepatic p38 MAP Kinase Activity during Liver Regeneration in Egr-1 Null Mice—p38 MAP kinase activity is an important negative regulator of cell cycle progression, including progression through stages subsequent to DNA synthesis (27Ambrosino C. Nebreda A.R. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Bulavin D.V. Amundson S.A. Fornace A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Takenaka K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Science. 1998; 280: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether delayed hepatocellular cell cycle progression during liver regeneration in Egr-1 null mice is associated with deranged activation (by phosphorylation) of p38, the steady state levels of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase in wild type and Egr-1 null regenerating liver were compared with each other. First the temporal pattern of regulation of p38 activity in normal regenerating liver was determined by immunoblot analysis of quiescent and regenerating liver for phosphorylated and total p38. The results showed that phosphorylated p38 is present in quiescent liver, decreases from 2 to 24 h after partial hepatectomy, increases 36 h after partial hepatectomy, and then declines again at 48 h after partial hepatectomy (Fig. 4A). These changes were specific for regenerating liver as they were not induced by sham surgery (data not shown). Comparable amounts of total p38 were detectable in quiescent and regenerating liver at all time points examined (Fig. 4A). Thus, the hepatectomy-induced changes in hepatic levels of phosphorylated p38 are mediated by regulation of p38 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and not by changes in the level of total p38. Next"

Here, the crystal structure of monomeric OC17, determined at a resolution of 1.5 Å, was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.1%. This is the first protein directly involved in a non-pathological biomineralization process resolved by x-ray diffraction to date. The protein has a mixed α/β structure containing a single C-type lectin-like domain. However, although OC17 shares the conserved scaffold of the C-type lectins, it does not bind carbohydrates. Nevertheless, in vitro OC17 modifies the crystalline habit of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and the pattern of crystal growth at intervals of 5–200 μg/ml. Determining the three-dimensional structure of OC17 contributes to a better understanding of the biological behavior of structurally related biomolecules and of the mechanisms involved in eggshell and other mineralization processes.

Determining the three-dimensional structure of OC17 contributes to a better understanding of the biological behavior of structurally related biomolecules and of the mechanisms involved in eggshell and other mineralization processes. The avian eggshell is a highly ordered nanocomposite structure that is deposited in an acellular milieu. It is secreted by the distal part of the oviduct, the uterus, and isthmus, and it is in the latter that the inner and the outer shell membranes are produced (1Roberts J.R. Brackpool C.E. Poult. Sci. Rev. 1994; 5: 245-272Google Scholar). During the transition in the isthmus (tubular shell gland) and the uterus, spherulitic crystal growth is initiated by the deposition of calcium carbonate onto specific protein aggregates that are the precursors of the mammillary knobs (2Nys Y. Hincke M.T. Arias J.L. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. Solomon S.E. Poult. Avian. Biol. Rev. 1999; 10: 143-166Google Scholar). Indeed, some of the most important macromolecules that regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of calcite are present in these knobs. Thereafter, the bulk of the calcite is deposited in the uterus, a process that is controlled by competitive crystal growth and that gives rise to the cone and palisade layers (3, Garcia-Ruiz, J. M. & Rodriguez-Navarro, A. B. (1994). in 7th International Symposium on Biomineralization. (Allemand, D. & Cuif, J-P., eds) pp. 85, Bulletin de l'Institut océanographique, Numéro spécial 14, 1. MonacoGoogle Scholar). As a result, two preferred crystallographic orientations are generated and reach a maximum toward the surface of the palisade layer (4Silyn-Roberts H. Sharp R.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 227: 303-324Crossref Google Scholar). A complex array of proteins exists in the uterine fluid and eggshell extract of Gallus gallus. Although one family of matrix proteins corresponds to the egg white proteins:lysozyme (14.4 kDa), ovotransferrin (78 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa; Refs. 5Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Panheleux M.

Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), another group of proteins in the eggshell is the bone matrix proteins osteopontin and sialoprotein (7Solomon S. Br. Poultry. Sci. 1999; 40: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, the third group of proteins that is specifically found in the uterus includes the ovocleidins and ovocalyxins. Indeed, ovocleidin-116 has been cloned and corresponds to the core protein of an eggshell dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (8Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Tsang C.P. McKee M.D. Nys Y. J. Biol.

The intramineral protein ovocleidin-17 (OC17) 1The abbreviations used are: OC17, ovocleidin-17; RMBP, rat mannose-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: OC17, ovocleidin-17; RMBP, rat mannose-binding protein. is an abundant component of the soluble fraction, and it is also glycosylated (OC23, Ref. 9Mann K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This protein can be obtained by acidic extraction of the G. gallus eggshell, and when sequenced it was shown to contain 142 amino acids including two phosphorylated serines (10Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this amino acid sequence, OC17 was seen to contain a C-type lectin-like domain (11Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) similar to lithostathine in human pancreatic stones (12Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and perlucin of the nacreous layer of Haliotis laevigata shell (13Mann K. Weiss I.M. André S. Gabius H.-J. Fritz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5257-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Weiss M. Kaufmann S. Mann K. Fritz M. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Comm. 2000; 267: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Notably, all of these C-type lectin-like domain-containing proteins are associated with the mineral phase of calcium carbonate. OC17 is the major protein component of the eggshell matrix and one of the best candidates to regulate mineral deposition. However, the binding of carbohydrates in a Ca2+-dependent manner typical of C-type lectins has not been attributed to this protein. OC17 is remarkably well conserved in the eggshell matrix of a number of avian species, suggesting that it plays a fundamental role in the process of eggshell formation (15Panheleux M. Bain M. Fernández M.S. Morales I. Gautron J. Arias J.L. Solomon S.E. Hincke M. Nys Y. Br. Poultry. Sci. 1999; 40: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, a specific antiserum against OC17 shows that it is present in the mammillary knobs, the palisade layer, and in the tubular gland cells of the shell gland (16Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P.W. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our aim is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the phenomena of CaCO3 biomineralization, which may be useful when considering the possible biomimetical applications. With this in mind, we have centered our efforts on studying the proteins that play an important role in crystal growth during the eggshell formation. Here, for the first time, we describe the three-dimensional structure of a non-pathological protein involved in a biomineralization process, OC17. In addition, we developed a preliminary model of the protein-calcite interaction based on our scanning electron and atomic force microscopy observations. Crystallization and Data Collection—Ovocleidin-17 was purified and crystallized as described by Reyes-Grajeda et al. (17Reyes-Grajeda J.P. Jáuregui-Zúñiga D. Rodríguez-Romero A. Hernández-Santoyo A. Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Moreno A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2002; 9: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystals of OC17 were grown at 4 °C by sitting droplet vapor diffusion. The protein solution, 5 μl of 6 mg ml-1, was added to 5 μl of reservoir buffer (6% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6), and the droplets were equilibrated with 1 ml of reservoir buffer. Crystals grew over 10–20 days reaching maximum dimensions of 0.2 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm. A complete data set was collected from a single crystal at a resolution of 1.5 Å at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BM14S (Grenoble, France) with a MarCCD detector system using a crystal to a detector distance of 80 mm and a wavelength of 0.97 Å. All data were integrated using the MOSFLM program (18Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 55: 1696-1702Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and then reduced with SCALE and TRUNCATE (19Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), yielding a unique data set of 26,123 reflections with a Rmerge factor of 6.3%. The crystals belonged to the P3221 space group with one monomer/asymmetric unit corresponding to a 45% (v/v) solvent content. The data collection parameters and statistics are presented in Table I.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP3221Unit cell parameters (Å)a = b = 58.26, c = 82.46Resolution limit (Å)1.5Specific volume2.38Number of molecules in the asymmetric unit1Number of unique reflections26,123Completeness (%, last shell)99.5 (98.5)RmergeaRmerge = Σ|Ihkl - 〈Ihkl〉|/ ΣIhkl6.3Crystallographic refinementResolution range (Å)7.98-1.5Number of reflections26,123RfactorbRfactor = Σhkl ‖Fo| - |Fc‖/Σhkl|Fo| for all data except 10%, which was used for the Rfree calculation (%)0.20Rfree (%)0.218Number of non-H protein atoms1046Number of water molecules153Root mean square deviations from ideal valuesBond lengths (Å)0.005Bond angles (°)1.3Dihedral angles (°)22.7Improper angles (°)3.94a Rmerge = Σ|Ihkl - 〈Ihkl〉|/ ΣIhklb Rfactor = Σhkl ‖Fo| - |Fc‖/Σhkl|Fo| for all data except 10%, which was used for the Rfree calculation Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the native OC17 crystal was solved by molecular replacement with the AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) program using data up to 3.5 Å. The search model was derived from the human pancreatic stones lithostathine (1lit) at 1.55 Å resolution. The rotational search showed two solutions with relatively low correlation values of 2.8 and 2.4σ. A translational search and rigid body fitting for these two solutions produced a correlation value of 0.28 (R-value of 48.1%) over 0.15 for the next highest peak. This solution was applied to the model, and the resulting coordinates were then used for refinement. The initial model, oriented and positioned according to the molecular replacement solution, was examined using the program TURBO/FRODO (21Jones T.A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). To improve the model, rounds of model building and iterative simulated annealing were performed using torsion angle dynamics (starting at T = 5000 K with a cooling rate of 50 K/cycle), energy minimization, and B-factor refinement using CNS tasks (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). At this point the model still had ambiguous zones (Rwork 41.2%, Rfree 46.6%, with ∼10% of reflections in the test set for cross validation). The refinement started at a resolution of 2.5 Å with temperature factors for all atoms set to 20 Å2. By increasing the resolution stepwise, the model was refined to a resolution of 1.5 Å. The combination of crystallographic refinement and model building improved the initial model, solving the ambiguities. Water molecules were automatically inserted using CNS and accepted if the corresponding Fo - Fc density map was at least 3.0σ and the geometric requirements for hydrogen bonding were fulfilled. Finally, one phosphate group was modeled and refined to fit the extra electron density found in the vicinity of Ser61. The crystallographic R-factor of the model is 20.1% for all unique reflections at a 1.5-Å resolution (Rfree = 21.8%). Crystal Growth Experiments—Crystallization experiments were carried out at 18 °C inside an ad hoc designed chamber for the synthesis of CaCO3 crystals. This system maintains the same CO2 vapor pressure generated by the decomposition of ammonium carbonate (25 mm). The chamber is composed of a dual-glass Petri dish in which one of the compartments holds several glass coverslips onto which the OC17 could be poured. In all the experiments the concentration of CaCl2 was 0.1 m in a volume of 50-μl. For each experiment, different concentrations of OC17 were added to the droplet (5–200 μg/ml). After 3 days the crystals were rinsed with Milli-Q water, air-dried, and prepared for a scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis using JEOL JSM9000 LV scanning electron microscopy at 20 kV. Atomic Force Microscopy Studies on OC17 Nanospheres—Samples of aqueous OC17 for tapping mode atomic force microscopy were prepared by adsorbing several microliters of protein solution (1 μg/ml) at room temperature onto freshly cleaved mica. This sample was incubated during 30 min. The surface was then lightly rinsed with double distilled water and dried at room temperature. A Nanoscope-IIIa from DIGITAL Instruments was used for atomic force microscopy acquisition. The atomic force microscopy images were obtained in tapping mode at room temperature in air at a scanning rate of 1.0 Hz for different scan sizes. The installed NanoScope Software (Version 4.42r7) was used to produce three-dimensional color graphics. Structure Determination—We first established the conditions that yielded crystals of OC17 that belonged to the trigonal space group P3221 (a = b = 58.26 Å and c = 82.46 Å) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. These crystals were used to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the previously reported lithostathine structure as a search probe (12Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the final model, the first three N-terminal residues Asp1, Pro2, and Asp3 were ill defined and were therefore not incorporated into the model. In addition, the side chains at the surface loop Gly64-Gly68 were also poorly defined in the electron density maps. Nevertheless, the root mean square deviations were 0.005 Å from the ideal bond lengths and 1.3° from the ideal bond angles. Calculations with the program PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that almost all residues (93.6%) in the asymmetric unit were located in the most favorable regions, with none of the residues in the disallowed regions. The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table I. The crystallized OC17 is 142 amino acids in length and contains a single C-type lectin-like domain (24Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. Proteins. 2003; 52: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) of 46 × 44 × 38 Å (Fig. 1). The general topology is that of a mixed α/β structure, which is comprised of three α-helices and eight β-strands, the latter being clustered in two oppositely oriented antiparallel β-sheets (β1-β2-β8-β3 and β5-β4-β6-β7). The structure can be divided into two parts. A lower part of the molecule containing the two major helices α1 and α2, which are oriented perpendicular to one another and surround the four β-strands (β1, β2, β8, and β3). The upper half includes the second four-stranded (β5-β4-β6-β7) β-sheet with a short 310 helix connecting strands β5 and β6. The OC17 structure is further stabilized by three disulfide bridges (Fig. 2A), which are conserved in the long-form C-type lectins. 2Available at us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/prosite-search-ac?PDOC00537. Thus, in the lower half of the molecule, the Cys5-Cys16 bridge connects the loop preceding strand β1 with the N terminus of the β2 strand, whereas the other disulfide bond (Cys33-Cys138) joins α1 to β8. In the top half of the molecule, a disulfide bridge between Cys113-Cys130 cross-links strand β6 to the preceding β8 loop.Fig. 2Aspects of the OC17 structure.A,2Fo - Fc electron density map of the Cys5-Cys16 disulfide bridge with a cutoff level of 1.0σ at 1.5 Å resolution. B, final refined 2Fo - Fc electron density, contoured at 1.0σ, around Ser61. The electron density observed in the vicinity of Ser61 was unambiguously pinpointed to a covalently attached phosphoryl molecule. Ser(P)61 is located at the C-terminal end of the α2-helix in the loop connecting α2 with β4 in the lower lobe of the structure. The figure was drawn with TURBO/FRODO (21Jones T.A. J. Appl. Cryst. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar). The red sphere represents a water molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given that the major form of OC17 is a phosphoprotein with two phosphorylated serines (Ser61 and Ser67, Ref. 10Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphoryl group density observed in the vicinity of Ser61 was not unexpected. Structurally, the electron density was unambiguously pinpointed to a covalently attached tetrahedral component (Fig. 2B). Ser(P)61 is located at the C-terminal end of the α2-helix in the loop connecting α2 with β4 in the lower lobe of the structure. However, it was not possible to model the potential phosphorylation at Ser67 because of a disordered region in the crystal structure. The phosphoryl group at Ser61 might interact specifically with Ca2+ ions. However, when we soaked OC17 crystals in a solution of calcium chloride to determine specific binding sites, we did not find any changes in density that might correspond to the attachment of Ca2+ ions in a Fo - Fc electron density map. It is possible that the chemical affinity of OC17 is more specific to carbonate than Ca2+ ions, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. Structural Relationship with Other C-type Lectin Domains— The sequence of OC17 was aligned with several proteins associated with crystal growth in a mineral phase, as well as with the rat mannose-binding protein (RMBP) that is the prototype of the C-type lectin fold (Table II). RMBP was the only protein belonging to the short C-type lectin domain with two disulfide bridges (as shown in Table II). In RMBP, the carbohydrate recognition domain consists of a compactly folded region that contains a series of loops stabilized by two Ca2+ ions. Carbohydrate binding occurs directly and is coordinated by one of the Ca2+ ions designated as the principal calcium. Interactions with several side chains via hydrogen bonds produces a structure that selectively binds Ca2+, thereby forming an intimately linked ternary complex of protein, Ca2+, and sugar (25Ng K. Kolatkar A. Park-Snyder S. Feinberg H. Clark D. Drickamer K. Weis W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16088-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, OC17 and lithostathine do not conserve the residues implicated in the association with Ca2+. Thus, as a consequence of both sequence and structural differences, the calcium-binding sites in the mannose-binding protein are not present in either OC17 or lithostathine. Indeed, the failure to bind to carbohydrates was demonstrated by means of hemagglutination assays.Table IIAmino acid sequence alignment of OC17 with related proteins ansocalcin (34Lakshminarayanan R.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5257-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and RMBP Conserved residues are highlighted grey (>50% conservation) or black (100% conservation). The six amino acids that bind the main Ca2+ ion in RMBP are indicated with a black triangle. Open table in a new tab When the structure of OC17 was analyzed, the potential calcium-binding site in the 310 helix region, corresponding to residues Ala105–Arg109, was seen to be highly positive charged. This implies that the putative calcium-binding site is lost as a result of repulsive forces, thereby preventing the binding of carbohydrates. Unlike lithostathine, the sequence homology between OC17 and RMBP is very low in this region. Nevertheless, although the sequence identity of 32% between the pancreatic inhibitor of stone formation (lithostathine) and OC17 is relatively low, they share a common tertiary architecture (Fig. 3) with a root mean square deviation for all of the Cα atoms of 0.86 Å. The main structural variability was found in the regions of the loops and turns. Until now the structural data available for this large family has demonstrated a common scaffold with a variety of functions in the C-type lectin-like domain fold, which can bind carbohydrates, proteins, and in-organic substrates (24Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. Proteins. 2003; 52: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hence the familial relationships regarding protein folding may result from convergent evolution and may reflect the specificity for certain minerals and biocomposites. Surface Features and Mechanistic Implications—The electrostatic potential on the surface of OC17 reveals a regular distribution of charged residues and a particularly eye-catching feature is the high degree of polarization at the top of the molecule (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, on one side of the OC17 molecule, the surface of the protein presents an extended solvent-exposed basic stretch including 17 of the 21 basic residues. The concentration of the positive charge in OC17 is distributed mostly in a pseudo ring around the molecule with the greatest extension at the top. This can be seen in a close-up view of successive rotating images of the electrostatic charges in three consecutive positions (rotating 120° each, see Fig. 4B). Accordingly, this charge distribution intuitively implies the binding of the calcite ionic crystal surface through a periodic array of local binding sites for ions of opposite charge. This assumption is reinforced by the fact that solvent-exposed residues are conserved, as depicted in Fig. 4B, mainly clustered at the top part of the molecule. The high degree of polarization coupled to a unique array of positive charges on its surface strongly supports the idea that binding could be directed through the interaction with carbonate ions. Interestingly, lithostathine has been implicated in the inhibition of the growth and nucleation of calcium carbonate crystals (12Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Gerbaud V. Pignol D. Loret E. Bertrand J.A. Berland Y. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. Canselier J.-P. Gabast N. Verdier J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and shows a highly acidic polarized surface distribution (Fig. 4C). In turn, these subtle differences in the location of surface residues may explain the functional differences between OC17 and lithostathine despite the presence of a conserved C-type lectin domain scaffold. Protein-Crystal Interaction, a Preliminary Model—The influence of the purified OC17 upon calcite crystallization was also investigated in vitro, and some of the more representative calcite crystal structures formed in the presence of the OC17 are shown in Fig. 5. As expected, the common rhombohedral habit of calcite crystals was observed in the absence of the protein (Fig. 5a). However, in the presence of OC17 there was a strong aggregation of calcite crystals in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to that observed in the mammillary zone of the G. gallus eggshell (Fig. 5b). Indeed, the fact that OC17 is found in the mammillary knob could explain the aggregation of calcite crystals in the presence of OC17 in vitro. Using atomic force microscopy techniques, we showed that the aggregation of the protein into nanospheres (Fig. 6) might promote the formation of nucleation centers that would directly influence the aggregation of calcite crystals. This is a similar phenomenon to the model proposed for the amelogenin proteins involved in the biomineralization of dental enamel (27Moradian-Oldak J. Tan J. Fincham A.G. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct.

The atomic force microscopy images show the aggregation of the protein into nanospheres that might promote the formation of nucleation centers and would directly influence the aggregation of calcite crystals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of the large extent of the surface of OC17 that is positively charged and the aggregates that tend to form, it may be possible that large surfaces are exposed to interactions with carbonate ions or with specific crystal lattices of calcite. Hence, we propose a preliminary CaCO3 protein-CaCO3 interaction model, where nanospheres are responsible for the control and nucleation of crystals. However, we cannot discard the influence of synergistic interactions and other macromolecular constituents, although this would have to be tested to fully understand the process of eggshell biomineralization and draw inferences regarding the function of similar proteins in other biological systems. Concluding Remarks—It is becoming very important to search for new strategies to understand the mechanisms and the biomolecules that are involved in the crystallization process of the eggshell formation. The implications of this knowledge are important from the biomedical point of view, as they can be extended to processes as critical as the formation of pancreatic and kidney stones, as well as arterial calcification and cardiovascular disease. On the basis of the information that we have gleaned so far, certain aspects of the mechanism involved can be inferred. We now intend to focus our attention on characterizing those genes involved in regulating the expression of OC17 and other proteins related to the biomineralization of calcite in eggshells. With this information, the existence of these genes in different avian species can be determined, not only to understand their evolution but also, coupled to what we already know, to draw some correlation between structure, function, and evolution."

Science. 1987; 235: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Tax-1 possesses an oncogenic potential and is responsible for cell transformation in vitro and in vivo. Tax-1 and Tax-2 share roughly 75% nucleotide sequence homology (21Slamon D.J. Shimotohno K. Cline M.J. Golde D.W. Chen I.S. Science. 1984; 226: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). So far, four subtypes of HTLV-2 (A to D) have been described. HTLV-2B, -2C, and -2D Tax proteins retain similar but not identical length (356, 356, and 344 amino acids, respectively), whereas HTLV-2A Tax is shorter (331 amino acids) (23Slattery J.P. Franchini G. Gessain A. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 525-540PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, several reports have now demonstrated that although the functional regions of the proteins are well conserved (i.e. NF-κB and CREB/ATF activation domains) (24Ross T.M. Minella A.C. Fang Z.Y. Pettiford S.M. Green P.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Tax-1 and Tax-2 possess some major phenotypical differences: Tax-1 but not Tax-2 is capable of inducing transcription from the ICAM-1 gene in T-cells (25Tanaka Y. Hayashi M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Tax-1 but not Tax-2 induces micronuclei (26Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); and Tax-1 but not Tax-2 suppresses the maturation and development of human CD34+ cells in vitro (27Tripp A. Liu Y. Sieburg M. Montalbano J. Wrzesinski S. Feuer G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12152-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As compared with Tax-1, Tax-2A is also largely impaired for the inhibition of p53 functions (28Mahieux R. Pise-Masison C.A. Lambert P.F. Nicot C. De Marchis L. Gessain A. Green P. Hall W. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6866-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Van P.L. Yim K.W. Jin D.Y. Dapolito G. Kurimasa A. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both proteins transactivate the human EGR-1 promoter but through different cis-acting sequences (30Sakamoto K.M. Nimer S.D. Rosenblatt J.D. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2125-2130PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, HTLV-2 transforms T-cells independently of Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription activation (31Mulloy J.C. Migone T.S. Ross T.M. Ton N. Green P.L. Leonard W.J. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4408-4412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and most importantly, Tax-2 transforms rat fibroblasts less efficiently than Tax-1 (11Endo K. Hirata A. Iwai K. Sakurai M. Fukushi M. Oie M. Higuchi M. Hall W.W. Gejyo F. Fujii M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2648-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Soon after the discovery of HTLV-1, several laboratories investigated the localization of the Tax-1 protein in infected T-cells, using cellular fractionation, immunoelectron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, or immunofluorescence (32Felber B.K.

Tax-1 was found to be present both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions in the infected T-cells, in proportions that depend on the cell line and on the method of quantification used. In SLB-1, ∼80% of the Tax-1 signal was in the nucleus (33Slamon D.J. Press M.F. Souza L.M. Murdock D.C. Cline M.J. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Chen I.S. Science. 1985; 228: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas this nuclear signal represented only 20-30% in HUT 102 and less in MT2 (38Kiyokawa T. Kawaguchi T. Seiki M. Yoshida M. Virology. 1985; 147: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that between 50 and 60% of Tax-1 was present in the nuclear fraction of both HUT 102 and C8166 cell lines (39Goh W.C. Sodroski J. Rosen C. Essex M. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 227: 1227-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These discrepancies might be linked to rough calculation methods. Within the nucleus, Tax-1 is almost equally distributed between the nucleoplasm and the nuclear matrix (34Slamon D.J. Boyle W.J. Keith D.E. Press M.F. Golde D.W. Souza L.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 680-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The situation is nearly equivalent in Tax-1-transfected cells (32Felber B.K. Paskalis H. Kleinman-Ewing C. Wong-Staal F. Pavlakis G.N. Science. 1985; 229: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), where the protein colocalizes in discrete nuclear bodies (also called Tax Speckled Structures (26Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)), components of the spliceosome (42Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with transcription factors and specific transcripts of genes that are activated by Tax (43Bex F. McDowall A. Burny A. Gaynor R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3484-3497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bex F. Yin M.J. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The amount of Tax-1 presents in the cytoplasm depends on the cell line used for the experiment (45Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this cellular compartment, Tax-1 was reported to associate with a molecular chaperone complex containing hTid-1 and HSP70 (46Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Proteins enter and exit the nucleus by using lysine-rich signals that are referred to as nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) (47Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to NLSs, the best characterized transport sequences consist of one or two short stretches of basic amino acids (aa). Recently, NLSs that are not particularly rich in lysine residues have been identified in various viral and cellular proteins of diverse function. Some of these NLSs have been characterized as nonconventional importin-interacting motifs (47Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories have mapped the different domains of Tax. A first report (36Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) suggested that the minimal region of Tax-1 necessary for a nuclear distribution of the protein encompasses residues 17-48. The same group further reported that the 48 N-terminal residues of Tax-1 contained a noncanonical functional NLS sequence (35Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This was confirmed using either a Tax-1 mutant that was deleted for amino acids 2-59 (Δ58 Tax-1) (48Gitlin S.D. Lindholm P.F. Marriott S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2612-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the Δ24-60 mutant (49Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1992; 188: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both mutants failed to accumulate in the nucleus. Most interestingly, Tax-1 has a cysteine- and histidine-rich region (zinc finger domain) between amino acids 22 and 53, which therefore overlaps the putative NLS (49Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1992; 188: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whether the Tax-1 zinc finger domain is required for the nuclear localization of the protein is controversial, however (36Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 49Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1992; 188: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results lead to the basic paradigm that Tax-1, as transcription factors, is a nuclear protein. Nevertheless, Tax-1 also activates the NF-κB transduction pathway (50Li X.H. Gaynor R.B. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 233-245PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that it also has a cytoplasmic function (51Nicot C. Tie F. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6777-6784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was indeed demonstrated recently that Tax-1 was a shuttling protein (52Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on sequence scan, the same authors made also the suggestion that Tax-1 may contain a Rev-like nuclear export signal at amino acids 190-203 (52Burton M. Upadhyaya C.D. Maier B. Hope T.J. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2351-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was later confirmed when another group demonstrated that this region functions as an NES that is insensitive to leptomycin B (45Alefantis T. Barmak K. Harhaj E.W. Grant C. Wigdahl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21814-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Because of the lack of an available Tax-2-specific antibody, the intracellular localization of the protein in HTLV-2-infected cells has not been investigated but was assumed to be similar to that of Tax-1. We have engineered a rabbit Tax-2-specific antibody, which allowed us to investigate the subcellular distribution of Tax-2. Unexpectedly, the protein appears to locate predominantly in the cytoplasm of the HTLV-2-infected cells, regardless of the Tax subtype tested (i.e. 2A or 2B). These results were confirmed in several cell lines after transient transfection of either untagged Tax-1 and Tax-2 constructs, histidine tag Tax1/Tax2, GFP-Tax, or Tax-GFP fusion constructs. This unexpected localization is not due to a fault in the Tax-2 putative NLS signal since fusing the first 60 N-terminal amino acids of Tax-2 to the GFP protein results in a massive distribution of the protein into the nucleus. In order to map the Tax-2 domain that is responsible for such a difference, we constructed a series of Tax-1 and Tax-2 chimeric plasmids. This allowed us to determine that the minimal domain of Tax-2 that is responsible for this peculiar subcellular distribution encompasses amino acids 90-100. Most interestingly, we also show a correlation between the localization of the proteins and their transactivating activity. Our results therefore suggest that the predominant cytoplasmic localization of Tax-2 in the cell is not only linked to the presence of an NLS sequence but that at least another region (aa 90-100), which is also different from the NES, is responsible in part for its peculiar intracellular distribution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Drug Treatments—HeLa, COS-7, HEK, and 293T cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). HTLV-1-transformed cell lines C8166, C91/PL, HUT 102, HTLV-2A-transformed cell lines C19 and MO or HTLV-2B immortalized (IL-2 dependent) GabMD2 and Pyg590101, as well as uninfected CEM cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and l-glutamine. Interleukin-2 was added to Pyg590101 and GabMD2 cells. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. When indicated, cells were incubated with leptomycin B (20 nm for 6 h) (Sigma) as previously described (53Renard P. Percherancier Y. Kroll M. Thomas D. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Minella A.C. Fang Z.Y. Pettiford S.M. Green P.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Smith M.R. Greene W.C.

They were inserted downstream or upstream from the GFP sequence after SacI/EcoRI or XhoI/PstI digestion and cloned into pGFP-C3 and pEGFP-N1 vectors (Clontech). This resulted in constructs in which Tax-1 or Tax-2 were either fused to the C or to the N terminus of the green fusion protein (GFP). Chimeric sequences were also obtained by the same method. pSG5M-Tax-1/2 and pcDNA4hismax-Tax1/2 were constructed by inserting the Tax-1 or Tax-2 sequences into the EcoRI/BamHI or NotI/XbaI restriction endonuclease sites within the pSG5M or pcDNA4hismax plasmids, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was determined using the DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Except where indicated, Tax-2 implies Tax-2B throughout the text.Tax-2-specific Antibody—Based on the comparison sequences of Tax-2A and Tax-2B, two synthetic oligopeptides representing separate domains (central and C-terminal) of the protein were synthesized (Eurogentec). The peptides were selected from regions in the sequence found to be hydrophilic. Oligopeptide A consists of amino acids 74-88, and oligopeptide B consists of amino acids 320-331 of the Tax-2 sequence. They were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected to specific pathogen-free New Zealand White rabbits. After several booster injections, the serum (GP3738) was tested for the presence of anti-Tax-2 antibodies. Pre-immunization serum was also tested for the presence of nonspecific reactivity.Western Immunoblot Analyses—Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science), and incubated on ice. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Samples were loaded into 10% Tris/Gly gels (NOVEX, Invitrogen), subjected to electrophoresis at 130 V, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked in a 5% PBS/milk solution, incubated with a primary mouse monoclonal antibody anti-Tax-1 (Tab172 1:1000), anti-Tax-2-specific (rabbit polyclonal antibody GP3738 1:4000), anti-histidine (sc-8036 or sc-803 Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:1000), or anti-GFP (Invitrogen 46-0092, 1:5000 or Clontech 8371 1:1000), or anti-ubiquitinated proteins (Affiniti FK2 1:1000) overnight. The next day, the membranes were washed and incubated either with anti-rabbit or with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed using either the SuperSignal West Pico or SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). To control for the amount of protein loaded per well, membranes were stripped with the Re-blot Plus Kit (Chemicon International) and reprobed with a specific anti-β-tubulin antibody (sc9104 Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:1000).Tax/IKKγ/NEMO Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK cells were transfected using CaCl2 with GFP (5 μg), GFP-Tax-1 (5 μg), GFP-Tax-2 (5 μg), and GFP-Tax-2M22 (5 μg). In some cases, 5 μg of an IKKγ/NEMO expressing vector were also transfected (55Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours later, cells were lysed in Chris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (100 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (2 mm)). Whole cell extracts (800 μg) were incubated with anti-IKKγ/NEMO polyclonal antibody (55Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads were then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the complexes were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Inputs were run on 10% Tris-glycine (Invitrogen) gels. Western blot analysis was performed to detect GFP fusion proteins by using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) or to detect IKKγ/NEMO with the IKKγ/NEMO polyclonal antibody (55Yamaoka S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Transient Transfections—For microscopic analyses, HeLa, HEK, 293T, or COS-7 cells were seeded on an eight-well chamber glass slide at a concentration of 3 × 104 cells/well and transfected the next day with 0.2 μg of DNA using Effectene or Polyfect reagents (Qiagen). For immunoblot analyses or luciferase assays, HEK and 293 T-cells were seeded on a 6-well plate at 6 × 105 cells/well and transfected the next day with 2 μg of DNA using the Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.Green Fluorescent Protein Analyses—Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and washed with PBS. Nucleic acids were stained with 4′,6′-diamine-2 phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI)-containing mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope, ×40, using a Cool-SnapHQ digital camera and the SimplePCI software (Hamamatsu).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Following 0.5% Triton X-100 treatment, cells were preincubated with a 5% PBS/milk solution and incubated with anti-Tax1 (168A-5142), anti-Tax 2 (GP3738), or anti-histidine (sc-804, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene Research) antibodies at a dilution 1:100, 1:40, 1:100, and 1:100, respectively, in a 5% PBS/milk solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), CY3-conjugated goat anti-IgG rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), or CY3-conjugated goat anti-IgG mouse (Amersham Biosciences) at dilutions 1:200, 1:1000, and 1:1000, respectively, in a 5% PBS/milk solution for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverglass was finally washed, mounted with DAPI-containing Vectashield, and examined for the protein localization by two different investigators in a blinded manner. A similar procedure was performed for HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-infected cells. In some cases (Fig. 1, m-r), HTLV-2-infected cells were mixed on the slide with un-infected CEM cells at a ratio of 1 to 3 in order to control for the specificity of the signal.Luciferase Assays—HEK cells were transiently transfected with HTLV-1-LTR-luc, HTLV-2-LTR-luc, NF-κ B-luc, or IL-8-546-luc (57Murayama T. Ohara Y. Obuchi M. Khabar K.S. Higashi H. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5692-5695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmids together with pSG5M-Tax plasmids as described previously (28Mahieux R. Pise-Masison C.A. Lambert P.F. Nicot C. De Marchis L. Gessain A. Green P."
https://openalex.org/W2143456881,"The packaging of double-stranded genomic DNA into some viral and all bacteriophage capsids is driven by powerful molecular motors. In bacteriophage T4, the motor consists of the portal protein assembly composed of twelve copies of gene product 20 (gp20, 61 kDa) and an oligomeric terminase complex composed of gp16 (18 kDa) and gp17 (70 kDa). The packaging motor drives the 171-kbp T4 DNA into the capsid utilizing the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Evidence suggests that gp17 is the key component of the motor; it exhibits ATPase, nuclease, and in vitro DNA-packaging activities. The N- and C-terminal halves of gp17 were expressed and purified to homogeneity and found to have ATPase and nuclease activities, respectively. The N-terminal domain exhibited 2-3-fold higher Kcat values for gp16-stimulated ATPase than the full-length gp17. Neither of the domains, individually or together, exhibited in vitro DNA-packaging activity, suggesting that communication between the domains is essential for DNA packaging. The domains, in particular the C-terminal domain or a mixture of both the N- and C-terminal domains, inhibited in vitro DNA packaging that is catalyzed by full-length gp17. In conjunction with genetic evidence, these data suggest that the domains compete with the full-length gp17 for binding sites on the portal protein. A model for the assembly of the T4 DNA-packaging machine is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1991005243,"Both time-dependent modulation of intracellular signaling molecules and sequential induction of transcriptional regulators are essential for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. We have now shown that the activity, but not the abundance, of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is down-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. This decrease in p42/p44 MAPK activity does not appear to be a direct effect of hormonal inducers of differentiation but rather represents a characteristic event of adipocyte differentiation that is achieved through a persistent change in intracellular signaling. Although the phosphorylation or abundance of MEK, an upstream kinase for p42/p44 MAPK, was not altered during differentiation, the abundance of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a negative regulator of p42/p44 MAPK, was increased with a time course similar to that of the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity. Ectopic expression of MKP-1 in preadipocytes reduced and depletion of endogenous MKP-1 in mature adipocytes increased the activity of p42/p44 MAPK. Prevention of the up-regulation of MKP-1 abundance in preadipocytes by expression of Mkp-1 antisense RNA resulted in persistence of p42/p44 MAPK activation and blocked differentiation, effects that were reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. These results suggest that MKP-1 plays an essential role in adipocyte differentiation through down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity. Both time-dependent modulation of intracellular signaling molecules and sequential induction of transcriptional regulators are essential for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. We have now shown that the activity, but not the abundance, of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is down-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. This decrease in p42/p44 MAPK activity does not appear to be a direct effect of hormonal inducers of differentiation but rather represents a characteristic event of adipocyte differentiation that is achieved through a persistent change in intracellular signaling. Although the phosphorylation or abundance of MEK, an upstream kinase for p42/p44 MAPK, was not altered during differentiation, the abundance of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), a negative regulator of p42/p44 MAPK, was increased with a time course similar to that of the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity. Ectopic expression of MKP-1 in preadipocytes reduced and depletion of endogenous MKP-1 in mature adipocytes increased the activity of p42/p44 MAPK. Prevention of the up-regulation of MKP-1 abundance in preadipocytes by expression of Mkp-1 antisense RNA resulted in persistence of p42/p44 MAPK activation and blocked differentiation, effects that were reversed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. These results suggest that MKP-1 plays an essential role in adipocyte differentiation through down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity. The amount of adipose tissue, which is altered in various physiological and pathological conditions, is an important determinant of energy homeostasis in living animals (1Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.-X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Given that mature adipocytes do not undergo cell division, the number of adipocytes in vivo is thought to increase as a result of the proliferation of preadipocytes and their subsequent differentiation into mature adipocytes. Studies with cultured cells, such as mouse 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cell lines, have shed light on the mechanisms of growth and differentiation of preadipocytes (2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Differentiation of these cells occurs in two discrete steps. The cells first undergo several rounds of mitosis, known as clonal expansion, after which they become quiescent again, express adipocyte-specific proteins, and acquire biochemical and morphological characteristics of mature adipocytes (2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Both the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes are characterized by marked changes in the pattern of gene expression that are achieved by the sequential induction of transcription factors. Exposure of preadipocytes to appropriate hormonal inducers of differentiation thus results in early and transient expression of the β and δ isoforms of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. which in turn appear to contribute to the proliferation of these cells as well as to the subsequent increase in the expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (4Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q.

A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins then mediate the activation of a variety of adipocyte-specific genes (2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Both extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules also play key roles in the differentiation of preadipocytes. Down-regulation of Pref-1 (6Smas C.M. Chen L. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Wnt-10 (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), secreted proteins that are abundant in preadipocytes, is thus important for differentiation of these cells. Fibroblast growth factor-10, which is expressed transiently during adipocyte differentiation, is also required to maintain the expression of C/EBPβ until a specific stage of differentiation (8Sakaue H. Konishi M. Ogawa W. Asaki T. Mori T. Yamasaki M. Takata M. Ueno H. Kato S. Kasuga M. Itoh N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). With regard to intracellular signaling molecules, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is specifically activated at a late phase of differentiation, contributes to the expression of proteins that characterize mature adipocytes (9Sakaue H.

A preferential inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) prevents the differentiation of preadipocytes (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and overexpression of MAPK kinase 6, an activator of p38 MAPK, triggers the spontaneous differentiation of these cells (11Engelman J.A.

Introduction of an active form of the protein kinase Akt also induces spontaneous differentiation of preadipocytes (12Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Although these various observations indicate the importance of specific intracellular signaling in the differentiation of preadipocytes, the mechanisms by which such signaling is regulated remain largely unknown. We now show that the activity of the p42 and p44 isoforms of MAPK is down-regulated during differentiation of preadipocytes. We provide evidence that the abundance of MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1 increases during the differentiation of these cells and that this protein plays an essential role in the differentiation program by down-regulating the activity of p42/p44 MAPK. Antibodies, Reagents, and Kinase Assay—Antibodies to phosphorylated (Ser(P)473) Akt, phosphorylated (Thr(P)202 and Tyr(P)204) p42/p44 MAPK, p42/p44 MAPK, phosphorylated (Ser(P)217 and Ser(P)221) MEK, MEK, phosphorylated (Thr(P)180, Tyr(P)182) p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, CREB, and to PPARγ were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, MKP-1, MKP-2, and to MKP-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies to Akt were as described previously (13Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H.

PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies to aP2 (14Bernlohr D.A. Doering T.L. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and troglitazone were kindly provided by D. Bernlohr (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis) and Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to p42/p44 MAPK (αC92) was assayed with myelin basic protein as substrate as described previously (15Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Staining—3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A preadipocytes were maintained as described previously (9Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes was induced by incubation of confluent cells cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) first for 2 days with insulin (5 μg/ml), 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and then with insulin (5 μg/ml) alone for an additional 2 days. Alternatively, the cells were cultured in the presence of 10% FBS and treated with IBMX (0.5 mm) and dexamethasone (0.25 μm) for only 2 days. Differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes was induced by exposing confluent cells to troglitazone (10 μm) in the presence of 10% FBS for 2 days. After incubation with these reagents, the 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells were returned to normal culture medium, which was replenished every other day. Oil red O staining (8Sakaue H. Konishi M. Ogawa W. Asaki T. Mori T. Yamasaki M. Takata M. Ueno H. Kato S. Kasuga M. Itoh N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and staining for β-galactosidase activity (15Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Fractionation of Adipose Tissue—For preparation of stromal-vascular and mature adipocyte fractions of epididymal adipose tissue removed from 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice, the tissue was washed with and minced in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and then incubated on a shaking platform for 20 min at 37 °C with the same medium containing collagenase (0.5 mg/ml). The mixture was then passed through a nylon filter (pore size, 250 μm) to remove undigested material, and the filtrate was centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g and at 4 °C. Floating cells (the mature adipocyte fraction) and the pellet (the stromal-vascular fraction) were recovered, washed three times with DMEM, and then lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Expression Plasmids and Adenoviral Vectors—A mammalian expression vector encoding MKP-1 (pcDNA3.1/MKP-1) was constructed by subcloning a cDNA for the human MKP-1 ortholog (CL-100) (16Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by S. Keyse (Molecular Pharmacology Unit, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, UK), into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To construct an adenoviral vector that encodes Mkp-1 antisense RNA, we subcloned a mouse Mkp-1 cDNA containing both the entire coding region and 157 bp of the 5′-untranslated region (17Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), kindly provided by N. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), in the antisense orientation into pAxCAwt; the resulting construct was introduced into 293 cells together with DNA-TPC by transfection with the use of an adenovirus expression kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (9Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An adenoviral vector encoding β-galactosidase was kindly provided by I. Saito (Tokyo University, Japan). For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, cells cultured to subconfluency were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Two days after infection, differentiation was induced as described above. Alternatively, 3T3-L1 adipocytes at 6 days after the induction of differentiation were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 30 plaque-forming units/cell; the cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis 2 days after infection. Electroporation—For transfection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with pcDNA3.1/MKP-1 or with an expression vector for β-galactosidase (SRα/LacZ), the cells were detached from culture dishes by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% trypsin and collagenase (0.5 mg/ml). Approximately 5 × 106 cells were mixed with 5 μg of plasmid in the solution provided with a cell line Nucleofector kit V (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany), and the plasmid was then introduced into the cells by electroporation with the use of a Nucleofector (Amaxa) instrument according to the T-20 program. Down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK Activity during Adipocyte Differentiation—3T3-L1 preadipocytes, a well characterized model for studying adipocyte differentiation, were induced to differentiate by incubation with insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX for 2 days and then with insulin alone for an additional 2 days. At various times before, during, and after such treatment, the cells were harvested, and the activity of p42/p44 MAPK was assayed in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies that recognize both p42 and p44 isoforms of this kinase. The substantial p42/p44 MAPK activity that was apparent in preadipocytes before exposure to the inducers of differentiation had decreased by 4 days after the onset of differentiation induction (Fig. 1a). At 8 days postinduction, when >90% of the cells had acquired morphological and biochemical characteristics of mature adipocytes (data not shown), the activity of p42/p44 MAPK was <20% of that observed in the untreated cells. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies specific for phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of the isozymes, which reflects their kinase activity, decreased in parallel with the kinase activity (Fig. 1a); the abundance of the kinases was not affected by the induction of differentiation, consistent with previous observations (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not affected by the inducers of differentiation but was increased by treatment of the cells with anisomycin, an activator of this isozyme (Fig. 1b). Insulin activates p42/p44 MAPK in various cell types. However, the activity of p42/p44 MAPK in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes not exposed to insulin or the other inducers of differentiation was higher than that in cells at relatively late stages of differentiation induced by these agents (Fig. 1a). Induction of the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by exposure to dexamethasone and IBMX alone (without insulin) for 2 days resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets in ∼60% of the cells within 8 days after the onset of treatment (data not shown). Down-regulation of the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was also observed during the differentiation process (Fig. 1c). Moreover, when 3T3-F442A cells, a preadipocyte cell line closely related to 3T3-L1 cells (2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), were induced to differentiate by incubation for 2 days with troglitazone, a synthetic agonist for PPARγ (18Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was decreased with a time course similar to that observed during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1d). These results suggested that the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity during the differentiation of preadipocytes is dependent neither on the specific hormonal inducers nor on the specific cell line but rather reflects an intrinsic modification of intracellular signaling characteristic of the differentiation program. To verify this hypothesis, we deprived either 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or fully differentiated adipocytes (8 days after induction) of serum for 16 h, stimulated the cells by reexposure to serum for 10 min, and then assayed cell lysates for the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and of Akt, both of which are known to be activated by serum. Serum elicited a marked increase in the extent of phosphorylation of both p42/p44 MAPK and Akt in the nondifferentiated cells (Fig. 2a). However, the effect of serum on the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was greatly reduced in the differentiated adipocytes compared with that in the nondifferentiated cells. In contrast, the amount of phosphorylated Akt in the differentiated adipocytes was greater than that in the nondifferentiated cells in the absence or presence of serum, probably reflecting the increase in the abundance of Akt that occurred during differentiation. These results were thus consistent with the notion that the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity during differentiation of preadipocytes is intrinsic to the differentiation program. We also investigated whether this biochemical change observed in cultured adipocytes also occurs in adipose tissue of living animals. Mouse epididymal adipose tissue was fractionated into the mature adipocyte fraction and the stromal-vascular fraction, the major cell population of which is thought to be preadipocytes, and extracts of both fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis. As expected, adipocyte marker proteins such as C/EBPα and aP2 were detected in the mature adipocyte fraction but not in the stromal-vascular fraction, whereas the abundance of C/EBPβ, which is induced early during the differentiation of cultured preadipocytes, was higher in the stromal-vascular fraction (Fig. 2b). Although the amount of p42/p44 MAPK did not differ substantially between the two fractions, the extent of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was much greater in the stromal-vascular fraction, suggesting that the decrease in p42/p44 MAPK activity apparent during adipocyte differentiation in culture also occurs in adipose tissue of living animals. Up-regulation of MKP-1 during Adipocyte Differentiation— The activity of p42/p44 MAPK is regulated both by the upstream kinase MEK, which phosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues of p42/p44 MAPK, and by a dual specificity phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the residues of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylated by MEK (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylated MEK was readily detected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes that had been stimulated with serum for 10 min, it was detected in cells treated with inducers of differentiation only at low levels revealed by prolonged exposure of immunoblots (Fig. 3a). However, neither the amount of phosphorylated MEK nor that of total MEK changed during differentiation. Moreover, the extent of serum-induced phosphorylation of MEK was similar in nondifferentiated preadipocytes and in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity during adipocyte differentiation is not attributable to a change in MEK signaling. In contrast, the amount of mRNA for Mkp-1, a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), was increased during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells induced by insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX with a time course similar to that of the decrease in p42/p44 MAPK activity (Fig. 3b). Consistent with this result, the abundance of MKP-1 protein also increased during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, whereas that of the dual specificity phosphatases MKP-2 and MKP-3 (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) remained largely unchanged (Fig. 3c). Moreover, a similar increase in the abundance of MKP-1 was observed in 3T3-L1 cells induced to differentiate with IBMX plus dexamethasone as well as in 3T3-F442A cells induced to differentiate with troglitazone (Fig. 3d). The amount of MKP-1 protein was also greater in the mature adipocyte fraction than in the stromal-vascular fraction of mouse epididymal adipose tissue (Fig. 2b). These results indicate that the increase in the abundance of MKP-1 is also a characteristic feature of adipocyte differentiation. MKP-1 Expression Determines p42/p44 MAPK Activity during Adipocyte Differentiation—We next investigated whether the increase in the abundance of MKP-1 is related to the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity during differentiation of preadipocytes. For these experiments, we used electroporation to introduce exogenous genes into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Transfection with an expression vector for β-galactosidase revealed that >70% of the cells expressed the exogenous gene (Fig. 4a), indicative of a high efficiency of transfection with this method. The amount of MKP-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transfected with a vector for this protein was similar to that in nontransfected differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 4b). Transfection with the MKP-1 vector did not affect the abundance of other proteins such as CREB, a transcription factor involved in adipocyte differentiation (2Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The serum-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK, however, was greatly diminished in preadipocytes transfected with the MKP-1 vector compared with that apparent in cells transfected with the corresponding empty vector (Fig. 4c), consistent with the notion that the change in the abundance of MKP-1 is a major determinant of that in the activity of p42/p44 MAPK during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. To establish more directly a causal link between MKP-1 expression and p42/p44 MAPK activity during adipocyte differentiation, we next examined the effect of depletion of endogenous MKP-1 on p42/p44 MAPK activity. Given that transfection of fibroblasts with a vector encoding Mkp-1 antisense RNA was shown to prevent the expression of Mkp-1 (20Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 922-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we constructed an adenoviral vector (AxCAMkp-1-1AS) that contains Mkp-1 cDNA in the antisense orientation. As expected, infection of 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes with AxCAMkp-1-1AS, but not with a control adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (AxCAlacZ), resulted in a marked reduction in the amount of Mkp-1 without an effect on that of CREB (Fig. 4d). Conversely, the extent of serum-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was greater in the differentiated cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS than in those infected with the control adenovirus (Fig. 4e). These results thus support the conclusion that the increase in the abundance of MKP-1 is a major contributor to the decrease in p42/p44 MAPK activity during adipocyte differentiation. Up-regulation of MKP-1 Expression Is Required for Adipocyte Differentiation—We next investigated the physiological importance of the up-regulation of MKP-1 expression during adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with AxCAMkp-1AS or with the control virus AxCAlacZ and were subsequently exposed to hormonal inducers of differentiation (insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX). Eight days after exposure to the inducers of differentiation, the abundance of MKP-1 in cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS was ∼10% that in cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 5a). Consistent with this observation, the differentiation-associated down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity apparent in the cells infected with the control virus did not occur in the cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, although the cells infected with AxCAlacZ exhibited substantial accumulation of lipid droplets 8 days after exposure to the inducers of differentiation, lipid accumulation was markedly inhibited in the cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS (Fig. 5c). The induction of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 was also greatly reduced in cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS compared with that apparent in cells infected with the control virus (Fig. 5d). The abundance of CREB was not affected by expression of Mkp-1 antisense RNA (Fig. 5, a and d), and the up-regulation of C/EBPβ expression, which is maximal 2 days after exposure to the hormonal inducers of differentiation, was similar in cells infected with AxCAMkp-1AS and in those infected with AxCAlacZ (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that the induction of MKP-1 expression is essential for adipocyte differentiation and that MKP-1 contributes to this process at a step after the induction of C/EBPβ. 3T3-L1 cells that had been infected with AxCAMkp-1AS and exposed to inducers of differentiation in the presence of PD98059, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, manifested a reduced level of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation similar to that apparent in cells that had been infected with the control virus before induction of differentiation (Fig. 5b). Such treatment with PD98059 also prevented the inhibitory effect of MKP-1 depletion on adipocyte differentiation, as monitored by the accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 5c) and by the up-regulation of adipocyte marker proteins including PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 (Fig. 5d). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of AxCAMkp-1AS on adipocyte differentiation is attributable to the sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK. We have shown that the activity of p42/p44 MAPK decreases during the differentiation of cultured preadipocytes, consistent with previous observations (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results suggest that this down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity is intrinsic to the differentiation program, reflecting a change in the intracellular signaling machinery, and is independent of the specific inducers of differentiation. The extent of the serum-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was thus greater in nondifferentiated preadipocytes than in mature adipocytes, even though the abundance of p42/p44 MAPK did not differ between the two states. An insulin-induced increase in the activity of p42/p44 MAPK apparent several hours after exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX has been shown to enhance the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression during differentiation (21Prusty D. Park B.H. Davis K.E. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46226-46232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the fact that insulin increases the proportion of differentiated cells but is not absolutely required for differentiation. Signaling by MEK and p42/p44 MAPK has also been shown to contribute to the mitotic clonal expansion that occurs within several days after the induction of differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (22Qiu Z. Wei Y. Chen N. Jiang M. Wu J. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In contrast, incubation of preadipocytes with growth factors that induce a prolonged activation of p42/p44 MAPK prevents the cells from differentiating into adipocytes (24Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Hayashi I. Nixon T. Morikawa M. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 107: 279-286Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and such inhibitory effects are attenuated by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (24Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Together, these various observations suggest that, although p42/p44 MAPK signaling is important for early steps of the differentiation program, sustained activation of this signaling inhibits adipocyte differentiation. The down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity that occurs during the differentiation of preadipocytes thus appears to be essential for completion of the differentiation process. The Mkp-1 gene is an immediate early gene whose expression is induced rapidly by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Agents used to induce the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, including insulin (27Kusari A.B. Byon J. Bandyopadhyay D. Kenner K.A. Kusari J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1532-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids (28Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and cyclic AMP analogs (29Schliess F. Kurz A.K. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), have thus been shown to increase expression of the Mkp-1 gene. However, the induction of MKP-1 gene expression by such stimuli is usually transient (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 27Kusari A.B. Byon J. Bandyopadhyay D. Kenner K.A. Kusari J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1532-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Kassel O. Sancono A. Kratzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the abundance of Mkp-1 was increased within several hours after exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX but had returned to basal levels by 16 h. 2H. Sakaue, W. Ogawa, and M. Kasuga, unpublished observations. The pronounced increase in the amounts of both MKP-1 mRNA and protein apparent 4 days after exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to these inducers of differentiation as well as the persistence of the increased level of Mkp-1 gene expression in differentiated adipocytes are thus likely attributable to an alteration of the transcriptional machinery programmed during differentiation and not to a direct effect of the differentiation inducers per se. Given that the time courses of the expression of C/ebpα2 and Pparγ were similar to that of Mkp-1 expression, one or both of these transcription factors may play a role in transcriptional activation of the Mkp-1 gene. In this regard, the promoter of the mouse Mkp-1 gene contains a sequence (TGGTGGAAT, nucleotides -1155 to -1147) to which both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are able to bind. Furthermore, the induction of Mkp-1 expression normally observed during liver regeneration does not occur in mice that lack the C/ebpβ gene (30Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which expression of the Mkp-1 gene is up-regulated during the differentiation of preadipocytes remains to be established, however. The down-regulation of the activity and phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK appeared related to the up-regulation of Mkp-1 expression during the differentiation both of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in culture as well as of cells in adipose tissue derived from animals. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MKP-1 in preadipocytes at a level similar to that of the endogenous protein in mature adipocytes resulted in a marked decrease in the extent of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, and conversely, depletion of endogenous MKP-1 in mature adipocytes triggered an increase in the level of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, suggesting that MKP-1 is a major regulator of p42/p44 MAPK activity during the differentiation of adipocytes. Prevention of the up-regulation of MKP-1 expression by transfection of preadipocytes with a vector for Mkp-1 antisense RNA also greatly inhibited adipo-genesis in cells exposed to insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX. The phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK was not down-regulated even 8 days after exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing Mkp-1 antisense RNA to the inducers of differentiation. Moreover, inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK activity by treatment with PD98059 restored the ability of cells expressing Mkp-1 antisense RNA to undergo differentiation into adipocytes. The sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK in these cells thus appeared to be the cause and not a result of the prevention of differentiation by MKP-1 depletion. Although MKP-1 dephosphorylates and inactivates kinases other than p42/p44 MAPK (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), the restorative effect of PD98059 indicates the importance of p42/p44 MAPK as a target of MKP-1 during adipocyte differentiation. Whereas the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression during adipocyte differentiation was markedly attenuated by depletion of MKP-1, that of C/EBPβ expression was unaffected. These results are consistent with our observation that the activity of p42/p44 MAPK began to decrease after the onset of the increase in C/EBPβ expression during differentiation. The up-regulation of MKP-1 expression and the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity therefore likely contribute to adipocyte differentiation at a step after the induction of C/EBPβ expression. The activity of many members of the nuclear receptor family, including that of PPARγ, is affected by their phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of PPARγ2 on Ser112 (equivalent to Ser82 of PPARγ1) is catalyzed by p42/p44 MAPK and inhibits its transactivation activity (31Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 32Hu E. Kim. J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Depletion of MKP-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes thus likely promotes the phosphorylation of PPARγ by p42/p44 MAPK and thereby prevents the cells from acquiring the characteristics of mature adipocytes. PPARγ appears capable of inducing the expression both of itself and of C/EBPα (33Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 34Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The prevention of the increase in the abundance of PPARγ and of C/EBPα by expression of Mkp-1 antisense RNA might thus be attributable to inhibition of the transactivation activity of PPARγ. We have found that growth factor-induced inhibition of transactivation activity of PPARγ2 was prevented either by MKP-1 overexpression or by PD98059, 2H. Sakaue, W. Ogawa, and M. Kasuga, unpublished observations. which is consistent with our hypothesis that MKP-1 can regulate the transactivation activity of PPARγ. In summary, we have shown that the down-regulation of p42/p44 MAPK activity is a characteristic feature of and is crucial for adipocyte differentiation and that this biochemical change is attributable to an increase in the abundance of MKP-1. The abundance of MKP-1 is regulated by a variety of stimuli at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (19Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Given that the putative MAPK phosphorylation sites in PPARγ influence both the size of fat cells and whole body insulin sensitivity in living animals (35Rangwala S.M. Rhoades B. Shapiro J.S.

The rate of IgM-catalyzed gp120 cleavage was greater than of other polypeptide substrates, including the bacterial superantigen protein A. The kinetic parameters of gp120 cleavage varied over a broad range depending on the source of the IgMs, and turnover numbers as great as 2.1/min were observed, suggesting that different Abs possess distinct gp120 recognition properties. IgG Abs failed to cleave gp120 detectably. The Fab fragment of a monoclonal IgM cleaved gp120, suggesting that the catalytic activity belongs to the antibody combining site. The electrophoretic profile of gp120 incubated with a monoclonal human IgM suggested hydrolysis at several sites. One of the cleavage sites was identified as the Lys432-Ala433 peptide bond, located within the region thought to be the Ab-recognizable superantigenic determinant. A covalently reactive peptide analog (CRA) corresponding to gp120 residues 421–431 with a C-terminal amidino phosphonate diester mimetic of the Lys432-Ala433 bond was employed to probe IgM nucleophilic reactivity. The peptidyl CRA inhibited the IgM-catalyzed cleavage of gp120 and formed covalent IgM adducts at levels exceeding a control hapten CRA devoid of the peptide sequence. These observations suggest that IgMs can selectively cleave gp120 by a nucleophilic mechanism and raise the possibility of their role as defense enzymes.

IgG Abs produced by differentiated B cells, in comparison, contain V domains that are more diversified by adaptive maturational processes occurring after exposure to the antigen. Recently, we reported that IgM μ subunits expressed as components of the B cell receptor account for the majority of the nucleophilic reactivity of the B cell surface, detected as the irreversible binding of haptenic covalently reactive antigen analogs (CRAs) containing an electrophilic phosphonate diester group (1Planque S.

The phosphonate CRAs serve as probes for the activated nucleophiles found in non-Ab proteolytic enzymes (2Powers J.C. Asgian J.L. Ekici O.D. James K.E. Chem.

There was no expectation in these studies of selective catalytic cleavage of individual peptide antigens by the IgMs because no attempts were made to induce specific Ab responses by immunization procedures. Indeed, the proteolytic reaction was characterized by its promiscuity, in that tripeptide and tetrapeptide substrates with no apparent sequence similarity were cleaved, limited only by the requirement for a basic residue at the cleavage site (1Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14024-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the case of specific IgG Abs directed to individual antigens, noncovalent Ab-antigen interactions guide the nucleophilic reaction and enable antigen-specific proteolysis, as judged from the selective covalent reaction of the Abs with polypeptide CRAs containing the phosphonate group within their antigenic epitopes (4Planque S.

Various innate and adaptive immune mechanisms have been documented to be important in defense against microbial infections. In the case of HIV-1, the coat protein gp120 is an important target of host immune responses. Oligomers of gp120 initiate viral infection by binding host cell CD4 receptors. In addition, monomer gp120 shed from viral and infected cell surfaces mediates certain toxic effects. Binding of gp120 to uninfected CD4+ T cells has been implicated in apoptotic depletion of these cells, a hallmark of AIDS (5Siliciano R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 205: 159-179PubMed Google Scholar), and the neurotoxic effect of free gp120 may contribute to dementia in HIV-infected subjects (6Kaul M. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). gp120 is bound by certain Abs found in uninfected individuals (7Berberian L. Goodglick L. Kipps T.J. Braun J. Science. 1993; 261: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), earning this protein the designation of a superantigen, i.e. an antigen recognized by Abs without the requirement for adaptive sequence diversification of the V domains. A weak correlation between IgG Abs that recognize gp120 as a superantigen and resistance to HIV infection has been noted (8Townsley-Fuchs J. Kam L. Fairhurst R. Gange S.J. Goodglick L. Giorgi J.V. Sidell N. Detels R. Braun J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1794-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In infected subjects, gp120 induces the synthesis of Abs directed mainly to antigenic epitopes located in the mutable regions of gp120 (9Moore J. Trkola A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These Abs are generally ineffective against viral escape mutants appearing over the course of infection. Presently, no effective immunotherapeutic or vaccination strategies against HIV infection or soluble gp120 are available. Abs to the CD4 receptor binding site of gp120 developed by experimental immunization (10He Y. Honnen W.J. Krachmarov C.P. Burkhart M. Kayman S.C. Corvalan J. Pinter A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and phage library protocols (11Burton D.R. Pyati J. Koduri R. Sharp S.J. Thornton G.B. Parren P.W. Sawyer L.S. Hendry R.M. Dunlop N. Nara P.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) have been proposed as immunotherapy candidates. Recently, immunization with the CRA derivative of gp120 was shown to induce the synthesis of specific IgG Abs that cleave gp120 (12Paul S. Planque S. Zhou Y.-X. Taguchi H. Bhatia G. Karle S. Hanson C. Nishiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20429-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteolytic Abs offer the potential advantage of permanent inactivation of the target protein. Moreover, repeated reaction cycles mediated by a single catalyst molecule are predicted to inactivate multiple gp120 molecules. In comparison, conventional Abs bind gp120 stoichiometrically, and dissociation of the Ab-antigen complex releases the biologically active protein. We report here the selective and efficient cleavage of the HIV coat protein gp120 by IgM Abs from uninfected humans and mice immunized with irrelevant antigens. Based on their reactivity with CRA probes, the IgMs appear to cleave gp120 via a nucleophilic mechanism. Selectivity for gp120 appears to be derived at least in part from recognition of a peptide determinant composed of gp120 residues 421–433, which is known to contribute contact sites for CD4 (13Olshevesky T.J. Helseth E. Furman C. Li J. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5701-5707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). This determinant is also implicated in gp120 recognition as a superantigen by the conserved V domain regions of certain Abs (15Goodglick L. Zevit N. Neshat M.S. Braun J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5151-5159PubMed Google Scholar, 16Karray S. Zouali M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Polyclonal human sera were from subjects without evidence of infection or immunological disease (two females, three males; age 23–45 years). Monoclonal human IgM was from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia diagnosed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center according accepted clinical criteria (bone marrow/lymph node biopsy, flow cytometry, serum immunoglobulin quantitation, and electrophoresis as appropriate). IgM concentrations in these samples as determined by rate nephelometry were 9.2–55.7 mg/ml. None of these patients had any known history of HIV infection. Murine serum Abs were from BALB/c mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; pooled from 150 mice; age 8–12 weeks). Monoclonal murine IgMs were purchased as cell-free ascites fluid and are described by the supplier to be directed against certain major histocompatibility antigens (clones corresponding to catalog nos. 8702, 8704, 9008, 9010, and 9020; Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada).

The unbound fraction was dialyzed against buffer B, purified by FPLC gel filtration on a Superose 12 column and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS. Total protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). SDS-PAGE (4–20% gels) was conducted under reducing conditions (2-mercaptoethanol). Blots of the gels were stained with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human μ, γ, κ, and λ Abs or goat anti-mouse μ, γ, κ, and λ Abs followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Fc-specific) as in Ref. 17Kalaga R.

Band intensities are expressed in arbitrary area units. Initial velocities were computed as slopes of progress curves (incubation for 20, 40, 60, 120 and 220 min; r2 > 0.9 for all data reported here). Catalytic Activity of Polyclonal IgM Abs—Each IgM preparation purified from five human sera expressed readily detectable ability to cleave biotinylated gp120 (Bt-gp120) (Fig. 1A), assessed by depletion of the parent gp120 band and appearance of fragments with lower mass in electrophoresis gels (Fig. 1B; the recombinant protein migrates with nominal molecular mass of ∼95 kDa, presumably because of incomplete glycosylation in the baculovirus expression system). With increasing length of incubation, accumulation of the 50-kDa biotin-containing fragment and depletion of the 80-kDa fragment were evident, suggesting that the latter product is susceptible to further hydrolysis. IgG samples from these sera did not cleave gp120 detectably. The data in Fig. 1A are expressed per equivalent combining sites of IgM and IgG (10 and 2, respectively; note, however, that all 10 IgM valences are usually not filled; Ref. 24Chavin S.I. Franklin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superior IgM catalysis, therefore, cannot be ascribed to the greater number of IgM combining sites. Essentially identical results were obtained using IgM and IgG Abs prepared from the pooled sera of immunologically unstimulated BALB/c mice (87.9% cleavage/20 h/150 nm IgM combining sites; undetectable gp120 cleavage at equivalent IgG combining site concentration; reaction conditions as in Fig. 1A). Next, we examined the possibility of non-IgM proteases as the explanation for the observed catalytic activity. In particular, there is the risk of copurification of contaminants bound noncovalently to the IgM. A denaturing solvent (6 m guanidine hydrochloride) was employed to ensure dissociation of potential noncovalent complexes in an IgM preparation purified previously by affinity chromatography using immobilized anti-IgM Abs. The IgM was then subjected to two sequential cycles of FPLC gel filtration in the denaturing solvent (Fig. 1C). The 900-kDa IgM fraction recovered by this procedure was renatured by dialysis, and the catalytic activity was measured. The renatured IgM displayed Bt-gp120 cleaving activity in the same range as the starting IgM fraction (inset, Fig. 1C; 82.2 ± 9.2 and 78.8 ± 1.0% cleavage, respectively). To our knowledge, no serum proteases with mass corresponding to the 900-kDa IgM fraction are described in the literature. Because low molecular mass proteins are well separated from the 900-kDa IgM fraction by the denaturing gel filtration procedure, we are unable to explain the observed gp120 cleavage as being the result of trace contaminants. Catalytic Activity of Monoclonal IgM Abs—Next, we studied the gp120ase activity of monoclonal human and murine IgM Abs. All but one of the IgMs (IgM Yvo) were prepared by an identical affinity chromatography procedure using immobilized anti-IgM Abs. IgM Yvo, a cryoglobulin, was purified by three cycles of precipitation prior to the affinity chromatography step. 10 of 12 monoclonal IgMs from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (including IgM Yvo) and four of five murine monoclonal IgMs displayed the gp120 cleaving activity (>10% consumption of available gp120; Fig. 2A). The monoclonal IgMs from five patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia were purified in two independent experiments, and their gp120 cleaving activities were measured. The interexperiment variations of the activity were within the range of experimental error of the cleavage assay (6.8 ± 4.2%; n = 5). This suggested that the differing activities of the individual monoclonal IgMs in Fig. 2A are not caused by variables associated with the purification method. A subset of IgMs containing VH3 family VH domain from uninfected humans has been reported previously to bind gp120 (7Berberian L. Goodglick L. Kipps T.J. Braun J. Science. 1993; 261: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Goodglick L. Zevit N. Neshat M.S. Braun J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5151-5159PubMed Google Scholar, 16Karray S. Zouali M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). VH3+ IgMs can be identified by screening for binding of iodinated protein A because the iodination reaction inactivates the Fc binding site of protein A while leaving intact the recognition of this protein as a superantigen by the V domains (19Silverman G.J. Sasano M. Wormsley S.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5840-5855PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, 5 VH3+ monoclonal IgMs from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia were identified by measuring the binding of I-protein A by ELISA (n = 12 IgMs; A490 range 1.52–2.81, S.D. values < 12% of the mean in each case; the remaining 7 IgMs studied did not bind I-protein A detectably, A490 < 0.11). All but one of the IgMs with I-protein A binding activity and all but one of the IgMs devoid of this activity were observed to cleave gp120 (Fig. 2A). To the extent that the absence of detectable I-protein A binding activity reflects the usage of non-VH3 family domains, these results suggest that the proteolytic activity is not restricted to VH3+ IgMs. This is supported by the observed gp120 cleavage by IgM Yvo, which contains a VH2 family VH domain (18Shaw D.C. Shultz B.B. Ramsland P.A. Edmundson A.B. J. Mol. Recog. 2002; 15: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar; as expected, IgM YVO was devoid of I-protein A binding activity determined by ELISA). There was no evident association between the extent of gp120 cleavage and I-protein A binding activity within the group of VH3+ IgMs (n = 5, r = 0.05, p = 0.72). Importantly, none of the five VH3+ IgMs cleaved I-protein A detectably (an example is shown in Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that the ability to cleave gp120 is a distinctive property of individual IgM Abs, as opposed to a generalized consequence of superantigen recognition. IgM Yvo, which displayed the greatest gp120 hydrolyzing activity among the 12 Waldenström's IgMs studied, was assayed at two stages in its purification process, i.e. after three cycles of precipitation induced by warming and cooling, and after the additional affinity chromatography step using an anti-IgM column. The levels of gp120 cleavage before and after the affinity chromatography step were essentially identical (46.4 ± 0.6% (S.D.) and 44.3 ± 4.9% Bt-gp120 cleaved/50 nm IgM/6 h, respectively; reactions as in Fig. 2A). Purification of the IgM preparation to constant specific activity supports assignment of the Bt-gp120 cleaving activity to the Abs. The possibility of contamination was studied further using the Fab fragment prepared by gel filtration after digestion of IgM Yvo with immobilized pepsin. Concentration-dependent Bt-gp120 cleavage by the 50–55-kDa Fab fraction was evident (Fig. 3B). Undigested IgM subjected to gel filtration under identical conditions eluted as the 900 kDa peak, with no gp120 cleaving activity detected in fractions corresponding to the 50–55-kDa mass range. Next, we considered the possibility that pepsin released from the immobilized pepsin column may be responsible for the observed activity. The pH optimum of pepsin is 1.5–2.7 depending on the substrate, and the enzyme is inactivated irreversibly at the neutral pH employed for Bt-gp120 hydrolysis assays (25Cornish-Bowden A. Knowles J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reported properties of pepsin, purified pepsin at concentrations as large as 1.2 μm did not cleave Bt-gp120 detectably (not shown; reaction conditions as in Fig. 3B), suggesting that the proteolytic activity of the Fab cannot be explained by pepsin contamination. To identify peptide bonds in gp120 susceptible to cleavage by IgM Yvo, nonbiotinylated gp120 at a concentration in excess of the IgM was employed as substrate (Fig. 4). Several Coomassie Blue-stained bands attributable to cleavage by the IgM were evident (smeared products at nominal mass range 80 kDa, 50 kDa, and more well defined bands at 15.4–18.8 kDa; the bands at 25 and 70 kDa correspond to IgM Yvo light and heavy chains, respectively; Fig. 4). Possible reasons for the difference in Bt-gp120 (Figs. 1 and 3) and nonbiotinylated gp120 cleavage patterns include (a) the biotinylation reaction at Lys residues and associated experimental manipulations could alter the substrate properties of the protein; (b) the biotin content of the Bt-gp120 was small (1.4 mol/mol), with the result that certain Coomassie Blue-stainable fragments may not contain biotin, and the profile of biotinylated products may not accurately predict their relative abundance; and (c) under the conditions of near complete gp120 cleavage in Fig. 4, the products may be digested further by the catalyst, allowing increased accumulation of the lower mass bands and decreased accumulation of the intermediate sized products. The 50-kDa fragment in Fig. 4 was not present in sufficient amounts for further analysis. The remaining fragments bands were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Table I). The 80-kDa gel region yielded a sequence corresponding to the N terminus of gp120. Because no internal gp120 peptide sequence was detected, the cleavage site could not be identified. However, from the mass of this N-terminal fragment (80 kDa), it may be concluded that the cleavage site is located in the C-terminal half of gp120. gp120 fragments with N-terminal sequences corresponding to gp120 residues 433–442 were identified in the gel regions corresponding to 15.4–16.4-kDa and 17.6-kDa gel regions, permitting unamb"

Sulfolobus solfataricus is a hyperthermophilic Archaea that grows optimally at 80-85 °C and pH 2-4, utilizing a wide range of carbon and energy sources (1Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Central metabolism in this organism involves a non-phosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (2De Rosa M. Gambacorta A.

The first enzyme in the pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconate and galactose to galactonate. Subsequently, gluconate dehydratase is known to catalyze the dehydration of gluconate to d-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), 1The abbreviations used are: KDG, d-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; KDGA, KDG aldolase; KDGal, d-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate; NAL, N-acetylneuraminate lyase; EcNAL, Escherichia coli NAL; HiNAL, Haemophilus influenzae NAL; EcDHDPS, Escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase.1The abbreviations used are: KDG, d-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; KDGA, KDG aldolase; KDGal, d-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate; NAL, N-acetylneuraminate lyase; EcNAL, Escherichia coli NAL; HiNAL, Haemophilus influenzae NAL; EcDHDPS, Escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase. and galactonate to d-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal). 2H.

The third enzyme, KDG aldolase (KDGA), catalyzes the aldolate cleavage of KDG and KDGal, with both substrates yielding pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde. Moreover, in the aldol condensation reaction, KDGA exhibits no facial selectivity, condensing pyruvate with d-glyceraldehyde to produce a mixture of KDG and KDGal (7Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D.

KDGA is thus an extremely unusual aldolase in not exhibiting stereoselectivity with its natural substrates, and the whole metabolic pathway in S. solfataricus contrasts with the situation observed in other microorganisms where separate enzymes exist for the catabolism of the two sugars.Aldolases are divided into two main groups, Type I and Type II. Type I aldolases proceed through a Schiff base intermediate formed between an active site lysine and the α-keto acid moiety of the substrate, whereas Type II aldolases are non-Schiff base forming and require a metal cofactor. S. solfataricus KDGA is a homotetrameric enzyme and has a monomeric molecular mass of 33 kDa with 293 residues per monomer (8Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is a Type I aldolase and a member of the N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL) subfamily (9Lawrence M.C. Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. Hall N.E. Pilling P.A. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) for which a number of crystal structures have been determined (10Izard T. Lawrence M.C. Malby R.L. Lilley G.G. Colman P.M. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes are tetramers, with each monomer having a TIM barrel fold decorated with additional helices at the C terminus. These enzymes are thought to utilize a common mechanism, in which a strictly conserved lysine serves to form the Schiff base intermediate; other strictly conserved residues are involved in stabilizing the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex (11Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. DeGori R. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. Campi E.M. Jackson W.R. Brossmer R. Sommer M. Lawrence M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each reaction is reversible, with pyruvate being the common substrate, and they are each specific for non-phosphorylated substrates.In the current study we present the native structure of KDGA at 2.0-Å resolution, derived by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. By virtue of the hyperthermophilic nature of the enzyme, we have been able to trap pyruvate, KDG, or KDGal in crystals of KDGA at low temperatures and so visualize Schiff base formation at resolutions of between 1.7 and 2.1 Å. From these structures we are able to rationalize the substrate and mechanistic promiscuity of this novel aldolase and thereby understand the enzymic basis of the unique metabolic promiscuity we have discovered in archaeal sugar metabolism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization of Recombinant KDGA—Several crystal forms of KDGA were previously obtained, the best diffraction data being to 2.15 Å from an orthorhombic crystal form (a = 135.1 Å, b = 135.9 Å, c = 188.7 Å) grown at pH 4.0 (12Hendry E.J. Buchanan C.L. Russell R.J. Hough D.W. Reeve C.D. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Solvent content estimations indicated the presence of two tetramers in the asymmetric unit related by a pseudo-centering. Numerous attempts at molecular replacement with Escherichia coli NAL (EcNAL), Hemophilus influenzae NAL (HiNAL), or E. coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase (EcDHDPS) failed to provide a solution, and therefore selenomethionine labeling of the protein was carried out.Preparation of Selenomethionine Derivative—JM109 cells containing the pREC7-KDGA expression vector were prepared as described previously (8Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The gene was then inserted into a pET3a expression plasmid, which confers resistance to ampicillin, contains the lacZ promoter, and is compatible with the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain, B834. Transformed B834(DE3) cells were grown in basic medium containing l-selenomethionine and 20 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C. Once the optical density of the cells had reached 0.5 at 600 nm, they were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for a further 24 h at 250 rpm, 37 °C. The purification procedure for the Se-Met derivative was as for the native protein (12Hendry E.J. Buchanan C.L. Russell R.J. Hough D.W. Reeve C.D. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) except that all buffers contained 5 mm dithiothreitol. Screening for crystallization conditions had to be repeated as no crystals were obtained under the conditions described for the native protein (8Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Reproducible thin triangular crystals were obtained at 20 °C in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.0, 8% (v/v) isopropanol, 13% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (buffer A). The crystals belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 84.1 Å, b = 131.5 Å, c = 132.5 Å. The pH optimum for the enzyme is pH 6.0, and therefore this crystal form is at a more physiologically relevant pH value compared with the acidic conditions under which the original crystals were obtained. Crystals of the native protein were also obtained at these pH 6.0 conditions and used for collection of the native data to 2.0 Å and for substrate soaks.Data Collection and Reduction—The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected on a MAR-CCD detector at three wavelengths around the Se-K edge on station ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved through equilibration against mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol, and data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal to 2.5 Å. Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALE-PACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38344) Google Scholar).Structure Solution—The selenium substructure was determined using version 1.15 of SOLVE (14Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Estimates of the solvent content suggested that there was one tetramer present in the asymmetric unit, and all 16 expected selenium atoms were identified by Patterson analysis, resulting in a figure of merit of 0.27-2.5 Å. The selenium sites had peak heights of ∼15 σ. The phase estimates from SOLVE were used with DM (15Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), as implemented in the CCP4 program suite (16P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19698) Google Scholar) to calculate a solvent-flattened electron density map, which had distinct solvent boundaries and evident regions of secondary structure. A mask was generated from the experimental bones of the solvent-flattened map, and full noncrystallographic symmetry averaging was performed in DM. The initial correlation between the monomers was 0.70, and this improved to 0.91 after 50 cycles of averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching. The final figure of merit in the top resolution shell was 0.79.Model Building and Refinement—A polyalanine model was constructed manually into the averaged map using the bones as a guide. Sequence assignment started at the clearest part of the model, which was the stretch of three tyrosines at positions 102, 103, and 104. Manual model building was followed by refinement by simulated annealing, as implemented in crystallography NMR software (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), against the 2.5-Å inflection data with a 10% subset of reflections being omitted from the refinement calculations. 200 cycles of simulated annealing resulted in the R-factor dropping from 48.0 to 34.0%, and the R-free went from 47.6 to 35.9%. Subsequent refinement was through manual adjustment of side chains followed by energy minimization and individual B-factor refinement with no noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Water molecules were then added. The final model is complete in all monomers, with every residue clearly seen in the density from Pro-2 to Glu-294. The final R-factor was 19.7% and R-free factor 24.1%.

Open table in a new tab Schiff Base Formation—Crystals of KDGA were soaked with 50 mm pyruvate in buffer A for 30 min at 20 °C. The KDG Schiff based complex was formed by soaking crystals with 30 mm KDG in buffer A for 1 min at 4 °C. The KDGal Schiff based complex was formed by soaking crystals with 25 mm KDGal in buffer A for 1 min at 4 °C. In all cases, soaked crystals were then cryoprotected by rapid stepwise equilibration against buffer A with substrate containing 10% (v/v), followed by 20% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals were then flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K, and data were collected on beamline ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (λ = 0.933 Å). The complexes were refined using REFMAC to give statistics shown in Table I. KDG and KDGal were produced as described earlier (7Lamble H.J. Heyer N.I. Bull S.D. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34066-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with diastereomeric purity confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography and 1H NMR.RESULTSOverall Structure—Each subunit of KDGA displays the same fold as the other members of the NAL subfamily, with the (α/β)8 TIM barrel structure decorated with three additional helices at the C terminus. KDGA has 26, 28, and 27% sequence identity with EcNAL, HiNAL and EcDHDPS, and their monomeric structures are all very similar, with the β-strands being highly superimposable (Fig. 1a).The KDGA tetramer is also similar to the other members of the NAL subfamily, with root mean square deviation values ranging from 2.1 to 2.3 Å with any of the other enzymes. The tetramer can be thought of as a dimer of dimers (18Mirwaldt C. Korndorfer I. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) having a more extensive subunit interface between the AD (or BC) dimer with 1640 Å2 of surface buried compared to 1100 Å2 buried at the AC (or BD) interface (Fig. 1b). In all members of the family the AC (or BD) interface is polar, whereas the AD (or BC) interface is hydrophobic. The AD (or BC) interface in KDGA, however, is larger than in the other enzymes, and this is reflected in the greater number of interactions between the KDGA subunits. KDGA also has more intersubunit ion pairs than the others. In the AC (or BD) interface, Arg-169 of one subunit forms ion pairs with each of Glu-234 and Asp-230 of the other subunit. Similar pairs are seen in the AD (or BC) interface between Lys-110 of one subunit and the Glu-271 or Asp-268 of the other. The localization of ion pairs across the subunit interfaces differs among the other members of the family: EcDHDPS has no intersubunit ion pairs across either of the interfaces; HiNAL and EcNAL both have intersubunit pairs across the AC interface, but only EcNAL has ion pairs across the AD interface.Enzyme-Substrate Complexes—All complexes were obtained by soaking protein crystals with substrate prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to space group P212121, with a KDGA tetramer in the asymmetric unit, and the same structural features were observed in each monomer unless otherwise stated.Pyruvate Schiff Base Complex—A Schiff base complex with pyruvate was obtained by soaking a crystal in 50 mm pyruvate at pH 6.0 for 30 min at 21 °C, more than 60 °C below the physiological temperature of the enzyme. The difference Fourier maps identified a covalent bond between the Nζ of Lys-155 and C-2 of pyruvate, the planar trigonal geometry about the C-2 position being consistent with the Schiff base intermediate form (Fig. 2a). The carboxylate group of the pyruvate Schiff base forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Thr-43 and Thr-44 and the Oγ of Thr-44. Thr-43 is stabilized through hydrogen bonding of its Oγ to the hydroxyl of Tyr-103 from another monomer. The C-3 of the pyruvate adduct points toward a water-filled cavity.Fig. 2Ligand complexes.a, pyruvate Schiff base Fo - Fc map contoured at 2.5 σ. b, comparison of the native and pyruvate complex. c, KDG Schiff base Fo - Fc map contoured at 2.5 σ. d, KDGal Schiff base Fo - Fc map contoured at 3 σ (cyan) and 2 σ (magenta), showing the final refined structures of KDGal (yellow carbons) and pyruvate + d-glyceraldehyde (orange carbons). e, interactions made by KDGal. f, interactions made by pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde.

In the native structure the hydroxyl of Tyr-130 forms hydrogen bond interactions with the amide group and Oγ of Thr-43, the Nζ of Lys-155, and two water molecules, one of which (W1) hydrogen-bonds to the Oγ of Thr-157. In the pyruvate complex one of these water molecules is displaced by the carboxylate group of the pyruvate, and Tyr-130 rotates around χ1 and χ2, leading to a shift of ∼1 Å in its hydroxyl position. In its new conformation, this tyrosyl hydroxyl is in close proximity (3.1-3.2 Å) to one of the carboxylate oxygens of the pyruvate, while still hydrogen-bonding to the Oγ of Thr-43 and the Oγ of Thr-157 via W1. This shift in Tyr-130 brings the plane of the tyrosine ring parallel to the plane of the pyruvate, which is held on its opposite face by Pro-7, forcing the methyl group (C-3) of pyruvate into close proximity with W1 (∼3.1 Å).KDG Schiff Base Complex—A Schiff base complex with KDG was obtained by soaking a crystal in 30 mm KDG at pH 6.0 for 1 min at 4 °C, more than 80 °C below the physiological temperature of the enzyme. The difference Fourier map reveals clear electron density for the trapped KDG forming a Schiff base with Lys-155 (Fig. 2c). The carboxyl group of KDG lies in the same position as the carboxyl group of pyruvate, making the same hydrogen bond interactions with the enzyme. The hydroxyl (O-4) connected to C-4 of KDG takes the place of water W1 of the pyruvate complex and forms a close interaction with the OH group of Tyr-130, ranging from 2.3 to 2.5 Å. O-4 also makes a hydrogen bond interaction with Oγ of Thr-157. In contrast to these groups, the C-5 hydroxyl (O-5) shows significant deviations in its position across the tetramer. Despite this, in three of the monomers it is seen interacting with a water molecule (W2) that hydrogen-bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly-179 and the amide of Ala-198. O-6 also displays some flexibility and in addition to the hydrogen bond it forms with the OH group of Tyr-132, directly (2.8-3.3 Å) or via a water molecule, a water-mediated interaction with the Oγ of Thr-44 is observed in two of the monomers.KDGal Schiff Base Complex—To trap KDGal in the enzyme, a crystal was soaked in 25 mm KDGal at pH 6.0 for 1 min at 4 °C. The Fo - Fc difference electron density map reveals clear electron density for Schiff base formation with Lys-155 (Fig. 2d); however, in all four monomers there is both density corresponding to the methyl C-3 of pyruvate and connecting density corresponding to the C-3-C-4 bond of KDGal. During refinement a number of models were tested to account for the electron density: pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde, KDGal, and a mixture of all three ligands. The most consistent interpretation, measured by lack of unexplained electron density in the final Fo - Fc electron density maps, was a mixture of ligands with occupancies of 80% for pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde and 20% for KDGal. Comparing the KDGal complex with the KDG complex, the major difference is the conformation of the sugar from C-3 to C-6 and the interactions made by its hydroxyl oxygens. KDGal is the C-4 epimer of KDG, and in the KDGal complex the C-3 and C-4 atoms shift relative to their positions in the KDG complex, thereby still allowing O-4 to hydrogen bond to the OH of Tyr-130 and Oγ of Thr-157 (Fig. 2e). In the KDGal complex, however, the hydrogen bond distance between O-4 and Tyr-130 increases by an average of 0.2 Å, and the interaction with Thr-157 becomes closer (2.5-2.8 Å). As in the case of KDG, the C-5 and C-6 hydroxyls also display flexibility in the KDGal complex. However, O-5 now hydrogen-bonds directly with the hydroxyl of Tyr-132, whereas O-6 is seen interacting differently with the enzyme in the four monomers. In monomers A and B, O-6 hydrogen-bonds to Oγ of Thr-44 and makes a water-mediated interaction with Oγ of Ser-241 and Nδ2 of Asn-245. In monomers C and D, O-6 is shifted and makes the same interactions as in monomers A and B via a water molecule that occupies its previous position.The complex with pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde has the pyruvate in the same position as observed in the pyruvate Schiff base complex discussed above, whereas d-glyceraldehyde takes up a slightly shifted position relative to the C-4 to C-6 moiety of KDGal. The glyceraldehyde O-3 (equivalent to O-4 in KDGal) hydrogen-bonds to Oγ of Thr-157 and the OH of Tyr-130 but with longer hydrogen bonds (∼2.7 and ∼3 Å, respectively) than seen in the KDGal complex (Fig. 2f). Glyceraldehyde O-2 (equivalent to O-5 in KDGal) is observed either hydrogen bonding to Tyr-132 (monomer A) or making a water-mediated interaction with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly-179 and the amide of Ala-198 (monomers C and D). Glyceraldehyde O-3 is involved in the same interactions as its O-6 equivalent in KDGal.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies on the NAL superfamily have trapped pyruvate Schiff base complexes either by borohydride reduction in the case of EcNAL (9Lawrence M.C. Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. Hall N.E. Pilling P.A. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), at high pH in the case of EcDHDPS (19Blickling S. Renner C. Laber B. Pohlenz H.D. Holak T.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), or by adding pyruvate to the crystallization buffer in the case of Nicotiana sylvestris DHDPS (20Blickling S. Beisel H.G. Bozic D. Knablein J. Laber B. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Substrate analogues have also been used to understand substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism (9Lawrence M.C. Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. Hall N.E. Pilling P.A. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as well as acid quenching to trap Schiff base intermediates in Type I aldolases (21Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study we have been able to trap the natural substrates pyruvate, KDG, and KDGal by soaking crystals of KDGA for a short time at 80 °C below the physiological temperature of the enzyme. In the case of the KDGal complex, we have also observed a complex with the cleavage products pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde from turnover of the substrate in the crystal.KDGA was predicted to belong to the NAL superfamily (11Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. DeGori R. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. Campi E.M. Jackson W.R. Brossmer R. Sommer M. Lawrence M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), members of which are proposed to have similar active sites but are modulated to accommodate varying substrates. Our structural studies largely confirm this prediction, and a scheme for the catalytic mechanism of KDGA, based on that proposed for NAL (11Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. DeGori R. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. Campi E.M. Jackson W.R. Brossmer R. Sommer M. Lawrence M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 3. However, there are differences in the details of how KDG and KDGal are recognized by KDGA. A primary group of active site residues, conserved across the NAL superfamily, was defined as being associated with the binding of the α-keto acid moiety of the substrate and the enzyme reaction. In KDGA these include: (i) Lys-155, located at the C-terminal end of strand β6, which forms the Schiff base; (ii) Tyr-130 at the C-terminal end of strand β5; and (iii) a GTTG motif, including Thr-43 and Thr-44, in the loop between strand β2 and helix α2, involved in binding the carboxylate group of the substrate. It was previously suggested that the carbonyl of Gly-179 would be involved in binding the hydroxyl at C-4 of the substrate in KDGA (11Barbosa J.A. Smith B.J. DeGori R. Ooi H.C. Marcuccio S.M. Campi E.M. Jackson W.R. Brossmer R. Sommer M. Lawrence M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, our structural studies show that this is not the case; O-4 interacts with Oγ of Thr-157 and with the OH of Tyr-130. In all four KDGA structures presented here, the native and three Schiff base complexes, Tyr-130 interacts with the Oγ of Thr-43, which in turn interacts with the OH of Tyr-103 from another monomer. The structures of EcNAL, HiNAL, and EcDHDPS also have equivalent relays of hydrogen bonds involving"

The N-terminal domain of this protein has no significant sequence homology with proteins of known function, whereas the C-terminal domain is similar to the catalytic domains of PP2C-type phosphatases. The phosphatase activity of RsbU is stimulated greatly during the response to stress by associating with a kinase, RsbT. This association leads to the induction of σB activity. Here we present data on the activation process and demonstrate in vivo that truncations in the N-terminal region of RsbU are deleterious for the activation of RsbU. This conclusion is supported by comparisons of the phosphatase activities of full-length and a truncated form of RsbU in vitro. Our determination of the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of RsbU from Bacillus subtilis reveals structural similarities to the regulatory domains from ubiquitous protein phosphatases and a conserved domain of σ-factors, illuminating the activation processes of phosphatases and the evolution of “partner switching.” Finally, the molecular basis of kinase recruitment by the RsbU phosphatase is discussed by comparing RsbU sequences from bacteria that either possess or lack RsbT.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is the predominant regulatory mechanism in biology, modulating cellular processes such as signaling, division, and development. The phosphorylation of regulatory proteins by protein kinases effects a change in their function and structure (1Johnson L.N. Lewis R.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2209-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), reversed by the action of protein phosphatases, which restore the regulatory proteins to their original, unphosphorylated state. Hence the cellular response is determined by controlling the enzymatic activities of the mutually antagonistic kinases and phosphatases. Protein phosphatases can be divided into three major groups, defined by their substrate specificity (2Kennelly P.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2291-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar): phosphotyrosine (further subdivided into Cdc25 and the conventional and the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatases), phosphoserine/threonine (further subdivided into protein phosphatase P and M families), and phosphoaspartate phosphatases (e.g. Rap and Spo0E from Bacillus). In addition, there is the dual-specific phosphatase group, which can dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine substrates, and it has been recorded that several histidine kinases also have phosphohistidine phosphatase activity (3Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In Bacillus subtilis, five serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been identified that belong to the PP2C subgroup of the protein phosphatase M family, namely PrpC (4Obuchowski M. Madec E. Delattre D. Boel G. Iwanicki A. Foulger D. Seror S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), SpoIIE (5Duncan L. Alper S. Arigoni F. Losick R. Stragier P. Science. 1995; 270: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), RsbP (6Vijay K. Brody M.S. Fredlund E. Price C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), RsbX and RsbU (7Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PrpC plays an important regulatory role in stationary phase (8Gaidenko T.A. Kim T.J. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and SpoIIE regulates differentiation in Bacillus, a process known as sporulation, by forming a complex with the cell division protein FtsZ (5Duncan L. Alper S. Arigoni F. Losick R. Stragier P. Science. 1995; 270: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Lucet I. Feucht A. Yudkin M.D. Errington J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RsbX, RsbP, and RsbU are involved in the regulation of the alternative σ factor, σB, which controls the general stress response of B. subtilis and other Gram+ microorganisms, such as the human pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (10Hecker M. Völker U. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 35-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Price C.W. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: from Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 369-384Google Scholar). Depending on the nature of the stress, the signal is conveyed to σB by two separate pathways, which converge on phosphorylated RsbV (RsbV-P), 1The abbreviations used are: RsbV-P, phosphorylated RsbV; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; PP5, protein phosphatase 5. 1The abbreviations used are: RsbV-P, phosphorylated RsbV; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; PP5, protein phosphatase 5. the common substrate for RsbP and RsbU (Fig. 1). A decrease in the intracellular energy level activates RsbP, via RsbQ (12Brody M.S. Vijay K. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6422-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas environmental stresses such as heat or salt shock, or ethanol treatment, activate RsbU, via the kinase RsbT (7Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Akbar S. Yang X. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3846-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Völker U. Dufour A. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated RsbV subsequently liberates σB from the transcriptionally inactive σB·RsbW complex, by competing with σB for binding surfaces on RsbW (15Alper S. Dufour A. Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Delumeau O. Lewis R.J. Yudkin M.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5583-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), freeing σB to bind to core RNA polymerase to activate transcription of the σB regulon. The alternative binding of RsbW to σB or RsbV is a regulatory mechanism called “partner switching” (17Alper S. Duncan L. Losick R. Cell. 1994; 77: 195-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).RsbT is related to the anti-σ factors RsbW and SpoIIAB; all are members of the GHKL family of kinases/ATPases, a group that includes two-component histidine kinases, topoisomerases, and chaperones. However, RsbT does not bind, as in the other partner-switching mechanisms, to σ or anti-anti-σ factors. During exponential growth RsbT is thought to be sequestered in a large supramolecular complex composed of RsbR and RsbS (18Chen C.-C. Lewis R.J. Harris R. Yudkin M.D. Delumeau O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, during environmental stress RsbT is liberated from the supramolecular complex after phosphorylating its substrates, RsbR and RsbS. RsbT is then free to associate with, and activate, RsbU (7Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). RsbU is not a substrate for the kinase activity of RsbT (19Kang C.M. Vijay K. Price C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the precise mechanism of the activation of RsbU by RsbT remains unknown. Analysis of the sequence of RsbU shows that it is composed of two domains, a C-terminal domain of ∼200 amino acids with sequence homology to other PP2C-type phosphatases and a N-terminal domain of ∼110 amino acids with no significant homology to any non-RsbU sequences. The simplest hypothesis regarding the role of the N-terminal domain of RsbU is that it exerts an inhibitory influence on the C-terminal, catalytic domain, which is relieved by the binding of RsbT to RsbU.We report here an investigation into the activation process of RsbU that integrates genetics and molecular and structural biology. The phenotype of B. subtilis strains containing deletions in the N-terminal domain of RsbU support the view that this domain plays a critical role in the activation of the phosphatase by RsbT. These results are discussed in the light of our determination of the crystal structure at 1.6-Å resolution of the N-terminal domain of RsbU, and conclusions are drawn as to the nature of the activation process of RsbU.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The experiments conducted in this study (Table I) were performed with derivatives of B. subtilis wild type strain 168 (20Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). For the construction of the various truncated versions of RsbU, there were two approaches. First, the rsbU gene, and truncated versions thereof, were amplified by PCR with chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis strain 168 as the template using appropriate primer pairs and a proofreading Taq polymerase. Subsequently, all these PCR products were digested with HindIII and SalI and ligated into the non-integrative plasmid pDG148 (21Stragier P. Bonamy C. Karmazyn-Campelli C. Cell. 1988; 52: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which had also been digested with the same enzymes. The different rsbU alleles were thus placed under the control of the IPTG-regulated promoter Pspac. After transformation into Escherichia coli strains TOP10 or TG2, and confirmation of the correct DNA sequence of the rsbU inserts by sequencing, plasmids carrying the wild type rsbU sequence (pGK01) and the truncations ΔrsbU1–19 (pMB21), ΔrsbU1–38 (pGK02), ΔrsbU1–77 (pGK03), ΔrsbU1–93 (pGK04), and ΔrsbU1–134 (pGK05) were selected for transformation into B. subtilis BSA140 (Table I). The B. subtilis strain BSA140 carries a ctc::lacZ transcriptional reporter gene fusion, but lacks a functional copy of rsbU because of a deletion of an NdeI fragment internal to the rsbU structural gene. Transformants were selected for their resistance to kanamycin (20 μg ml-1) creating strains BSG14, BSG15, BSG16, BSG17, BSG18, and BSG19, respectively (Table I).Table IPlasmids and strains used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype or features of plasmidConstruction or Ref.B. subtilisBSA46PY22 SPβ ctc::lacZ erm cat 86aThe cat86 gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance is linked to the ctc::lacZ reporter gene fusion58Benson A.K.

Hanschke R. Hecker M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose as a carbon source and l-tryptophan (0.78 mm). The cultures were inoculated from overnight cultures propagated in minimal media containing kanamycin to an optical density at 540 nm of 0.05. The expression of the plasmid-encoded rsbU variants was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm. Ethanol stress was imposed on the cells during exponential growth phase (A540 = 0.3) by the addition of ethanol to a final concentration of 4% (v/v).In the second approach, B. subtilis strain PB291, previously deleted for rsbU, was transformed with derivatives of plasmid pMLK (23Karow M.L. Piggot P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which directs integration at the amyE locus. A fragment of DNA corresponding to PA-rsbR-rsbS-rsbT-rsbU (where PA represents the σA-dependent promoter region of the operon) was excised from plasmid pAW70 (24Wise A.A. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 123-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by BamHI restriction digest and cloned in pMLK using the BamHI site in amyE. For the cloning of rsbR, rsbS, rsbT, and a fragment of rsbU coding for the C-terminal catalytic domain only (ΔN-rsbU-(1–112), the regions corresponding to PA-rsbR-rsbS-rsbT and ΔN-rsbU-(1–112) were amplified separately by PCR using primers that allow overlaps between the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively. The annealed PCR products were subsequently used as the template for a further round of PCR to yield a DNA fragment of PA-rsbR-rsbS-rsbT-ΔN-rsbU-(1–112), which was also cloned in pMLK at the BamHI site in amyE. Transformants of these strains, which are diploid for rsbR, rsbS, and rsbT, were selected by loss of amylase activity on starch plates. Bacteria were grown in buffered LB, and subjected to 4% ethanol stress at time 0.In both cases, the β-galactosidase activity of the ctc::lacZ reporter gene fusion was determined by harvesting 1-ml aliquots of cells at appropriate time points by centrifugation at 4 °C. β-Galactosidase enzyme assays were conducted as previously described (14Völker U. Dufour A. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar).Purification of Full-length RsbU and Truncated Proteins—RsbU was overexpressed in E. coli (BL21) and was purified using a procedure slightly modified from that previously published (18Chen C.-C. Lewis R.J. Harris R. Yudkin M.D. Delumeau O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted by sonication in 30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 and the chromatogram was developed with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 400 mm. The RsbU-containing fractions were concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon) and then loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). To remove the few remaining contaminants, RsbU was further purified using high resolution Mono-Q ion exchange chromatography using the same buffer conditions as for the earlier DEAE-Sepharose column. For C-RsbU, which was cloned into pET15b, the overexpression and purification protocols were similar to those for full-length RsbU, except that a Superdex-75 gel filtration column was used instead of Superdex-200. The two N-RsbU constructs (residues 1–84 and 1–112) were purified as described previously (26Dutta S. Lewis R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); RsbT was purified as described previously (18Chen C.-C. Lewis R.J. Harris R. Yudkin M.D. Delumeau O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) except that all buffers were supplemented with 100 μm ATP to maintain RsbT in a soluble form. Estimates of the molecular sizes of RsbU, N-RsbU, and C-RsbU were obtained by the use of Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration chromatography, calibrated against proteins of known molecular sizes.Measurement of the Phosphatase Activity—RsbV-P, the phosphatase substrate, was prepared as previously described (18Chen C.-C. Lewis R.J. Harris R. Yudkin M.D. Delumeau O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation reactions were performed in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm MnCl2,and1mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C with 30 μm RsbV-P, 0.5 μm RsbU (or C-RsbU) and, unless specified, 1 μm RsbT. The rates of dephosphorylation of RsbV-P were measured at various time intervals by removing 20-μl samples, stopping the reaction in each by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (40% glycerol, 200 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and placing the sample on ice until analysis by native gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. RsbV-P and RsbV bands are easily separated on a 12% acrylamide gel (16Delumeau O. Lewis R.J. Yudkin M.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5583-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Eight time points were normally taken per reaction. The gels were scanned and intensities of the bands corresponding to the appearance of RsbV were measured with Scion Image software. The values were then compared with a standard curve of known concentrations of RsbV treated under the same electrophoretic conditions.Crystallographic Methods—The structure of N-RsbU was determined by selenomethionine MAD phasing. To prepare selenomethionyl-labeled N-RsbU, the E. coli methionine auxotroph, B834 (DE3), was transformed with pETNRsbUL, a pET15b derivative that directs the IPTG-inducible expression of N-RsbU-(1–112) (26Dutta S. Lewis R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Transformants were initially grown in LB media, before harvesting, washing, and finally inoculating selenomethionyl media. This culture was grown for a further 4 h before the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cells were harvested by centrifugation 4 h later, and the cell pellets were stored at -80 °C overnight. Purification and crystallization were carried out as reported previously (26Dutta S. Lewis R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The near complete incorporation of selenomethionine was confirmed by mass spectrometry.MAD diffraction data were collected at beamline BM14 of the ESRF, Grenoble, France, from a single crystal of SeMet N-RsbU at three different wavelengths to ∼2.1-Å resolution. Each data set was individually integrated and reduced using the HKL suite (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38355) Google Scholar) scaling the Bijvoet pairs separately. Native diffraction data were collected separately on ID14-EH2 to a resolution of 1.6 Å for refinement purposes. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table II. The structure was determined with the program SOLVE in its automatic mode (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). A total of two heavy atom sites were found corresponding to the two internal methionines, with a SOLVE Z-score of 9.1. MAD phasing from these sites produced an electron density map with a clear boundary between protein and solvent, and a mean FOM to 2.3 Å of 0.34. These phases were improved by density modification in RESOLVE (mean FOM of 0.47), producing an electron density map of sufficient quality for RESOLVE to automatically build amino acids 3–34 (helices 1–2) and 44–58 (helix 3) with the correct sequence. After initial refinement in REFMAC (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar), the higher resolution data became available and refinement proceeded against these data, where the Rfree flags were maintained from the MAD data. Building of the rest of the structure, mostly loops and helix 4, was performed by hand in QUANTA (Acclerys). All other calculations were performed using programs from the CCP4 suite (30P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19703) Google Scholar). The loop between helices 3 and 4 was built in two stages, commencing only when its path could be traced unequivocally. Successive rounds of rebuilding and refinement were interspersed until refinement converged, at an Rwork of 19.6% and Rfree of 22.9%. Greater than 97% of the residues of the final model fall within the core region of the Ramachandran plot, and the overall G factor is 1.6. Statistics for the final model are presented in Table II.

To test this hypothesis experimentally, a series of N-terminal truncated RsbU variants were designed and their effect on σB activity was tested both in exponentially growing cells and in cells exposed to ethanol, a well known environmental stress stimulus. Specifically, the truncations were of the first 19, 38, 77, 93, and 134 amino acids. A wild-type copy and each of the truncated rsbU genes were cloned by PCR into the self-replicating plasmid pDG148 and thus were placed under the control of the IPTG-inducible promoter, Pspac. Plasmids were transformed into a derivative of B. subtilis wild-type strain BSA46, in which the chromosomal copy of rsbU had been inactivated by a deletion of an internal NdeI fragment in rsbU (BSA140) (14Völker U. Dufour A. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of all truncated versions of RsbU on IPTG induction was verified by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibodies directed against RsbU (data not shown). σB activity was monitored under the same conditions with a ctc-lacZ reporter gene fusion. This fusion is known to be strictly σB-dependent (31Igo M. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and thus the β-galactosidase activity of those strains is directly correlated to σB activity.Surprisingly, although all the RsbU variants were expressed, none of the strains harboring the plasmid-encoded truncated rsbU alleles displayed any significant ctc-lacZ reporter gene activity during exponential growth in the presence of the inducer IPTG (data not shown). Only the strain carrying a plasmid-encoded full-length copy of rsbU displayed a modest β-galactosidase, and hence σB activity, in the presence of IPTG. Therefore, partial or complete deletion of the N-terminal domain of RsbU does not render RsbU constitutively active in vivo. Next, the ability of the truncated RsbU variants to mediate environmental stress-triggered activation of σB was tested. Cells grown in the presence or absence of the inducer IPTG were exposed to 4% ethanol, a well known strong inducer of the σB regulon (32Boylan S.A. Redfield A.R. Brody M.S. Price C.W. J.

This result is fully consistent with the proposed role of this residue as an active site base that initiates catalysis. Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH, 1The abbreviations used are: XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; Moco, molybdenum cofactor; AFR, activity to flavin ratio. EC 1.1.1.204) catalyzes the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid, the last two steps in the formation of urate. A water molecule rather than O2 is the ultimate source of oxygen incorporated into the product, and the reaction is thus fundamentally different from that of all other monooxygenase/hydroxylase systems. The mammalian enzyme is synthesized as the dehydrogenase form, XDH, and exists mostly as such in the cell, although it can readily be converted to an oxidase form (XO) by oxidation of sulfhydryl residues or by proteolysis (1Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Waud W.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). XDH shows a preference for NAD+ reduction at the FAD site but is also able to react with molecular oxygen, whereas XO fails to react with NAD+ and exclusively uses dioxygen as its substrate. The conversion of XDH to XO is of considerable medical interest, because the enzyme is implicated in hyperuricemia, and its activity is proposed to play a role in post-ischemic reperfusion injury (3McCord J.M. New Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar). The mammalian enzyme is a homodimer with a molecular mass of 290 kDa, with each monomer acting independently in catalysis. Each subunit contains one molybdenum cofactor (Moco, consisting of a MoOS(OH) core coordinated to 1 eq of molybdopterin), two [2Fe-2S] clusters that are distinguishable by EPR, and 1 eq of FAD (4Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). The oxidation of xanthine takes place at the Moco, and the electrons thus introduced are transferred via the two FeS centers to FAD by intramolecular electron transfer. Rhodobacter capsulatus XDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme with an (αβ)2 heterodimeric structure, with the two subunits encoded by the xdhA and xdhB genes, respectively (5Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The redox-active cofactors are bound to two different subunits; the FAD and [2Fe2S] centers are found in the XDHA subunits, and the Moco is found in the XDHB subunits. This complement of redox-active centers provides the enzyme with the capacity to hold a maximum of 6 reducing eq per functioning αβ unit (corresponding to one intact subunit in the case of the vertebrate enzymes) upon reduction; under anaerobic conditions each can react with 3 eq of xanthine. Unlike the mammalian oxidoreductases, but like avian XDH, R. capsulatus XDH is isolated with high reactivity toward NAD+ and does not undergo the conversion to the oxidase form (6Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to xanthine, XDH is reducible by NADH (7Rajagopalan K.V. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4097-4107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G.

A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and the homologous bacterial XDH from R. capsulatus (10Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have paved the way for a detailed structural and functional analysis of these enzymes. In previous work (6Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) we have reported a system for the heterologous expression of R. capsulatus in Escherichia coli. The bacterial XDH thus represents an ideal system for the generation of site-directed mutants by which the catalytic roles of various active site residues at the molybdenum center can be evaluated. Here we describe a detailed kinetic characterization of wild-type XDH by steady state and rapid reaction kinetics, and we then compare and contrast this with the behavior of site-specific mutations of two glutamate residues at the active site of the enzyme. The two active site glutamate residues that have been targeted, Glu-232 and Glu-730, have been proposed to be involved in either substrate binding or in rate acceleration of substrate oxidation by base catalysis. Our kinetic results with Glu-232 and Glu-730 variants clearly identify these residues as important for catalysis, and we show that residue Glu-730 is essential for catalysis by acting as an active site base that initiates substrate oxidation. Our data provide the first mutagenic study of amino acid residues at the active site of a xanthine oxidoreductase. Protein Purification—R. capsulatus XDH was purified using the procedure described by Leimkühler et al. (6Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Instead of chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B/folate gel (11Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The inactive form of XDH was eluted from the affinity column with 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, containing 10% pyrophosphate. The fully active form of XDH was eluted with 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, containing 15% pyrophosphate and 20 mm salicylate. Both fractions were separately concentrated using ultrafiltration, gel filtered using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and finally stored in 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. By using PCR mutagenesis amino acid exchanges E232A, E730A, E730Q, E730D, and E730R were introduced into R. capsulatus XDH. The generated XDH variants were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and Q-Sepharose chromatography, and XDH variant E232A was additionally purified on Sepharose 4B/folate gel. Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, in a final volume of 1 ml. Routine assay mixtures contained 1 mm xanthine. XDH activities with various electron acceptors were determined by monitoring the absorbance changes as follows: NAD+ (1 mm; 340 nm), O2 (air-saturated buffer; 295 nm), or cytochrome c (16.7 μm; 550 nm). XDH concentration was determined from the absorbance at 465 nm using the extinction coefficient of 31.6 mm–1 cm–1 for the native enzyme. The extinction coefficient was determined on the basis of FAD content after acid precipitation. The activity to flavin ratio (AFR) was obtained by dividing the change in absorbance/min at 295 nm in the presence of NAD by the absorbance at 465 nm of the enzyme used in the assay at 25 °C. Reductive Titration with Sodium Dithionite—Reductive titration of XDH was carried out in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, at 20 °C. Anaerobic enzyme was prepared in an all-glass apparatus (12Williams C.H.J. Arscott L.D. Mathews R.G. Thorpe C. Wilkenson K.D. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) by using oxygen-free argon obtained by passing the argon gas through a column of Oxyout (Osaka Sanso). Sodium dithionite was dissolved in the same buffer and made anaerobic by bubbling with oxygen-free argon for more than 10 min and put in a gas-tight glass syringe. Concentrations of sodium dithionite were determined by titration with a solution of FAD of known concentration. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3200 spectrophotometer in a double-beam mode. Absorbance Spectra during Anaerobic Reduction with Xanthine and NADH—XDH in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, was put in the main compartment of an anaerobic cuvette, and 50 μl of 10 mm xanthine or NADH were put in the side arm. The solutions in the main compartment and side arm were made anaerobic by repeat evacuation and flushing with argon. The reaction was started by mixing the two solutions and was allowed to proceed at 20 °C. Recording of the absorbance spectrum was repeated over the range of 250 to 800 nm with a Beckman DU-7400 diode array spectrophotometer. Rapid Reaction Kinetics of Recombinant Protein—Rapid half-reaction experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions in 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, at 4 °C with an Applied Photophysics SX-18MV kinetic spectrophotometer with a 1-cm observation path length. For recombinant wild-type XDH, enzyme concentrations of 4–5 μm were mixed in equal volumes of various concentrations of xanthine or NADH. Absorbance changes were monitored at 460 and 620 nm in time periods ranging from 0.05 to 1 s, and the observed rate constants kobs were then plotted against substrate concentration to obtain the reduction constant (kred) and the dissociation constant (Kd). For the E232A variant, the enzyme concentrations of 30–40 μm were mixed in equal volumes with various concentrations of xanthine (24–520 μm). Absorbance changes were monitored at 460 nm in periods ranging from 10 to 200 s. The E730A, E730Q, E730D, and E730R variants were too slow to be observed on the stopped flow and were therefore reacted under anaerobic conditions between 5 and 24 h while periodically measuring an absorbance spectrum. Quantitative Analysis of the Amount of Cyanolysable Sulfur Present in R. capsulatus XDH—In order to assess quantitatively the degree of incorporation of both molybdenum and the acid-labile sulfur (present as Mo=S) in the molybdenum coordination sphere, the amount of Mo=S present in R. capsulatus XDH was determined by the cyanolysis method of Westley (13Westley J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which quantitates the amount of labile sulfur released as thiocyanate upon reaction with cyanide. 2 mg of XDH in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, were incubated with 100 mm KCN overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the protein fraction was separated from the soluble fraction by ultrafiltration. Released SCN was determined by the addition of 500 μl of ferric nitrate reagent (100 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 200 ml of 65% HNO3 per 1500 ml) to 500 μl of the protein-free soluble fraction. Thiocyanate (complexed with iron) was quantitated by A460 using an SCN standard curve. Purification of Active R. capsulatus XDH by Folate Affinity Chromatography—R. capsulatus XDH is a member of the MoOS family of molybdenum enzymes, containing Mo=O and Mo=S groups in the molybdenum coordination sphere (10Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been shown that fully active XDH can be separated from inactive species (e.g. desulfo or demolybdo enzyme) by using affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B/folate gel (11Nishino T. Nishino T. Tsushima K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To obtain molybdenum-saturated R. capsulatus XDH, enzyme purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and Q-Sepharose chromatography was applied to a folate affinity column. Inactive R. capsulatus XDH, lacking molybdenum or both molybdenum and the catalytically essential sulfur, was eluted from the column with buffer containing 10% pyrophosphate, whereas active enzyme possessing the fully assembled molybdenum center, including the catalytically essential Mo=S group, was eluted with buffer containing 15% pyrophosphate and 20 mm salicylate. Visible absorption spectra of recombinant XDH purified after folate affinity chromatography are shown in Fig. 1. The active portion of the enzyme showed an absorbance ratio of A465/A550 of 3.12 and an A280/A465 ratio of 4.9, reflecting a high purity of the enzyme, as well as a FAD to iron content of 1:4 (Table I). On the basis of FAD content, the molar extinction coefficient for R. capsulatus XDH was calculated as 31.6 mm–1 cm–1. In contrast, the less tightly bound enzyme was mainly inactive and was determined to lack substantial amounts of the Mo=S group (Table I, data not shown). After separation of the inactive species, the active portion of R. capsulatus XDH showed an AFR (as defined under “Experimental Procedures”) of 1750. As shown in Table II, analysis of the amount of cyanolysable sulfur present in R. capsulatus XDH gave a value of 80% of Mo=S present in the enzyme. This shows that in contrast to the bovine enzyme, R. capsulatus XDH is purified in a form possessing an almost full complement of the Mo=S ligand required for activity (14Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. Vitam.

Open table in a new tab Reduction of R. capsulatus XDH by Xanthine, NADH, and Sodium Dithionite—Before characterizing variants of R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase generated by site-directed mutagenesis, it was first necessary to establish the behavior of the wild-type enzyme. The reduction of wild-type enzyme by xanthine and NADH was thus examined under anaerobic conditions. Fig. 2A shows the spectra of 13.3 μm oxidized XDH and reduced enzyme 15 s and 135 min after mixing with 0.5 mm xanthine. The reduction level reached around 80% of the initial absorbance at 465 nm immediately after mixing, and the enzyme was completely reduced after an incubation time of 135 min. Xanthine reacts at the molybdenum center of the enzyme, and 3 eq are required for full reduction. The observed biphasic reaction indicates that 80% of the enzyme is fully active and reduced in the fast phase, whereas the remaining inactive 20% is reduced in a second slower phase by intermolecular electron transfer from the (now reduced) population of functional protein, which subsequently reacts with more xanthine to become fully reduced once again (Table II). As shown in the inset of Fig. 2A, it was occasionally possible to purify essentially 100% functional R. capsulatus XDH, which is fully reduced in the fast phase of the reaction with xanthine. It is believed that the sulfuration of the enzyme is dependent to a certain degree on the expression conditions. However, because preparations of R. capsulatus XDH after expression in E. coli were usually 80% sulfurated, all further analyses were performed with that enzyme. Fig. 2B shows the spectra of 12.1 μm oxidized XDH and enzyme 10 s, 1 min, and 18 min after mixing with 0.5 mm NADH. As in the reduction with xanthine, the reduction level reached around 80% of the initial absorbance at 465 nm immediately after mixing, and it remained almost constant thereafter. This shows that reduction of the enzyme by NADH is very rapid but, as described for milk XDH and chicken XDH, is only reduced to the four-electron state by NADH (15Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18904-18914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reductive titrations of XDH with sodium dithionite were also performed (Fig. 3A). In total, 6 reducing eq/monomer were required to reach the end point of the titration (Fig. 3B). Although the molybdenum center is essentially colorless, the large color changes associated with FeS and FAD reduction permit the accumulation of reducing equivalents in these centers to be followed conveniently. 2In reductive titrations of multisite systems such as XDH, the various redox-active centers will become reduced in order of their reduction potentials, from highest to lowest. The amount of singly reduced state in centers such as FAD is dictated by the relative half-potentials of the center, i.e. those for the FAD/FADH• and FADH•/FADH2 couples. The first 2 reducing eq caused a pronounced decrease in absorbance at 466 nm, accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 630 nm and a decrease in absorbance at 530 nm, consistent with the formation of the flavin semiquinone radical with simultaneous reduction of the FeS centers to an appreciable degree. Addition of the next 2 eq resulted in little increase in absorbance at 630 nm with continued decrease in absorbance at 466 and 530 nm. This suggests that the flavin semiquinone level remained unchanged, whereas the FeS centers became reduced to a greater degree. The last 2 reducing eq caused a continuous and uniform loss of the remaining absorbance at all wavelengths, indicating reduction of flavin semiquinone to the hydroquinone. These data are consistent with the reductive titration of chicken liver XDH (17Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13528-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pointing to a similar order of oxidation-reduction potentials for both enzymes. Steady State Kinetics and Superoxide Generation of Wild-type Enzyme—Steady state kinetics of wild-type R. capsulatus XDH were performed by varying the concentrations of xanthine and NAD (see “Experimental Procedures”). From the data, kcat(xanthine) is calculated as 108 ± 1.5 s–1, Km(xanthine) as 64.5 ± 0.9 μm (Table III), and Kmnad as 103 ± 2.5 μm. Because the enzyme used in the assay was only 80% active, the corrected turnover number for the fully functional enzyme is 135 s–1. This value is six times higher than that reported for chicken liver XDH of 22.5 s–1 (16Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is similar to that of Comamonas acidovorans XDH (18Xiang Q. Edmondson D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5441-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The bacterial enzymes thus react much faster with xanthine as substrate, which explains the higher activities (expressed as AFR) of the enzyme in standard assays as compared with bovine milk XO that have been described previously (6Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Substrate inhibition at xanthine concentrations higher than 200 μm was not observed for R. capsulatus XDH, a phenomenon described for bovine XO that is associated with substrate binding to reduced rather than oxidized forms of the enzyme generated in steady state (19Hille R. Stewart R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1570-1576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rubbo H. Radi R. Prodanov E. Biochim. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab R. capsulatus XDH, like avian XDH, is isolated with high reactivity toward NAD+ and low reactivity toward oxygen as electron acceptor and does not convert to an oxidase form (6Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum observed when enzyme is reacted with xanthine under aerobic conditions indicates that R. capsulatus XDH is largely reduced in the steady state, consistent with a lower overall reactivity toward O2 as compared with NAD+ as oxidizing substrate (Fig. 4). The predominant flavin species is the semiquinone form, as evidenced by the increase in absorption at 620 nm relative to the oxidized enzyme (Fig. 4) which is typical for the dehydrogenase form of the XORs at pH 7.8. It is known, however, that the dehydrogenase forms of the vertebrate enzymes produce a larger amount of O2·¯ than do the oxidase forms (16Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Harris C.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The production of O2·¯ during turnover is conveniently monitored by including cytochrome c into the reaction mixture, the reduction of cytochrome c by O2·¯ being considerably faster than the spontaneous dismutation of O2·¯. The amount of O2·¯ produced in the reaction mixture is obtained by comparison against a blank reaction run under the same conditions in the presence of saturating superoxide dismutase (16Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using this method we observe that the reduction of cytochrome c is the same with or without the addition of superoxide dismutase, with 1.9 mol of cytochrome c reduced per min/mol of enzyme. In comparison, 2.5 mol of urate/min/mol of enzyme were produced using O2 as electron acceptor, so that during turnover with. xanthine and O2, R. capsulatus XDH produces 38% of O2·¯ radicals. This is comparable with results with chicken liver XDH, which produces 40–44% O2·¯. radicals, and rat XDH, which produces 34% O2·¯ radicals, during turnover with xanthine and O2 (16Nishino T. Nishino T. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2518-2527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics of Reduction of Wild-type R capsulatus XDH by Xanthine and NADH—Finally, with regard to the wild-type enzyme, we have examined the kinetics of reduction by both xanthine and NADH, using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig. 5A, the reaction as followed at several different wavelengths was biphasic. The first phase of the reaction has a spectral change reflecting substantial reduction of the flavin with significant accumulation of both semiquinone and hydroquinone, as well as FeS reduction. 3The prevailing model for interpreting the spectral changes associated with the observed kinetic phases of the molybdenum hydroxylases is the rapid equilibrium model as originally proposed by Olson et al. (8Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, upon dissociation of product urate from the reduced molybdenum center, reducing equivalents equilibrate between the several redox-active centers of the enzyme according to their relative reduction potentials, and do so rapidly relative to the rate of product dissociation. It is for this reason that the kinetics of the reaction at the Moco, which is essentially colorless, can be monitored by the accumulation of reducing equivalents in the FAD and FeS centers of the enzyme. This phase is dependent on the concentration of xanthine with values of kred(xanthine) = 67.3 ± 1.3 s–1 and Kd(xanthine) 33.6 ± 2.3 μm (Fig. 5B). For both bovine XO (8Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chicken liver XDH, the overall rate-limiting step is thought to be dissociation of urate from the reduced molybdenum center (for chicken XDH, klim = 1.8 s–1 at 4 °C) (17Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13528-13538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that turnover is substantially faster in the bacterial enzymes as compared with enzyme from vertebrate sources, product release must be considerably faster than is seen with the vertebrate enzymes. The second phase of the reaction with xanthine has a similar rate following the reaction at either 460 or 620 nm (about 3 s–1) and is independent of the xanthine concentration. The second phase resulted in the disappearance of the flavin semiquinone radical (no change in absorbance at 620 nm) and a further decrease of the absorbance at 460 nm, reflecting reduction of the flavin semiquinone onto the hydroquinone, with additional reduction of the FeS centers. We have also analyzed the kinetics of reduction of XDHox by NADH. Although NADH is the product of the physiological reaction, when present in excess it can efficiently reduce XDHox to the four-electron level, effectively backing up the reaction (7Rajagopalan K.V. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4097-4107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with xanthine, reaction of XDHox with NADH gave a biphasic reaction as shown in Fig. 6A. The first phase of the reaction is very fast, and the rate constant krednadh has been estimated as 1093 ± 81 s–1 from Fig. 6B. As seen with xanthine, the spectral change associated with the first phase showed FeS reduction and flavin semiquinone accumulation. Unlike the reaction with xanthine, however, the rate constant for the second phase exhibits hyperbolic dependence on the NADH concentration and kred(NADH)S and kd(NADH)S values were determined to be 98.4 ± 1.0 s–1 and 26.8 ± 0.9 μm, respectively (Fig. 6B).

Substantial progress in leprosy control through multidrug therapy over the last 2 decades has led to a dramatic decline in prevalence from 10-12 million cases in the early 1980s to 534,000 today, as reported by 110 countries (1, World Health Organization. (2004) http://www.who.int/lep,Google Scholar). However, the current prevalence of 3.4 cases/10,000 people in the populations of the top endemic countries at the beginning of 2003 still exceeds the targeted elimination (1/10,000) of leprosy as a public health problem by the year 2000, as declared by the World Health Organization in 1991. In reality, the significance of leprosy as a disease has been undermined by the resurgence of tuberculosis in the late 1990s, which directed much of the focus of mycobacterial research away from M. leprae to its close relative, the tubercle bacillus. M. leprae is unique in that it is non-cultivable in the laboratory with an exceptionally slow growth rate, perhaps the longest doubling time of all bacteria. The bacillus can only be isolated from a host, the nine-banded armadillo or humans, and by cultivation in mouse foot pad (2Draper P. Acta Leprol. 1984; : 99-112PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, leprosy is manifested as a spectrum of disease states depending on the responsiveness or unresponsiveness of various components in the cellular immune system of the host (3Sansonetti P.

It is therefore important to identify specific molecular determinants of M. leprae that would modulate the host immune response by dictating the molecular nature of host-pathogen interactions, the spectrum of cytokines induced, and, importantly, the T cell response elicited. Unlike the more restricted expression of species- and/or strain-specific surface glycolipids, the cell wall-associated lipoarabinomannan (LAM) 1The abbreviations used are: LAM, lipoarabinomannan; Araf, arabinofuranose; CSU20LAM, LAM from M. tuberculosis clinical isolate CSU20; DEAE, diethylaminoethyl; Emb, ethambutol; ESI, electrospray ionization; GC, gas chromatography; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy; IEF, isoelectric focusing; LepLAM, LAM from M. leprae; LM, lipomannan; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ManLAM, mannose-capped LAM; Manp, mannopyranose; MS, mass spectrometry; MTX, 5-deoxy-5-methyl-5-thio-α-xylofuranose; PAS staining, periodic acid Schiff staining; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIM, phosphatidylinositolmannoside; RvLAM, LAM from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. and its related lipomannan (LM) are potent immunomodulators commonly found in all Mycobacterium species investigated to date. One of the more significant recent immunobiological findings is the firm identification of LAM from M. leprae (LepLAM), and not that from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (RvLAM), as the specific non-peptide antigens recognized by CD1b- and CD1c-restricted αβ+ CD4-/CD8- double negative T cell lines derived from the skin lesion of a leprosy patient (4Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 2795-2803PubMed Google Scholar). The CD1 protein family has been proposed to comprise a distinct lineage of antigen-presenting molecules involved specifically in the acquisition of cell-mediated immunity to persistent intracellular pathogens (6Prigozy T.I. Sieling P.A. Clemens D. Stewart P.L. Behar S.M. Porcelli S.A. Brenner M.B. Modlin R.L. Kronenberg M. Immunity. 1997; 6: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Notably, the binding site in CD1 is hydrophobic and flexibly accommodates a variety of anchoring hydrocarbon chains while exposing the diverse polar moieties of the presented lipid antigens in a region accessible for recognition by T cell receptors. The T cell specificity demonstrated against LepLAM over RvLAM therefore indicates a significant structural difference between the two LAMs and confers on LepLAM an antigenic role in mediating leprosy-specific immunopathological responses. LepLAM could be found in copious amounts in M. leprae (7Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in comparison with M. tuberculosis. Nevertheless, because of the problems in obtaining M. leprae source material for experimental studies, very little is currently known of its fine structure in contrast to the large body of work investigating LAM from the slow growing laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, as well as the fast growing M. smegmatis, M. chelonae, and M. kansasii (for review, see Refs. 8Nigou J. Gilleron M. Puzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar and 9Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Stemming from these studies, the salient and common structural features of the extremely heterogeneous LAM are now relatively well established (Fig. 1), although many of the fine details on the arabinan and mannan framework remain poorly understood. The genuine technical difficulty in defining the size distribution and the branching pattern and in localizing precisely the many known or implicated charged substituents on the arabinomannan has inevitably led to a perceivable emphasis on the non-reducing terminal capping functions, which have been accorded a myriad of receptor-binding and immunomodulatory roles. In contrast, no particular function has as yet been attributed to the characteristic terminal arabinan motifs, in which the degree of branching off the linear Araβ1→2Ara- α1→[5Araα1→]n chains to produce the branched Ara6 termini, Araβ1→2Araα1→5(Araβ1→2Araα1→3)Araα1→5Araα1→, is probably as important in determining the spatial conformation and density of the cap and hence its biological attributes. The antituberculosis drug ethambutol (Emb), for example, could inhibit complete elaboration of the arabinan and consequently abolish its mannose-capping functions in LAM from an Emb-susceptible laboratory strain of M. tuberculosis at a sub-minimal inhibitory concentration. Importantly, LAM from an Emb-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolate (CSU19) was shown (10Khoo K.-H. Tang J.-B. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3863-3871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to be more heterogeneous in the spread of size, ranging from full-size to severely truncated, and to have a significantly higher proportion of non-capped arabinan termini than RvLAM while retaining similar relative abundance of linear and branched arabinan termini. These and earlier studies demonstrated that the degree and chemical nature of capping functions on LAM are strain-specific and dependent on the relative activities of the gene products involved in the biosynthesis of the arabinan, which could be further affected by Emb. It also indicates that biological relevance of the capping function should be considered in the context of the underlying arabinan motifs. Like LAM from M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, and M. avium, LepLAM is known to carry mannose caps but apparently at a very low level (11Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As no detailed structural studies have ever been performed, it is unclear whether its overall arabinan and mannan structural framework bears any semblance to those of better characterized LAM such as RvLAM, especially in the light of the comparatively smaller genome of M. leprae because of massive gene deletion and decay (12Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R.M. Devlin K. Duthoy S.

Eiglmeier K. Lepr. Rev. 2000; 71: S162-S164PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that one or more of the complement of glycosyltransferases in M. leprae and other gene products involved in the synthesis of LAM may be absent or non-functional. Based on revised sample preparation protocols for better conservation of sample materials, we were able to accumulate mg quantities of pure LepLAM to enable a thorough structural study. We show in this work that LepLAM maintains most structural attributes of RvLAM but encapsulated within a simpler form. The low degree of mannose capping is paralleled by an overall smaller arabinan, which echoes the concept of reductive evolution for an obligate intracellular mycobacterium. Similar to our previous findings, LAM from another Emb-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolate, CSU20 (CSU20LAM), was likewise found here to be drastically altered both in size and by reduction in the degree of mannose capping in comparison with the RvLAM. Rather unexpectedly, CD1-restricted T cell clones responsive to LepLAM and not RvLAM were found to be equally responsive to CSU20LAM. This is the first evidence that differential cell-mediated immunopathological response could be elicited by LAM differing not in the identity of the capping function but in the overall arabinan framework. CSU20LAM from a clinical isolate is shown here to be more akin to LepLAM than RvLAM in both structural features and T cell immunogenicity. Chemical Reagents—All chemical reagents were of the highest grade from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Milli-Q® water was used for all chemical reactions. Growth Conditions of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CSU20—M. tuberculosis CSU20 is a clinical strain isolated from a patient in Korea. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of CSU20 for Emb, cycloserine, and pyrazinamide were 17, 60, and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Frozen stocks of the strains were plated on 7H11 agar plates (Difco) with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment supplement for 3 weeks. Early colonies were picked and transferred to 5 ml of a glycerolalanine salts broth for 2 weeks at 37 °C on a shaker. Large scale cultures were initiated by using 1 ml of broth from the starter cultures to inoculate 50 ml of fresh medium. After 7 days at 37 °C, 1 ml of the inoculated culture was transferred to 400 ml of broth at 37 °C for 2 weeks; then following the same procedure, the culture was upscaled to a liter, grown until late log phase, and harvested. About 8-10 g of cells were obtained from 2 liters of culture. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was used as our reference standard. Extraction of LAM/LM/PIMs from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CSU20—Wet cells (∼10 g) were delipidated with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) for 2 h (two times) at room temperature and dried. The dried biomass was suspended in breaking buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin), DNase, and RNase in PBS and disrupted mechanically using a French press. Triton X-114 (Sigma) was added to the lysed cells to a final concentration of 8% (v/v), and after cooling on ice, the solution was mixed at 4 °C overnight. The cell wall was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C to induce biphasic separation (14Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upper aqueous layer was mixed with the cellular debris and re-extracted as described above. The detergent layers were combined, and the lipoglycans were precipitated by the addition of 9 volumes of cold ethanol (95%, -20 °C). The precipitate was collected and treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 60 °C. The solution was dialyzed and lyophilized for further analysis. Extraction of LAM/LM/PIMs from M. leprae—M. leprae was purified from nonirradiated armadillo livers by the Draper protocol (15, Draper, P. (1980) Report of the 5th Meeting of the Scientific Working Group on the Immunology of Leprosy (IMMLEP), Geneva, Switzerland, June 24-26, 1980, Vol. Annex 4, World Health Organization, Geneva, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar). Pure wet cells (∼500 mg, obtained from 250 g of infected armadillo liver) were suspended in 2.5 ml of PBS and disrupted mechanically using a probe sonicator (W-385 Heat Systems-Ultrasonic) to achieve over 90% breakage of cells. The suspension after cell breakage was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged as before. The combined supernatants from both centrifugations containing both cytosol and membrane were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The resulting pellet, representing the membrane fraction of M. leprae, was resuspended in PBS containing Triton X-114 (4% by volume), mixed well at 4 °C, placed at 37 °C to induce phase separation, and treated with ethanol as described above. The ethanol precipitate was collected, dried, and partitioned between phenol and water (16Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous layer from the phenol partition contained the majority of cellular LAM and LM. It was evaporated to dryness and was the basis for further purification steps. Quantitation of LepLAM and RvLAM in Whole Bacteria—30 mg (wet weight) of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were washed twice with 10 mm NH4HCO3 and resuspended in 2 ml of NH4HCO3 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by intermittent probe sonication (Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710, Cole and Palmer Instruments, Chicago, IL) for 25 and 35 min (60-s bursts, 60 s of cooling). Approximately 95% of the cells were broken when the lysates were acid fast-stained and examined under the microscope. Protein concentrations of the whole-cell lysates were measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay reagent (Pierce). For quantitation of LAM/LM/PIMs, SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on the lysates, and equal amounts of samples (based on protein concentrations) were applied. Densitometry analysis of LAM and LM after silver-periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on-line at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Size Fractionation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—For LepLAM purification, a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column (100 cm × 1.5 cm; column volume = 150 ml) was prepared by washing and suspending the gel in a buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. For purification of LAM from the M. tuberculosis strains used in this study, high pressure liquid chromatography was performed on a Rainin S.D. 200 series liquid chromatography system fitted with a Sephacryl S-200 HiPrep 16/60 column in tandem with a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same eluent as for the open columns at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. SDS-PAGE and PAS staining (17Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were used to monitor the elution profile of the fractions containing LAM and LM, which were then pooled and dialyzed at 37 °C without detergent followed by water for several days. LAM/LM fractions recovered were reanalyzed by SDS-PAGE to check for purity prior to detailed analysis. Sample concentrations were maintained at 2 μg in 10 μl of sample buffer. Western blots were performed by transferring antigens (LAM/LM/PIMs, 5 μg each) from 15% SDS-PAGE to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and then probed with serum from patients with different clinical symptoms of leprosy and drug treatment status. Following incubation with the secondary anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase, reactivity was detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tretrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate (Sigma Fast Tablet substrate). Immunoblotting with mAbs CS-35 and CS-40 was performed essentially as described previously (17Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). mAb CS-35 was generated against M. leprae and has been shown to cross-react with LAM from M. tuberculosis as well as other mycobacteria. Recently, the primary epitope of recognition was defined as the terminal branched Ara6 motif present in both LAM and arabinogalactan (18Kaur D. Lowary T.L. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). mAb CS-40, on the other hand, was raised against LAM from M. tuberculosis Erdman (16Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6234-6239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reacts preferentially with the mannose-capped LAMs; the precise epitope of recognition has not been established. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of LepLAM/CSU20LAM/RvLAM—LAM (10 μg) was resuspended in 20 μl of IEF sample buffer (7 m urea, 5% ampholyte 4.5-5.4 (Amersham Biosciences) and ampholyte 3-10 (Amersham Biosciences), 2% Nonidet P-40, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and applied over the upper electrode buffer covering the top of a 6% polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing tube gel (2-mm inside diameter × 70 mm) containing 1.6% ampholytes. The tube gels were focused for 3 h at 1 kV with degassed 20 mm NaOH as the upper electrode buffer (catholyte) and 20 mm H3PO4 acid as the lower electrode buffer (anolyte), subsequently treated with transfer buffer (2.9% SDS, 71 mm Tris-HCl, 0.003% bromphenol blue) for 30 min, applied on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and stained with silver-PAS staining. The pI value of each band was determined to be 4.7, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.8, and 6.8, respectively, according to an IEF pH gradient profile as detected with a pH meter. All bands showed positive responses to the monoclonal anti-LAM antibody CS-35. LM and PIMs were also subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis, and each gave only one band spanning the pI range of 5.0-5.4. Digestion with Endoarabinanase and Subsequent Analyses—Preparation of endoarabinanase Cellulomonas gelida has been described previously (19McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To ensure complete digestion of LAMs, the reaction mixture was incubated overnight, and aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to ensure production of the mannan core as gauged by its electrophoretic mobility compared with LM. The digestion products that contained both the mannan core and the released oligoarabinosides were analyzed directly by Dionex analytical HPAEC performed on a Dionex liquid chromatography system fitted with a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column. The oligoarabinosides were detected with a pulse-amperometric detector (PAD-II) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). For a preparative scale, 2 × 2 mg aliquots of CSU20LAM (a total of 4 mg) were taken in 100 μl of water and digested with 50 μl of enzyme for 4 h, after which a fresh 30 μl of enzyme was added, and digestion continued for another 4 h. The digestion mixture was applied to a Bio-Gel P4 column at 50 °C (1000 mm × 15 mm, flow rate of 10 ml/h). Fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by HPAEC and subsequently by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). For NMR analysis, 5 mg of CSU20LAM digest was applied to an octyl Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (200 × 20 mm) and eluted with 15, 45, and 60% propanol in 0.1 m ammonium acetate. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and monitored by carbohydrate detection on a TLC plate using α-naphthol spray. The endoarabinanase-resistant core obtained (45 and 60% propanol fractions) after four consecutive digestions was further desalted through a HiPrep 26/10 (Amersham Biosciences) column prior to analyses. Digestion with α-Mannosidase—Digestion with α-1,2,3,6-mannosidase (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA), was carried out in sodium phosphate buffer (150 mm, pH 7.0) initially for 10 h at 37 °C using 1 μl of the enzyme/50 μg of LAM. Aliquots were withdrawn and analyzed by Dionex HPAEC. To ensure complete digestion, a further 1 μl of the enzyme was added, and the enzymatic digestion was continued for a further 16 h. The digestion was terminated by denaturing the enzyme. Monosaccharide, Fatty Acids, and Succinate Composition—Samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, converted to alditol acetates, and analyzed by GC using scyllo-inositol as an internal standard (20McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Ginsberg V. Methods in Enzymology. 179. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 215-242Google Scholar). GC of the alditol acetates was performed on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatography model 5890 fitted with a SP 2380 column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter) at an initial temperature of 50 °C for 1 min, increasing to 170 °C by 30 °C/min followed by an increase to 270 °C by 5 °C/min. Methanolysis of LAM samples followed by trimethylsilylation afforded fatty acid methyl ester for quantitation by GC/MS (heptadecanoic acid, C17:0, was used as an internal standard). GC/MS of the fatty acid methyl esters was carried out on a ThermoQuest Trace gas chromatograph 2000 (ThermoQuest, Austin, TX) connected to a GCQ/Polaris MS mass detector (ThermoQuest). The derivatives were dissolved in hexanes prior to injection on a DB-5 column (10 m × 0.18 mm internal diameter, 0.18-μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) at an initial temperature of 60 °C for 1 min, increasing to 130 °C at 30 °C/min and finally to 280 °C at 5 °C/min. Succinates were quantitated by GC/MS of the octyl succinates using 50-100 μg of LAM after octanolysis with 3 n 1-octanol (99%, 100 μl) at 120 °C for 30 min. The derivatives were dissolved in hexanes prior to injection on a DB-5 column at an initial temperature of 60 °C held for 1 min. The temperature was increased to 330 °C at the rate of 30 °C/min. NMR Spectroscopy of LAMs and the LAM Core—One-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR was performed on a Varian Inova AM-400 MHz, and two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. Spectra were acquired after several lyophilizations in D2O of 6-7 mg/0.6 ml in 100% D2O. The HSQC data were acquired with a 7-kHz window for proton in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1. The total recycle time was 1.65 s between transients. Adiabatic decoupling was applied to carbon during proton acquisition. Pulsed field gradients were used throughout for artifact suppression but were not used for coherence selection. The data set consisted of 1000 complex points in t2 by 256 complex points in t1 using States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation). Forward linear prediction was used for resolution enhancement to expand t1 to 512 complex points. A cosine-squared weighting function and zero filling were applied to both t1 and t2 prior to the Fourier transform. The final resolution was 3.5 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/point in F1. Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Samples were perdeuteroacetylated with pyridine:d6-acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) at 80 °C for 2 h, after which the reagent was removed under a stream of nitrogen. ESI-MS analyses were performed on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, United Kingdom) fitted with an ESI source assembly and operated at 4 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were dissolved in methanol, and 10-μl aliquots were injected through a Rheodyne loop into the mobile phase (methanol/water/acetic acid, 50:50:1, v/v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the ESI source by a syringe pump. CD1-restricted T Cell Assays—CD1b-restricted T cell lines derived from a skin biopsy of a cutaneous lesion of a leprosy patient were co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells preincubated with RvLAM, LepLAM, and CSU20 LAM as described previously (4Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L.

We demonstrate that NF-κB p50 was able to bind to the nucleosome with an apparent association constant close to that for free DNA. In agreement with this, the affinity of NF-κB p50 binding does not depend on the localization of its recognition sequence relative to the nucleosome dyad axis. In addition, the binding of NF-κB p50 does not induce eviction of histones and does not perturb the overall structure of the nucleosome. The NF-κB p50-nucleosome complex exhibits, however, local structural alterations within the NF-κB p50 recognition site. Importantly, these alterations were very similar to those found in the NF-κB p50-DNA complex. Our data suggest that NF-κB p50 can accommodate the distorted, bent DNA within the nucleosome.

The Rel/NF-κB protein family regulates several vital processes in mammalian cells, including inflammation and immune responses, formation of dorsal-ventral polarity, cell adhesion, cancer, and apoptosis (1Baeuerle P.A.

When bound to DNA the Rel/NF-κB proteins are found either as homo- or heterodimers. The crystal structures of NF-κB p50 and NF-κB p52 homodimers bound to DNA have been solved previously (5Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B.

A detailed picture of the structure and dynamics of these complexes in solution is, however, still missing.The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is formed upon the wrapping of two superhelical turns of DNA around an octamer of core histones (two of each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The structures of both the histone octamer and the nucleosome were solved by x-ray crystallography (8Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions the nucleosomal arrays fold into higher order structures. The chromatin higher order structures and the nucleosome internal architecture both might interfere with the binding of the transcription factors to their recognition DNA sequence. Two main strategies used by the cell to allow transcription factors to overcome the nucleosome-imposed structural impediments have been the focus of several studies. The first strategy uses ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activities. Several remodeling complexes have been isolated and studied (11Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L.

Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and all of these complexes are able to assist histone octamer sliding in an ATP-dependent manner and thus to facilitate access of nucleosomal DNA to transcription factors (for recent reviews, see Refs. 16Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 17Langst G. Becker P.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2561-2568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the second strategy, a transient unraveling of a portion of the nucleosomal DNA is used as a key event in increasing the accessibility of the transcription factor recognition site (18Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 19Anderson J.D. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Miller J.A. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this case a reduction in the association constant of the transcription factors in the order of 102–105 is expected, depending on the localization of the binding site relative to the nucleosome dyad (18Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).In addition to these two strategies, the cell may also use specially designed transcription factors that are able to overcome the nucleosome barrier and to bind to nucleosomal DNA (21Beato M. Eisfeld K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, several transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors, can bind efficiently to nucleosomal DNA (21Beato M. Eisfeld K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Angelov D. Charra M. Seve M. Cote J. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. J. Mol.

The mechanism of binding of these transcription factors as well as the nature of the perturbations of the nucleosome structure induced by their binding is, however, largely unknown.Here we analyzed the binding of NF-κB p50 to its recognition sequence in positioned nucleosomes. It is shown that at equilibrium, a dimer of NF-κB p50 is found bound to nucleosomal DNA as efficiently as to naked DNA templates. In addition, the overall structure of the nucleosome within NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes was preserved. The local alterations in the NF-κB p50 recognition site in the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes were very similar to those found in the NF-κB p50-naked DNA structures. Therefore, the presence of the core histones does not significantly interfere with the interaction of NF-κB p50 with nucleosomal DNA. We hypothesized that this specific property of NF-κB p50 is required for fulfilling its functions as a key factor for the different stress responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—37-Mer oligonucleotides 5′-ACGCACTCGAGTTGGGGATTCCCCAGTCTAGAGAGTG and 5′-CACTCTCTAGACTGGGGAATCCCCAACTCGAGTACGT were purchased from Genosys (UK) and gel-purified. Typically 10 pmol from either the top or the bottom strand were 5′-end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. The specific activity of the labeled probe was 2–3 × 106 cpm/pmol. After annealing with the complementary strand, DNA was treated by Fpg DNA N-glycosylase (a kind gift from Serge Boiteux, Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique-Fontenay aux Roses) to remove preexisting oxidative guanine lesions, gel-repurified, and reannealed (31Angelov D. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Chromatin Protocols.in: Becker P. Methods in Molecular Biology. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 481-495Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, 100% of duplexes were obtained.DNA Fragments—Plasmid pXP10 was digested with EcoRI and RsaI, and the 152-bp fragment containing the Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S gene was isolated by standard procedures (44Lee K.-M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce the recognition sequence of NF-κB p50 (ggggattcccc) at positions–16 to –26 (NF1), –41 to –51 (NF2), and –53 to –63 (NF3). The 5′-or3′-ends at the EcoRI site of the 152-bp fragment were 32P-labeled by using either polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or klenow fragment and [α-32P]ATP. The typical specific activity was 2–3 × 107 cpm/μg.Nucleosome Reconstitution—Recombinant Xenopus laevis full-length histone proteins were used for nucleosome reconstitution (45Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleosome reconstitution was carried out as described previously (46Scrittori L. Hans F. Angelov D. Charra M. Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30002-30010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, a stoichiometric solution of the four histones in 10 mm HCl was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against histone-folding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 m NaCl). The next morning, histones were mixed at a 0.8/1 w/w ratio with 60 ng of the 152-bp labeled DNA probes and 550 ng of “bulk” nucleosomal DNA (prepared from native hen erythrocyte nucleosomes) in a final volume of 150 μl of 1× histone-folding buffer containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reconstitution was performed by dialysis against solutions containing decreasing concentrations of NaCl. Finally, the reconstituted particles were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The protocol of Adams and Workman (47Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce and purify recombinant human NF-κB p50. The NF-κB p50-DNA and NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes were formed according to Angelov et al. (22Angelov D. Charra M. Seve M. Cote J. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Hydroxyl Radical and DNase I Footprinting—The binding reactions were carried out in 10 μl of solution of 20 mm Hepes, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5. Carrier nucleosomes were added to the naked NF1 and NF3 DNA samples to concentrations equal to those in the labeled nucleosome samples. 5–10 fmol of either labeled nucleosomes or free DNA were mixed with the indicated amounts of NF-κB. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C the samples were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EC-M, electron cryomicroscopy; 8-oxoGua, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine. The EMSA was done in a 4% acrylamide gel at room temperature in 0.5× or 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer as described previously (46Scrittori L. Hans F. Angelov D. Charra M. Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30002-30010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The gels were then dried and exposed overnight on a PhosphorImager screen. For the analysis of the stoichiometry of NF-κB p50-nucleosome interaction, the gel was incubated in 1× SDS-PAGE running buffer, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using the NF-κB p50 antibody sc-1190 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an Alexa anti-goat secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described by Angelov et al. (22Angelov D. Charra M. Seve M. Cote J. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Steger D.J. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2463-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Angelov D. Molla A.

The hydroxyl radical footprinting was carried out according to the protocol of Hayes and Lee (48Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).UV Laser Footprinting—The NF-κB p50-DNA complexes were formed (22Angelov D. Charra M. Seve M. Cote J. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and both the resulting bound biomolecules and the naked oligonucleotide were exposed to either a single high intensity UV pulse (Epulse = Etotal = 0.1 J/cm2) or multiple low intensity UV pulses (Epulse = 0.01 J/cm2; Etotal = 0.2 J/cm2). The DNA was then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, dissolved in an appropriate buffer, and treated with piperidine or digested with either Fpg protein or T4 endonuclease V (31Angelov D. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S. Chromatin Protocols.in: Becker P. Methods in Molecular Biology. 119. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 481-495Google Scholar, 34Spassky A. Angelov D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Following lyophilization, DNA was resuspended in formamide loading buffer, heated briefly at 90 °C, and run on either 15 or 8% sequencing gel for the separation of the digested products of the 37- or 152-bp DNA fragments, respectively. The gels were dried, exposed overnight on a PhosphorImager screen, and processed by using ImageQuant 4.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). The quantum efficiency of cleavage (relative cleavage yield/number of photons absorbed/base, assuming linear absorption approximation) was determined as described previously (34Spassky A. Angelov D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6571-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Electron Cryomicroscopy—The electron cryomicroscopy (EC-M) analysis was carried out on NF-κB p50-NF1 nucleosome complexes. NF1 nucleosomes were reconstituted and brought to about 50 μg/ml. Increasing amounts of NF-κB p50 were added to a fixed amount of NF1 nucleosomes, and the complexes thus formed were analyzed by EMSA. The conditions that allowed the assembly of 50% of NF-κB p50-NF1 nucleosome complexes were determined and used for EC-M. A 3-μl drop of the sample solution prepared as described above was applied on an electron microscopy grid covered with perforated supporting film; the excess of solution was removed with blotting paper (Whatman 40), and the grid was projected by a gravity-driven plunger into liquid ethane (∼110 K). Without rewarming, the grid was mounted in a cryoholder (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) and transferred into a Philips CM200 microscope. Low dose images were recorded on Kodak SO163 film at 80 kV acceleration voltage at ×66,000 direct magnification with an underfocus of 1.5 μm. The images were scanned using a Charged Coupled Diodes camera with a resolution of 8.8 μm/pixel, low pass-filtered (Gaussian mask with variable radius), and optimized in brightness and contrast.RESULTSNF-κB Is Able to Bind to Its Recognition Sequence Inserted within a Positioned Nucleosome—To determine whether NF-κB p50 was able to interact with positioned nucleosomes, three different constructs, each containing a single NF-κB p50 binding site inserted at different locations within a 152-bp fragment comprising the 5 S RNA gene of X. borealis, were made. Because the X. borealis 5 S RNA gene contains a strong positioning signal, this allowed the reconstitution of precisely positioned nucleosomes (NF1, NF2, and NF3) containing the NF-κB p50 target sequence located at different distances from the nucleosome dyad (Fig. 1A). Recombinant highly purified X. laevis histones were used for reconstitution of nucleosomes. EMSA of the reconstituted particles using low ionic strength conditions showed that complete reconstitution was achieved because no or very little free DNA was observed on the gel (Fig. 1B) and showed that all particles migrated with the same mobility, suggesting that there were no detectable alterations of the positioning of the histone octamer on the 5 S DNA fragment.Proteins present in the gel-purified nucleosome particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). The expected protein composition for a nucleosome particle and the integrity of histones were preserved in the reconstituted nucleosomes. It should be noted that recombinant histones H2A and H2B show the same electrophoretic mobility and cannot be well separated on the SDS gel (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the reconstituted nucleosomes on these altered 5 S DNA sequences, a DNase I footprinting was performed on each reconstituted nucleosome (Fig. 1D). A clear footprint pattern in all three reconstituted nucleosomes, NF1, NF2, and NF3, identical to the pattern obtained on the 5 S nucleosomal template was observed, indicating that the introduction of the NF-κB binding site in the 5 S DNA sequence does not perturb nucleosome formation and positioning.To test whether NF-κB p50 was able to interact with these nucleosomes, NF1, NF2, and NF3, we determined the apparent dissociation constant of NF-κB p50 for nucleosomes and compared it with that of free DNA (Fig. 2A). Briefly, DNA of NF1, NF2, and NF3 was radioactively end-labeled and reconstituted into nucleosomes. Increasing amounts of NF-κB p50 were incubated with identical amounts of NF1, NF2, or NF3 nucleosomes or with naked NF1 or NF2 DNA. The respective complexes were allowed to form, and they were then separated on native polyacrylamide gels. The portions of NF-κB p50 unbound nucleosomes or NF-κB p50 unbound free DNA at a given NF-κB p50 concentration were calculated from the experimental data, and the dependences of unbound template versus added NF-κB p50 were built (Fig. 2A). The apparent dissociation constants, corresponding to the values of the NF-κB p50 concentrations at 50% unbound template, were thus determined. Remarkably, the apparent dissociation constants for the free NF1 and NF2 DNA and the NF1, NF2, and NF3 nucleosomes were very close: 5 nmversus 10 and 20 nm, respectively. Therefore, the presence of the nucleosomal histones interferes only slightly with the binding of NF-κB p50 to its recognition sequence inserted within a nucleosomal DNA. To further characterize the interaction of NF-κB p50 with the nucleosomal templates, we performed DNase I footprinting (Fig. 2B). Indeed, a clear footprint pattern corresponding to the interaction of NF-κB p50 with its target site in all three reconstituted nucleosomes was observed (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5 with lanes 2, 4, and 6 for the top strand and lanes 1′, 3′, and 5′ with lanes 2′, 4′, and 6′ for the bottom strand). An increased sensitivity of DNA for DNase I digestion is observed close to the binding sites of NF-κB p50 (positions –32 to –38), indicating that the binding of NF-κB p50 induces local modification of DNA accessibility. Hence, NF-κB p50 is able to bind to its cognate sequence inserted within nucleosomal DNA independently of its location relative to the dyad axis of the nucleosome. Interestingly, the DNase I-characteristic 10-bp digestion pattern of the nucleosomal structure is still clearly visible when NF-κB p50 is bound, indicating that the overall nucleosomal structure is conserved. This conclusion is further supported by the EC-M data (Fig. 3).Fig. 2NF-κB-p50 exhibits very similar binding affinity for both free DNA and nucleosomes.A, typical EMSA of NF-κB p50-DNA and NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes. An increasing amount of NF-κB p50 was allowed to bind to NF1, NF2, or NF3 nucleosomes as well as to the respective naked NF1 and NF2 DNA fragments. The nucleoprotein complexes were then separated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. The positions of the naked DNA, the nucleosomes, and the NF-κB p50-DNA and NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes are indicated. For the determination of the NF-κB apparent dissociation constants Kd for DNA and for nucleosomes, the percentage of NF-κB p50 unbound nucleosomes or NF-κB p50 unbound free DNA at a given NF-κB p50 concentration was calculated from EMSA data. Data points, averaged over at least three independent experiments, were fitted by non-linear least squares to the following binding equation: fraction unbound = 1/(1 + [NF-κB p50]/Kd). The value of 50% unbound NF-κB p50 to the nucleosome corresponds to the apparent constant of dissociation. Note that the apparent dissociation constant of NF-κB p50 for free NF1 or NF2 DNA is only 2- and 4-fold less than for the NF2 nucleosome and the NF1 and NF3 nucleosomes, respectively. B, NF-κB p50 was allowed to interact with the reconstituted nucleosomes, and its binding was visualized by DNase I footprinting. The recognition sequence of NF-κB is designated by the vertical bold line. The top strand (lanes 1–6) was labeled at the 5′-end, and the bottom strand (lanes 1′–6′) was labeled at the 3′-end.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Cryoelectron micrographs of DNA-NF-κB p50 and nucleosome-NF-κB p50 complexes. A 205-bp DNA fragment containing the X. borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene with the inserted NF-κB binding site at positions –16 to –26 was used to reconstitute a nucleosome. This nucleosome contains about 30 bp of free DNA on both of its ends, allowing easier visualization. A, cryoelectron micrographs for three 205-bp DNA-NF-κB p50 complexes.

It was extremely powerful in studying both the structure of the nucleosome and the nucleosomal conformational transitions occurring upon the passage of SP6 RNA polymerase (25Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 191-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Bednar J. Studitsky V.M. Grigoryev S.A. Felsenfeld G. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We used a 208-bp DNA fragment containing the 5 S RNA gene of X. borealis with the inserted NF-κB p50 recognition sequence at positions –16 to –26 to reconstitute a nucleosome with the NF-κB p50 recognition sequence located in the vicinity of the dyad. About 30 bp of free DNA are present on each end of this nucleosome, which allows easier visualization of nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3). NF-κB p50 was allowed to interact with both free DNA and the reconstituted nucleosome. The assembled complexes were visualized by EC-M (Fig. 3). The electron cryomicrographs of the NF-κB p50-DNA complexes (Fig. 3A) clearly show the presence of a dense structure located roughly in the middle of the DNA molecule where the NF-κB p50 recognition sequence was inserted. Such structures are not observed in the naked DNA fragment alone (Fig. 3B). We attributed this structure to the presence of bound NF-κB p50. This dense structure was also observed in the micrographs of the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes (Fig. 3, d–f and d′–f′), and it was absent in those of the nucleosome alone (Fig. 3, a–c and a′–c′). The dense structure was visualized in the middle of the nucleosome, as expected for a bona fide NF-κB p50-nucleosome complex. Therefore, EC-M distinctly detected NF-κB p50 bound to its recognition sequence within a positioned 5 S nucleosome. Interestingly, the overall shape of the nucleosomal DNA of the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes was essentially the same as that of the nucleosome alone (Fig. 3, compare a–c with d–f) suggesting that the binding of NF-κB p50 does not perturb the overall structure of the nucleosome or that the structural changes are minor and below the resolving power of EC-M imaging.The NF-κB-Nucleosome Complex Exhibits Both Histone Content and a Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting Pattern Identical to Those of the Nucleosome Alone—To further characterize the organization of DNA of the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complex we used a hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis. Because of its small size and lack of sequence selectivity, this probe allows a detailed resolution of the DNA conformation within the nucleosome (27Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8434-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A NF1 nucleosome was incubated with NF-κB p50; then the DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting was performed with (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5) and without (lane 3) gel purification of the complex. The DNase I footprinting shows that NF-κB p50 binds to its cognate sequence under the conditions used (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–2). The hydroxyl radical footprinting pattern of the NF-κB p50 bound samples is the same as that of the nucleosome alone (Fig. 4A, compare lane 5 with lane 4). Indeed, in all cases a clear enhancement of the hydroxyl radical cleavage at every 10 bp is observed, a pattern typical for the nucleosome (27Hayes J.J. Bashkin J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8434-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the hydroxyl radical pattern of the region, which is covered by the protein, is not perturbed. Therefore, the binding of NF-κB is unlikely to affect the regular exposure of the nucleosomal DNA strands toward the solution. This conclusion is supported by the DNase I footprinting data of the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes where the sequences flanking the NF-κB p50 binding site exhibit a 10-bp cleavage repeat typical for the nucleosomes (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–2).Fig. 4The binding of NF-κB p50 does not affect either the histone composition of the nucleosome or the exposure of nucleosomal DNA toward the solution.A, DNase I (lanes 1–2) and hydroxyl radical (OH·) (lanes 3–5) footprinting of NF1 nucleosome-NF-κB p50 complexes. The bottom DNA strand was labeled at its 3′-end. The vertical line and the arrow show the binding site of NF-κB p50 and the cleavage position at –6 nucleotides, respectively. Lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5 are from complexes purified from native gels, whereas in lane 3, nucleosomes subjected to hydroxyl radical footprinting were not gel-purified. Note that the binding of NF-κB p50 to the nucleosome does not perturb the hydroxyl radical footprinting. B, preparative gel shift used for analysis of the histone composition of the NF-κB p50-nucleosome complexes. NF1 nucleosomes (1, the first two lanes) and NF1 nucleosome-NF-κB p50 complexes (2, the second two lanes) were separated on a preparative native 4% polyacrylamide gel; the bands containing the respective nucleoproteins were eluted, and the protein composition was analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W1992638924,"Synapsins, a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that play an important role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, were recently demonstrated to interact with the synaptic vesicle-associated small G protein Rab3A within nerve terminals (Giovedì, S., Vaccaro, P., Valtorta, F., Darchen, F., Greengard, P., Cesareni, G., and Benfenati, F. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 43760–43768). We have analyzed the functional consequences of this interaction on the biological activities of both proteins and on their subcellular distribution within nerve terminals. The presence of synapsin I stimulated GTP binding and GTPase activity of both purified and endogenous synaptic vesicle-associated Rab3A. Conversely, Rab3A inhibited synapsin I binding to F-actin, as well as synapsin-induced actin bundling and vesicle clustering. Moreover, the amount of Rab3A associated with synaptic vesicles was decreased in synapsin knockout mice, and the presence of synapsin I prevented RabGDI-induced Rab3A dissociation from synaptic vesicles. The results indicate that an interaction between synapsin I and Rab3A exists on synaptic vesicles that modulates the functional properties of both proteins. Given the well recognized importance of both synapsins and Rab3A in synaptic vesicles exocytosis, this interaction is likely to play a major role in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins, a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that play an important role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, were recently demonstrated to interact with the synaptic vesicle-associated small G protein Rab3A within nerve terminals (Giovedì, S., Vaccaro, P., Valtorta, F., Darchen, F., Greengard, P., Cesareni, G., and Benfenati, F.

Conversely, Rab3A inhibited synapsin I binding to F-actin, as well as synapsin-induced actin bundling and vesicle clustering. Moreover, the amount of Rab3A associated with synaptic vesicles was decreased in synapsin knockout mice, and the presence of synapsin I prevented RabGDI-induced Rab3A dissociation from synaptic vesicles. The results indicate that an interaction between synapsin I and Rab3A exists on synaptic vesicles that modulates the functional properties of both proteins. Given the well recognized importance of both synapsins and Rab3A in synaptic vesicles exocytosis, this interaction is likely to play a major role in the modulation of neurotransmitter release. Rab proteins, belonging to the Ras superfamily of small G proteins, are implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking between subcellular compartments (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Rab3A, the most abundant and widely distributed isoform in brain, cycles between a GTP-bound form that associates with the SV membrane and a GDP-bound form that becomes soluble upon formation of a complex with the GDP dissociation inhibitor (RabGDI) (for review see Refs. 2Takai Y.

The cycling of Rab proteins is strictly linked to the exo-endocytotic cycle of SV. Stimulation of neurotransmitter release promotes GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of Rab3A from the SV membrane (6Fischer von Mollard G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R.

Rab3 has been proposed to regulate vectorially SV trafficking at various stages of the exo-endocytotic cycle through interactions with specific effector proteins. Rab3 may participate in the docking of SV to appropriate sites of the presynaptic membrane by interacting with presynaptic effectors localized at active zones, such as Rim (11Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schimtz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), as well as in the following priming and fusion events by interacting with a prefusion complex and preventing fusion of primed SV with the presynaptic membrane (for review see Refs. 4Geppert M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the hypothesized roles of Rab3A has been confirmed by studies on Rab3A knockout mice (13Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), its role in docking has been questioned, as Rim knockout mice do not exhibit changes in the number of docked SV (14Koushika S.P. Richmon J.E. Hadwiger G. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nonet M.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Under conditions of high frequency stimulation, Rab3A knockout mice exhibit a decrease in the recruitment of SV at the presynaptic membrane and a delayed recovery of release after stimulation (15Leenders A.G. Lopes da Silva F.H. Ghijsen W.E. Verhage M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3095-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas train and paired-pulse facilitations were increased after injection of constitutively active Rab3A into Aplysia neurons (10Dousseau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3147-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects, together with the described interaction between the Rab3 effector Rabphilin-3 and the actin bundling protein α-actinin (16Kato M. Sasaki T. Ohya T. Nakanishi H. Nishioka H. Imamura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31775-31778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), implicate Rab3 in the activity-dependent trafficking of SV upstream of SV fusion, possibly by affecting the dynamics of SV binding to the actin cytoskeleton. After endocytosis of the fused SV, soluble Rab3A dissociates from RabGDI, reassociates with the SV membrane, and undergoes a GDP/GTP exchange that involves the intervention of a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. It has been demonstrated recently that GTP/GDP exchange is not a prerequisite for Rab3A binding to the SV membrane and that GDP-bound Rab3A binds to a protein component of SV that competes with soluble RabGDI for Rab3A delivery (17Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Chou J.H. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9433-9440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A GDI dissociation factor has been identified recently for Rab5 and Rab9 (19Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Sivars U. Aivazian D. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and a similar factor could be involved in the translocation of GDP-Rab to SV. As Rab3 represents a clock for exocytosis, the identification of Rab3 partners that modulate its cycle may be important for the understanding of the fine mechanisms of neurotransmitter release. By using phage display library analysis to uncover high affinity synapsin-binding peptides, we have recently found that Rab3A is one of the synapsin interactors in intact nerve terminals (62Giovedì S. Vaccaro P. Valtorta F. Darchen F. Greengard P. Cesareni G. Benfenati F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43760-43768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Synapsins, a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins, have been demonstrated to regulate the supply of SV available for exocytosis by binding to both SV and actin cytoskeleton in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (for review see Refs. 21Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar and 22Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Although these observations strongly support a pre-docking role of the synapsins in the assembly and maintenance of a large reserve pool of SV and in the regulation of short term synaptic plasticity, recent results indicate that the synapsins are also involved in some later step of exocytosis. Thus, the kinetics of release was slowed in the squid giant terminal after injection of a conserved synapsin COOH-terminal peptide (23Hilfiker S. Schweizer F.E. Kao H.T. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. Augustine G.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), as well as in Aplysia ganglion neuron terminals after neutralization of endogenous synapsin by antibody injection (24Humeau Y. Dousseau F. Vitiello F. Greengard P. Benfenati F. Poulain B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As synapsins act as regulators of SV trafficking at both pre- and post-docking stages of the SV cycle, we studied whether the synapsin-Rab3 interaction plays some role in the multiple stages of exocytosis. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between synapsin and Rab3A regulates the activities of both proteins. Thus, synapsin stimulated the Rab3A cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase activity, and Rab3A recruitment to the SV membrane, and conversely, Rab3A inhibited the actin binding and SV clustering activity of synapsin. [α-32P]GTP, [γ-32P]GTP, γ-35S-GTP, [3H]GDP, and glutathione-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences.

The anti-synapsin and anti-Rab3A polyclonal antibodies were raised in our laboratories. The other antibodies were obtained from available commercial sources. Rat RabGDI was expressed as His6-tagged protein in BL21(DE3) pLysS strain and purified to homogeneity on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified bovine synapsin I was stoichiometrically phosphorylated in vitro by using purified protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII), mitogen-associated protein kinase Erk 1/2 (MAPK), or cyclin-dependent protein kinase-1 (cdk-1) as described previously (25Schiebler W.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and all other chemicals were from Sigma. SV were purified to homogeneity from rat forebrain through the step of controlled pore glass chromatography (27Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Mouse forebrain homogenate was subfractionated through the step of sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described (27Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) yielding purified SV and synaptic membrane fractions (SG2 and SG4 fractions, respectively). Binding of γ-35S-GTP to Rab3A—The binding of γ-35S-GTP to Rab3A was evaluated as described by Kikuchi et al. (28Kikuchi A. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Recombinant Rab3A was loaded with GDP (1 μm) by incubation for 20 min at 30 °C in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 25 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and the nucleotide-protein complex was stabilized by chilling the samples on ice and adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm. GDP-loaded Rab3A (2 pmol/sample; final volume 50 μl) was then incubated with increasing concentrations (30–1000 nm) of γ-35S-GTP for 15 min at 30 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) in the absence or presence of synapsin I (1 μm). Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding in the presence of an excess unlabeled GTP (300 μm). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold stopping solution (25 mm Tris-Cl, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) followed by rapid filtration on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed five times with ice-cold stopping solution, and the retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For the analysis of GTP binding to SV, synapsin-depleted SV (SSV) were first loaded with GDP (500 μm) as described above, and the excess GDP was removed by high speed centrifugation (400,000 × g for 20 min) after addition of 20 mm MgCl2 (17Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GDP-loaded SV (10 μg of protein/sample) were assayed for γ-35S-GTP binding as described above, followed by filtration and scintillation counting. Dissociation of [3H]GDP from Rab3A—Recombinant Rab3A or SSV were loaded with [3H]GDP (1 μm) by incubation at 30 °C for 20 min in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4, followed by cooling the samples on ice and adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm. The dissociation of [3H]GDP from recombinant Rab3A (2 pmol/sample) or SSV (10 μg protein/sample) was initiated at time t = 0 by the addition of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled GTP in a mixture containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, in the absence or presence of synapsin I (1 μm). The reaction was stopped by filtration on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters as described above at various times (15 min to 3 h) after the addition of GTP (28Kikuchi A. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rab3A GTPase Activity—Assays for Rab3A GTPase activity were performed as described previously (28Kikuchi A. Nakanishi H.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2689-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. For the formation of the [α-32P]GTP-Rab3A complex, recombinant Rab3A (25 pmol/sample) or purified SV (5 μg of protein/sample) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in loading buffer containing 50 nm [α-32P]GTP (1 μCi/sample). The mixture was placed on ice, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 20 mm to stabilize the nucleotide-protein complex. Excess unbound [α-32P]GTP was removed by passage through a gel filtration column Bio-Spin 6, previously equilibrated in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). For the measurement of GTPase activity, GTP-loaded samples were incubated at 30 °C in reaction buffer in the absence or presence of purified synapsin I (25 pmol/sample). Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were taken at various time intervals and stopped by the addition of 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm GDP (final concentration) followed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. The ratio of GTP and GDP bound to Rab3A was quantified by TLC as described previously (30Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were applied to PEI-cellulose TLC sheets, which were then immersed in methanol for 5 min, dried at room temperature, and developed with 4 m formic acid (brought to pH 3.5 with NH4OH). After completion of the run (about 1 h), chromatograms were immersed in methanol for 20 min, dried, and exposed at –80 °C. Based on nucleotide staining, the radioactive spots corresponding to [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GDP were scraped from the chromatogram and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The hydrolysis of Rab3A-bound GTP was expressed as percent increase in [α-32P]GDP formation with respect to the amount of [α-32P]GDP present at time 0. Rab3A-GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) Activity—Recombinant Rab3A (10 pmol/sample), loaded with [γ-32P]GTP as described above, was incubated with recombinant Rab3-GAP for 6 min at 25 °C in the absence or presence of either Rabphilin-3 or synapsin I in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. At the end of the incubation, samples were diluted with ice-cold buffer and filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes, and the retained radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (31Clabecq A.

Actin Binding and Bundling Assays—G-actin (5 μm) purified as described previously (32Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Chieregatti E. Greengard P. Neuron. 1992; 8: 377-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in G-buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm NaN3, 2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) was polymerized for 1 h at room temperature by the addition of 90 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with synapsin I (0.5 μm), Rab3A (0.5–5 μm), or synapsin I plus Rab3A in the presence of either GTPγSor GDP. Identical samples were centrifuged either at low speed (10,000 × g for 10 min) for recovery of actin bundles or subjected to high speed centrifugation in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor (400,000 × g for 30 min) for recovery of total F-actin (33Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1987; 326: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The actin pellets and supernatant fractions were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The amounts of actin in the various fractions were detected by Coomassie Blue staining, whereas the amounts of synapsin I bound to actin or free in the supernatant were determined by either protein staining of the gels or immunoblotting. Quantitative analysis of Coomassie-stained gels or immunoblots was performed either by laser scanning densitometry (Ultroscan XL, Amersham Biosciences) by interpolation of the density values into a suitable standard curve. Vesicle Aggregation Assays—Phospholipid vesicles mimicking the phospholipid composition of SV (PC:PE:PS:PI:cholesterol = 40:32:12:5: 10) or PC vesicles (PC:cholesterol = 90:10) were made by sonication as described previously (35Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rossi M.C. Onofri F. Sihra T. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1845-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled vesicles had the same lipid composition with the addition of the appropriate amounts (2% of the total lipid, w/w) of NBD-PE or LRh-PE either alone (single-labeled liposomes) or in combination (double-labeled liposomes). Changes in synapsin-induced vesicle aggregation in the presence of either Rab3A-GDP or Rab3A-GTP were followed by analyzing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the energy donor NBD-PE and the acceptor LRh-PE (35Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rossi M.C. Onofri F. Sihra T. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1845-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Synapsin I (100 nm)-induced aggregation in the presence or absence of GDP- or GTP-bound Rab3A (1 μm) was followed by monitoring FRET at 22 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 spectrofluorometer according to two distinct assays. In the first case (aggregation/fusion assay), the fluorescence donor and acceptor were incorporated into separate vesicle populations. Two populations of vesicles (100 μg of phospholipid for each vesicle population, containing 2% labeled phospholipid) were mixed, and FRET was measured by exciting the donor at 470 nm and following either the decrease in NBD emission at 520 nm (NBD quenching) or the increase in LRh emission at 590 nm (excitation and emission slits of 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively). In the second assay (fusion assay), one population of vesicles containing both fluorophores in equimolar amounts (50 μg of phospholipid, 2% labeled phospholipids) was mixed with unlabeled vesicles (150 μg of phospholipid). Under these conditions, pure aggregation of vesicles not accompanied by fusion is silent per se but can by evaluated as an enhancement in the rate and extent of vesicle fusion induced by a subsequent addition of 3 mm Ca2+. Membrane fusion, leading to intermixing of labeled and unlabeled membrane components, results in a decrease in the surface density of donor and acceptor fluorophores and thereby in FRET that can be followed as an increase in NBD emission at 520 nm (NBD dequenching) or a decrease in LRh emission at 590 nm. Rab3A-Synapsin I Pull-down Assays—The binding of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rab3A to dephosphorylated synapsin I or to synapsin I that had been stoichiometrically phosphorylated by either PKA, CaMKII, MAPK, or cdk-1 was assessed by co-precipitation experiments as follows. GST or GST-Rab3A loaded with GTPγS was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (0.04 nmol of fusion protein per μl of settled beads) in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2. After extensive washing, protein-coupled beads (15 μl) were incubated with synapsin I (0.1–0.5 μm) in 500 μl of binding buffer for 3–5 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, extensively washed with binding buffer and detergent-free binding buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 2 min. Binding was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by quantitative immunoblotting. Purified SV containing endogenous synapsins (untreated SV (USV)) were quantitatively depleted of synapsin I by exposure to mild salt treatment (synapsin-depleted SV (SSV)) and reassociated in vitro with purified synapsin I (rebound SV (RSV)) as described previously (27Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Purified SV (USV, SSV, or RSV, 20 μg protein/sample) were analyzed for the translocation of endogenous Rab3A and/or synapsin I between the SV-bound and the soluble form. SV were loaded with GDP or GTPγS (500 μm) in loading buffer for 15 min at 37 °C, chilled on ice, and supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2 to stabilize the nucleotide-protein complex. Samples were then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations of either synapsin I (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μm), purified RabGDI (0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 μm), or both. After the incubation, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 450,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Effects of Synapsin I on the Biochemical Properties of Rab3A—The rate of the Rab3 cycle within the nerve terminal is regulated by the key events of GDP/GTP exchange, which follows the association of Rab3 with SV, and GTP hydrolysis that promotes Rab3 dissociation from SV during priming and fusion. We employed biochemical assays to determine whether the association between synapsin I and Rab3 modulates Rab3 GTPase activity or nucleotide binding. The intrinsic Rab3 GTPase activity was assayed by measuring the decrease in the radioactivity associated with [α-32P]GTP-loaded Rab3A and the corresponding increase in [α-32P]GDP formation as a function of time. Synapsin I significantly stimulated the GTPase activity of both recombinant Rab3A (Fig. 1A) and endogenous Rab3 associated with highly purified SV (Fig. 1C). Synapsin I increased the GTPase activity of purified Rab3A in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with a ≅5-fold increase in the initial rate of GTP hydrolysis at a 1:1 synapsin:Rab3A molar ratio (Fig. 1B). The GTPase activity of SV depleted of endogenous synapsin (SSV) was decreased by ∼50% in comparison to untreated SV (USV), whereas the in vitro reassociation of purified synapsin I with synapsin depleted SV (RSV) restored GTP hydrolysis to the levels observed in untreated SV (Fig. 1C). Rabphilin, another SV Rab3 interactor stimulating Rab3 GTPase activity, is known to markedly inhibit in a dose-dependent fashion GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of Rab3 by binding to the Rab3 effector domain. However, at variance with Rabphilin-3, synapsin I did not inhibit the effect of GAP on Rab3 GTPase activity (Fig. 1D). Equimolar concentrations of synapsin I significantly enhanced the binding of γ-35S-GTP to both purified and SV-associated GDP-Rab3 by inducing a significant, 3-fold increase in the Bmax of γ-35S-GTP (Fig. 2, A and B). As the assay protocol involved nucleotide stripping by EDTA, we wondered whether the observed effects were simply attributable to Rab stabilization by a chaperone-like activity of synapsin I. To test this possibility, we repeated the assays in the presence of BSA and found that the effect of synapsin I was fully preserved also under these conditions (Fig. 2C), indicating that it was not merely due a nonspecific chaperone-like effect. At variance with GTP binding, the dissociation of [3H]GDP from either recombinant Rab3A (Fig. 2D) or synapsin-depleted SV (Fig. 2E) triggered by an excess of GTP was not affected by the presence of synapsin I. Modulation of the Synapsin-Rab3A Interaction by Synapsin Phosphorylation—Synapsin I is a target of multiple protein kinases, and site-specific phosphorylation of synapsin I is known to affect its interactions with SV and the actin cytoskeleton and its compartmentalization within nerve terminals (22Hilfiker S.

Thus, we evaluated whether phosphorylation of synapsin by either PKA (site 1), CaMKII (sites 2 and 3), MAPK (sites 4–6), or cdk-1 (site 6) was able to affect its interaction with Rab3A and the subsequent stimulation of Rab3A GTPase activity. Rab3A pull-down assays revealed that the interaction with synapsin I is poorly sensitive to its phosphorylation state, whereas phosphorylation by CaMKII was totally ineffective, phosphorylation by either PKA or MAPK/Erk induced only a mild decrease in the binding at low synapsin concentrations (Fig. 3A). Consistent with binding data, both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of synapsin I significantly stimulated Rab3A GTPase activity, although PKA- or MAPK-phosphorylated synapsin I was less powerful than dephosphorylated synapsin I (Fig. 3B).

The 1H NMR spectrum of the carbonmonoxy adduct of the mutant, the Leu-358 → Pro mutant (L358P), in the absence of Pdx showed that the ring current-shifted signals arising from d-camphor were upfield-shifted and observed as resolved signals, which are typical for the wild type enzyme in the presence of Pdx. Signals from the β-proton of the axial cysteine and the γ-methyl group of Thr-252 were also shifted upfield and down-field, respectively, in the L358P mutant as observed for Pdx-bound wild type P450cam. The close similarity in the NMR spectra suggests that the heme environment of the L358P mutant mimics that of the Pdx-bound enzyme. The functional analysis of the L358P mutant has revealed that the oxygen adduct of the L358P mutant can promote the oxygenation reaction for d-camphor with nonphysiological electron donors such as dithionite and ascorbic acid, showing that oxygenated L358P is “activated” to receive electron from the donor. Based on the structural and functional characterization of the L358P mutant, we conclude that the Pdx-induced structural changes in P450cam would facilitate the electron transfer from the electron donor, and the Pdx binding to P450cam would be a trigger for the electron transfer to oxygenated P450cam.

Cytochrome P450cam (P450cam) 1The abbreviations used are: P450cam, cytochrome P450 camphor; Pdx, putidaredoxin. from Pseudomonas putida is a heme-containing enzyme that catalyzes the regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylation of d-camphor by using molecular oxygen and 2 reducing eq from NADH (1Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 83-124Crossref Google Scholar). Electrons from NADH are sequentially transferred by a [2Fe-2S] cluster protein, putidaredoxin (Pdx), from putidaredoxin reductase to P450cam. P450cam is highly specific for the electron donor, Pdx (3Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the homologous iron-sulfur protein, adrenodoxin, which serves as the reductant for mitochondrial P450s, is unable to transfer an electron to give a product. Furthermore, the addition of nonphysiological small molecule reductants, including dithionite and monothiols to oxy-P450cam, produce only less than 5% of the theoretical maximum amounts of product, although they exhibit lower redox potentials than that of Pdx. These observations have led to the longstanding view first proposed by Lipscomb et al. (3Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Pdx is an effector molecule for the catalytic reaction in P450cam as well as an electron donor. Various spectroscopic studies on the P450cam-Pdx system have demonstrated that Pdx induces structural changes in P450cam (4Unno M. Christian J.F. Benson D.E. Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. Champion P.M. J.

The νFe-CO and νC-O stretching modes also shifted up and down, respectively, upon Pdx binding to P450cam-CO (5Makino R. Iizuka T. Sakaguchi K. Ishimura Y. Nozaki M. Yamamoto S. Ishimura Y. Coon M.J. Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Oxygenases and Oxygen Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1982: 467-477Google Scholar), supporting enhancement of the electronic donation. Recently, we applied NMR spectroscopy to the P450cam-Pdx system to characterize further the Pdx-induced conformational changes of P450cam in detail (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39809-39821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Upfield shifts of the ring current-shifted signals from the β-proton of the axial Cys and d-camphor in the P450cam-CO upon the binding of Pdx showed that the axial ligand and d-camphor move toward the heme iron by Pdx binding (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39809-39821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These structural changes in P450cam upon Pdx binding seem to be crucial for the enzymatic activity, because the enhancement of the electronic donation from the axial thiolate to the heme iron could facilitate the activation of the O–O bond and stabilize the high valent reaction intermediate of P450cam (13Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Based on the radical rebound mechanism (14Yoshizawa K. Kamachi T. Shiota Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9806-9816Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the approach of d-camphor to the heme iron could also promote hydroxylation of d-camphor. In addition, a recent report by Nagano et al. (15Nagano S. Shimada H. Tarumi A. Hishiki T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Egawa T. Suematsu M. Park S.Y. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Ishimura Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14507-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) indicated that mutations of the amino acid residue at the putative Pdx-binding site, Arg-109 or Arg-112, inhibit the conformational changes in P450cam and lower the electron transfer rate from Pdx to oxy-P450cam (second electron transfer rate) to 39–75% that of the wild type enzyme, suggesting that the Pdx-induced structural changes possibly promote the second electron transfer reaction. Furthermore, Pochapsky et al. (7Pochapsky S.S. Pochapsky T.C. Wei J.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5649-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) examined the binding effects of adrenodoxin, which does not exhibit the effector activity, to P450cam by using multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and they found that adrenodoxin could not perturb the structure of P450cam. This result clearly indicates that a nonphysiological electron donor such as adrenodoxin cannot induce the structural changes in P450cam, thereby giving no hydroxylation product. These observations allow us to speculate that the Pdx-induced structural changes would be essential for the electron transfer to oxy-P450cam. If the Pdx-induced structural changes in P450cam trigger electron transfer to oxy-P450cam, then it might be expected that the Pdx-bound form of the enzyme would accept electrons from nonphysiological electron donors to produce the hydroxylation product. Here, in order to confirm that the Pdx-induced structural changes can be the trigger for the turnover reaction, we focused on a P450cam mutant, Leu-358 → Pro mutant (L358P) (16Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Yoshioka S. Tosha T. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. J. Am.

Hori H. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem.

Similar enhancement of π-electron donation from the axial thiolate to the heme iron is also induced by the binding of Pdx to wild type P450cam (5Makino R. Iizuka T. Sakaguchi K. Ishimura Y. Nozaki M.

Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Wild type and the mutant of P450cam were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as inclusion bodies (16Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg.

Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified proteins with an RZ value (A392/A280) greater than 1.5 were used in this study. The purified samples were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm d-camphor and stocked at –70 °C. The substrate-free sample was prepared by passing substrate-bound P450cam through a G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The buffer of the eluted sample was exchanged to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl by using Ultrafree Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore). Pdx was expressed in E. coli strain RR1 and was purified by the method of Gunsalus and Wagner (20Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) with a minor modification (21Aoki M. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Wada Y. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 272: 80-88Crossref Google Scholar). The purified Pdx had a 325 to 280 nm absorbance ratio of at least 0.6. The sample was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl and 80 μl/100 ml β-mercaptomethanol and stocked at –70 °C. β-Mercaptomethanol was removed by passing through a G-25 column before the measurements to avoid the interference of the association with P450cam. NMR Measurements—1H NMR measurements were carried out with BRUKER Avance DRX500 and DRX600 spectrometers at 17 and 40 °C. Peak shifts were referenced to the residual water signal that was calibrated against tetramethylsilane. A PRESAT pulse sequence was used to minimize the water signal for the measurements of one-dimensional spectra (22Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments with 30–100 ms of the mixing time were performed by using the standard pulse sequence (23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wütrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared by the method described previously (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39809-39821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Substrate-bound P450cam was dissolved in 10% D2O containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm d-camphor, pH 7.4. Substrate-free sample was dissolved in 10% D2O containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4. The concentrations of P450cam in the NMR samples were 0.2 and 0.5–1.0 mm for the one-dimensional NMR and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy measurements, respectively. Five hundred μl of sample was transferred into the NMR tubes, which were capped with rubber septa. After flushing the samples with argon gas, samples were reduced by the addition of a small aliquot of the degassed sodium dithionite solution. CO gas was anaerobically introduced into the NMR tube to prepare the ferrous-CO form of P450cam. The formation of carbonmonoxy P450cam was confirmed by the electronic absorption spectrum. Determination of the Dissociation Constant of Pdx to P450cam— Following the previous report (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39809-39821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we determined the dissociation constant (Kd) of Pdx to P450cam. We measured one-dimensional NMR spectra for carbonmonoxy L358P in the presence of various concentrations of reduced Pdx (Pdxred) at 17 and 40 °C. The concentration of Pdxred was from 50 to 800 μm. The Kd value of Pdxred to carbonmonoxy P450cam was estimated by the shifts of the NMR signals upon the complexation with Pdxred. We confirmed that the equilibrium between Pdx-bound P450cam and Pdx-free P450cam was the “fast exchange process” on the NMR time scale at 40 °C (see “Results”). The nuclei in two states gave a single resonance at the population weighted average chemical shift of the nuclei during the titration, and Kd can be determined by the following Equation 1 (24Lian L.-Y.

[P450]tot and [Pdx]tot correspond to the total concentrations of P450cam and Pdx in the sample solution, respectively. Measurements of Autooxidation Rates—Oxy-P450cam was prepared by the method described previously (25Brewer C.B. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Brewer C.B. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Unno M. Shimada H.

Five hundred μlof ∼10 μm ferric enzyme was allowed to sit under argon atmosphere with bubbling of argon gas for about 20 min to remove oxygen in the sample solution. The ferrous enzyme was prepared by the careful addition of a minimal volume of ∼20 mm sodium dithionite solution. Formation of the ferrous enzyme was confirmed by UV/visible spectrometer. The oxygen adduct was prepared by manually mixing the ferrous solution with an equal volume of the air-saturated buffer on ice. The autooxidation reaction was monitored by following the absorption change at 418 nm, the Soret maximum for oxy-P450cam, and the measurement temperature was at 4 °C (28Sligar S.G. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P.G. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 61: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The autooxidation rate (kox) was determined by the single exponential fitting to the time course at A418. Reactions between Oxy-P450cam and Electron Donors—d-Camphor hydroxylation activity was examined by mixing oxy-P450cam and one of the electron donors, reduced Pdx, dithionite, or ascorbic acid. Oxy-P450cam was prepared as described above. Reduced Pdx was prepared by the same method used to prepare reduced P450cam. Two ml of 10 μm oxidized Pdx was allowed to sit under an argon atmosphere and was reduced by the careful addition of a minimal volume of the sodium dithionite solution. Two ml of 1 m sodium dithionite or ascorbic acid was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm d-camphor, and was equilibrated with the argon atmosphere. The d-camphor hydroxylation reaction was started by the addition of an equal volume of 10 μm reduced Pdx to 10 μm oxy-P450cam or the addition of 1 μlof1 m sodium dithionite or ascorbic acid to 500 μl of 5 μm oxy-P450cam on ice. After 20 min, the product was extracted from the reaction solution with chloroform. The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (Shimazu, GC-17A) and a column DB-1701 (J & W Scientific). Heme Environment of the Ferrous-CO Form of L358P—Up-shift and downshift of νFe-CO and νC-O, respectively, in the L358P mutant indicate that the electronic structure of L358P-CO likely corresponds to that of the Pdx-bound wild type enzyme. To confirm the structural similarity between the L358P mutant and the Pdx-bound wild type enzyme, we investigated the heme environment of the ferrous-CO form of the L358P mutant by using NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 2 displays the NMR spectra for carbonmonoxy wild type P450cam (trace A) in the absence and presence of Pdxred (trace B), and carbonmonoxy L358P in the absence of Pdxred (trace C) in the upfield region at 40 °C. As seen in Fig. 2, the signals x (9-methyl group of d-camphor) and y (5-exo proton of d-camphor), both of which are only detected as resolved peaks in the presence of Pdxred for the wild type enzyme (trace B), were observed as resolved peaks for the L358P mutant in the absence of Pdxred (trace C). Furthermore, the signals a (β-proton of the axial Cys) and d (γ-methyl group of Thr-252) showed upfield and downfield shifts, respectively, in the L358P mutant, which were also observed in the wild type enzyme upon Pdx binding. Thus, the NMR spectral pattern for carbonmonoxy L358P in the absence of Pdxred (Fig. 2, trace C) is similar to that of the wild type enzyme in the presence of Pdxred (trace B), indicating that the heme environmental structure of the mutant would be similar to that of the Pdx-bound wild type enzyme. Because the contribution of the ring current shifts mainly depend on the position of the proton relative to the heme plane (29Johnson C.E.J. Bovey F.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1958; 29: 1012-1014Crossref Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 30Case D.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the ring current-shifted signals for the L358P mutant provide more detailed information on the local heme environment of the L358P mutant. By using the Johnson Bovey model (29Johnson C.E.J. Bovey F.A. J. Chem.

On the other hand, the γ-methyl group of Thr-252 moves away from the heme iron by ∼0.05 Å in the L358P mutant. In our previous work we found that Pdx binding to P450cam results in the movement of the axial Cys, 9-methyl group, and 5-exo proton of d-camphor closer to the heme iron by ∼0.05–0.15, ∼0.15, and 0.5–0.7 Å, respectively, whereas the γ-methyl group of Thr-252 moves by ∼0.25 Å away from the heme iron (6Tosha T.

Although the magnitude of the structural changes on the Leu-358 to Pro mutation is smaller than from Pdx binding, the same trend in the structural changes in the heme environment indicates that the heme environment of L358P-CO has similar property to the Pdx-bound wild type enzyme. Effects of Pdx Binding on Ferrous-CO L358P—If the L358P mutant in the absence of Pdx corresponds to the Pdx-bound wild type enzyme, it is expected that the heme environment in the mutant might not be perturbed by Pdx binding. We measured the NMR spectra for L358P-CO in the presence of Pdxred to examine the effects of Pdx binding on the heme environmental structure of L358P-CO. Fig. 3 illustrates the NMR spectra for the ferrous-CO form of the L358P mutant in the presence of 0.5–4 eq of Pdxred at 40 °C. By increasing the concentration of Pdxred, the ring current-shifted signals showed upfield (signals a, x, and y) and downfield shifts (signal d) as observed for the wild type enzyme (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39809-39821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These NMR spectral changes indicate that the binding of Pdx further induces structural changes around the heme in the L358P mutant. To compare the magnitude of the Pdx-induced structural changes in the L358P mutant with those of the wild type enzyme, the limiting shifts of the ring current-shifted signals in the L358P mutant were estimated by NMR titration experiments. No significant line broadening of the NMR signals, except for signal y, in the L358P mutant upon the binding of Pdx implies that the exchange rate between free and bound proteins is fast enough on the NMR time scale in the L358P-Pdx system, which is the same as that in the wild type enzyme (6Tosha T.

In the fast exchange process, we can use Equation 1 for determining the limiting shifts (24Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-182Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a plot of the shifts for the signal x in the L358P mutant and the wild type enzyme as a function of the ratio of Pdxred to P450cam. The experimental data points for the L358P mutant were fitted by Equation 1 with δmax = –1.45 ppm and Kd = 4.8 μm. δmax for the signals a and d were also estimated to –3.02 and –0.67 ppm, respectively (data not shown). The chemical shifts of the signals a, d, x, and y for the Pdx-free and Pdx-bound wild type enzyme (6Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Shimada H. Morishima I. J. Biol.

From these values, the changes of the chemical shifts upon the binding of Pdxred to the L358P mutant were estimated to be 40–68% of those of the wild type enzyme. Because the trend of the structural changes in the heme active site upon the Leu-358 to Pro mutation was the same as those induced by Pdx binding and the L358P mutant only exhibited relatively small Pdx-induced structural changes, the heme environment of the L358P mutant could reflect the Pdx-induced structural changes in the wild type enzyme.Table IISpecific assignments for the ring current-shifted signals in the 1H NMR spectra of the ferrous-CO forms of the enzymes in the absence and presence of Pdxδ (ppm from tetramethylsilane)Pdx-freePdx-boundΔaδPdx-bound - δPdx-free.β-Proton of the axial CysWild typebSee Ref. 6.-2.76-2.88-0.12L358P-2.95-3.02-0.079-Methyl group of d-camphorWild typebSee Ref. 6.-1.25-1.45-0.20L358P-1.37-1.45-0.085-exo-Proton of d-camphorWild typebSee Ref. 6.-1.18-2.46-1.28L358P-2.02-2.63cThe chemical shift is in the presence of 4 eq of Pdxred, which corresponds to 96% of P450cam-Pdx complex.-0.61γ-Methyl group of Thr-252Wild typebSee Ref. 6.-0.88-0.690.19L358P-0.80-0.670.13a δPdx-bound - δPdx-free.b See Ref. 6Tosha T.

The interaction between synapsin I and Rab3A was confirmed by photoaffinity labeling experiments on purified synaptic vesicles and by the formation of a chemically cross-linked complex between synapsin I and Rab3A in intact nerve terminals. Synapsin I could be effectively co-precipitated from synaptosomal extracts by immobilized recombinant Rab3A in a GTP-dependent fashion. In vitro binding assays using purified proteins confirmed the binding preference of synapsin I for Rab3A-GTP and revealed that the COOH-terminal regions of synapsin I and the Rab3A effector domain are required for the interaction with Rab3A to occur.

Synaptic vesicles are organized in two distinct functional pools, a large reserve pool in which SV are restrained by the actin-based cytoskeleton, and a quantitatively smaller releasable pool in which SV contact the presynaptic membrane and eventually fuse with it upon stimulation (for review see Refs. 1Neher E.

Both SV trafficking and neurotransmitter release depend on a precise sequence of events that includes release from the cytoskeletal constraint, targeting to the active zone, docking, priming, fusion, and endocytotic retrieval of SV. These steps are believed to be mediated by a series of specific interactions among cytoskeletal, SV, presynaptic membrane, and cytosolic proteins that, by acting in concert, promote the spatial and temporal regulation of the exocytotic machinery (3Greengard P.

Such a model has been confirmed by an array of in vivo observations. In living hippocampal neurons, synapsin I dissociates from SV and disperses into the axon during firing, whereas it reclusters upon return to the resting state, and the dispersion of the proteins depends on phosphorylation by CaMK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (21Chi P.

Conversely, neutralization of endogenous synapsins by the intracellular injection of anti-synapsin antibodies disrupted the clusters of SV, decreased neurotransmitter release evoked by high frequency stimulation in the lamprey giant reticulospinal neurons (11Pieribone V.A.

Although the above-mentioned observations strongly support a pre-docking role of the synapsins in the assembly and maintenance of a large reserve pool of SV and in the regulation of short term synaptic plasticity, recent results indicate that the synapsins are also involved in some later step of exocytosis. The kinetics of release was slowed in the squid giant terminal after injection of a conserved synapsin COOH-terminal peptide (31Hilfiker S. Schweizer F.E. Kao H.T. Czernik A.J. Greengard P.

However, there is no clear evidence, as yet, of an interaction of synapsins with presynaptic or SV proteins involved in the post-docking events of exocytosis. Synaptic vesicles docked or fused with the presynaptic membrane following electrical stimulation are only partially depleted of synapsins (11Pieribone V.A. Shupliakov O. Brodin L.

This raises the possibility that the putative post-docking effects of the synapsins are obtained via specific interactions with nerve terminal proteins playing a direct role in exocytosis. With the aim of uncovering potential synapsin partners, we have identified high affinity synapsin-binding peptides by phage display library analysis and have generated anti-peptide antibodies to identify nerve terminal proteins bearing the selected peptide motifs. By using this approach, we have observed that the small G protein Rab3A is one of the synapsin I interactors and that the binding of synapsin I to Rab3A occurs in purified SV and intact nerve terminals. 125I and 125I-labeled secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences; the Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence detection system was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Truncation mutants were detected in immunoblotting assays by either anti-His6 antibodies, protein S, or mAb 10.22 recognizing distinct sites on their NH2 terminus and detecting all mutants with the same sensitivity (39Vaccaro P.

We have used a previously described nonapeptide phage display library (40Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) containing ≈108 independent clones. Random oligonucleotides were inserted into the PC89 phagemid at the 5′ end of the gene encoding for the major coat protein pVIII. The resulting chimeric pVIII protein was incorporated into phage particles by introduction of the phagemid into E. coli cells subsequently superinfected with M13-K07 helper phage. Selection of the phages displaying peptides that bound to purified synapsin I immobilized on polystyrene beads (6.4 mm diameter; Precision Plastic Balls, Chicago, IL) was performed by the standard panning method as described previously (41Parmley S.F. Smith G.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Generally, two or three cycles of panning were needed to achieve a reliable enrichment of phage clones. Synapsin-positive clones, identified by immunoscreening analysis, were isolated, and single-stranded genome DNAs were purified and sequenced (39Vaccaro P. Dente L. Onofri F. Zucconi A. Martinelli S.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 43-58Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences were aligned, and consensus sequences were derived by using Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The relative affinity of interaction of the selected phage clones with native synapsin I was tested by ELISAs as described previously (42Cesareni G. Castagnoli L. Dente L. Iannolo G. Vetriani C. Felici F. Luzzago A. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Zegers N.D. Boersna W.J.A. Claasson E.E. Immunological Recognition of Peptides in Medicine and Biology.

Briefly, polystyrene beads coated with synapsin I (1 μg/ml) were incubated with the most reactive phage clones (50 μl of supernatant) for 1 h at 37 °C on a rocking platform. After washing the wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-pIII monoclonal antibody and revealed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary rat antibodies and the alkaline phosphatase detection system, and then reading the absorbance at 405–620 nm using a Labsystem reader. The site-specific binding of the selected phage clones was assayed by far Western overlay. Holosynapsin I and its cysteine-specific cleavage fragments (7.5 μg of total protein) (35Bähler M. Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer), rinsed with TBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 containing 1010 phage/ml. The membranes were then washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rat anti-pIII monoclonal antibody and revealed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the alkaline phosphatase detection system. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the most reactive clones were synthesized at the Rockefeller University Oligomer Facility. Peptides were coupled to thyroglobulin in 10 mm KPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, by dropwise addition of glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and used to immunize rabbits in complete Freund's adjuvant. Sera were collected at various time intervals after immunization, and the antipeptide antibodies were affinity-purified using columns made by coupling synthetic peptides to CH-Sepharose 4B beads following the manufacturer's instructions (5-ml bed volume; 20–40 ml of serum). After serum loading, the columns were washed sequentially with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4; 25 mm sodium borate, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.3; 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 5.5; 50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated to about 1 mg/ml. The COOH-terminal fragment of synapsin I, generated by cysteine-specific cleavage, was conjugated in the dark with SASD (1.4 mm) for 40 min at room temperature and subsequently iodinated on the reagent moiety as described previously (15Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The modified, 125I-labeled COOH-terminal fragment (100–400 nm final concentration) was incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark with synapsin-depleted SV (10–30 μg of total protein). After high speed sedimentation, SV pellets were photolyzed for 2 min at 254 nm using an ultraviolet lamp (UVP, San Gabriel, CA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cross-linking of synaptosomal proteins was performed by incubating intact synaptosomes at 37 °C for 45 min with the cell-permeable cross-linker DSS dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a final concentration of 5 mm (43Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After quenching the reaction with 100 mm glycine for 30 min, synaptosomes were osmotically lysed and fractionated by differential centrifugation, and the resulting crude SV fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot assay. Affinity Purification of Rab3A-binding Proteins from Brain Synaptosomes—Wild-type or mutated GST-Rab3A fusion proteins (30 μg) were loaded with either GDP or GTPγS (500 μm) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 25 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (loading buffer), for 10 min at 30 °C. After the incubation, the samples were chilled at 4 °C, and MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. When the loading procedure was carried out with a trace amount of either [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP, the average nucleotide binding stoichiometry was 0.22 ± 0.05 mol of nucleotide/mol of GST-Rab3A. Preloaded GST-Rab3A or GST alone was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (30 μl of settled beads) by an overnight incubation at 4 °C under gentle rotation in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) and 5mm MgCl2. Samples were then extensively washed with 20 volumes of binding buffer and mixed with 1 ml of a 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 extract of Percoll-purified synaptosomes (1 mg of protein/ml) (37Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). After a 3–5-h incubation at 4 °C under gentle rotation, samples were extensively washed and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Rab3A-Synapsin I Binding Assays—The binding of wild-type and mutated GST-Rab3A to purified synapsin I or to truncation mutants of the COOH-terminal region of synapsin I was assessed by co-precipitation experiments as follows. GST-Rab3A was loaded with either GDP or GTPγS as described above. Preloaded GST-Rab3A fusion proteins or GST alone was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (0.04 nmol of fusion protein per μl of settled beads) in binding buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2. After extensive washing, protein-coupled beads (15 μl) were incubated for 3–5 h at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of either purified synapsin I (62.5–2000 nm) or synapsin truncation mutants (400 nm) in 500 μl of binding buffer. After the incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, extensively washed with binding buffer and detergent-free binding buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 2 min. Binding was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by quantitative immunoblotting. The recovery of recombinant bait proteins in the pellets was routinely assessed by protein stain of the gels or of the corresponding blots. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay with BSA as standard. One- and two-dimension gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE and nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis) was performed according to Laemmli (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) and O'Farrell et al. (45O' Farrell P.Z. Goodman H.M. O' Farrell P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by immunoblotting by using either chemiluminescence or 125I-labeled secondary antibodies as detection system. Quantitative immunoblotting was performed either by laser scanning densitometry (Ultroscan XL, Amersham Biosciences) of the films obtained in the linear range of the emulsion response or by direct radioactivity counting, followed by interpolation o"
https://openalex.org/W2090309596,"The cytochrome P450cam active site is known to be perturbed by binding to its redox partner, putidaredoxin (Pdx). Pdx binding also enhances the camphor monooxygenation reaction (Nagano, S., Shimada, H., Tarumi, A., Hishiki, T., Kimata-Ariga, Y., Egawa, T., Suematsu, M., Park, S.-Y., Adachi, S., Shiro, Y., and Ishimura, Y. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 14507–14514). These effects are unique to Pdx because nonphysiological electron donors are unable to support camphor monooxygenation. The accompanying 1H NMR paper (Tosha, T., Yoshioka, S., Ishimori, K., and Morishima, I. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 42836–42843) shows that the conformation of active site residues, Thr-252 and Cys-357, and the substrate in the ferrous (Fe(II)) CO complex of the L358P mutant mimics that of the wild-type enzyme complexed to Pdx. To explore how these changes are transmitted from the Pdx-binding site to the active site, we have solved the crystal structures of the ferrous and ferrous-CO complex of wild-type and the L358P mutant. Comparison of these structures shows that the L358P mutation results in the movement of Arg-112, a residue known to be important for putidaredoxin binding, toward the heme. This change could optimize the Pdx-binding site leading to a higher affinity for Pdx. The mutation also pushes the heme toward the substrate and ligand binding pocket, which relocates the substrate to a position favorable for regio-selective hydroxylation. The camphor is held more firmly in place as indicated by a lower average temperature factor. Residues involved in the catalytically important proton shuttle system in the I helix are also altered by the mutation. Such conformational alterations and the enhanced reactivity of the mutant oxy complex with non-physiological electron donors suggest that Pdx binding optimizes the distal pocket for monooxygenation of camphor.

Because nonphysiological redox proteins such as ferredoxin and adrenodoxin cannot support the monooxygenation reaction or induce the conformational changes (7Pochapsky S.S. Pochapsky T.C. Wei J.W.

Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Pdx-induced changes in P450cam are thought to be important for the “effector” function of Pdx in addition to its reductase activity. In support of this view, a recent infrared and mutational study (15Nagano S. Shimada H. Tarumi A. Hishiki T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Egawa T. Suematsu M. Park S.-Y. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Ishimura Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14507-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has shown that Pdx-induced conformational changes promote the camphor monooxygenation reaction.Recent NMR studies found that the CO complex of the L358P mutant has very similar spectroscopic property to the WT P450cam-CO in a complex with Pdx (8Tosha T.

This suggests that the L358P mutant is a good model for Pdx-bound P450cam. However, our knowledge on the conformational change from the NMR studies is limited to only two residues, the axial cysteine ligand (Cys-357) and Thr-252 and the substrate. To overcome this limitation and to complement the NMR work, we have solved the crystal structures of the ferrous and ferrous-CO complex of the L358P mutant.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification and Crystallization—WT P450cam and the L358P 2The “WT” and “L358P” P450cam contain the C334A mutation to prevent intermolecular S–S bond formation that blocks crystal growth (40Nickerson D.

Comparison between enzymes with and without the C334A mutation revealed no significant change in catalytic and NMR spectroscopic properties. mutant were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (18Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The CO-bound P450cam structure was first solved by Raag and Poulos (19Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) by using the initial P212121 crystal form used to solve the P450cam structure. For a more accurate direct comparison between the WT and L358P structures, the ferrous and the ferrous-CO-bound structures for both WT P450cam and the mutant were determined in the P21 crystal form, thus minimizing differences because of crystal lattice and packing effects. Single crystals of WT P450cam and the mutant were obtained by the method described previously (20Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) for WT crystals in the same P21 space group with minor modifications. Crystals of the ferric form were grown at 15 °C. The precipitant solution was 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1–0.4 m KCl, 25–32% polyethylene glycol 4,000, and 0.7–1.0 mmd-camphor. The initial droplets contained 1–2 μl of protein solution at the concentration of 20 mg/ml, and 1 μl of the precipitant solution was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 500 μl of the precipitant solution. A single crystal in the ferric form was transferred to a vial containing 15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. The crystal was anaerobically reduced with 10 mm sodium dithionite for 10 min under anaerobic conditions. Reduction of the ferric enzyme crystals was independently confirmed by measuring the visible absorption spectra of the crystals treated with the procedure described above (spectra not shown). After reduction, CO was passed through the vial for 3 min. The crystal was kept under a CO atmosphere for 1–2 h and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.Data Collection and Processing—All data were collected using an R-Axis IV imaging plate detector (Rigaku) and rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic optics. Crystals were maintained at approximately –160 °C in a cryostream. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Five percent of the reflections were set aside for calculation of free R, and the same set of the test reflections was maintained throughout the refinement. Refinement statistics are listed in Table I.After a few cycles of energy minimization and individual temperature factor refinement, the Fo – Fc map clearly showed the heme-bound CO ligand in the L358P mutant that has one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). However, CO in the WT enzyme was well defined in only one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B). For the second molecule, the Fo – Fcomit map showed a triangularly shaped broad distribution of electron density around the 6th coordination site (Fig. 1C). The electron density distribution was reproducible for crystals from other preparations. The observed heterogeneity in the second molecule in the asymmetric unit is probably because of multiple conformational states and/or a mix of redox states with incomplete CO binding. This appears to be a characteristic of this crystal form because P450cam-O2 crystals also exhibited clearly defined electron density for only one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit (20Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The same is true for the cyanide complex (26Fedorov R. Ghosh D.K. Schlichting I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We used the structure of the first molecule of WT-CO crystal (Fig. 1B) for comparison with that for L358P-CO.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONL358P Mutation-induced Conformational Changes—The accompanying paper (17Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42836-42843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) shows that the CO complex of the L358P mutant has very similar NMR and vibrational spectral patterns to those of the Pdx-bound WT enzyme. Furthermore, because the vibrational spectroscopic behavior of the CO complex upon Pdx binding parallels that of the oxy complex, structural information gained from the CO complex can serve as a model for changes in structure upon formation of the oxy complex.Leu-358 follows the Cys-357 heme ligand. Although the geometry between the Cys-357 sulfur and Leu-358 peptide NH is not optimal for hydrogen bonding, the 3.6-Å distance is close enough for the partial positive charge on the peptide NH to attenuate the negative charge on the thiolate sulfur. The L358P mutation eliminates such electrostatic stabilization of the Cys-357 thiolate sulfur, which should enhance electron donation from the axial Cys to the heme iron. The enhanced electron donation was confirmed by a slight lowering of 36 mV in the mutant compared with that of WT enzyme (18Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Yoshioka S. Tosha T. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem.

Vibrational spectroscopic studies on the CO, NO, and oxy complexes have shown that Pdx binding enhances electron donation from the axial Cys, thereby promoting O–O bond cleavage (11Unno M.

As depicted in Fig. 2, replacement of the Leu with Pro enables the C-terminal side of the C helix to move toward the proximal ligand. Most notably the guanidinium group of Arg-112 relocates about 1 Å closer to Pro-358 and the heme. As discussed below, this is consistent with NMR studies by Pochapsky et al. 3They also reported that the B′, E, and F helix regions were perturbed by the Pdx binding. However, we observed no significant structural changes in this region. (7Pochapsky S.S. Pochapsky T.C. Wei J.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5649-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and may explain the high affinity of the mutant for reduced Pdx.Fig. 2Superimposed structures of L358P and WT P450cam in the ferrous-CO-bound forms. Carbon atoms and helix of L358P and WT are shown in cyan and yellow, respectively. Oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and iron atoms are shown in red, blue, orange, and dark pink, respectively. Dotted lines show electrostatic interaction between the thiolate of Cys-357 and the amide N atom of Leu-358. Open arrowheads indicate the position of the heme pyrrole rings A–C. Conformation A (see Fig. 3 and text) for Asp-251 to Thr-252 was omitted from the model for clarity. The two structures were aligned with C-α atoms by using LSQMAN (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because of steric crowding, the rigid Pro-358 side chain also forces a 0.4-Å movement of the heme pyrrole ring C away from the Pro-358 side chain as well as movement of the 357–359 backbone away from the heme (Fig. 2). Heme rings A and B move toward the proximal side by 0.3–0.4 Å. These changes slightly increase heme ruffling. Similar ruffling has been observed for the mutant P450cam where Arg-112 was substituted with Lys (15Nagano S. Shimada H. Tarumi A. Hishiki T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Egawa T. Suematsu M. Park S.-Y. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Ishimura Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14507-14514Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, a Pro at the position corresponding to 358 in P450cam has been found in a number of P450 enzymes such as CYP121 (28Leys D. Mowat C.G. McLean K.J. Richmond A. Chapman S.K.

Scheja L. Princen H.M. Gebhardt R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and CYP104 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (31Kanemoto R.H. Powell A.T. Akiyoshi D.E. Regier D.A. Kerstetter R.A. Nester E.W. Hawes M.C. Gordon M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2506-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CYP121 also shows a ruffled heme conformation because of steric crowding by the Pro ring (28Leys D. Mowat C.G. McLean K.J. Richmond A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5141-5147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because the plausible Pdx-binding site includes Arg-112, a critical residue for the electron transfer reaction and conformational change, it is reasonable to propose that Pdx binding to WT P450cam also pushes the C-ring up as in both the L358P and R112K mutants as well as CYP121. Although the relevance of such ruffling to P450 function remains unclear at present, a ruffled heme conformation could be important in the oxy-P450cam-Pdx complex because spectroscopic studies on metalloporphyrins have shown that ruffling decreases porphyrin π-metal dπ interactions and provides smaller inner sphere reorganization energies and thus enhances electron transfer rates (32Sun H.R. Smirnov V.V. DiMagno S.G. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 42: 6032-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).To clarify the effect of CO binding on the conformational change, we also determined structures in the ferrous state (structure not shown). The differences between the WT and mutant structures in the proximal pocket of the ferrous proteins are the same as found in the ferrous-CO structure. Therefore, proximal side changes are due to the mutation itself and not a combination of the mutation with CO binding. In sharp contrast, there is no significant difference in the distal pocket between WT and the mutant when the ferrous structures are compared. Therefore, differences in the distal pocket discussed in the next section are due to CO binding in combination with the mutation and not simply the mutation.In combination with the steric effect of CO binding, movement of the heme away from Pro-358 and toward the distal pocket where substrate binds leads to small but significant changes in the distal pocket (Fig. 2). Most notable is a repositioning of the substrate relative to the heme which is best described as a slight rotation about the C-1 atom, which results in a maximum movement of about 0.6 Å in the C-3, C-4, and C-5 atoms. The neighboring groups that contact the substrate like Leu-244 shift away from the distal pocket to allow the reorientation of the substrate.The conformation of the CO ligand in WT P450cam is very similar to that found in the CO-bound form structure reported previously (19Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this earlier work and the current study, the ligand in WT P450cam lies off the heme normal, bent away from the bound substrate, and directed toward Gly-248 in the I helix. The tilt angle between the heme normal and Fe–C bond and bend angle for the Fe–C–O bond are 7 and 151°, respectively, in the WT structure. The CO ligand of L358P also is positioned off of the heme normal and points away from the substrate with an Fe–C tilt of 15° and a Fe–C–O bend of 156°. However, because of the repositioning of the substrate in the L358P mutant compared with WT, the terminal O atom of the ligand moves closer to Thr-252 by 0.7 Å, which is similar to the WT O2 or CN– complexes (33La Mar G.N. Satterlee J.D. De Ropp J.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 5. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 185-298Google Scholar).In the mutant CO complex, Fo – Fc electron density maps clearly indicate that Asp-251 and Thr-252 have two alternate conformations that have been designated conformers A and B (Fig. 3). In conformer A, the peptide carbonyl of the Asp-251 peptide points toward the substrate, whereas Thr-252 is slightly further away from the substrate. Associated with conformation A are two new water molecules. However, we do not observe multiple conformations nor are the two new water molecules present in the WT-CO complex. This indicates that the two new waters are associated with conformer A of Asp-251 to Thr-252 because of the mutation and not CO binding.Fig. 3The alternate conformations of Asp-251 to Thr-252. The conformation B of Asp-251 and Thr-252, the substrate, and the heme are shown as yellow sticks. The alternate conformation A, which is also found in O- and CN–2 -bound P450cam (20Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 26Fedorov R. Ghosh D.K. Schlichting I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is illustrated as a green stick model. Two water molecules associated with conformation A are shown as green spheres. The simulated annealing Fo – Fc omit maps (conformation A was omitted from the model and 1.0 occupancy was assigned to conformation B) at 2.5- and –2.5-σ contour levels are shown in cyan and red, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Conformer A of Asp-251 to Thr-252 was also observed in the O2 or CN–-bound forms, and most interestingly, both ligands have very similar bent conformations even though CN– favors a linear Fe-C-N angle (33La Mar G.N. Satterlee J.D. De Ropp J.S. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 5. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 185-298Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions between the distal ligand and Thr-252 could be a key factor in the observed alternate conformations of Thr-252 and Asp-251. A CN– ligand has a negative charge formally localized at the N atom. Although an O2 molecule is neutral, the oxy complex is usually considered to be in equilibrium between the Fe(II)-O-O and Fe(III)-O-O– resonance forms, or at the very least, the significant negative charge is delocalized on the distal O atom of O2 (34Sharrock M. Debrunner P.G. Schulz C. Lipscomb J.D. Marshall V. Gunsalus I.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged distal ligand and O-γH of Thr-252 could be responsible for the conformation A observed in the O and CN–2 complexes (20Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 26Fedorov R. Ghosh D.K. Schlichting I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because a neutral CO ligand does not have such an electrostatic interaction, the conversion from conformer B to A does not occur in the WT-CO complex. However, the A and B conformations are observed in the L358P-CO complex. In this case, the camphor has moved in the mutant closer to the CO compared with WT that forces the oxygen atom in CO to orient toward Thr-252. Therefore, Thr-252 must adopt the A conformation to avoid steric clashes with the ligand and to make electrostatic interaction between the O-γ atom and the ligand.In summary, the mutation causes Arg-112 to move"

The enzyme architecture discloses a novel molecular arrangement, with each subunit consisting of an α/β N-terminal domain and a C-terminal 12-stranded β sandwich domain, connected by swapped β strands. The C-terminal domain shows a striking internal approximate 222 symmetry and an unprecedented topology, revealing a novel fold within the family of all β structures. The catalytic site is located in the long crevice that defines the interface between the domains. The conserved GGDG structural fingerprint of the catalytic site is reminiscent of the related region in 6-phosphofructokinase, supporting the hypothesis that NAD kinase belongs to a newly reported superfamily of kinases.

NAD(P) is today fully recognized as a vital dual function cofactor that is intimately involved in both energy and signal transduction (1Berger F. Ramirez-Hernandez M.H. Ziegler M. Trends Biochem.

In all organisms, de novo NADP synthesis occurs exclusively via NAD phosphorylation through a reaction catalyzed by NAD kinase (EC 2.7.1.23). The enzyme phosphorylates NAD, yielding NADP in the presence of ATP in a magnesium-dependent reaction; and this being the only biochemical event leading to de novo synthesis of NADP, NAD kinase is of crucial importance for NADP-dependent anabolic/biosynthetic pathways in the cell. The enzyme was indeed recently reported to be essential in Bacillus subtilis (10Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati A. Andersen K.K. Arnaud M. Asai K. Ashikaga S. Aymerich S. Bessieres P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the M. tuberculosis enzyme has also been shown to use inorganic polyphosphate (poly(P)) as the phosphate donor (14Raffaelli N.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4844-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were reported to have a marked positive cooperativity toward the substrate ATP and to be strongly inhibited by the product NADP. On the other hand, the human enzyme was shown to follow perfect hyperbolic kinetics (13Lerner F. Niere M. Ludwig A. Ziegler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We recently published an extensive biochemical and enzymatic characterization of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase, observing both a strong cooperativity for all substrates (Hill coefficients of 1.2, 1.5, and 1.4 for NAD, ATP, and poly(P), respectively) and a remarkable inhibition exerted by the product NADP (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings led to the proposal of a relevant role for NAD kinase in the regulation of the NADP metabolic flux in M. tuberculosis (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), as earlier hypothesized for the B. subtilis enzyme (16Garavaglia S. Galizzi A. Rizzi M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4844-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on the conservation of a common signature, NAD kinase was recently proposed to be a member of a new superfamily of kinases, including 6-phosphofructokinases (PFKs), 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; FHA fork-head-associated. 1The abbreviations used are: PFK, 6-phosphofructokinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; FHA fork-head-associated. diacylglyceride kinases, and sphingosine kinases (17Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These enzymes were suggested to adopt a common fold and to have a similar phosphate-donor binding site (17Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, the strictly conserved GGDG sequence fingerprint has been demonstrated to be essential for the involvement of catalysis in ATP binding (17Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A second highly conserved glycinerich region, a peculiar feature of NAD kinases, was recently identified (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of this region in M. tuberculosis NAD kinase demonstrated its essentiality in catalysis and pointed to its involvement in NAD binding (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, a robust picture of the catalytic mechanism carried out by the M. tuberculosis enzyme is available. Within the framework of our structural studies on NAD biosynthetic enzymes (18Rizzi M. Schindelin H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we report here the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase in its inactive T state, which represents the first structure of a NAD kinase ever reported. The structure of each subunit consists of an α/β N-terminal domain and an antiparallel 12-stranded β sandwich C-terminal domain, with the catalytic site located in the long crevice that defines the interface between the domains. Being an essential enzyme in M. tuberculosis and showing significant functional differences with its human counterpart, NAD kinase can be regarded as a promising target for the treatment of tuberculosis, a re-emerging worldwide leading cause of morbidity and mortality, which has a devastating impact in developing countries (19Dye C.

Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two different crystal forms were obtained (Table I). Crystals of form I were grown by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of a protein solution at 8 mg/ml with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 1 m Li2SO4, 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and equilibrating against 1000 μl of the reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a maximum dimension of ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm at 20 °C in about 7 days. For data collection, the crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K under a stream of liquid nitrogen. Prior to flash cooling, the crystals were stepwise transferred from the crystallization solution to the cryoprotectant solution, which had the same composition as the reservoir solution, with the addition of 20% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. A complete 2.8-Å resolution data set was collected on a native crystal using synchrotron radiation at the ID14 EH4 beam line, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Analysis of the diffraction data sets collected allowed us to assign these crystals to the tetragonal space group P43212 or P41212, with cell dimensions a = b = 118.7 Å and c = 222.8 Å, containing four molecules per asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 55%. Selenium Met M. tuberculosis NAD kinase was obtained adopting the same protocol used to purify the native enzyme (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the enzyme was overexpressed in the methionine-auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3)pLys in minimal medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml of all amino acids, except methionine, which was replaced by 60 μg/ml of seleno-l-methionine. Expression was induced for 8 h at 37 °C by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The labeled protein was purified using the same procedure adopted for native protein (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that the dithiothreitol concentration was increased to 5 mm to prevent selenomethionine oxidation. Crystals of the selenium methionine NAD kinase were yielded under the same conditions described above and were fully isomorphic with the native crystals (Table I). The multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on beam line ID14 EH4 using an ADSC Quantum 210 charge-coupled device detector. A crystal scan was performed to determine the wavelengths for data collection. Data were collected from randomly oriented crystals at the selenium absorption peak, at the inflection point, and at a remote reference energy.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsNativeMADP21212P43212PeakInflectionRemoteData collection and phasingWavelength (Å)0.9790.9790.97930.97950.9392Max resolution (Å)2.32.82.82.83.0Observation195,235225,138245,458246,875182,368Unique reflections29,11044,64444,27244,48432,737〈I〉/〈σ1〉4.34.287.27.8Rmerge10.012.36.37.37.7Multiplicity6.75.05.55.55.6Completeness (%)98.399.899.999.999.9Anomolous completeness (%)98.698.699.3Rcullis0.880.86Phasing power (centric/acentric)0.284/0.3200.294/0.341FOMaFOM, figure of merit0.140.14RefinementResolution (Å)2.32.8No. of protein atoms4,0968,488No. of solvent molecules276303Rwork (%)22.622.8Rfree (%)28.828.9r.m.s.d. bond (Å)0.0190.018r.m.s.d. angles (°)1.901.88Mean B-factor side (Å2)34.260.4Mean B-factor chain (Å2)37.563.4Mean B-factor solvent (Å2)37.563.4a FOM, figure of merit Open table in a new tab Crystals of form II were grown by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method following a previously published procedure (20Mori S. Kawai S. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1319-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this procedure, 3 μl of the protein solution at a concentration of 8 mg/ml were mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 1.8% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.1 m MES, and the drop equilibrated against 1000 μl of the reservoir solution. For data collection, these crystals were quickly washed in a solution containing the crystallization buffer and 35% glycerol as the cryoprotectant and flash-frozen under a stream of liquid nitrogen. A complete data set was collected at a temperature of 100 K up to 2.3 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at the ID14 EH4 beam line, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The analysis of the collected diffraction data sets allowed us to assign these crystals to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with cell dimensions a = 64.0 Å, b = 68.0 Å, and c = 145.0 Å, containing two molecules per asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 72%. For all data collections, diffraction intensities were evaluated and integrated using the program MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter Protein Crystallography. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar), whereas the CCP4 suite of programs (22Number Collaborative Computing Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) was used for data reduction. Table I gives a summary of all data collections. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of crystal form I was solved by using the three-wavelength anomalous diffraction data and the SHELXD program (23Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). SHELXD identified ten selenium sites, which were refined using the program SHARP (24Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) giving the phasing statistics reported in Table I. Inspection of the electron density maps unambiguously indicated P43212 as the correct space group. The initial electron density map was of good quality despite the limited resolution and allowed us to trace about 80% of the tetramer present in the asymmetric unit. Model building was carried out with the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and was guided by the position of the selenium sites, which were of great help for a correct sequence assignment. The crystallographic refinement was carried out at 2.8 Å by using the program REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). A random sample containing 2% of the total reflections (900 reflections) was excluded from the refinement and used for the calculation of the free R-factor (27Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained for the C-terminal domain throughout all the different stages of refinement. The initial model was subjected to iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement alternated with graphic sessions for model building using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were manually added at positions with density >4σ in the Fo - Fc map, considering only peaks engaged in at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or a solvent atom. The procedure converged to an R-factor and free R-factor of 22.8 and 28.9%, respectively. The current model contains 1125 amino acids and 303 solvent molecules. No or very poor electron density was visible between residues 1A–3A, 14A–17A, 44A–60A, 306A–307A, 1B–6B, 13B–17B, 33B–68B, 306–307B, 1C–2C, 47C–63C, 306C–307C, 1D, 15D–17D, and 306D–307D, which were therefore not included in the model. The average B-factors for the 8488 protein atoms and for the 303 solvent molecules are 62.5 and 63.4 Å2 (60.4 and 63.4 Å2 for the main chain and side chain, respectively). The structure of the most complete monomer of crystal form I was employed as a search model for molecular replacement calculation against the crystal form II. A clear solution for both the cross-rotation and translation functions was promptly obtained using the program AmoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), revealing the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic refinement was carried out at 2.3 Å with the program REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) and excluded from the refinement a random sample containing 4% of the reflections (1164 reflections) for the calculation of the free R-factor (27Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of crystallographic refinement were alternated with graphic sessions for model building until convergence. Peaks with density >4σ in the Fo - Fc map and engaged in at least one hydrogen bond with a protein atom or a solvent atom were interpreted as solvent molecules. The procedure converged to an R-factor of 22.6 and free R-factor of 28.8%, yielding a final model consisting of 543 amino acids and 276 solvent molecules. No electron density was visible between residues 1A–4A, 41A–76A, 1B–4B, and 41B–69B, which were not included in the model. The average B-factors for the 4096 protein atoms and for the 276 solvent molecules are 35.8 and 37.5 Å2 (34.2 and 37.5 Å2 for the main chain and side chain, respectively). The results of refinement are summarized in Table I. All the figures have been generated with the program MOLSCRIPT (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Deposition—The atomic coordinates of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1U0R and 1U0T for the tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal forms, respectively). Overall Quality of the Model—Two different crystal forms were obtained. Crystals of form I diffract to 2.8 Å and belong to the tetragonal space group P43212 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit; crystals of form II diffract to 2.3 Å and belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (see “Experimental Procedures”). The tetragonal crystal form was employed for structure determination by means of the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method, using the anomalous signal of selenium. A monomer of the tetragonal crystal form was then used for structure determination of the orthorhombic crystal through molecular replacement. The stereochemistry of the refined models have been assessed with the program PROCHECK (30Laskowsky R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Crystal form I shows 84% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no outliers are present. Crystal form II shows 90% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and no outliers. Overall Structure—M. tuberculosis NAD kinase folds into 7 α-helices, 18 β strands, and the connecting loops organized in two domains: an N- and a C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain (residues 1–137 and 279–284) consists of a classical α/β dinucleotide binding domain (31Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar), in which the core is a twisted six-stranded parallel open β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices. Interestingly, the sixth parallel β strand is contributed by strand β18 of the C-terminal portion of the protein, revealing a swapping of secondary structure elements between the two domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain also contains the N-terminal portion of the long β6 strand, which runs antiparallel to β18 and extends, with its C-terminal half, into the C-terminal domain, completing the observed swapping of secondary structure elements between the two domains (Fig. 1). Remarkably, the domain connection is therefore based upon a motif made of parts of the antiparallel β6 and β18 strands, the two swapped secondary structural elements. The C-terminal domain (residues 140–277) consists of 12 β strands and 1 α-helix arranged in an antiparallel 12-stranded β sandwich, with a short α-helical insertion (helix α6) between strands β11 and β12 (Fig. 2). The two β-sheets of the C-terminal domain β sandwich can be described as consisting of four structural repeats of a three-stranded unit, which appear to be related by an internal ∼222 symmetry (Fig. 2). Such a striking feature suggests that the C-terminal domain has probably resulted from duplication of this simple tetramerization unit. The molecular architecture of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase is completed by a C-terminal tail (residues 285–307) containing helix α7 and a long C-terminal extension located on the external face of the protein, roughly half-way between the two domains (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Stereo ribbon representation of the C-terminal domain of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase. Each of the four structural repeats of the three-stranded unit, related by internal ∼222 symmetry, is colored differently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quaternary Structure—Gel filtration experiments showed that M. tuberculosis NAD kinase exists in solution either as a tetramer (32Kawai S. Mori S. Mukai T. Suzuki S. Yamada T. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or a dimer (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Structural analysis revealed the presence of a tetramer and a dimer in the asymmetric unit of crystal form I and II, respectively. Within the tetramer, the four subunits associate with 222 symmetry (Fig. 3a). Although the C-terminal domains strictly follow the 222 symmetry, the N-terminal domains deviate from perfect symmetry showing a variation in the orientation of up to a 7° rotation, as calculated by the program DynDom (33Hayward S. Lee R.A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) for the N-terminal domains of subunits C and D. This hinge-bending rotation has its pivotal point in the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains. The inter-subunit contacts are entirely contributed by residues of the C-terminal domains, and no contacts involving residues of the N-terminal domains are present. Two major inter-subunit interfaces can be distinguished: one between the A-B subunits and the other between the A-D subunits (Fig. 3a). 1050 Å2 of the accessible surface area are buried in each monomer upon formation of the AB dimer. Several intermolecular contacts, including 57 polar interactions, occur across the dyad axis relating the A and B monomers. The second and most prominent subunit interface is established between monomers A and D, with 1800 Å2 of the accessible surface area buried in each monomer upon dimer formation. In this case, 68 polar interactions and many hydrophobic contacts participate in dimer stabilization. In particular, the regions encompassing residues 207–212 and 231–236 (β13) of one monomer meet their equivalent in the facing subunit. The resulting arrangement creates a parallel β-sheet at the A-D interface (Fig. 3b) characterized by a high number of hydrogen bonds involving backbone atoms. The second remarkable structural trait of the A-D interface is represented by the hooking of the C-terminal tail of one monomer onto a structural motif made by the antiparallel β strands β9 and β10 of the other, tightly anchoring the two monomers to each other (Fig. 3b). The asymmetric unit of orthorhombic crystal form contains a dimer with subunits related by a local dyad, where 1980 Å2 of the accessible surface area for each subunit are buried upon dimer formation. The dimer observed in the orthorhombic crystal form corresponds to the AD dimer of the tetramer described above, with a remarkable conservation of all the contacts established between subunits. Such an observation suggests that the dimer is the minimal functional unit for the allosteric M. tuberculosis NAD kinase, in agreement with the studies carried out in solution (14Raffaelli N. Finaurini L. Mazzola F. Pucci L. Sorci L. Amici A. Magni G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarity with Other Structures—A structural similarity search using the program DALI (34Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) has been performed for the whole enzyme as well as for the two separated domains. No structural similarity encompassing the whole enzyme could be identified when the entire monomer was employed. Not surprisingly, however, when the isolated α/β N-terminal domain was subjected to a DALI search, a number of Protein Data Bank entries showing high structural similarity were detected. The best score (Z value of 8.5) was produced by E. coli MurG, a membrane-associated glycotransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1f0k) (35Ha S. Walker D. Shi Y. Walker S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which shares 18% sequence identity and can be superimposed onto the N-terminal domain of M. tuberculosis NAD kinase, with an r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å for 113 C-α pairs. NAD kinase was recently proposed to belong to a new superfamily of kinases, which includes 6-PFKs, diacylglyceride kinases, and sphingosine kinases (17Labesse G. Douguet D. Assairi L. Gilles A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1993722516,"Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that has a number of metabolic effects in the body, including the control of both glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The globular head domain of adiponectin, gAd, has also been shown to increase fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Within days after birth, a rapid increase in fatty acid oxidation occurs in the heart. We examined whether adiponectin or gAd plays a role in this maturation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation. Plasma adiponectin increased in newborn rabbits following birth: 1.2 ± 0.3 μg/ml in 1-day-old, 6.8 ± 1.8 μg/ml in 7-day-old, and 45 ± 5 μg/ml in 6-week-old rabbits. Because plasma insulin levels decrease and remain low throughout the suckling period, and because this decrease may contribute to the maturation of fatty acid oxidation, we examined the effects of adiponectin and gAd on fatty acid oxidation in isolated perfused 1-day-old rabbit hearts in the presence or absence of 100 microunits/ml insulin. Adiponectin (10 μg/ml) did not alter fatty acid oxidation in the presence of insulin. In the absence of insulin, the addition of recombinant gAd (1.5 μg/ml) increased fatty acid oxidation compared with control (129 ± 18 <i>versus</i> 66 ± 11 nmol·g dry weight <sup>–</sup><sup>1</sup>·min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In 7-day-old hearts, where fatty acid oxidation rates were 5-fold higher than 1-day-old hearts, gAd did not alter fatty acid oxidation rates. The increase in fatty acid oxidation in 1-day-old hearts occurred independently of changes in 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or malonyl-CoA. The effect of gAd on fatty acid oxidation was reversed in the presence of 100 microunits/ml insulin. These results suggest that a decrease in plasma insulin and increase in gAd are involved in the increase of cardiac fatty acid oxidation in the immediate newborn period."

Upon malignant transformation of cells, the expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene increases in accordance with the increase in the amounts of highly branched N-glycans. Lectin blot analysis showed that the galactosylation of highly branched N-glycans is inhibited significantly in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells by the transfection of the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA, indicating the biological importance of the β-1,4-GalT V for the functions of highly branched N-glycans. We cloned the 2.3-kb 5′-flanking region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene, and we identified the region –116/–18 relative to the transcription start site as that having promoter activity. The region was found to contain several putative binding sites for transcription factors, including AP2, AP4, N-Myc, Sp1, and upstream stimulatory factor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Sp1 binds to nucleotide positions –81/–69 of the promoter region. Mutations induced in the Sp1-binding site showed that the promoter activity of the β-1,4-GalT V gene is impaired completely in cancer cells. In contrast, the promoter activity increased significantly by the transfection of the Sp1 cDNA into A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Mithramycin A, which inhibits the binding of Sp1 to its binding site, reduced the promoter activation and expression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene in A549 cells.

One of the most prominent transformation-associated changes in the sugar chains of glycoproteins is an increase in the large N-glycans of cell surface glycoproteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Kobata A. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 87-161Google Scholar). This was discovered by comparing the gel filtration patterns of glycopeptides obtained by Pronase digestion of metabolically labeled normal and malignant cell glycoproteins (2Meezan E. Wu H.C.

Detailed structural studies of N-glycans isolated from baby hamster kidney cells and polyoma- or Rous sarcoma virus-transformed baby hamster kidney cells showed that the increase in the GlcNAcβ1→6 branch attached to the Manα1→6Man arm of the trimannosyl cores is the structural basis for this phenomenon (5Yamashita K.

Gilbert F. Glick M.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3730-3735PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hiraizumi S. Takasaki S. Shiroki K. Kochibe N. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem.

Three transformed cell lines, MT1, MTPy, and MTAg, established from mouse NIH3T3 cells by transfection with the SV40 or polyoma virus early gene segments (10Segawa K. Yamaguchi N. Virology. 1986; 155: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), showed marked differences in their tumorigenic and metastatic potentials when transplanted subcutaneously or intravenously into athymic mice. Structural analysis of the N-glycans of these cells revealed that only about 20% of the glycoproteins from 3T3 and MT1 cells have highly branched N-glycans with the Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Man branch compared with 31 and 39% of the glycoproteins from MTPy and MTAg cells, respectively, indicating a proportionality between increased highly branched N-glycans and tumorigenic and metastatic potentials (11Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar). The increased expression of the highly branched N-glycans also correlates with the tumor forming activities of various other transformed cells (7Santer U.V. Gilbert F. Glick M.C.

Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to correlate with the metastatic potentials of mouse mammary carcinoma cells, mouse lymphoma cells, transformed rat fibroblasts, and human breast cancers (13Dennis J.W.

Thus the results of several studies established that an increase in highly branched N-glycans is actually related to the in vivo tumor forming and metastatic potentials of transformed cells. In accordance with the structural studies, the specific activity of UDP-GlcNAc:Man N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GlcNAcT) V, which synthesizes the GlcNAcβ1→6 branch, has been shown to be elevated 2–3-fold in transformed cells (15Yamashita K.

Biochem. 1988; 37: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant changes in the specific activities of other glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of N-glycans have been observed in transformed cells (15Yamashita K. Tachibana Y. Ohkura T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shirane K. Sato T. Segawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because the Galβ1→4GlcNAc outer chains form the basis for the expression of a variety of carbohydrate antigens, whether or not the gene expression of UDP-Gal:GlcNAc β-1,4-galactosyltransferases (β-1,4-GalT) I-VI, most of which are involved in the biosynthesis of N-glycans (18Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Sato T. Guo S. Furukawa K. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), is changed by malignant transformation was investigated using NIH3T3 and MTAg cells as described above. Northern blot analysis revealed that the β-1,4-GalT V transcript increases 2–3-fold and the β-1,4-GalT II transcript decreases to one-tenth, whereas those of other β-1,4-GalTs remain constant upon malignant transformation (17Shirane K. Sato T. Segawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in several human cancer cell lines (20Sato T. Shirane K. Kido M. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression pattern of β-1,4-GalT genes also changes upon malignant transformation of cells despite little apparent change in the enzymatic activity. Because our preliminary study suggested that the β-1,4-GalT V can effectively galactosylate the GlcNAcβ1→6 branch, which is synthesized by GlcNAcT V (21Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is important to elucidate the biological significance of the β-1,4-GalT V and the mechanism by which β-1,4-GalT V gene is regulated in cancer cells. For these purposes, we showed the biological importance of the galactosylation of highly branched N-glycans by the β-1,4-GalT V and then isolated the promoter region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene and examined the cis-elements and trans-acting factors that regulate β-1,4-GalT V gene expression. Cell Cultures and Reagents—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown at 37 °C in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 mg/ml kanamycin, and 1.0 mg/ml glucose. A549 human lung carcinoma cells, HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells, G361 human melanoma cells, and SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were grown in RPMI1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) and L-PHA were from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo). Goat anti-human Sp1 (PEP 2) and anti-human Sp3 (d-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The Sp1-expression vector, CMV-Sp1, was kindly provided by Dr. R. Tjian of the University of California, Berkeley. Mithramycin A was from Sigma. Lectin Blot Analysis of Antisense β1,4-GalT V cDNA-transfected Cells—SH-SY5Y cells (1 × 105 cells) were transfected with 2 μg of the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as a control or the pcDNA3.1 containing a partial sequence of human β-1,4-GalT V cDNA (–5 to +500 relative to the initiation codon) in an antisense orientation and the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured for 72 h, and then the plasmid-transfected cells were selected by culturing in a medium containing geneticin (500 μg/ml G418 sulfate, Sigma) for 2 weeks. Membrane glycoprotein samples were prepared from the mock- and antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA-transfected cells, subjected to SDS-PAGE using a Mini Protean II Electrophoresis Cell (Bio-Rad), and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters using a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis using HRP-conjugated RCA-I and L-PHA was performed by the method as described previously (22Sato T. Furukawa K. Greenwalt D.E. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Isolation, Southern Blot Analysis, and DNA Sequencing of Human Genomic DNA Clones—A human placenta λ genomic library in λFIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using the 480-bp EcoRI-ApaI fragment of human β-1,4-GalT V cDNA (21Sato T. Furukawa K. Bakker H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as a probe. The probe was random-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a “Ready to Go™” DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Positive clones were obtained by four successive screenings. Phage DNAs were purified and digested with several restriction endonucleases, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred onto a GeneScreen nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were hybridized with the biotinylated 100-bp PCR fragment containing the initiation codon of the β-1,4-GalT V gene as a probe according to the manufacturer's instructions for the random primer biotin-labeling kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The hybridization-positive 1.5-kb NdeI fragment or the 1.3-kb BamHI fragment was subcloned into the NdeI site of pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM/Nde or into the BamHI site of pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene) to generate pBlue/Bam. The nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragments were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) by using an Auto Read Sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). To identify the putative binding sites of transcription factors, the 2-kb 5′-flanking region of the human β-1,4-GalT V gene was analyzed by the MatInspector program (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). RNA Ligase-mediated Rapid Amplification of the 5′ cDNA End (RLM-RACE)—RLM-RACE analysis was performed to map the transcription start site using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the total RNA preparation (3 μg) from SH-SY5Y cells was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to dephosphorylate non-mRNAs or truncated mRNAs, and then treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove the 5′-cap structure from the full-length mRNAs. The GeneRacer RNA Oligo (5′-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA-3′) was ligated to the 5′-ends of the decapped mRNAs. Subsequently, the cDNAs were synthesized with random primers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase. Two antisense oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the coding region of the β-1,4-GalT V cDNA as shown in Fig. 4A were synthesized and used for the PCR. The primary PCR was conducted using the synthesized cDNAs as templates, the antisense gene-specific primer TS138 (5′-GGAGTCTTTCAGGGCAGGTATGGTT-3′; complementary to nucleotides +355/+331 relative to the initiation codon), and the GeneRacer 5′-Primer supplied with the kit under the following conditions: 98 °C, 10 s; 65 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 1 min; 40 times. The secondary PCR was conducted using the primary PCR products as templates, the antisense gene-specific primer TS137 (5′-TGCCGGGCGCCACATAGACGAAGTA-3′; complementary to nucleotides +112/+88 relative to the initiation codon), and the GeneRacer 5′-Nested Primer supplied with the kit under the following conditions: 98 °C, 10 s; 65 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 1 min; 25 times. The primary and secondary PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under a UV lamp as described previously (20Sato T. Shirane K. Kido M. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a final product, a DNA fragment comprising ∼300 bp was obtained in secondary PCR and subsequently cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. Reporter Plasmid Constructions—To assay the promoter activity, a variety of the 5′-flanking regions of the β-1,4-GalT V gene that differed in length was inserted into the firefly luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega), which contained no eukaryotic promoter or enhancer element. The strategy for cloning of the fragments of the β-1,4-GalT V gene promoter into a pGL3-Basic vector was as follows, with the numbers indicating the nucleotide positions relative to the transcription start site. 1) For pGL(–2099/+170), the 1.0-kb BamHI-NotI fragment was excised from pBlue/Bam (Fig. 2C) and cloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of pGEM/Nde (Fig. 2B) to generate pGEM/Nde-Not (Fig. 2D). Similarly, the 2.3-kb SacI-NotI fragment was excised from pGEM/Nde-Not and subcloned into the SacI-NotI sites of the pBluescript II KS vector to generate pBlue/Nde-Not. The 2.3-kb SacI-XhoI fragment was excised from pBlue/Nde-Not and subcloned into the SacI-XhoI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. In order to minimize the effect of sequences derived from the pBluescript II KS vector or pGEM-T Easy vector, the resultant plasmids were digested with NotI and SpeI to remove the multiple cloning sites in the vectors. The ends were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and then self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase. 2) For pGL(–1121/+170), pGL(–2099/+170) was digested with KpnI and Sse8387I. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 3) For pGL(–2099/–835), the KpnI-BamHI fragment was excised from pGL(–2099/+170) and subcloned into the KpnI-BglII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. 4) For pGL(–834/+170), the BamHI-HindIII fragment was excised from pGL(–2099/+170) and subcloned into the BglII-HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. 5) For pGL(–551/+170), pGL(–2099/+170) was digested with NdeI, and the ends were self-ligated. 6) For pGL(–313/+170), pGL(–2099/+170) was digested with SacI and PstI. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 7) For pGL(–116/+170), pGL(–2099/+170) was digested with SacI and BssHII. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 8) For pGL(+23/+170), the NaeI-HindIII fragment was excised from pGL(–116/+170) and then subcloned into the SmaI-HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic vector. 9) For pGL(–2099/–117), pGL(–2099/+170) was digested with BssHII and HindIII. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 10) For pGL(–116/+22), pGL(–116/+170) was digested with KpnI and NaeI and subcloned into the KpnI-SmaI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. 11) For pGL(–116/–18), pGL(–116/+170) was digested with SfiI and HindIII. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 12) For pGL(–17/+22), pGL(–116/+22) was digested with KpnI and SfiI. The ends were blunted and then self-ligated. 13) For pGL(–116/+170)-Sp1 mutation 1 and pGL(–116/+170)-Sp1 mutation 2, both plasmids were constructed using pGL(–116/+170) as a template with a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations in the Sp1-binding site are indicated by an underline at nucleotide positions –81/–69 (Sp1 mutation 1, GGCCCCAATCCC and Sp1 mutation 2, GGCCCCGTTTCCC, instead of the wild type, GGCCCCGCCTCCC). The correct orientation and sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis. The unaltered plasmid, pGL3-Basic, was used as a promoterless control, and the plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, was used as a normalization control to correct for variable transfection efficiencies. pGL3-SV40 (Promega) contained the firefly luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter as a positive control. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—One day prior to transfection, the cell lines (1 × 105 cells each) were seeded in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pRL-TK, and the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed in 200 μlof lysis buffer, and subjected to freeze-thaw lysis. The firefly or Renilla luciferase activity in 10 μl of cell lysate was determined with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) by Luminescence PSN AB-2200 (Atto Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities except in the case of CMV-Sp1, which significantly stimulated the TK promoter, which was co-transfected. In the latter case, the firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the protein content of each sample as described previously (25Halle J.P. Haus-Seuffert P. Woltering C. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nicolas M. Noe V. Jensen K.B. Ciudad C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22126-22132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results show the mean values of three experiments with standard errors. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMS Assay)—Nuclear extract was prepared from SH-SY5Y cells with NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce), containing multiple protease inhibitors, such as benzamidine, aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled with biotin-N4-CTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase according to the instructions for the Biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce), and then the biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to generate the double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes. The sequences of the upper strands of the oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. EMS assays were performed according to the instructions for the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMS assay kit (Pierce). In brief, the binding reaction was performed by preincubating 4 μg of nuclear extract with 50 ng of poly(dI-dC) in buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at room temperature. Approximately 30–50 fmol of probe was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were separated from the free probes by electrophoresis in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 45 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 1.25 mm EDTA as a running buffer. The samples in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). To detect DNA-protein complexes, the membranes were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and then visualized with LightShift Luminol/Enhancer solution and LightShift Stable Peroxide solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. For competition experiments, unlabeled Sp1-consensus oligonucleotides were added in a 100-fold molar excess prior to the addition of the biotinylated probes. To identify the transcription factor comprising the DNA-protein complexes by the supershift assay, the nuclear extract was incubated in the binding buffer for 60 min at 4 °C with anti-human Sp1 antibody or anti-human Sp3 antibody prior to the addition of the biotinylated probes.Table IOligonucleotides used in the EMS assayNameaProbes A—C are shown in Fig. 9A.Sequence (5′ to 3′)bThe mutations in the Sp1-binding site in probe B are underlined.Probe AGCGACGGTGCCCGGCGGCACTGGCCCProbe BCTGGCCCCGCCTCCCGCGCGTGCGCCProbe CCGCCCCGCCTCCGCCCCCGCCGCTGCSp1 mutationCTGGCCCCGAATCCCGCGCGTGCGCCSp1 consensusCCTTGGTGGGGGCGGGGCCTAAGCTGa Probes A—C are shown in Fig. 9A.b The mutations in the Sp1-binding site in probe B are underlined. Open table in a new tab Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA preparations were obtained from mithramycin A-treated and -untreated A549 cells using Sepasol RNA I total RNA isolation reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). RT-PCR analysis was conducted using the cDNAs as templates and oligonucleotide primers specific to the β-1,4-GalT V gene. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (20Sato T. Shirane K. Kido M. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Decreased Galactosylation of Highly Branched N-Glycans by Transfection of Antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA into SH-SY5Y Cells—To elucidate the biological significance of the β-1,4-GalT V in cancer cells, the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. RT-PCR analysis using oligonucleotide primers specific to the β-1,4-GalT V gene showed that the expression level of the β-1,4-GalT V transcript decreases 20–30% by the transfection of the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA into SH-SY5Y cells when compared with that of the control cells (data not shown). Under these conditions, the constant expression levels of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) gene were obtained in both cells (data not shown). Membrane glycoprotein samples were prepared from the mock- and antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA-transfected cells. They were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. When the filters were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, both samples contained similar protein components (Fig. 1, CBB). In order to examine whether or not the galactosylation changes in SH-SY5Y cells by the transfection of the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA, lectin blot analysis was performed using HRP-conjugated RCA-I and L-PHA. The filters were initially subjected to mild acid treatment to remove sialic acids prior to incubation with lectins. When the filters were incubated with RCA-I, which interacts with oligosaccharides terminating with the Galβ1→4GlcNAc group (27Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9795-9799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a remarkable decrease in the lectin binding was observed for 80,000–100,000, 120,000–140,000, 150,000, and 200,000 protein bands in the cells transfected with the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA (lane b of Fig. 1, RCA-I) when compared with the control cells (lane a of Fig. 1, RCA-I). Similarly, a significant decrease of the binding with L-PHA, which interacts with highly branched N-glycans with the Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2)Man branch (12Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11230-11234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was detected in the same protein bands as described above by the antisense β-1,4-GalT V cDNA transfection (lane b of Fig. 1, L-PHA) when compared with the control cells (lane a of Fig. 1, L-PHA). The lectin-reactive bands disappeared upon treatment of the filters with N-glycanase (data not shown). These results indicate that the β-1,4-GalT V is involved in the expression of highly branched N-glycans and that the suppression of the β-1,4-GalT V gene by the transfection of the antisense cDNA decreases the galactosylation of the highly branched N-glycans, which leads to the reduced binding to L-PHA. Similar results were obtained in other cancer cell lines including SW480 cells (18Guo S. Sato T. Shirane K. Furukawa K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and A549 cells. 2T. Sato and K. Furukawa, unpublished data. Therefore, the β-1,4-GalT V is considered to be very important in cancer cells for expressing the highly branched N-glycans that are involved in abnormal cell growth and metastasis (11Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Isolation of the 5′-Promoter Region of Human β-1,4-GalT V Gene—We identified in the GenBank™ a human genomic clone (RP5-1063B2) derived from 20q13.1–13.2 containing the human β-1,4-GalT V cDNA sequence reported by us (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank, accession number AB004550). The genomic sequence completely matched the coding region, +114/+1,167, relative to the initiation codon of the β-1,4-GalT V gene reported, but lacked the 5′-flanking region and the coding region upstream from +113. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of the β-1,4-GalT V gene, a human placenta λ genomic library was screened by the plaque hybridization method using the 480-bp fragment containing the initiation codon of the β-1,4-GalT V cDNA as a probe, and 10 genomic clones were obtained. In order to identify the genomic clones that contained the 5′-promoter region, Southern blot analysis was performed"
https://openalex.org/W2131680033,"The multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines NCI/AdRRES and MES-SA/DX-5 have higher glycolipid levels and higher P-glycoprotein expression than the chemosensitive cell lines MCF7-wt and MES-SA. Inhibiting glycolipid biosynthesis by blocking glucosylceramide synthase has been proposed to reverse drug resistance in MDR cells by causing an increased accumulation of proapoptotic ceramide during treatment of cells with cytotoxic drugs. We treated both multidrug-resistant cell lines with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors PDMP (d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol), C9DGJ (N-nonyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin) or C4DGJ (N-butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin). PDMP achieved a significant reversal of drug resistance in agreement with previous reports. However, the N-alkylated iminosugars C9DGJ and C4DGJ, which are more selective glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors than PDMP, failed to cause any reversal of drug resistance despite depleting glycolipids to the same extent as PDMP. Our results suggest that (a) inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase does not reverse multidrug resistance and (b) the chemosensitization achieved by PDMP cannot be caused by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase alone."
https://openalex.org/W2123840180,"Transfer of bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei variant 221a from calf serum to dog serum-based medium induces acute iron starvation, as the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) of variant 221a binds dog Tf poorly. We show here that transfer to dog serum induces a 3–5-fold increase in Tf-R mRNA and protein within one doubling time (8 h). Because iron stores are still high 8 h after transfer, we infer that the signal for Tf-R overproduction is the decreased availability of cytosolic iron when cellular iron import drops. Up to 30% of the extra Tf-R spills out of the flagellar pocket onto the pellicular surface. Because the 5-fold increase in Tf-R is accompanied by a 5-fold increase in bovine Tf uptake, the up-regulation of Tf-R levels in response to Tf starvation helps the trypanosome to compete for limiting amounts of Tf. We noted that Tf-R levels also vary in calf serum medium. Cells in dense cultures contain up to 5-fold more Tf-R mRNA and protein than in dilute cultures. Only onetenth of the extra Tf-R reaches the pellicular surface. The increase cannot be explained by a lack of Tf or to cell density sensing but is due to pericellular hypoxia. Our results show that bloodstream-form trypanosomes can regulate the expression of the two Tf-R subunit genes and the localization of their gene products in a flexible manner. This flexibility is made possible by the promoter-proximal position of the two genes in the variant surface glycoprotein expression site."
https://openalex.org/W1984112998,"Irofulven (6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene, HMAF, MGI 114) is one of a new class of anticancer agents that are semisynthetic derivatives of the mushroom toxin illudin S. Preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that irofulven is effective against several tumor types. Mechanisms of action studies indicate that irofulven induces DNA damage, MAPK activation, and apoptosis. In this study we found that in ovarian cancer cells, CHK2 kinase is activated by irofulven while CHK1 kinase is not activated even when treated at higher concentrations of the drug. By using GM00847 human fibroblast expressing tetracycline-controlled, FLAG-tagged kinase-dead ATR (ATR.kd), it was demonstrated that ATR kinase does not play a major role in irofulven-induced CHK2 activation. Results from human fibroblasts proficient or deficient in ATM function (GM00637 and GM05849) indicated that CHK2 activation by irofulven is mediated by the upstream ATM kinase. Phosphorylation of ATM on Ser1981, which is critical for kinase activation, was observed in ovarian cancer cell lines treated with irofulven. RNA interference results confirmed that CHK2 activation was inhibited after introducing siRNA for ATM. Finally, experiments done with human colon cancer cell line HCT116 and its isogenic CHK2 knockout derivative; and experiments done by expressing kinase-dead CHK2 in an ovarian cancer cell line demonstrated that CHK2 activation contributes to irofulven-induced S phase arrest. In addition, it was shown that NBS1, SMC1, and p53 were phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner, and p53 phosphorylation on serine 20 is dependent on CHK2 after irofulven treatment. In summary, we found that the anticancer agent, irofulven, activates the ATM-CHK2 DNA damage-signaling pathway, and CHK2 activation contributes to S phase cell cycle arrest induced by irofulven. Irofulven (6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene, HMAF, MGI 114) is one of a new class of anticancer agents that are semisynthetic derivatives of the mushroom toxin illudin S. Preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that irofulven is effective against several tumor types. Mechanisms of action studies indicate that irofulven induces DNA damage, MAPK activation, and apoptosis. In this study we found that in ovarian cancer cells, CHK2 kinase is activated by irofulven while CHK1 kinase is not activated even when treated at higher concentrations of the drug. By using GM00847 human fibroblast expressing tetracycline-controlled, FLAG-tagged kinase-dead ATR (ATR.kd), it was demonstrated that ATR kinase does not play a major role in irofulven-induced CHK2 activation.

Studies of mechanisms of irofulven action suggest that it induces DNA damage, MAP kinase activation and apoptosis (18Kelner M.J. McMorris T.C. Beck W.T. Zamora J.M. Taetle R.

It is also suggested that irofulven-elicited DNA lesions are mainly repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (21Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Kelner M.J. Ng J.M. Yamashita Y.M. Takeda S. McMorris T.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, the cell evokes signal transduction pathways to arrest at G1/S, S, or G2/M checkpoints, allowing time to deal with the insult (22Sherr C.J.

It has been well documented that DNA damage activates ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated), and/or ATR (ATM-RAD3-related) kinases, two apical protein kinases of the DNA damage response pathways. ATM and ATR phosphorylate downstream effector kinases, CHK1 and CHK2. It is generally believed that ATM is the kinase mainly responding to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double strand breaks, while ATR responds to the formation of DNA adducts and stalled replication induced by UV, genotoxic drugs, and radiation (23Zhou B.B.

However, controversy exists regarding the role of CHK2 in cell cycle regulation and p53 phosphorylation.

In this study, we found that the anticancer agent, irofulven, activates ATM-CHK2 DNA damage-signaling pathway, and activates NBS1, SMC1, and p53 in an ATM-dependent manner. Irofulven also induces CHK2-dependent p53 phosphorylation on Ser20. This CHK2 activation contributes to irofulven-induced S phase arrest.

The SV40-transformed human normal fibroblast GM00637, the AT (ataxia telangiectasia) fibroblast GM05849 and its parental non-transformed AT fibroblast GM05823 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) were grown in DMEM. The ATM-complemented AT fibroblast (AT22IJE-T-pEBS7-YZ5, generously provided by Prof. Yosef Shiloh, Tel Aviv University, Israel) (80Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). GM00847 human fibroblast-expressing tetracycline-controlled, FLAG-tagged kinase-dead ATR (ATR.kd) (81Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H.

Schreiber and Shlomo Handeli of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 400 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). For ATR.kd induction, cells were treated with 1.5 μg/ml of doxycycline (Sigma) for 48 h. For UV treatment in control experiments, cells were treated with 50 J/m2 of UV light in Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) followed by one additional hour of incubation. To inhibit CDC25A degradation, proteasome inhibitor LLnL (N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al) (Sigma) (50 μm) were added to cells 30 min before irofulven treatment. Colonogenic Survival Assay—The IC50 concentration of irofulven in ovarian cancer cell lines and the colon cancer cell line HCT116 was determined by colonogenic survival assay. Cells were plated in 6-well plates overnight in complete medium. Cells were treated with different concentrations of irofulven for 1 h. Medium was then replaced with fresh drug-free medium and incubated for 7–10 days. Colonies were stained with PBS containing 0.04% crystal violet and 0.5% paraform-aldehyde for about 10 min. Staining liquid was aspirated and colonies counted. Western Blotting—Western blot was performed as described previously (20Wang W. Waters S.J. MacDonald J.R. Roth C. Shentu S. Freeman J. Von Hoff D.D. Miller A.R. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 559-564PubMed Google Scholar).

Total cellular protein (40 μg) was electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot protein detection was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Monoclonal antibodies against actin and FLAG were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against PARP and polyclonal antibodies against ATR, SMC1, NBS1, CDC25A, p53, and phosphorylated p53 on Ser15 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

BrdU Pulse Labeling and Flow Cytometry—Cells were prelabeled with 10 μm BrdU (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h before treatment with irofulven for 1 h. After drug removal, cells were incubated in drug-free medium and harvested by trypsinization at different time points. Cells were washed once with cold PBS and fixed in 75% ethanol/PBS. Cells were then washed with 1% BSA/PBS and resuspended in 2 n HCl/0.5% Triton X-100. After incubating for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with 1% BSA/PBS and resuspended in 0.2 ml of 1% BSA/PBS. Anti-BrdU antibody (20 μl) (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was added to each cell suspension. After incubating in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, 20 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distributions among BrdU-positive cells were analyzed by ModFit v3.0 software (Verity, Topsham, ME). RNA Interference—The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for small interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized and annealed by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of two double-stranded siRNAs for ATM are CATCTAGATCGGCATTCAG and TGGTGCTATTTACGGAGCT. The siRNA sequence for bacterial green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene is TGGAAGCGTTCAACTAGCA. A2780 cells were transfected twice within a 24-h period starting at 40% confluence with 100 nm final concentrations of siRNAs for ATM (two ATM siRNAs were pooled) and GFP using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with irofulven for 1 h, washed, and incubated in drug-free media, and harvested 12 h later. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blot as described above. Transfection of Kinase-dead CHK2 and Flow Cytometry—Ovarian cancer cell line CAOV3 was transfected twice within a 24-h period with vector or HA-tagged kinase-dead CHK2 (82Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. Jann Sarkaria of the Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with irofulven for 1 h, washed, and incubated in drug-free media, and harvested 12 h later. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol. After washing twice with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS on ice for 15 min, then washed with 1% BSA/PBS, and the cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of 1% BSA/PBS containing 1 μg of FITC-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml of propidium iodide and 20 μg/ml of RNase A. Cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and cell cycle distributions for propidium iodide and FITC-positive cells were analyzed by ModFit v3.0 software (Verity, Topsham, ME). Irofulven Activates CHK2 Kinase in Ovarian Cancer Cells—To assess irofulven cytotoxicity, ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with different concentrations of irofulven for 1 h, then the drug was removed, and colonogenic formation assays were performed. The IC50 concentrations obtained for ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, A2780/CP70, CAOV3, SKOV3, and OVCAR3) ranged from 0.7 to 2.3 μm. In response to DNA damage, CHK2 kinase is phosphorylated at Thr68, which is critical for CHK2 activation (42Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2014479690,"The nucleotide substrate specificity of yeast poly(A) polymerase (yPAP) toward various C-2- and C-8-modified ATP analogs was examined. 32P-Radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide primers were incubated with yPAP in the absence of ATP to assay polyadenylation using unnatural ATP substrates. The C-2-modified ATP analogs 2-amino-ATP and 2-chloro (Cl)-ATP were excellent substrates for yPAP. 8-Amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP all produced chain termination of polyadenylation, and no primer extension was observed with the C-8-halogenated derivatives 8-Br-ATP and 8-Cl-ATP. The effects of modified ATP analogs on ATP-dependent poly(A) tail synthesis by yPAP were also examined. Whereas C-2 substitution (2-amino-ATP and 2-Cl-ATP) had little effect on poly(A) tail length, C-8 substitution produced moderate (8-amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP) to substantial (8-Br-ATP and 8-Cl-ATP) reduction in poly(A) tail length. To model the biochemical consequences of 8-Cl-Ado incorporation into RNA primers, a synthetic RNA primer containing a 3′-terminal 8-Cl-AMP residue was prepared. Polyadenylation of this modified RNA primer by yPAP in the presence of ATP was blocked completely. To probe potential mechanisms of inhibition, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy experiments were used to examine the conformation of two C-8-modified AMP nucleotides, 8-Cl-AMP and 8-amino-AMP. C-8 substitution in adenosine analogs shifted the ribose sugar pucker equilibrium to favor the DNA-like C-2′-endo form over the C-3′-endo (RNA-like) conformation, which suggests a potential mechanism for polyadenylation inhibition and chain termination.

Modified nucleoside analogs have been used extensively as chemotherapeutic agents (1Plunkett W. Gandhi V. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1996; 38: S67-S74PubMed Google Scholar). These analogs of cellular nucleosides are based on structural alterations of the ribose sugar ring, as with 3′-azido-3′-deoxyazidothymidine (2Mitsuya H. Yarchoan R. Broder S. Science. 1990; 249: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and acyclovir (3Elion G.B. Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. De Miranda P. Beauchamp L. Schaeffer H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5716-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar), or modifications of the purine or pyrimidine base, such as fludarabine (9-β-d-ribofuranosyl-(2-fluoroadenine) monophosphate) (4Gandhi V. Kemena A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1993; 10: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (5Hentosh P. McCastlain J.C. Blakley R.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nucleoside antimetabolites typically are taken up by cells, metabolized, and subsequently enter cellular nucleotide pools, where they exert their chemotherapeutic action. In particular, modified purine analogs have demonstrated promise for cancer treatment. Our biochemical studies have centered on two C-8-modified adenosine analogs, 8-chloroadenosine (8-Cl-Ado) 1The abbreviations used are: Cl, chloro; Ara-ATP, 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine 5′-triphosphate; yPAP, yeast poly(A) polymerase; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Br, bromo; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′′-tetramethylethylenediamine; dPAGE, denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DQF-COSY, double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy. and 8-aminoadenosine (8-amino-Ado), which have demonstrated antineoplastic activity (6Gandhi V. Ayres M. Halgren R.G. Krett N.L. Newman R.A. Rosen S.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5474-5479PubMed Google Scholar, 7Halgren R.G. Traynor A.E. Pillay S. Zell J.L. Heller K.F. Krett N.L. Rosen S.T. Blood. 1998; 92: 2893-2898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are under investigation for application to multiple myeloma and leukemia treatments. 8-Cl-Ado and 8-amino-Ado recently have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines in culture (6Gandhi V. Ayres M. Halgren R.G. Krett N.L. Newman R.A. Rosen S.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5474-5479PubMed Google Scholar, 7Halgren R.G. Traynor A.E. Pillay S. Zell J.L. Heller K.F. Krett N.L. Rosen S.T.

Analysis of the cellular metabolism of 8-Cl-Ado and 8-amino-Ado revealed that treated cells rapidly accumulate the 5′-phosphorylated derivatives, 8-Cl-ATP and 8-amino-ATP, respectively, which appear to be the cytotoxic agents (6Gandhi V. Ayres M. Halgren R.G. Krett N.L. Newman R.A. Rosen S.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5474-5479PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gandhi V. Chen W. Ayres M. Rhie J.K. Madden T.L. Newman R.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 50: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2N. L. Krett, K. M. Davies, M. Ayres, C. Ma, C. Nabhan, V. Gandhi, and S. T. Rosen, submitted for publication. In both cases, a concurrent decrease in endogenous ATP is observed. Further analysis of 8-Cl-Ado cellular metabolism indicated that the effects of 8-Cl-Ado appear to be RNA-directed; treated cells exhibit decreased total cellular RNA levels and show 8-Cl-AMP incorporation into RNA (10Stellrecht C.M. Rodriguez C.J. Ayres M. Gandhi V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7968-7974PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis induction by C-8-modified adenosine analogs may arise from parallel changes in cellular biochemistry, including alteration of cellular ATP levels and interference with biosynthetic pathways. Incorporation of C-8-modified analogs into RNA polymers may inhibit enzymatic chain extension during transcription or polyadenylation and/or block subsequent RNA processing and transport. We previously showed that 8-Cl-Ado incorporation into RNA duplexes leads to a decrease in RNA duplex stability of ∼5 kcal/mol/8-Cl-Ado modification, despite the preference of 8-Cl-Ado to maintain base pairing affinity for uracil over other nucleobases (11Chen L.S. Sheppard T.L. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2002; 21: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The corresponding deoxynucleoside analog, 8-Cl-dAdo, also maintains standard base pairing during enzymatic DNA synthesis by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (12Chen L.S. Bahr M.H. Sheppard T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of DNA synthesis is diminished when 8-Cl-dAdo serves as a template base or is incorporated as an incoming nucleotide (12Chen L.S. Bahr M.H. Sheppard T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that 8-Cl-Ado metabolites may display potent effects on the synthesis and stability of cellular nucleic acids. Given the RNA-directed nature of 8-Cl-Ado action, our research efforts have been focused on the biochemical effects of 8-modified adenosine analogs on RNA synthesis and processing. Treatment of multiple myeloma cells with 8-Cl-Ado results in a rapid reduction in total RNA levels. Because cellular RNA levels result from a balance of biosynthesis and RNA degradation, 8-modified adenosine analogs may exert their effects by inhibition of transcription as well as acceleration of RNA degradation. Although previous studies have shown transcriptional incorporation of 8-modified adenosine derivatives into RNA polymers (10Stellrecht C.M. Rodriguez C.J. Ayres M. Gandhi V. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7968-7974PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that 8-Cl-AMP incorporation may affect downstream RNA processing or transport steps required for mRNA maturation. Furthermore, because of their structural similarities to ATP, the analogs may inhibit the activities of other ATP-dependent RNA polymerases, such as poly(A) polymerase. Interference with RNA processing provides a potential mechanism to enhance the degradation of RNA transcripts and may explain the phenotype of cells treated with C-8-modified adenosine analogs. Inhibition of cleavage and polyadenylation events may be a potential mechanism for the observed decrease in cellular RNA levels following 8-Cl-Ado and 8-amino-Ado treatment. Processing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA involves three major steps: 5′-end methylguanosine capping, 3′-end cleavage and polyadenylation, and intron splicing (13Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage and polyadenylation in vivo are a tightly regulated process coupled to transcription (14Birse C.E. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lee B.A. Keller W. Proudfoot N.J. Science. 1998; 280: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), involving numerous protein complexes (15Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 16Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA poly(A) tail length has been shown to regulate RNA stability (17Wahle E. Ruegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, polyadenylation inhibition may contribute to the decreased RNA levels observed upon treatment of cells with 8-Cl-Ado. In addition to increased RNA degradation, the consequences of polyadenylation inhibition in eukaryotic systems include impaired mRNA transport from the nucleus and altered translation efficiency (18Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Known RNA processing inhibitors include other ATP analogs, such as cordycepin triphosphate (3′-dATP), an inhibitor of transcription and polyadenylation (19Darnell J.E. Philipson L. Wall R. Adesnik M. Science. 1971; 174: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 20Rose K.M. Bell L.E. Jacob S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 475: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and Ara-ATP, an inhibitor of cleavage and polyadenylation (21Rose K.M. Jacob S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1418-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Rose K.M. Leonard T.B. Carter T.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 23Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5871-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays using poly(A) polymerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yPAP) frequently have served as a biochemical model system for polyadenylation in cells (24Haff L.A. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1838-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies examined the substrate specificity of several ribonucleotide, deoxyribonucleotide, and dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphate analogs (25Martin G. Keller W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 226-230PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zaug A.J. Lingner J. Cech T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 532-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with purified yPAP. However, the inhibitory properties of C-8-modified adenosine triphosphates were not evaluated. Thus, assays of C-8-modified ATP analogs in polyadenylation reactions may provide insight into the mechanism of cellular RNA depletion in cells treated with C-8-modified purine nucleoside analogs. Furthermore, if these analogs demonstrate selective inhibition of polyadenylation enzymes, they may be useful reagents for dissecting biochemical steps in polyadenylation pathways in cells. In the studies described herein, we examined the substrate specificity of yPAP for modified ATP derivatives that may be useful for treatment of hematological malignancies. We chose yPAP as a cell-free polyadenylation model system to provide an initial evaluation of the effects of C-8-modified ATP analogs on RNA polyadenylation. First, we assessed the inhibitory effects of various modifications at C-8 of ATP and compared them with analogous modifications at the C-2 site of the base. Modified ATP analogs were also assayed as substrate analogs and as potential inhibitors of polyadenylation in the presence of ATP. We observed that C-2-modified ATP analogs are substrates for yPAP and that C-8-modified ATP analogs are chain terminators and/or inhibitors of polyadenylation. Polyadenylation of an 8-Cl-Ado-modified RNA primer was also examined, and 3′-terminal 8-Cl-AMP residues abrogated polyadenylation by yPAP in the presence of ATP. Polyadenylation inhibition by 8-modified adenosine analogs may be due to a conformational change imposed by C-8 substitution. The conformations of C-8-modified AMP analogs were examined using NMR spectroscopy as models of the chain-terminated 3′-ends of pre-mRNA. Our model studies suggest that C-8 substitution shifts the sugar pucker equilibrium in aqueous solution to favor the DNA-like C-2′-endo form over the RNA-like C-3′-endo conformer. Perturbation of the ribose ring conformation may alter the substrate efficiency of modified ATP analogs with yPAP and the structure of the 3′-end of pre-mRNA substrates. Furthermore, C-8-modified ATP analogs, which inhibit poly(A) polymerase via several mechanisms, may be useful for the dissection of individual biochemical steps in polyadenylation pathways. Materials—All reactions were performed in oven-dried (140 °C) glassware using anhydrous Aldrich Sure-Seal™ solvents and N2 as an inert atmosphere. Unless otherwise noted, reagents were obtained from Aldrich and used without further purification. Tributylamine was freshly distilled and stored over 4-Å molecular sieves. DEAE-Sephadex A-25 resin (chloride counterion) was used for ion exchange chromatography. The resins were soaked in 1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) and then swelled in deionized water prior to use. 31P NMR data were recorded at 162 MHz on a Varian 400 spectrometer and referenced to an external standard of 85% aqueous phosphoric acid. RNA oligonucleotides were analyzed by RP-HPLC with a Waters Prep 600 HPLC using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.2). RNA oligonucleotides were characterized using a Voyager-DE™ PRO Biospectrometry™ workstation MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). An N2 laser was used (337-nm wavelength, 3-ns pulse), and spectra were acquired in the linear positive or negative ion mode, averaging 128 shots. A MALDI-TOF-MS matrix was prepared by combining an 8:1 ratio of 0.2 m 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone in 50% CH3CN/H2O and 0.3 m ammonium citrate (H2O). (dT)10 and (dT)18 sequences (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used as internal standards for calibration of molecular masses in MALDI-TOF-MS experiments. Samples were prepared using a Millipore C-18 ZipTip™ to remove excess salts. T4 polynucleotide kinase (30 units/μl) and yPAP (600 and 815 units/μl) were purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. Enzyme concentrations of yPAP for polyadenylation assays (reported in units/μl of reaction total volume in the protocols below) corresponded to 10–16 nm for each experiment. A 10-bp DNA ladder was obtained from Invitrogen. NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN. Radioactive bands on polyacrylamide gels were visualized using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager and analyzed using Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant software. ATP Derivatives—ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and 2-Cl-ATP was obtained from Ambion Inc. 2-Amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies, and 8-Br-ATP was obtained from Sigma. 8-Cl-Ado (see Scheme 1, 1) was synthesized as described (11Chen L.S. Sheppard T.L. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2002; 21: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and 8-amino-Ado (2) was synthesized from 8-bromoadenosine (27Holmes R.E. Robins R.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 1772-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). 8-Cl-AMP (3) and 8-Amino-AMP (5)—To a stirred solution of 1 (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol) or pink emulsion of 2 (0.028 g, 0.10 mmol), dissolved in 0.25 ml of trimethyl phosphate, was added phosphorus oxychloride (0.018 ml, 0.2 mmol) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h and then quenched with 2 ml of 1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified by DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography (0–1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate), lyophilized, and dissolved in 2 ml of methanol. A 1.0 m NaI solution in acetone (5 ml) was added; the resulting slurry was centrifuged; and the supernatant was removed. The precipitate was rinsed with acetone (2 × 5 ml) by centrifugation, and the solvent was removed to give 0.032 g of white powder (3, 78%) or 0.011 g of pale pink powder (5, 14%). 3: 31P NMR (D2O); δ 2.78; ESI-MS, calculated [M]– = 380.0 and found [M]– = 380.1. 5: 31P NMR (D2O); δ 0.64; ESI-MS, calculated [M]– = 361.1 and found [M]– = 361.1. 8-Cl-ATP (4) and 8-Amino-ATP (6)—To a stirred solution of 1 (0.030 g, 0.10 mmol) or pink emulsion of 2 (0.028 g, 0.10 mmol), dissolved in 0.25 ml of trimethyl phosphate, was added phosphorus oxychloride (0.018 ml, 0.2 mmol) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, and then 0.1 ml of tributylamine and a solution of ammonium pyrophosphate (0.228 g, 0.50 mmol) in 1 ml of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 5 min, quenched with 5 ml of 1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified by DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography (0–1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate), lyophilized, and dissolved in 2 ml of methanol. A 1.0 m NaI solution in acetone (5 ml) was added; the resulting slurry was centrifuged; and the supernatant was removed. The white precipitate was rinsed with acetone (2 × 5 ml) by centrifugation, and the solvent was removed to give 0.053 g of white powder (4, 90%) or 0.007 g of pale pink powder (6, 13%). 4: 31P NMR (D2O); δ –7.50, –10.17, and –21.50; ESI-MS, calculated [M]– = 540.0 and found [M]– = 540.0. 6: 31P NMR (D2O); δ –4.93, –10.56, and –20.34; ESI-MS, calculated [M]– = 521.2 and found [M]– = 521.1. RNA Oligonucleotides—RNA primer 5′-UGUGCCCGA-3′ (7) was purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. and was deprotected at 37 °C for 30 min with 400 μl of 100 mm acetic acid, adjusted to pH 3.8 with TEMED. The purity was verified by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS (calculated [M]+ = 2832.8 and found [M]+ = 2829.7), and the oligonucleotide was used without further purification. Oligonucleotide 5′-UGUGCCCGACl-3′ (8) was synthesized using an 8-Cl-Ado-derivatized Controlled-Pore Glass support as described previously (11Chen L.S. Sheppard T.L. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2002; 21: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), purified by RP-HPLC, and characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS (calculated [M]– = 2865.2 and found [M]– = 2865.6). Preparation of 5′-32P-Radiolabeled Oligonucleotides—RNA oligonucleotide 7 or 8 (20 pmol) was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with 10.5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 24 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (8.4 Ci/μl, 7000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was quenched with 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA, and the labeled DNA was purified by 7 m -20% dPAGE with 89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, and 1mm EDTA as the running buffer. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was visualized by autoradiography, excised, and eluted by soaking the gel piece in 100 μl of buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA) at 25 °C for 12 h. The eluted product was purified using a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column and stored in double-distilled H2O. yPAP Substrate Specificity Assays—Radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide 7 was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a solution containing yPAP and a single modified nucleoside triphosphate in the absence of ATP. The extension reactions were analyzed by 7 m-20% dPAGE. Final extension conditions were as follows: 100 μm NTP, 200 nm primer 7, 1.25 units/μl yPAP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. The triphosphates assayed were ATP, 3′-dATP, 2-Cl-ATP, 2-amino-ATP, 8-Br-ATP, 8-Cl-ATP, 8-amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP. Isolation and Characterization of Chain Termination Products— RNA primer 7 was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a solution containing 15 μm primer 7, 1.0 mm 3′-dATP or 1.15 mm 8-amino-ATP, 4 units/μl yPAP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. To remove proteins from the reaction mixture, the reactions were extracted with 20 μl of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (pH 8.0). The phenol layers were back-extracted with 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), and the combined aqueous layers were extracted with 40 μl of 24:1 chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to remove residual phenol. The products were analyzed by RP-HPLC using a Waters XTerra™ RP18 column (C-18, 3.5 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm) and a 5–10% CH3CN gradient in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.2) for 40 min. Unmodified 7 eluted at tR = 16 min, and products from both 3′-dATP and 8-amino-ATP extension reactions eluted at tR = 22 min. The products were frozen, lyophilized, and desalted using a C-18 ZipTip™. MALDI-TOF-MS (m/z): 3′-dAMP termination product (5′-UGUGCCCGAdA-3′), calculated [M]+ = 3145.0 and found [M]+ = 3144.5; 8-amino-AMP termination product (5′-UGUGCCCGAANH2-3′), calculated [M]+ = 3177.0 and found [M]+ = 3177.8. Evaluation of Kinetic Parameters (Km) for ATP Analogs 3′-dATP and 8-Amino-ATP—Radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide 7 (200 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min using single hit completed conditions (28Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 4–50 μm 3′-dATP or 1–100 μm 8-amino-ATP, 1.1 units/μl yPAP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of analog triphosphate. Aliquots were removed during the reaction, and the extension reactions were terminated by adding 1 volume of 2× gel loading buffer (20% (w/v) sucrose, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF, 0.1% SDS, 16 m urea, 89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, and 1 mm EDTA). Each reaction was analyzed by 7 m-20% dPAGE. The ratio of terminated product to unextended primer was determined from the relative band intensities of the imaged gel. Extension data were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots, and the observed kinetic parameters were extracted using linear regression analysis of the plots. Data were also analyzed by fitting the Michaelis-Menten expression, which gave Km values within 20% of the Lineweaver-Burk values. Polyadenylation Inhibition Assays with 8-Halogenated ATP—Radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide 7 (200 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a solution containing 1.1 units/μl yPAP, 100 μm ATP, 25–100 μm 8-Br-ATP or 8-Cl-ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. The extension reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 volume of 2× gel loading buffer, and the products were analyzed by 7 m-20% dPAGE. Polyadenylation Inhibition Assays with Unnatural Triphosphates and ATP—Radiolabeled RNA oligonucleotide 7 (200 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a solution containing 100 μm ATP, 50–100 μm NTP, 1.1 units/μl yPAP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. The triphosphates assayed were ATP, 3′-dATP, 2-Cl-ATP, 2-amino-ATP, 8-Cl-ATP, 8-amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP. The extension reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 volume of 2× gel loading buffer, and the products were analyzed by 7 m-20% dPAGE. Polyadenylation of 3′-Terminated 8-Cl-AMP Primer 8—Radiolabeled RNA primer 8 (200 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a solution containing 1.25 units/μl yPAP, 200 μm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml acetylated BSA, and 10% glycerol. Aliquots were removed at 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, and the products were analyzed by 7 m-20% dPAGE. As a control, primer 7 was assayed under the same conditions. NMR Conformational Analysis of Phosphorylated AMP Derivatives— AMP and AMP derivatives were dissolved in D2O (99.96 atom % D) and lyophilized three times. The samples were redissolved in 0.4–0.8 ml of D2O (99.96 atom % D), with a final sample concentration from 0.5 and 1.0 mm, then transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. NMR data were acquired on an Varian spectrometer operating at a frequency of 600 MHz and a probe temperature of 298 K. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and DQF-COSY data were acquired in phase-sensitive mode. The digital resolution of the processed DQF-COSY spectrum was 2.34 and 15 Hz/point in the w2 and w1 dimensions, respectively. The 3JH-1′,H-2′ coupling constants were obtained from the splitting observed in the DQF-COSY cross-peaks in the w2 dimension. The fractional populations of the C-2′-endo conformation were obtained using the formula [C-2′-endo] = 3JH-1′,H-2′/(JH-1′,H-2′ + 3JH-3′,H-4′), where the value of 3J3H-1′,H-2′ + 3JH-3′,H-4′ is assumed to be equal to 10 Hz (29Altona C. Sundaralingam M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 2333-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 5′-Phosphorylated 8-Modified Derivatives—The AMP and ATP derivatives 8-Cl-AMP (3) and 8-Cl-ATP (4) and 8-amino-AMP (5) and 8-amino-ATP (6) were synthesized from 8-Cl-Ado and 8-amino-Ado, respectively (30Ludwig J. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1981; 16: 131-133PubMed Google Scholar). Triphosphate derivatives 4 and 6 were synthesized in a one-pot reaction using phosphorus oxychloride and tributylammonium pyrophosphate as shown in Scheme 1. The triphosphate analogs were converted into sodium salts and isolated by RP-HPLC. Poly(A) Polymerase Nucleotide Specificity—To assess the substrate specificity of yPAP, a number of C-2-modified (2-Cl-ATP and 2-amino-ATP) and C-8-modified (8-Br-ATP, 8-Cl-ATP, 8-amino-ATP, 8-azido-ATP, and 8-aza-ATP) analogs were assayed with yPAP under standard conditions (24Haff L.A. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1838-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer extensions with yPAP were conducted using a synthetic RNA primer (5′-UGUGCCCGA-3′, 7) in reactions containing 200 nm primer 7 and 100 μm each ATP analog in the absence of ATP. A known yPAP chain terminator, 3′-dATP, was used as a positive control (31Lingner J. Keller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2917-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The extension reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then analyzed by 20% dPAGE as shown in Fig. 1. Polyadenylation in the presence of the natural substrate ATP produced a poly(A) tail several hundred nucleotides in length (Fig. 1, lane 3). Incubation with 3′-dATP, a known polyadenylation inhibitor, produced a single extension product (Fig. 1, lane 4), consistent with chain termination. Primer extension reactions with C-2- and C-8-modified nucleotides exhibited trends that could be grouped based on the type of modification. Incubation of yPAP with both C-2-modified ATP analogs produced polyadenylated product beyond a single AMP insertion (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Polyadenylation with 2-amino-ATP proceeded as efficiently as with ATP, producing a poly(A) tail several hundred nucleotides in length (Fig. 1, lane 6). Polyadenylated product was observed with 2-Cl-ATP, with, however, a decreased efficiency relative to ATP and 2-amino-ATP (Fig. 1, lane 5). yPAP was unable to processively synthesize poly(A) tails using C-8-modified ATP analogs, in contrast to C-2-modified ATP analogs.

Here we use a biological model in which HOXB6 represses α- and γ-globin mRNA levels to perform a structure/function analysis for this homeodomain protein. HOXB6 protein represses globin transcript levels in stably transfected K562 cells in a DNA-binding dependent fashion. However, the capacity to form cooperative DNA-binding complexes with the PBX co-factor protein is not required for HOXB6 biological activity. Neither the conserved extreme N-terminal region, a polyglutamic acid region at the protein C terminus, nor the Ser214 CKII phosphorylation site was required for DNA binding or activity in this model. We have previously reported that HOX proteins can inhibit CREB-binding protein (CBP)-histone acetyltransferase-mediated potentiation of reporter gene transcription. We now show that endogenous CBP is co-precipitated with exogenous HOXB6 from nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of transfected K562 cells. Furthermore, endogenous CBP co-precipitates with endogenous HOXB6 in day 14.5 murine fetal liver cells during active globin gene expression in this tissue. The CBP interaction motif was localized to the homeodomain but does not require the highly conserved helix 3.

Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). In addition, HOX genes are expressed in blood cells in lineage-specific patterns (2Kongsuwan K. Webb E. Housiaux P.

Largman C. Lawrence H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We cloned two alternatively spliced HOXB6 cDNAs from HEL cells, a human leukemic cell line with erythroid/myeloid bipotential differentiation capacity (3Shen W.-F. Largman C. Lowney P. Corral J.

Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a previous study, enforced expression of one of these cDNAs that encoded a 224-amino acid, HD-containing HOXB6 protein repressed the erythroid phenotype in human leukemic cells, as reflected by the loss of α-, β-, and γ-globin gene expression; loss of erythroid surface markers; and down-regulation of heme synthesis (6Shen W.-F. Detmer K. Mathews C.H.E. Hack F.M. Morgan D.A. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it has proven difficult to describe a precise biochemical mechanism of action to account for these effects. Similarly, despite genetic studies showing that HOX genes influence the expression of downstream targets, the efforts of numerous investigators have yielded few mechanistic details to explain the action of HOX proteins. Although they are thought to function as transcription factors, most full-length HOX proteins, including HOXB6, bind only weakly by themselves to DNA targets containing a TAAT sequence (7Catron K.M.

Several laboratories demonstrated that HOX proteins exhibited weak activation or repression on reporter genes containing either TAAT multimers (reviewed in Ref. 10Graba Y. Aragnol D. Pradel J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or HOX gene auto-regulatory elements containing TAAT sequences (11Zappavigna V. Renucci A. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Urier G.

However, in our own studies, HOXB6 and other HOX proteins did not produce changes in transient reporter gene assays using either synthetic TAAT multimers or putative gene regulatory regions (13Shen W.-F. Krishnan K. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7509-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We and others demonstrated that HOX proteins gain both DNA binding avidity (9Shen W.-F. Chang C.-P. Rozenfeld S. Sauvageau G. Humphries R.K. Lu M. Lawrence H.J. Cleary M.L. Largman C.

For the HOX proteins from paralog groups 1-8, binding as heterodimers with PBX was far stronger than binding as monomers to TAAT sites (9Shen W.-F. Chang C.-P. Rozenfeld S. Sauvageau G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transgenic reporter studies demonstrated the importance of consensus PBX-HOX sites within auto- or cross-regulatory regions of HOX genes (16Popperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.-K. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Mann R.S. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Gould A. Morrison A. Sproat G. White R.A. Krumlauf R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 900-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, except for the auto-regulatory sites, few mammalian gene targets have been identified that contain PBX-HOX sites, and no direct gene targets of any type have been reported for HOXB6. Indeed, reports that other HOX proteins activate important genes, including p21 (18Bromleigh V.C. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), β-fibroblast growth factor (19Care A. Silvani A. Meccia E. Mattia G. Stoppacciaro A. Parmiani G. Peschle C. Colombo M.P.

Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) all relied on computerized identification of TAAT sequences as putative binding sites. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the Drosophila DFD protein (HOXB4 homolog) directly activates the apoptosis protein reaper (22Lohmann I. McGinnis N. Bodmer M. McGinnis W. Cell. 2002; 110: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the putative DFD-binding sites do not contain PBX/EXD consensus motif, adding further confusion regarding whether PBX-HOX sequences are the biologically relevant regulatory binding sites. These studies, showing HOX proteins as activators, contrast to a large body of data suggesting that these proteins function as genetic repressors (8Schnabel C. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2678-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that HOX proteins function alone as repressors and are converted to activators by forming cooperative DNA-binding complexes with PBX/EXD (25Pinsonneault J. Florence B. Vaessin H. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the efforts of many laboratories, little progress has been made in defining biologic targets and the biochemical mechanism of action of the HOX proteins. The CBP/p300 proteins have been a focus of interest because they appear to link transcription factors to chromatin remodeling mechanisms, thus facilitating eukaryotic gene transcription (26Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 are thought to increase general transcription via their histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (26Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). One model is that CBP/p300 function by mediating the acetylation of histones within the nucleosome core, thereby reducing DNA interactions and facilitating and/or stabilizing steric changes that permit increased access of the general transcriptional machinery to target genes (28Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism by which CBP-HAT may regulate transcription is through the direct acetylation of transcription factors, thus modulating their activity. The GATA1 transcription factor plays a critical role in red cell development (29Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F.

Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Consistent with the second model, CBP directly acetylates the GATA1 protein, which increases its transcriptional activity (31Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 32Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study suggested that the Pu.1 protein blocks erythroid differentiation by blocking the CBP-HAT-catalyzed acetylation of GATA1 and other proteins (33Hong W. Kim A.Y. Ky S. Rakowski C. Seo S.B. Chakravarti D. Atchison M. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3729-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that HOXB6 and other HOX proteins bind to CBP/p300 and inhibit their HAT activity (13Shen W.-F. Krishnan K. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7509-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HOXB6 blocked CBP-HAT-dependent, transient in vivo reporter gene transcriptional activity. Conversely, CBP prevented DNA binding by HOXB6 and other HOX proteins. To gain insights into the mechanism of action of HOXB6, we have performed a structure/function analysis, using a modified version of our previously described system, in which the biological activity of HOXB6 can be readily observed as readout. In addition, our data on CBP-HOX protein interactions stimulated us to explore the importance of HOXB6-CBP interactions in this model system. Establishment of HOXB6-expressing Cell Lines—A full-length human HOXB6 cDNA (5Shen W.F. Detmer K. Simonitch-Eason T.S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), engineered to encode a full-length protein fused to an N-terminal FLAG epitope, was cloned into a bicistronic murine stem cell virus retroviral vector in which an internal ribosomal entry site allows GFP expression (gift from K. Humphries). Standard techniques were used with the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to produce a series of mutant HOXB6 proteins. These included proteins in which asparagine 196 was changed to alanine (N196A) to disrupt DNA binding. Tryptophan 130 was changed to glycine (W130G) to disrupt PBX interactions. Serine 214 was changed to glutamic acid (S214E) or to alanine (S214A) to mimic a constitutively phosphorylated molecule or one incapable of phosphorylation on Ser214. A set of deletion mutants were constructed in which ΔNterm is missing the first 12 amino acids; ΔCterm is missing 9 amino acids; and Δ119, Δ127, and Δ134 are missing amino acids 1-119, 1-127, and 1-134, respectively. ΔHD is missing amino acids 135-224, whereas HDΔhelix 3 represents a protein extending from 135-224 but missing amino acids 187-203. The correct mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each of the mutant proteins was checked by expression as a T7 epitope-tagged fusion protein in the TnT system (Promega). Viral supernatants prepared in 293T cells using helper plasmids (34Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) were used to infect K562 cells in two rounds of spinoculation. The cells were sorted for GFP expression and expanded to produce lines. Most experiments were performed within a 20-day period after sorting when HOX protein levels were relatively high. A few experiments were performed using cells in which exogenous HOXB6 expression levels were similar to those of the endogenous protein. Immunochemistry Studies—Immunoblotting, immunohistochemical localization, co-immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were all performed following standard procedures with appropriate secondary antibodies as outlined (35Coligan J.E. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Antisera used for chromatin IP were: rabbit α-acetyl lysine histone 3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), murine α-FLAG (Sigma), and rabbit α-HOXB6 against the N-terminal 128 amino acids (antiserum 1), as described previously (36Kömüves L.G. Shen W.-F. Kwong A. Stelnicki E. Rozenfeld S. Oda Y. Blink A. Krishnan K. Lau B. Mauro T. Largman C. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 218: 636-647Crossref Google Scholar). Antibodies used for HOXB6 immunoprecipitation were either the α-HOXB6 antiserum 1 or a mixture of two rabbit antisera (antiserum 2) against peptides RKSDCAQDKSVFGET and ESKLLSASQLSAEE, respectively. These peptides are from regions of the HOXB6 protein N- and C-terminal to the HD, which are conserved between human and mouse. Antibody 1 was also used for Western blotting and for immunohistochemistry experiments in combination with the TSA Cy3 amplification kit (704A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunohistochemical staining, α-HOXB6 antiserum 1 or a third antibody to HOXB6 (antiserum 3) (S20, Santa Cruz) was used. All three antisera to HOXB6 were shown to recognize the full-length protein by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated protein (data not shown). Mouse α-T7 (Novagen) was used for immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated T7 epitope-tagged HOXB6 associated with DNA. Rabbit α-CBP (A-22, Santa Cruz) was used for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and histochemical detection, whereas a murine α-CBP (C-1; Santa Cruz) was used to confirm CBP co-precipitation with HOXB6 by Western blotting. Goat α-tubulin (C20) was used to confirm protein loading. Determination of Globin mRNA Levels—Sixteen separate transfection experiments were performed for the HOXB6-GFP and the corresponding MIG control vector (Supplemental Tables I and II). Supplemental Tables III and IV show experiments in which the different mutant HOXB6 proteins were studied in addition to the parental HOXB6 and the MIG control vector. Following FACS separation of GFP+ cells, total RNA was isolated from each population using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantitated by A260. Approximately 15 μg of RNA from each cell pool was analyzed for human α-globin and γ-globin on separate Northern gels, using specific cDNA probes as previously described (6Shen W.-F. Detmer K. Mathews C.H.E. Hack F.M. Morgan D.A. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For each experiment all of the samples to be compared were run on a single gel and Northern blotted, and the resulting filters were probed for either α-globin or γ-globin. Filters were stripped and reprobed for human β-actin to allow correction for loading differences. The blots were scanned using a Lacie Silver Scanner, and the bands were quantitated using National Institutes of Health Image software. The ratios of the γ-globin or α-globin signals to the actin signal, in the HOXB6-transfected cells and in the MIG vector-transfected control cells, are shown in Supplemental Tables I and II. The globin/actin signals vary between experiments because of efficiency of probe labeling, autoradiography times, and film development conditions. To better compare data between experiments, the globin/actin ratio for the MIG control in each experiment was arbitrarily set to 1.0 (see Supplemental Tables III and IV). The other globin/actin ratios within each experiment were then normalized to its MIG control. Changes in globin gene levels for each of the mutant HOXB6 proteins relative to the wild type HOXB6 protein were then compared using the mean values shown in Supplemental Tables III and IV. Analysis of heme synthesis, EMSA analysis, CBP interaction studies, and phosphorylation of HOXB6 protein were performed as described (6Shen W.-F. Detmer K. Mathews C.H.E. Hack F.M. Morgan D.A.

HOXB6 proteins were measured by fractionating 15 μg of total cell extract by PAGE, followed by Western blotting with α-FLAG sera, hybridization with goat α-mouse IgG, and subsequent development for 30 min with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). A Cell Model for Analyzing HOXB6 Activity in K562 Cells—The purpose of the current study was to perform a structure/function analysis of the HOXB6 protein using a convenient cell culture model as a readout. Previously studies employed a replicon-based transfection assay that utilized a long drug selection protocol to show that HOXB6 down-regulated erythroid markers when expressed in erythroid cell lines (6Shen W.-F. Detmer K. Mathews C.H.E. Hack F.M. Morgan D.A. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the current study we utilized a bicistronic murine stem cell virus-derived retroviral vector coupled with FACS sorting of GFP-positive cells to rapidly obtain K562 lines expressing exogenous HOXB6 protein without prolonged drug selection (Fig. 1A). Using this protocol it is likely that multiple different viral integration sites are present in each pool of FACS-sorted cells. Endogenous HOXB6 mRNA expression can be detected in K562 cells (3Shen W.-F. Largman C. Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Hauser C.A. Simonitch T.A. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8536-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but Western blotting revealed only weak signals for endogenous HOXB6 protein in vector-infected controls (not shown). In contrast, HOXB6 or a HOXB6 DNA-binding mutant (HOXB6-N196A) protein was readily detected in representative stably transduced cell lines (Fig. 1B). The relative levels of the HOX proteins varied to some degree between infections, possibly reflecting differences in viral integration sites within chromatin. A qualitative estimate of the relative HOXB6 protein expression for the 16 separate transfection experiments is shown in Supplemental Table I. For most of the different infection experiments, the levels of HOXB6 protein were lower than or approximately equal to those detected for the HOXB6-N196A or other HOXB6 mutant proteins (Figs. 1, 3, and 4 and data not shown).Fig. 3Interaction with PBX is not required for HOXB6-mediated down-regulation of globin expression.A, the HOXB6-W130G protein does not form cooperative DNA-binding complexes with PBX on a PBX-HOXB6 consensus oligonucleotide target by EMSA.

HOXB6 proteins containing mutations deleting the conserved extreme N-terminal region (ΔNterm), the polyglutamic acid extreme C-terminal region (ΔCterm), or altering a previously described ckII phosphorylation site to either a nonphosphorylated residue (S214A), or mimicking constitutive phosphorylation (S214E) all repressed globin expression to a similar degree as the wild type protein. B, all of the mutant proteins form cooperative DNA-binding complexes with PBX1a in EMSA analysis. The TnT lysate used to synthesize the various HOXB6 and PBX1a proteins contains endogenous protein(s) capable of shifting the target oligonucleotide to form a nonspecific complex that migrates faster than the HOXB6-PBX band and exhibits variable intensity (compare for instance with Fig. 3A or 5B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HOXB6 Represses Globin mRNA Levels—We first confirmed our earlier findings that the HOXB6 protein repressed globin mRNA levels. HOXB6 overexpression resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) 3-4-fold decrease in both γ- and α-gamma globin gene expression (Fig. 1B and Table I). Northern gel analysis showed that although there was variation in the absolute degree of globin mRNA repression among the 16 experiments (ranging from 1.6- to 50-fold for γ-globin and 1.7- to 12.5-fold for α-globin, respectively), there was a decrease in both transcripts for each experiment (see Supplemental Tables I-IV). The repression of globin mRNA levels roughly paralleled the estimated HOXB6 protein levels in the 16 experiments.Table IDown-regulation of α-and γ-globin mRNA levels by HOXB6 proteinsHOXB6 constructNα-GlobinaThe relative expression values shown are the means and standard deviation of globin mRNA levels normalized to actin to control for mRNA loading and then normalized to the MIG control, run in parallel for each experiment, which was set to 1.0.

Open table in a new tab The production of mature hemoglobin, consisting of globin protein chains and the heme group, is a defining feature of terminal erythroid differentiation. K562 cells have been shown to express low levels of hemoglobin, reflecting their myeloid/erythroid progenitor bipotential phenotype (38Hicks D.G. Ohlsson-Wilhelm B.M. Farley B.A. Kosciolek B.A. Rowley P.T. Exp. Hematol. 1985; 13: 273-280PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in which HOXB6 was expressed were markedly white compared with the red parental K562 cells containing a control vector (Fig. 1C). To further characterize HOXB6-induced differentiation changes, we measured heme production using benzidine staining of colonies grown in soft agar, as performed previously (6Shen W.-F. Detmer K. Mathews C.H.E. Hack F.M. Morgan D.A. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). There was a marked decrease in heme synthesis in the HOXB6-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). One possible explanation for low globin synthesis was that high levels of HOXB6 were squelching general transcription. Although the relatively uniform actin expression argued against this phenomenon, we repeated the globin analysis on cells in which HOXB6 expression was estimated to be less than 5-fold elevated over the low endogenous levels. In these cells, α- and γ-globin expression was still reduced, albeit to a lesser extent than observed in cells in which higher levels of HOXB6 protein were detected (Fig. 1E).

An increase in levels of GABRA4 mRNA and membrane protein is observed in an animal model of premenstrual syndrome and postpartum depression, in which rats undergo withdrawal from high levels of progesterone treatment (11Smith S.S.

Withdrawal of progesterone is accompanied by a series of behavioral changes, including reduced seizure threshold, increased anxiety, and locomotor activity, all of which occur in parallel with the increase of GABRA4 expression. An elevation of GABRA4 expression is also observed in the rat following electroshock (31Clark M. Neurosci.

These findings have led to the speculation that the α4 subunit of the GABAA-R might be involved in neuronal hyperexcitability.Despite accumulating reports on the plasticity of the α4 subunit, the molecular mechanisms controlling this process are little understood at present. In this report we have analyzed the promoter region of GABRA4 in cultured cortical neurons by a luciferase reporter assay and identified two Sp1 binding sites within the proximal promoter region that are critical for promoter activity. The Sp1 binding site, also known as the GC box, contains an asymmetric hexanucleotide core GGGCGG sequence that is recognized by the members of Sp/KLF family of transcription factors with zinc finger motifs (33Suske G.

The closely related Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 have a similar binding affinity to the classic Sp1 site, as do other subfamily members, such as BTEB1, TIEG1, and TIEG2 (33Suske G. Philipsen S. Kadonaga J.T.

Our results indicate that both Sp3 and Sp4 can interact with the Sp1 sites in the GABRA4 promoter and are critical for promoter activity in neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of GABRA4 Reporter Plasmids and DNA Sequence Analysis—For constructing plasmids pLuc-P1 through pLuc-P8, pLuc-P1Δ1, and pLuc-P1Δ2, various promoter fragments of GABRA4 were generated by direct PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from 129 × 1/Svj mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) using the Expand Long Template System (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The PCR primers (Table I) were designed based on the published mouse genome sequence (36Karolchik D. Baertsch R. Diekhans M. Furey T.S. Hinrichs A. Lu Y.T. Roskin K.M. Schwartz M. Sugnet C.W. Thomas D.J. Weber R.J. Haussler D. Kent W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) using Amplify 1.0 software (University of Wisconsin) at default settings. Restriction sites for MluI and NheI were included at the 5′-end of the PCR primers to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mini-prep DNA was isolated from white colonies and screened by MluI and NheI digestion. Fragments from the MluI and NheI digestion were gel purified and ligated into the MluI and NheI sites of pGL3-basic vector (pGL-BV) (Promega). Mutant vectors pLuc-P7Δ1 through pLuc-P7Δ8 were generated from the wild-type plasmid pLuc-P7 using the ExSite PCR-based system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers listed in Table I. Constructs pLuc-P7A, pLuc-P7B, and pLuc-P7AB were generated from the pLuc-P7 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers listed in Table I.

Both mouse and human genomic sequences were based on 2002 assembly. DNA sequence analysis was performed using the AliBaba2 program and TRANSFAC data base for predicting transcription factor binding sites. Repetitive DNA sequence was analyzed using a tandem repeats finder program. The 5′-untranslated region putative stem-loop structure was analyzed by a RNA secondary structure prediction program.5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) and Primer Extension Assays—Total RNA was isolated from the brain tissue of adult C57/BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratory and Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 5′-RACE analysis of transcription initiation sites was carried out by synthesizing RACE-ready cDNA from total brain RNA using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and by using the FirstChoice RLMRACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RACE-ready cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification using the universal anchor primer and the GABRA4 specific primer anti-4 (5′-CGCAATCGCGGGTACCTTCTGGACAG-3′), which anneals to the region +8 to +33 relative to the coding ATG. PCR amplification was performed by denaturing the cDNA for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and clones containing the PCR inserts were sequenced to locate the 5′-end of the transcript for GABRA4.The primer extension assay was carried out by using the Primer Extension System (Promega). 3 × 106 cpm of the [γ-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) labeled anti-4 primer was annealed to 30–40 μg of total brain RNA at 55 °C for 30 min following denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min. Annealed samples were slowly cooled to room temperature prior to addition of reverse transcriptase. After incubating for 1 h at 42 °C, the reverse transcription (RT) reaction mixture was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The primer extension products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing TBE gel containing 8 m urea using a DNA sequencing size marker prepared with the AmpliCycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).RT-PCR and Real-time PCR Analyses—For RT-PCR analysis, cDNA was reverse transcribed from 0.5 to 1 μg of total RNA in a 30-μl reaction containing 0.25 μg of random hexamer (Qiagen), 1 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of RNaseOut (Invitrogen), and 5 units of reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) with 1× RT reaction buffer. The RT reaction mixture was purified by one step of phenol-chloroform extraction. The primers for GAPDH, GB450 (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′) and GB449 (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′), which amplify both human and mouse genes, were described previously (37Liu A. Zhuang Z. Hoffman P.W. Bai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26423-26434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primers for GABRA4 mRNA were individually designed and the resulting PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GABRA4 RT-PCR primers for human (HEK293 cells) were: sense (5′-CTGGACAAAAGGTCCTGAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTCTCTGCACTGGAGCAGC-3′), and for mouse (neurons and astrocytes) were: sense (5′-TACACCTGGACCAAAGGCCC-3′) and antisense (5′-TCTGTGTGTTTCTCCTTCAGCACA-3′). The 50-μl PCR reaction mixture contained 2 μl of cDNA, 0.2 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1× PCR buffer with Mg2+ (Roche Applied Science). PCR amplification was carried out by denaturing the cDNA for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 28 cycles (GAPDH) or 35 cycles (GABRA4) of 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final step of elongation for 7 min at 72 °C.For real-time PCR analysis, 0.5–1 μg of total RNA was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) for 15 min followed by heat inactivation. cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) with random hexamer followed by RNase H digestion. Real-time PCR primers were designed by OligoPerfect Designer (Invitrogen) using default settings, which generates Tm matched primer pairs that amplify 80–250 bp of target sequence. The GAPDH primers were forward (5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′) and reverse (5′-ACACATTGGGGGTAGGAACA-3′) and amplified a product of 223 bp. The GABRA4 primers were forward (5′-TAAACGAATCCCCAGGACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GACGCAGCCTGTTGTCATAA-3′) and amplified a product of 105 bp. The amplified PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Real-time PCR were carried out in a DNA Engine Thermocycler (MJ Research, Reno, NV) using SYBR green I dye. The 50-μl reaction mixtures contained 0.5 μm of each primer, 1 to 2 μl of cDNA, and 25 μl of Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). The conditions for realtime PCR were 2 min at 95 °C, and 45 (GAPDH) or 50 (GABRA4) cycles for 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C followed by a gradient step from 55 to 95 °C to obtain a melting curve for each sample. Plasmids containing GAPDH and GABRA4 cDNA were linearized by EcoRI digestion and were used as PCR standards in 5-fold serial dilutions. The cycle threshold (Ct) line was positioned manually at the point where the fluorescent signals surpassed background noise and started to increase linearly. Standard curves were determined for each reaction by plotting Ct as a function of log [DNA]. Ct for each sample was obtained from the fluorescence trace where it intersected with the Ct line. DNA concentration was obtained by converting the Ct to an initial quantity by interpolation from the standard curve run on the same plate. The homogeneity of PCR products was analyzed by the observation of a single peak of the fluorescence versus temperature trace at the melting temperature and by agarose gel electrophoresis. In each experiment, the average values of triplicate samples were used for each data point, and a minimum of three independent neuronal cultures were included for each analysis to obtain the final results. A control sample with no reverse transcriptase in the RT reaction was included in each experiment to monitor for genomic DNA contamination.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Dual Luciferase Assay—Mouse cortical neurons were prepared as previously described with modifications (38Huettner J.E. Baughman R.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3044-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were isolated from embryonic day 17 or 18 C57/BL6 mice (Jackson Laboratory and Charles River Laboratories). The dissected cortices were minced in 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 units/ml papain (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in 1× Earle's balanced salts solution (Sigma) containing 1 mml-cysteine (Calbiochem) and 0.5 mm EDTA (Sigma). Digested cortical cells were further dissociated in Earle's balanced salts solution containing 2 mg/ml albumin (Sigma) and 100 units/ml DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) by gentle trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The resulting single cell suspension was layered on top of a 20 mg/ml albumin solution in Earle's balanced salt solution for a single step of discontinuous gradient centrifugation at 800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was then resuspended in phenol red-free minimum essential medium (PRF-MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Sigma) and 0.5 mml-glutamine (Sigma). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 12-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) pre-coated overnight with 0.05 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). On day 3 in vitro, half of the media was replaced with phenol red-free neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm glutamine, 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen), and the anti-mitotic agents 10–4m uridine and 10–5m 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (Sigma). Fresh PRF neurobasal medium was added to replace half of the media every other day thereafter. Astrocytes were prepared by culturing the cortical cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 5% equine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) PRF-MEM. Astrocytes continued to propagate and constituted more than 90% of the cells in the mixed culture population after 2 weeks of expansion. Transfection of neurons was generally performed on days 7–9 in vitro for luciferase analysis, whereas transfection of astrocytes was performed after 2 weeks in culture. HEK293 cells were cultured as described previously (39Nishikawa K. Jenkins A. Paraskevakis I. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and transfected when the cells reached 70–80% confluence. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment of 5% CO2.Plasmid DNA used for transfection was obtained using the HiSpeed maxi-prep kit (Qiagen) and re-purified by sodium acetate and ethanol precipitation. For each construct, at least three independent plasmid DNA preparations were used for transfection experiments. For each transfection, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added to 5 ng of CMV promoter driven Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-CMV) (Promega) for co-transfection. The pRL-CMV construct served as the internal control for the dual luciferase assay (Promega). Transfection was performed using a combination of the Nupherin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) reagents. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was first mixed with 6 μg of Nupherin in 150 μl of PRF-MEM for 15 min and then combined with 150 μl of PRF-MEM containing 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 for another 15 min at room temperature. The culture media was replaced with 300 μl of transfection media containing the LipofectAMINE-Nupherin-DNA complex. After incubating for 1 h, transfection media was replaced with 1 ml of culture media. Luciferase activity was analyzed 20–24 h post-transfection with a Turner Design 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Triplicate samples were measured for each construct, and the average values of luciferase light units were used for data analysis. The negative control pGL-BV plasmid was the pGL3-basic vector (Promega), which contained no eukaryotic promoter or enhancer sequence. The luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of the light units of GABRA4 promoter driven firefly luciferase versus CMV promoter driven Renilla luciferase. The relative luciferase activity for each sample was normalized to that of the SV40 minimal promoter (PSV40) driven luciferase construct for comparison among different experiments. The expression vectors pEVR2/Sp1, pRC/CMV-Sp3, and pRC/CMV-Sp4 were obtained from Professor G. Suske (40Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol.

Briefly, the brain tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and shattered into tissue powder. About 500 mg of tissue was lysed in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and homogenized for 10 strokes using a glass homogenizer with loose type pestle. Tissue debris was discarded by centrifuging the homogenate at 2,000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C, and nuclei were collected by centrifuging the supernatant at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were re-suspended in 200–500 μl of buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C by gentle shaking. Nuclear extract was collected by centrifuging the lysate at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 s.Oligos Sp1-A (5′-GAGCGGCGAGGGAGGGGGCGGGCGCGCAGGTC-3′) and Sp1-B (5′-GCGCGCAGGTCCCGCCTCCCCTGGCCGCGT-3′) were synthesized (Qiagen) and double-stranded oligos were prepared by annealing the complementary strands in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. The consensus Sp1 binding sites were underlined in the oligo sequences. The sequences of mutant oligos MutA and MutB were listed in Table I. The Sp1 core oligo was obtained from Promega. The in vitro binding reactions were carried out using a gel shift kit (Roche Applied Science). The oligos were either end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP or digoxigenin. About 10 ×"

Here we show that an invertebrate (Lymnaea stagnalis) homolog of P/Q- and N-type calcium channels (LCav2), although colocalized with β subunits in synapses of mature neurons, is physically uncoupled from the β subunits in the leading edge of growth cones of outgrowing neurons. Moreover, LCav2 channels that mediate transmitter release in mature synapses also participate in neuronal outgrowth in growth cones.

The physiological importance of calcium channel β subunits is supported by studies involving mutant and knockout mice. For example, a spontaneous mutation in β4 effectively leads to a functional null mouse resulting in a lethargic phenotype with impaired synaptic transmission (19Burgess D.L. Biddlecome G.H. McDonough S.I. Diaz M.E. Zilinski C.A. Bean B.P. Campbell K.P. Noebels J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 293-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Alternatively, knockout of β3 inhibits the activities of neuronal L-type and N-type channels (20Namkung Y. Smith S.M. Lee S.B. Skrypnyk N.V. Kim H.L. Chin H. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, because the central nervous system expresses multiple β subunits, compensation by other β subunit isoforms complicates the analysis of these phenotypes (21Miller R.J. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 445-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, synaptic nerve terminals frequently express both N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels (22Timmermann D.B. Westenbroek R.E. Schousboe A. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), each of which can associate with all of the four β subunits (23Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J.

This combinatorial subunit complexity has hampered attempts to delineate the precise fundamental roles of β subunits on synaptic function (21Miller R.J. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 445-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, invertebrates express only a single representative of each of the three major calcium channel α1 subunit isoforms and a singleton homolog of the β subunit (26Spafford J.D. Zamponi G.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have reported recently the isolation and functional characterization of a Cav2 calcium channel homolog (LCav2) from the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis. We showed that LCav2 displays functional properties that are reminiscent of mammalian N-type calcium channels (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that this channel is essential for synaptic transmission between identified Lymnaea neurons (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like its vertebrate counterpart, LCav2 contains the α-interaction domain, a highly conserved region in the domain I-II linker that is essential for interactions with calcium channel β subunits (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the Lymnaea model system allows for the in vitro reconstruction of identified synapses, which are highly amenable for molecular and cellular manipulation. These synapses are target cell-specific, require gene transcription and de novo protein synthesis, are ultrastructurally and electrophysiologically similar to those observed in vivo (28Feng Z.P. Klumperman J. Lukowiak K. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of this invertebrate model to elucidate fundamental aspects of β subunit physiology. Here we report the isolation of the Lymnaea β subunit (LCavβ), its functional characterization, and its distribution in neurons. LCavβ caused neither a considerable alteration in LCav2 calcium channel activity nor did it mediate an increase in expression of LCav2. We show that besides their known function in triggering neurotransmitter release, LCav2 channels are essential for proper synaptic outgrowth. However, in terminal growth cones and nascent growth along major neurites, β subunits are spatially and physically uncoupled from LCav2 channels and not associated with neurite outgrowth. In synaptic contacts, LCav2 channels associate with β subunits that potentially are synthesized locally in distal neurites. This local pool of neuritic β subunits may support the immediate and cytoskeletal reorganization of the developing growth cone into a nascent synapse or the dynamic remodeling in mature synapses. Molecular Identification, Structural Analyses, and Preparation of Lymnaea Genes for in Vitro Expression—The L. stagnalis calcium channel β subunit LCavβ (gi:29378324) was identified in a 418-bp PCR product from fresh Lymnaea brain cDNA with the use of degenerate primers (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The isolated PCR product served as a probe to isolate a full-length 1950-bp cDNA homolog coding for LCavβ (gi:29378324) from Lymnaea brain cDNA libraries (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Protein sequences of LCavβ and other Cavβ subunit homologs were aligned in PILEUP (GCG Wisconsin Package, Accelrys) and imported into PAUP 4.0 to generate a consensus gene tree using the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. The gene tree was tested for robustness in 100 bootstraps and displayed in TREEVIEW 1.6.6 (Rod Page, Glasgow, Scotland, UK). A running window of average similarity of the aligned genes was displayed using PLOTSIMILARITY (GCG Wisconsin Package). For in vitro expression, 5′ NotI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites were incorporated into primers flanking the 568-amino acid coding region of LCavβ for PCR cassette insertion into the mammalian expression vector PMT2SX. The sequence immediately upstream from the start (ATG) codon was also altered to include a consensus Kozak sequence CGGCCGCCACC(ATG). Transfection and Assessment of Function in Vitro by Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Heterologously expressed cDNAs encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein marker (Clontech), a Cav2 α1 subunit from rat (rCav2.1, rCav2.2, and rCav2.3) or Lymnaea (LCav2a, GenBank™ accession number AF484082), the rat α2-δ1 subunit, and either no β subunit or one of the four rat β subunits (β1b, β2a, β3, and β4) or the Lymnaea β subunit (LCavβ) were transfected into human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells by using a standard calcium phosphate protocol (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transfected LCav2a cDNA contained the first 44 amino acids swapped with the homologous region of rat Cav2.1. We demonstrated previously (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that this alteration is one that is both necessary and sufficient for membrane expression of LCav2a in human cell lines. The activities of calcium channels were measured with barium as the charge carrier via whole cell patch clamp using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), pCLAMP 9.0 software, after incubation of transiently transfected cells at 28 °C for 2-4 days. All solutions and recording procedures have been described previously (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data were analyzed in Clampfit (pClamp 9, Axon Instruments) and SigmaPlot 2000 (Jandel Scientific, SPSS Science, Chicago). Steady state inactivation curves and macroscopic current voltage relations were analyzed using a standard Boltzmann equation. A monoexponential fit of the raw data was used to derive time constants for inactivation and for recovery from inactivation. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., with numbers in parentheses, as displayed in the figures, reflecting the numbers of experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using Sigmastat (Jandel Scientific). Differences between mean values from each experimental group were tested using paired and unpaired Student's t tests or one-way analysis of variance and were considered significant if p < 0.05. Polyclonal Antibody Synthesis and Immunolocalization of Lymnaea LCavβ and LCav2 in Cultured Neurons and Transfected Cell Lines—The peptide SLDEEKEALRRET corresponding to amino acids 64-76 (see Fig. 1A) was used as the antigen for the LCavβ peptide antibody. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography were used to confirm the purity of the peptide (Henk Hilkman, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Rabbits were immunized for a 4-week period with adjuvants and antigen conjugated to carrier protein (Washington Biotechnology Inc., Baltimore). Rabbit antiserum was enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titered at 1:50,000 and measured for immunoreactivity by spot blot. A peptide polyclonal antibody for the LCav2 calcium channel was derived from the antigenic sequence KAEDNENDSEQNDND, coding for amino acids 418-432 of the cytoplasmic I-II linker. This peptide coupled to carrier was raised either as anti-rabbit (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or anti-chicken. Western blot samples consisted of proteinaceous extracts of harvested transiently transfected or untransfected tsA-201 cells incubated for 4 days at 37 °C or freshly isolated Lymnaea central ring ganglia. Cell samples were collected on ice in 500 μl of 0.32 m sucrose and the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 mg/ml), aprotinin (1 mg/ml), leupeptin (1 mg/ml), pefabloc SC (0.2 mm), benzamidine (0.1 mg/ml), and the calpain inhibitors I and II (8 mg/ml each). After centrifugation, supernatants of proteinaceous extracts were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE and transferred (40 V for 16 h) onto a Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After air-drying for 2 h, the membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding in 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, PBS solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.3)) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody (1:2000). The membranes were washed five times in PBS/Tween 20 followed by incubation for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-chicken IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase in 5% milk/PBS/Tween 20 and five washes in PBS/Tween 20. Antigen was detected using chemiluminescent horse-radish peroxidase substrate (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and visualized following exposure to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP. Neurons (VD4, LPeD1, RPeD1, CGCs) that form identified synapses in vitro were isolated from the Lymnaea central ring ganglia by using established protocol (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P.

Immunolabeled samples of untransfected/transfected tsA-201 and identified Lymnaea cultured cells were fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin containing 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Immunolabeled samples were washed extensively in Tris/bovine serum albumin/Triton followed by washing in Tris buffer (27Spafford J.D. Chen L. Feng Z.P. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21178-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunolabeled samples were exposed to primary (1:2000 dilution) and fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies overnight at 4 °C for 45 min at room temperature, respectively, to limit background staining. Background staining was assessed by preincubating the peptide polyclonal antibody at 1:2000 dilution with the antigenic peptide (5 μg/ml) overnight or by substituting the primary antibody for anti-rabbit or anti-chicken preimmune serum at 1:2000. Fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies for immunostaining IgG (H+L) anti-rabbit LCavβ, and anti-rabbit or anti-chicken IgG (H+L) LCav2 consisted of Alexa Fluor 555 (red) donkey anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 (green) goat anti-chicken IgG at 1:400 dilution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Prepared samples were wet-dried and mounted in fluorescence antifading media (Fluorsave, Calbiochem). Images were visualized and analyzed on an Olympus confocal microscope. In Situ Hybridization and Immunolocalization in Lymnaea Central Ring Ganglia Sections—Lymnaea central nervous systems were fixed in Bouin's fixative (16-24 h) and, after dehydration with ethanol, embedded in paraffin. Consecutive 7-μm sections were adhered to Superfrost™ microscope slides. LCavβ RNA was detected in tissue sections with run-off antisense RNA, complementary to the coding region of amino acids 114-354 (720 bp) of LCavβ. An antisense construct was synthesized in the PCR by using forward primer with a 5′ incorporated KpnI site, GGGGTACCTGGCTGTGCGGTGTCATTTGGGG, upstream of DNA position 505 bp and 3′ reverse primer, GATTGTGTCACAGTCCAACACCAC, ending at position 1260 bp just downstream of a unique SacI restriction site at 1229 bp. The resulting PCR product after KpnI-SacI digestion was inserted into pBluescriptII KS+. EV3 and EV2 primers were used to amplify the 721-bp PCR product containing the LCavβ fragment flanked by T7 and T3 promoters of pBluescript KS+. RNA was synthesized from this linear PCR template using T7 (for sense probe) and T3 (for antisense probe) RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). RNA probes were then labeled with 35S-dUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) rendering specific activities of >50000 cpm/pmol DNA. The 10 fmol/μl probe in a standard hybridization mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then washed with increasing stringencies at 60 °C. Slides were subsequently dipped in Eastman Kodak NTB2 emulsion and developed after 7 days of autoradiographic exposure. Assessment of RNA Transcript Levels and Local Protein Expression in Isolated Neurites—Isolated Lymnaea CGC neurons were isolated and subsequently cultured on a poly-l-lysine-coated adhesive substrate as described previously (31Spencer G.E. Syed N.I. van Kesteren E. Lukowiak K. Geraerts W.P. van Minnen J. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated with long neuritic stumps to maximize neurite extension without allowing neuronal intra-connections (autapses) or inter-connections with other neurons (synapses). After 2 days of culturing, somata were severed from neurites with a sterile glass pipette 20-40 μm from the somata and then removed from the dish. For reverse Northern blot analyses, dishes containing soma-ablated neurites were rinsed three times in sterile saline before cultured neurites were bathed and lifted from the adhesive substrate by trituration in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Subsequent to Trizol extraction, total RNA (200 ng) was amplified by SMART cDNA synthesis (zco;clontech-Clontech). Blots were probed with 32P-labeled/PCR-amplified cDNA inserts spotted with DNA plasmids (200 ng) on a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) coding for DNA fragments of Lymnaea calcium and potassium channel clones (GenBank™ accession number, corresponding to the amino acid sequences, LCav1 (AF484079, 373-670), LCav2 (AF484082, 302-621), LCav3 (AF484084, 848-1111), LCavβ (AF484087, 285-433), LKv2.1 (AY551910), and LKv3.1 (AY551911), and subsequently imaged via a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). LKv2.1 and LKv3.1 are novel sequences accompanying this paper that were isolated from fresh Lymnaea cDNA by degenerate PCR. To assess local protein synthesis of LCavβ mRNA in soma-ablated neurites, an HA-tagged LCavβ construct was designed by nested PCR insertion of TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTAC, coding for an HA epitope (YPYDVPDY) just downstream of the start codon of full-length LCavβ in pBluescript II KS+. Linearized template was created by digestion of post-3′-untranslated region of linearized HA-tagged LCavβ with KpnI enzyme. In vitro transcribed, capped, and poly(A)-tailed RNA was synthesized from 3′ linearized HA-tagged LCavβ construct plasmid using the mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). HA-tagged LCavβ mRNA construct was microinjected into soma-ablated neurites, followed by a 12-h incubation to allow heterologous expression of HA-tagged protein. These samples were then fixed and stained for HA epitope using a rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-rat IgG (H+L), using the immunocytochemical procedure described above. Gene Knockdowns in Cultured, Identified Lymnaea Neurons—Gene knockdowns were carried out on isolated CGC neurons, plated on non-adhesive, hemolymph-treated glass coverslips, and bathed in brain-conditioned medium with 10 μm antisense/mismatch DNA oligonucleotide probes (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 3 days of incubation, the treated neurons were transferred to poly-l-lysine-pre-treated glass coverslips bathed in fresh brain conditioned medium. These neurons were incubated for 48 h in the dark to maximize sprouting of neurites and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for detection of LCav2 and LCavβ protein expression by confocal microscopy. Extension of primary neurites beyond five somata lengths was considered normal, control neurite growth. 15-mer antisense ACAAGACGACCTATC spanned a region of a highly conserved sequence at amino acids 136-141, coding for WIGRLV at position 574-588 bp in LCavβ. Mismatch probes for LCavβ consisted of 3 base changes to the antisense sequence, ACGAGACCACCGATC (changed nucleotides are underlined). Antisense/mismatch probes were prefiltered through a 0.8-μm filter, boiled for 2 min, and cooled on ice before incubation with neurons. Fluorescence intensities of antisense versus mismatch LCavβ samples were quantified in optical density units in a 200 × 200 μm area encompassing each neuron centered in view using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). As described previously (4Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. Van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), RNA interference probes consisted of a mixture of double-stranded RNA synthesized by T7/T3 transcription in both sense/antisense strands (MEGASCRIPT; Ambion, Austin, TX) of template inserted between T7 and T3 promoters in Bluescript II KS+ vector. The template coded for the II-IIII loop in LCav2a (2237-2710) and LCav2b (2237-2761), or a negative control consisting of a fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of LCav2 that lies between natural PstI and HindIII sites (6709-7278). All of the experiments involving gene knockdown were carried out in a double blind fashion. Lymnaea Neurons Express a Cavβ Subunit—A full-length 1950-bp cDNA homolog coding for a 568-amino acid calcium channel β subunit (LCavβ) was isolated from an L. stagnalis brain cDNA library (Fig. 1A). Other invertebrates as well as completed genomic sequences of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila reveal a similar singleton homolog that represents the four known mammalian β subunit isoforms (i.e. β1 through β4, Fig. 1B). LCavβ and mammalian β subunits display a similar architecture of three variable regions separated by two highly conserved regions, in which LCavβ and mammalian β subunits share 80 and 89% sequence identity, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). The β subunit core is considered to resemble central modules of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (33Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 34Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C.

Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), with conserved and interacting SH3 and guanylate kinase domains, and a variable HOOK region that splits the SH3 fold (Fig. 1, A and C). Residues in the guanylate kinase domain contribute to form a deep, hydrophobic groove for high affinity binding of high voltage-activated calcium channels (33Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 35Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which are highly conserved residues among invertebrate and mammalian β subunits (Fig. 1A, black residues). The striking conservation of the structural core of all invertebrate and vertebrate β subunits suggests a functional equivalency of the four mammalian β subunits with the singleton invertebrate homolog. At vertebrate presynaptic terminals, all four mammalian β subunit isoforms are considered potential regulators of the two synaptic calcium channel α1 subunits, P/Q-type (Cav2.1) and N-type (Cav2.2). Like the singleton β subunit gene, invertebrates bear a single Cav2 homolog that represents both mammalian P/Q-type and N-type synaptic calcium channels and that is essential for synaptic transmission (26Spafford J.D. Zamponi G.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This lack of combinatorial complexity of multiple calcium channels and β subunits provides for a unique opportunity to delineate the fundamental neurophysiological function of the β subunit. Distribution of LCavβ in Lymnaea Brain—To assess the distribution of LCavβ and its putative colocalization with the LCav2 calcium channel α1 subunit in Lymnaea brain, we generated a polyclonal peptide antibody designed against the β subunit raised in rabbit (see Fig. 1, A and C), and an anti-chicken LCav2 antibody, whose epitope specificity was characterized previously from rabbit (27Spafford J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1996474098,"Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was performed from Ser-130 to Leu-160 in the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Helicobacter pylori to determine the topology of each residue and to identify functionally important residues. All of the mutants were based on cysteine-less NhaA (Cys-less NhaA), which functions very similarly to the wild-type protein, and were expressed at a level similar to Cys-less NhaA. Discontinuity of [14C]N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-reactive residues suggested that TM4 comprises residues Gly-135 to Val-156. Even within TM4, NEM reactivity was high for I136C, D141C to A143C, L146C, M150C, and G153C to R155C. These residues are thought to be located on one side of the α-helical structure of TM4 and to face a putative water-filled channel. Pretreatment of intact cells with membrane-impermeable maleimide did not inhibit [14C]NEM binding to the NEM-reactive residues within TM4, suggesting that the putative channel opens toward the cytoplasm. NEM reactivity of the A143C mutant was significantly inhibited by Li+. The T140C and D141C mutants showed lower affinity for Na+ and Li+ as transport substrates, but their maximal antiporter velocities (Vmax) were relatively unaffected. Whereas the I142C and F144C mutants completely lost their Li+/H+ antiporter activity, I142C had a lower Vmax for the Na+/H+ antiporter. F144C exhibited a markedly lower Vmax and a partially reduced affinity for Na+. These results suggest that Thr-140, Asp-141, and Phe-144 are located in the end portion of a putative water-filled channel and may provide the binding site for Na+, Li+, and/or H+. Furthermore, residues Ile-142 to Phe-144 may be important for the conformational change that accompanies ion transport in NhaA. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was performed from Ser-130 to Leu-160 in the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA from Helicobacter pylori to determine the topology of each residue and to identify functionally important residues. All of the mutants were based on cysteine-less NhaA (Cys-less NhaA), which functions very similarly to the wild-type protein, and were expressed at a level similar to Cys-less NhaA. Discontinuity of [14C]N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-reactive residues suggested that TM4 comprises residues Gly-135 to Val-156. Even within TM4, NEM reactivity was high for I136C, D141C to A143C, L146C, M150C, and G153C to R155C. These residues are thought to be located on one side of the α-helical structure of TM4 and to face a putative water-filled channel. Pretreatment of intact cells with membrane-impermeable maleimide did not inhibit [14C]NEM binding to the NEM-reactive residues within TM4, suggesting that the putative channel opens toward the cytoplasm. NEM reactivity of the A143C mutant was significantly inhibited by Li+. The T140C and D141C mutants showed lower affinity for Na+ and Li+ as transport substrates, but their maximal antiporter velocities (Vmax) were relatively unaffected. Whereas the I142C and F144C mutants completely lost their Li+/H+ antiporter activity, I142C had a lower Vmax for the Na+/H+ antiporter. F144C exhibited a markedly lower Vmax and a partially reduced affinity for Na+. These results suggest that Thr-140, Asp-141, and Phe-144 are located in the end portion of a putative water-filled channel and may provide the binding site for Na+, Li+, and/or H+. Furthermore, residues Ile-142 to Phe-144 may be important for the conformational change that accompanies ion transport in NhaA. Na+/H+ antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins that are located in the cytoplasmic and organelle membranes of most cells from bacteria to humans (1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Bakker E.

Among the three antiporters, EC NhaA 1The abbreviations used are: EC NhaA, E. coli Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA; TM, transmembrane domain; Cys-less, cysteine-less; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HP NhaA, H. pylori Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: EC NhaA, E. coli Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA; TM, transmembrane domain; Cys-less, cysteine-less; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HP NhaA, H. pylori Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. plays a major role in regulating intracellular Na+ concentrations (1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Bakker E. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Procaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 3-24Google Scholar). Its activity is dependent on environmental pH and increases markedly as pH is elevated from neutral to alkaline. At pH 7.0, EC NhaA has negligible antiporter activity, whereas at pH 8.5, it is enhanced by three orders of magnitude (8Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NhaA gene has been cloned (5Karpel R. Olami Y. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10408-10414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and essential residues for ion transport have been deduced on the basis of its primary structure (10Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Noumi T. Inoue H. Sakurai T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The topological arrangement of 12 putative transmembrane helices (TM) in EC NhaA has been modeled on the basis of its hydropathy profile and its secondary structure as revealed by phoA fusion experiments (12Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and also on the basis of its tertiary structure, elucidated using crystallographic analysis at a 7-Å resolution (13Williams K.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For EC NhaA, three Asp residues in the fourth and the fifth TMs (TM4 and TM5) are essential for ion transport (10Inoue H.

Although extensive studies have been performed, the structure-function relationships that underlie mechanisms of ion transport and pH sensing are not fully understood.We have previously shown that NhaA from Helicobacter pylori (HP NhaA) functions in E. coli where it exhibits a profile of pH sensing that is very different from that of EC NhaA (16Inoue H. Sakurai T. Ujike S. Tsuchiya T. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HP NhaA is constitutively active from weak acidic to alkaline pH (pH 6.0–8.5) in contrast to EC NhaA, which functions at alkaline pH (pH 7.5–8.5), even though they have extensive homology at the primary sequence level. We have analyzed the molecular basis underlying this difference in HP and EC NhaA pH sensitivity in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of pH sensing by antiporters. Chimeric and random-mutational analyses have shown that the difference is not determined by the unique sequence found in the loop structure between TM8 and TM9 (loop 8) of HP NhaA but by the limited TMs (TM4, TM8, and TM10), which are highly conserved between the two NhaAs (17Inoue H. Tsuboi Y. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Tsuboi Y. Inoue H. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21467-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations causing severe reduction of activity at any pH range have been mapped to two distant regions in the primary sequence, TM4–5 and TM10–11 (18Tsuboi Y. Inoue H. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21467-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggested that TM4, TM5, TM10, and TM11 together constitute the essential components of the ion transport pathway (18Tsuboi Y. Inoue H. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21467-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).TM4 contains residues important for both antiporter activity and pH sensing. However, the topological characteristics of these residues have not been described. Based on the hydrophilicity analyses of TM4 residues, we have proposed that residues between Ile-136 and Lys-154 are located within the hydrophobic intramembrane region (Fig. 1) (16Inoue H. Sakurai T. Ujike S. Tsuchiya T. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the precise location of TM4 residues within the membrane is not known. Previous studies have shown that several residues within putative transmembrane domains of several transporters are located on the surface of a water-filled channel, possibly forming a part of a solute transport pathway (19Yan R.T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining the hydrophilic environment of all of the TM4 residues is essential for understanding the role of TM4 residues in forming a putative channel required for ion transport and pH-sensing mechanisms.In this study, to investigate this phenomenon, we performed scanning cysteine substitution and chemical modifications of residues within TM4 and the neighboring loop regions of HP NhaA. 22 residues between Gly-135 and Val-156 were predicted to form a hydrophobic membrane domain. However, several residues within this region (Ile-136, Asp-141 to Ala-143, Leu-146, Met-150, Gly-153 to Arg-155) residing on one side of a putative α-helix are located in a hydrophilic environment, possibly facing a water-filled ion transport channel. Furthermore, the N-terminal region of TM4, including Thr-140 and Asp-141, was shown to be critical for binding of Na+ and Li+ as transport substrates and for conformational changes following substrate binding. These results provide an important structural insight into the ion transport pathways and transport mechanisms of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (KOD) were purchased from TOYOBO (Osaka, Japan). LA-Taq polymerase was from TaKaRa Bio, Inc. (Shiga, Japan). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. N-[ethyl-1-14C]Maleimide (1.3 GBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other reagents and materials were of the highest commercially available grade.Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—E. coli strains KNabc [ΔnhaA::Kmr, ΔnhaB::Emr, ΔchaA::Cmr, supE, hsdΔ5, thi, Δ (lac-proAB)/F′ (traΔ36, proAB+, laclq, lacΔM15)] (22Nozaki K. Inaba K. Kuroda T. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and JM109 (23Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) were used to express HP NhaA mutant molecules and construct various plasmids, respectively. Cells were cultured in Luria broth (LB) (24Kanazawa H. Miki T. Tamura F. Yura T. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) containing 87 mm KCl instead of NaCl. For growth on solid plates, agar (1.5% w/v) was added to the medium. Transformants were selected using an appropriate antibiotic. For analysis of salt tolerance in KNabc transformed with various plasmids, various concentrations of NaCl or LiCl were added to LB plates containing 87 mm NaCl. The plates and broth cultures were incubated at 37 °C.Construction of Expression Plasmids—Construction of HP NhaA expression plasmids derived from pBR322 (pBR-HP) has been described previously (16Inoue H. Sakurai T. Ujike S. Tsuchiya T. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These plasmids express HP NhaA with a FLAG epitope tag at the 3′ end of the coding region and under the control of the tet promoter. NhaAs expressed from these vectors contain an additional sequence, GMQ, at the junction of the FLAG tag sequence (DYKDDDDK).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutations were introduced using the two-step PCR method (25Inoue H. Noumi T. Shimomura T. Takimoto N. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1998; 21: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or the oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed dual amber method (26Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Yasojima K. Tsujimura A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cys-less HP nhaA was constructed by replacing two native cysteine residues with serine (C226S/C344S). DNA fragments encoding Cys-less HP NhaA were cloned into pBR-HP instead of native HP NhaA. pKF19k harboring the gene of FLAG-tagged Cys-less HP NhaA was used as a DNA template for the oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed dual amber mutagenesis method. DNA fragments encoding HP NhaA, in which a single cysteine had been introduced, were ligated back into the corresponding sites of pBR-HP. The DNA sequence of all of the mutagenized nhaA was verified by sequencing.Immunological Detection of FLAG-tagged NhaAs—The expression of HP NhaA and its mutated derivatives was detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (17Inoue H. Tsuboi Y. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Miki J. Kusuki H. Tsugumi S. Kanazawa H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4227-4232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Membrane Vesicles and Na+/H+or Li+/H+Antiporter Assay—Membrane vesicles from E. coli cells, which had been transformed with various expression plasmids were prepared as described previously (17Inoue H. Tsuboi Y. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles (100 μg) were resuspended in 2 ml of assay buffer (10 mm Tricine and 140 mm KCl adjusted to the desired pH with KOH) as described previously (10Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Proton flow was measured by monitoring 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) fluorescence quenching after the addition of potassium lactate (5 mm, pH 7.0), a substrate of the electron transport respiratory chain (22Nozaki K. Inaba K. Kuroda T. Tsuda M. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fluorescence dequenching after the addition of 5 mm NaCl or LiCl was monitored to measure antiporter activity. Fluorescence was measured with a fluorospectrophotometer (JASCO FP-750, JASCO Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).[14C]NEM Modification—The [14C]NEM binding experiment was performed using sonicated membranes prepared from E. coli KNabc cells expressing Cys-less NhaA or single cysteine mutants. Sonicated membranes (0.5 mg of protein) were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm MOPS-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.5 mm [14C]NEM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 5 or 30 min. To observe substrate-induced conformational change, 0.1 m KCl in the membrane sample buffer was replaced with 0.1 m LiCl. The modification reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 20 mm dithiothreitol to the reaction mixture followed by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C. The resultant precipitate was resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. The suspension was centrifuged at 178,000 × g for 30 min with an Airfuge (Beckman) to remove insoluble substances. The resultant supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) and protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in 15 μl of 0.125 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed with the solubilized aliquot according to the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar). The 14C-labeled NhaA protein was visualized and quantitated using a BAS1800 bioimaging system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).Prevention of [14C]NEM Binding by 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2–2′-disulfonic Acid (AMS)—5 μl of 100 mm AMS (final concentration, 5 mm) or an equivalent volume of distilled water was added to 100 μl of a suspension of intact E. coli KNabc cells expressing mutant NhaA or to a sonicated membrane suspension containing a mutant NhaA followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 20 μlof 3mm [14C]NEM (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added to the reaction mixture followed by incubation for 20 min, and then the mixture was diluted with 900 μl of the same buffer containing 5 mm of unlabeled NEM. In the case of the cell suspension, the cells were collected and washed once with the same buffer immediately after dilution and then were disrupted by brief sonication. The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation and solubilized, and NhaA proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Densities of radioactive bands following pretreatment with AMS were compared with those without AMS treatment.DNA Manipulation and Other Procedures—Preparation of plasmids, digestion by restriction endonucleases, ligation of the DNA fragments by T4 DNA ligase, and other techniques related to DNA handling were performed according to published procedures (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of DNA fragments cloned into the various expression plasmids in this study were determined using an automatic DNA sequencer (Model 377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Rabdll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSConstruction and Expression of Single Cysteine Mutants of HP NhaA—Prior to cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of HP NhaA, we constructed a Cys-less mutant NhaA by substituting serine for two native cysteine residues (Cys-226 and Cys-344) (Fig. 1). When this Cys-less HP NhaA was expressed in the Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient mutant E. coli strain, KNabc, the Na+- and Li+-sensitive phenotype of KNabc growth was modified and became similar to that of wild-type HP NhaA (data not shown). Since the Na+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiporter activities and pH dependence of Cys-less HP NhaA were almost the same as those of wild-type HP NhaA (data not shown), we used this protein as a starting material for the generation of a mutant series with single cysteine substitutions.Residues located in the putative TM4 of HP NhaA (Leu-136 to Lys-154) and in its adjacent loop regions (Ser-130 to Gly-135 and Arg-155 to Leu-160) were sequentially replaced with cysteine (Fig. 1). Expression vectors for each of these single cysteine NhaA mutants were introduced into KNabc, and the expression levels of the mutant NhaA proteins in the membrane fraction were detected using antibodies against the FLAG tag, which was fused to their C termini. Although there was some variation in the expression level of the mutant NhaA proteins, all of the mutant proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of Cys-less HP NhaA with the exception of P157C (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Expression of a single cysteine mutant NhaAs in E. coli membranes. Membrane proteins (2 μg) from the KNabc strain transformed with the plasmid expressing FLAG epitope-tagged Cys-less or single cysteine mutant NhaAs were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide). As a negative control, membrane proteins of pBR322 transformants were also analyzed. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a GVHP filter and probed with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and immunoreactive bands were visualized (16Inoue H. Sakurai T. Ujike S. Tsuchiya T. Murakami H. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Labeling of Introduced Cysteines with [14C]NEM—To determine the topology of the residues in TM4 and adjacent loops, we assessed the labeling of single cysteine residues in the cysteine-scanning mutant NhaA series with [14C]NEM (Fig. 3). Since maleimide reagents including NEM react with the deprotonated form of sulfhydryl groups and since the reaction requires a water molecule as a proton acceptor (21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), this procedure was used for topological definition of the membrane domain. On the basis of hydropathy analysis, the boundaries between TM4 and its adjacent loop regions were predicted to occur at Gly-135 and Arg-155 (Fig. 1). However, on the loop 3 side, sequential reactivity of NEM was observed up to F134C, although the reactivity of S130C was relatively low (Fig. 3). Therefore, we concluded that the actual boundary is Phe-134 rather than Gly-135. On the loop 4 side, although K154C, P157C, T158C, and A159C were highly NEM-reactive, R155C and V156C displayed relatively low and negligible reactivity, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that the transmembrane core of the helix runs from Pro-137 to Leu-152 at least. Since the minimal number of amino acids in a transmembrane helix is ∼20 (31Iwaki S. Tamura N. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22704-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the helix might be extended to Gly-135 and Val-156. Thus, in our model, TM4 is comprised of 22 residues (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Binding of [14C]NEM to the residues in TM4 and its flanking region. Sonicated membranes (0.5 mg protein) of E. coli cells expressing the cysteine-scanning mutants were incubated with 0.5 mm [14C]NEM for 5 min at 30 °C followed by solubilization and immunoprecipitation of the NhaA proteins using anti-FLAG antibodies. The protein bands were visualized after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the protein bands visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (lower panels), and the radioactive NhaA bands visualized with a BAS-1800 bioimaging analyzer (upper panels). B, the relative extents of [14C]NEM binding per NhaA protein were calculated from the band densities in A. The [14C]NEM binding is normalized to that of the A159C mutant, which is considered as being representative of typical residues located in the hydrophilic loop regions based on the hydropathy profile. C, helical wheel projection of the residues in TM4 viewed from the periplasmic side. The residues of cysteine mutants that gave high or low (not none) NEM reactivity in Fig. 3B are depicted as outlined letters on a black background or a gray background, respectively. Residues, which displayed 20–40% reactivity (bold lines in B), are depicted by a gray circle. Residues having greater than 40% reactivity are shown by a black circle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Many NEM-reactive residues exist within TM4, even though the region has been demonstrated to traverse the lipid bilayer based on phoA fusion experiments (12Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). I136C and two contiguous residues, I142C and A143C, which follow the essential Asp-141 (10Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were highly reactive (Fig. 3, A and B). Asp-141 exhibited lower albeit significant reactivity. The NEM-reactive residues, L146C, M150C, G153C, and K154C, also appeared periodically, every three or four residues, from A143C to the C terminus of TM4 (Fig. 3, A and B). These C-terminal-reactive residues were mapped to one side of a putative α-helix based on a helical wheel model of TM4 (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that one side of the α-helix in the C-terminal half of TM4 located in the region following Asp-141 faces a water-filled channel-like structure (Fig. 9).Fig. 9Schematic illustration of topological arrangement of TM4 residues facing a putative hydrophilic channel. TM4 comprises 20–22 residues from Gly-135 to Val-156. The core domain within the membrane may be from Pro-137 to Leu-152. In TM4, those residues facing a putative water-filled channel are shaded. Important residues for ion transport are shown by enlarged letters. The white letter A within a black circle indicates Ala-143 where the substrate-induced conformational change was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of [14C]NEM Labeling by Membrane-impermeable Maleimide AMS—To next determine whether the residues that face the putative channel-like structure are accessible from the cytoplasmic side or the periplasmic side, we tested the effects of the membrane-impermeable reagent, maleimide AMS, on NEM labeling of single cysteine mutants in intact cells. Since AMS is a more hydrophilic and bulky molecule than NEM, it is unable to pass through the lipid bilayer (21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, in intact cells expressing a single cysteine mutant NhaA, pretreatment by AMS should only block NEM labeling of cysteine residues that face the periplasmic side and not the cytoplasmic side (21Kimura-Someya T. Iwaki S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32806-32811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As expected, the labeling of Q131C, which resides on the periplasmic loop (loop 3), was completely inhibited by AMS treatment (Fig. 4). Labeling of I136C, also located on the periplasmic side, was blocked by AMS. In contrast, the labeling of the other residues for all of the cysteine-scanning mutants of NhaA was not prevented extensively by AMS. These results indicate that the residues facing the putative water-filled channel from Ile-142 onwards are not accessible from the periplasmic side and suggests that the putative pore opens onto the cytoplasmic side. The results also suggest that the putative pore ends in the proximity of Asp-141, because only the residues oriented on the N-terminal side (i.e. the periplasmic side) of Asp-141 are accessible from the periplasmic side.

Here we present evidence that PI(4,5)P2 levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are down-regulated by the homologous and functionally redundant proteins TAX4 and IRS4. The EPS15 homology domain-containing proteins TAX4 and IRS4 bind and activate the PI(4,5)P 5-phosphatase INP51 via an Asn-Pro-Phe motif in INP51. Furthermore, the INP51-TAX4/IRS4 complex negatively regulates the cell integrity pathway. Thus, TAX4 and IRS4 are novel regulators of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4,5)P2-dependent signaling. The interaction between TAX4/IRS4 and INP51 is analogous to the association of EPS15 with the 5-phosphatase synaptojanin 1 in mammalian cells, suggesting that EPS15 is an activator of synaptojanin 1.

Phosphoinositides are conserved from yeast to mammals as second messengers. They mediate the signal transduction involved in many different cellular processes and thereby comprise a complex signaling system (1Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). One of the more thoroughly studied phosphoinositides is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). 1The abbreviations used are: PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; EH, EPS115 homology; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin A; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; TOR, target of rapamycin; TORC, TOR complex; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ts, temperature sensitive. 1The abbreviations used are: PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; EH, EPS115 homology; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; HA, hemagglutinin A; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; TOR, target of rapamycin; TORC, TOR complex; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ts, temperature sensitive. PI(4,5)P2 was originally shown to be cleaved by phospholipase C to generate the two second messengers inositol-1,4,5-phosphate and diacylglycerol (2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar). More recently, uncleaved PI(4,5)P2 has also been shown to act as a second messenger (3Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uncleaved PI(4,5)P2 acts by binding conserved domains in target proteins, such as the pleckstrin homology domain (4Gascard P. Sauvage M. Sulpice J.C. Giraud F.

In mammalian cells, PI(4,5)P2 signaling is important in regulating vesicular transport, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and the regulation of ion channels (7Cremona O. De Camilli P. J.

In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PI(4,5)P2 is also essential and is produced by MSS4, the sole phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase in yeast (10Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T.

ROM2 contains a pleckstrin homology domain that binds PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane, thus mediating the localization of ROM2 (12Ozaki K. Tanaka K. Imamura H. Hihara T. Kameyama T. Nonaka H.

Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ROM2 has two homologs, ROM1 and TUS1, which also harbor putative pleckstrin homology domains (12Ozaki K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ROM2 and its homologs are components of the cell integrity pathway necessary for the cellular response to cell wall damage induced by stress such as heat shock (14Schmelzle T. Helliwell S.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The response to cell wall damage includes a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and an up-regulation of cell wall synthesis (16Igual J.C. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H.

Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Activation of the cell integrity pathway is mediated by its most upstream component, the cell wall sensor WSC1, which signals to ROM2 (19Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl.

Subsequently, ROM2 stimulates the exchange of GDP to GTP in the Rho GTPase RHO1, thereby activating RHO1 (12Ozaki K. Tanaka K. Imamura H. Hihara T. Kameyama T. Nonaka H. Hirano H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) SAC7 converts RHO1-GTP into the inactive GDP-bound form (21Schmidt A. Bickle M.

Activation of the MAP kinase MPK1 induces transcription of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis such as CHS3 encoding chitin synthase III, which is important for cell wall repair (16Igual J.C.

The TOR signaling network contains two structurally and functionally distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and 2 (TORC2) (27Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L.

Interestingly, the sole phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase MSS4 is required for the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, and overexpression of MSS4 restores growth in conditional TORC2 mutants (10Desrivieres S.

Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the link between PI(4,5)P2 and TORC2 in the regulation of ROM2 and, ultimately, the actin cytoskeleton is not understood. The phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases INP51, INP52, and INP53 (also known as SJL1–3) mediate the turnover of PI(4,5)P2 and are implicated in several cellular processes such as cell wall biosynthesis and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (31Stolz L.E.

Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Heat shock has been observed to induce an increase in PI(4,5)P2 levels, suggesting the existence of a mechanism regulating the levels of this phosphoinositide (10Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J.

However, the nature of this regulatory mechanism and, more specifically, the possible regulation of the phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases are not well understood. In mammalian cells, the INP family orthologue synaptojanin 1 interacts with several proteins involved in endocytosis in nerve terminals (33Haffner C. Takei K. Chen H. Ringstad N. Hudson A.

To investigate the regulation of PI(4,5)P2 turnover in S. cerevisiae, we focused on INP51, INP52, and INP53 and their role in PI(4,5)P2 signaling linked to the cell integrity pathway and the TORC2 pathway. Here we present evidence for two novel positive regulators of the PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase INP51, the redundant EPS15 homology (EH) domain-containing proteins TAX4 and IRS4. INP51 associates with TAX4 or IRS4 to form a complex important for the turnover of PI(4,5)P2 linked to the cell integrity pathway.

The resuspended cells were diluted in a 10-fold dilution series. 3 μl of each dilution (10×, 100×, 1,000× and 10,000× diluted) were spotted on a YPD plate. Growth was scored after 2 days at 30 or 37 °C. INP51 Purification—Cells expressing a tagged or untagged (mock purification) version of INP51 were grown in 5 liters of YPD to an A600 of 0.8 at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with cold water before resuspension in lysis buffer. The lysis buffer used to prepare cell extracts contained phosphate-buffered saline, 5% glycerol. 0.5% Tween 20, phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysate was obtained by glass bead lysis. Cell lysates containing ∼700 mg of protein were cleared with a 5-min, 500 × g spin, diluted with lysis buffer to 10 mg/ml, and subsequently passed over an ion exchange resin (SP-Sepharose). The resin was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with lysis buffer containing 50 mm potassium acetate. Bound proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 600 mm potassium acetate. The eluate was precleared over a protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column prior to the addition of anti-HA (12CA5) cross-linked to protein ASepharose beads. After 5 times washing with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by silver staining (41Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7814) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein bands by mass spectrometry was performed as described (27Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A.

Immunoprecipitation—Yeast extracts from cells (500-ml culture in YPD grown to A600 of 0.8 at 30 °C) expressing tagged proteins of interest were prepared as described above. An aliquot of extract containing 10 mg of protein was adjusted to 1 ml with lysis buffer plus inhibitors. For immunoprecipitations, 20 μl of anti-HA (12CA5) or anti-Myc (9E10) cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads were added and mixed for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and resuspended in 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gele sample buffer for electrophoresis. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% dry milk powder in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with primary antibody anti-HA (clone 12CA5) or anti-Myc (clone 9E10) (1:10000 in blocking solution). Subsequently tagged proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphoinositide Analysis—Yeast cells were diluted 5 × 104/ml in SD medium lacking inositol containing 10 μC/ml [3H]inositol and grown to a density of 2–4 × 106/ml (12–16 h). 2-ml aliquots were taken and mixed with 2 ml of MeOH. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and processed as described previously (42Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Douglas M.R. Sayers L.G. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Differential Centrifugation—Differential centrifugation was performed as described previously (43Kaiser C.A. Chen E.J. Losko S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Logarithmically growing cells containing INP51-HA, TAX4-Myc, or IRS4-Myc were fixed for 2 h in the growth medium supplemented with formaldehyde (3.7% final) and potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm final, pH 6.5). Cells were washed and resuspended in sorbitol buffer (1.2 m sorbitol and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5). Cell walls were digested for 45 min at 37 °C in sorbitol buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (20 mm final) and zymolyase 20T (12.5 mg/ml; Seigagaku Corporation). Spheroblasts were fixed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and permeabilized with PBT (53 mm Na2HPO4, 13 mm NaH2PO4, 75 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunofluorescence directed against the HA epitope was performed by application of a primary antibody anti-HA (clone 12CA5) or anti-Myc (clone 9E10) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBT for 2 h and, subsequently, the application of a Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1,000 in PBT for 90 min. Washed cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (100× objective). Immunofluorescent detection of FKS1 was performed as described previously (17Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). MAP Kinase Activation Assay—YPD cultures of logarithmically growing cells at 24 or 39 °C were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared as described previously (44Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of extracts were determined by using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were denatured by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. A total of 25 μg of protein (for MPK1 protein detection) or 40 μg of protein (for phosphorylated MAP kinase detection) was loaded for standard SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and Western blot. For immunodetection, a goat anti-MPK1 antibody (clone yN-19, 1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a rabbit antiphospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling) were used. The anti-MPK1 and anti-phospho-MAP kinase were verified to specifically recognize activated MPK1 under heat stress conditions (data not shown). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (anti-MPK1) or anti-rabbit (anti-phospho-MAP kinase) secondary antibody and detection by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The nitrocellulose membrane used for the Western blot was stained with Coomassie Blue for the visualization of total protein. Actin Staining—Logarithmically growing cells were fixed in formaldehyde (3.7%) and potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.5) and stained with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize actin, as described previously (45Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Chitin Staining—1 ml of cells at an A600 of 0.5 were collected by centrifugation and washed with water. Cells were then incubated in a solution with 0.5 mg/ml calcofluor white (Sigma) for 5 min to visualize chitin. To remove residual calcofluor white, cells were washed twice with water. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (100× objective). Disruption of INP51 Restores Growth of a tor2 Mutant—To understand further how the turnover of PI(4,5)P2 is important for PI(4,5)P2 signaling, we tested whether the phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase INP51, INP52, or INP53 antagonizes MSS4 signaling. We asked if the lack of any INP gene mimics MSS4 overexpression in suppressing a TOR2 signaling defect. A deletion of each INP gene was introduced into a temperaturesensitive tor2 (tor2ts) mutant defective in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The double mutants were grown at permissive (30 °C) and restrictive (37 °C) temperatures to determine whether an INP mutation can suppress the tor2ts mutation. Deletion of only INP51, INP52, or INP53 conferred no growth defect at any temperature (data not shown). Interestingly, the deletion of INP51, but not the deletion of INP52 or INP53, suppressed the growth defect of tor2ts cells (data not shown). The inp51 tor2ts cells grew almost as well as wild-type cells and as well as tor2ts cells overexpressing MSS4 (Fig. 1). This result suggests that INP51, but not INP52 or INP53, antagonizes the role of MSS4 in the TORC2 signaling pathway. Curiously, although inp51 suppressed the growth defect of tor2ts, it did not appear to suppress the actin defect of the tor2ts mutant (data not shown). INP51 Synthetically Interacts with Mutations Affecting the Cell Integrity Pathway—The finding that an inp51 deletion suppresses the growth defect of a tor2ts mutant is similar to the previous observation that activation of the cell integrity pathway suppresses the growth defect of a tor2ts mutant (15Bickle M. Delley P.A. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and suggests that INP51 may antagonize the cell integrity pathway. Thus, we investigated whether an inp51 mutation interacts with mutations affecting components of the cell integrity pathway. Specifically, we asked if an inp51 deletion suppresses or enhances the effect of mutations in WSC1, ROM2, SAC7, or MPK1. We observed that the deletion of INP51 suppresses the growth defects of wsc1 and rom2 cells at 37 and 30 °C, the restrictive temperatures of these mutants, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Conversely, the combination of inp51 with sac7 conferred a synthetic growth defect (Fig. 2C). Finally, the growth defect of an mpk1 mutant grown at restrictive temperature (38 °C) was not suppressed by INP51 deletion (data not shown). The above results show that INP51 genetically interacts with at least some components of the cell integrity pathway. Deletion of INP51 suppresses mutations in positive components of the pathway (WSC1 and ROM2) and causes a synthetic defect when combined with a mutation in a negative element of the pathway (SAC7). The nature of these interactions suggests that the phosphoinositide phosphatase INP51 negatively regulates signaling through the cell integrity pathway. This conclusion is consistent with the previous conclusions (13Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Loewith R.

INP51 Associates with the EH Domain-containing Proteins TAX4 and IRS4 —In mammalian cells, the kinases and phosphatases that determine PI(4,5)P2 levels are regulated by interacting proteins (33Haffner C.

An indication that the level of PI(4,5)P2 is regulated in S. cerevisiae has been suggested previously by the observation that PI(4,5)P2 levels increase upon heat shock (10Desrivieres S. Cooke F.T.

However, proteins regulating such kinases and phosphatases in S. cerevisiae remain to be identified. To identify potential INP51 regulatory proteins, we opted to isolate INP51-interacting proteins by using a biochemical approach described previously (27Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S.

A functional, epitope-tagged version of INP51 (INP51-HA) was constructed and purified from yeast cell extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two homologous proteins were co-purified with INP51, IRS4, and an uncharacterized protein encoded by the open reading frameYJL083w that we named TAX4 (Fig. 3). The interaction between INP51 and TAX4 or IRS4 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation using epitope-tagged versions of TAX4 (TAX4Myc) and IRS4 (IRS4-Myc), as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4). We did not observe interaction between TAX4 and IRS4 by coimmunoprecipitation of the heterologously tagged versions (TAX4-TAP and IRS4-Myc) of these proteins (data not shown). IRS4 was identified previously in a screen for mutants defective in rDNA silencing (52Smith J.S. Caputo E. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3184-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Untagged TAX4 has an apparent molecular mass of 77 kDa and a predicted size of 68.7 kDa. Untagged IRS4 is observed as two bands between 70 and 75 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted size of 68.8 kDa. TAX4 and IRS4 have an overall identity of 31% and contain a C-terminal EH domain. The EH domains of TAX4 and IRS4 are 64% identical. The EH domain, conserved from yeast to human, is a protein-protein interaction domain of ∼100 amino acids that interacts specifically with short motifs containing an asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) core (53Wong W.T.

Here we report the crystal structure of E. coli MoaB at a 1.6-Å resolution. Amino acid sequence and structural similarities with other members of the Moco pathway strengthen the possibility of a role for MoaB. Cloning and Protein Purification—E. coli MoaB was cloned, expressed, and purified using standard procedures (25Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H.

The hexahistidine tag was removed before crystallization. The purified MoaB protein was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and concentrated using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). Before crystallization, any particulate matter was removed from the sample by passage through a 0.2-μm Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filtration device (Millipore). Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Two microliters of the dialyzed MoaB protein were mixed with an equal volume of precipitant containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Droplets were equilibrated against the precipitant with hanging drop vapor diffusion, and crystals grew after 2-5 days at 21 °C. For diffraction studies, the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol added to the crystallization buffer as the cryoprotectant. The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P321, with the cell parameters at 100 K being a = b = 69.11Å, c = 126.22Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, and contained two molecules of protein/asymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient (26Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) was 2.33, which corresponds to the solvent content of ∼46% in crystals. A two-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment with crystals of Se-Met-derivatized protein was carried out on the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center Collaborative Access Team of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The absorption peak and the rising inflection point were determined by calculating and plotting f′ and f″ values against energy (27Evans G. Pettifer R.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 8286Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) from the fluorescence spectrum measured for a test crystal. Later, higher resolution data were collected from the unexposed part of the same crystal, which had been stored in liquid nitrogen. All crystallographic data were measured with the custom built 3 × 3 tiled charge-coupled device detector (28Westbrook E.M. Naday I.

Divalent cations were added as MgCl2, CaCl2, or MnCl2 to a concentration of 5 mm. After 15 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate in binding buffer and incubation on ice for 15 min. Pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with saturated ammonium sulfate, and dried. The protein was then resuspended in 10 μl of binding buffer, and the precipitated GTP was monitored by scintillation counting using total input radioactivity as a standard. Determination of the GTPase activity was essentially as previously described (31Scheffers D.J. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, pelleted proteins were resuspended in binding buffer and hydrolyzed by adding perchloric acid to 6% concentration for 15 min. The pH was adjusted to 3.5 with potassium phosphate, the reactions were clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Selecto Scientific Inc.). A GDP standard was enzymatically derived by the incubation of [α-32P]GTP substrate with thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) in the manufacturer's supplied reaction buffer. Separation of phosphorylated reaction products was achieved by TLC using 0.65 m KH2PO4 as running buffer. Plates were dried and exposed to Fuji RX film.

An inspection of the log-likelihood gradient maps revealed the non-isotropic nature of these sites. After phase refinement and accounting for this anisotropy, two other Se sites were also located. However, they were disordered to the extent that the phases did not improve significantly (Table II).

Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The remainder of the model was built and all side chains were corrected manually. This model was then refined against the 1.6-Å resolution data with several macrocycles of CNS and subsequently with REFMAC5 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar) with the access code 1MKZ. Spatial Model of MoaB—The current model of MoaB consists of two crystallographically independent molecules, A and B. Molecule A contains 170 amino acid residues and has Met1 and Ser2 absent. Molecule B has 171 residues, with Met1 absent. Gly171 and Ser172, adducts of cloning, were clearly visible in the electron density maps of both molecules. The Arg22 and Glu100 side chains in molecule A were incomplete because of poor electron densities, and in molecule B the Ser2, Gln3, Arg21, Arg22, Glu83, and Glu112 side chains were incomplete for the same reason. The following side chains were modeled in alternative conformations, Molecule A, Thr6, Glu24, Glu25, Thr28, Gln38, Glu83, Arg97, Ser110, Glu113, Thr118, and Ile133 and molecule B, Thr6, Thr28, Leu92, Arg97, Glu100, Se-Met108, Thr118, Ile133, and Arg160. Phe134 in the hydrophobic core of the molecule was replaced by leucine, probably as a mutation introduced by a polymerase chain reaction. Seven sulfate ions, three acetate molecules, and 238 water molecules were also revealed in the model. Four of the sulfates are bound to molecule A and three to molecule B. The MoaB monomer is ∼32 × 35 × 50 Å3 and consists of a six-strand β sheet, six α helices, and one 310 helix packed in a modified Rossman fold (Fig 2A). The twisted β sheet with a β2↑β1↑β3↑β6↑β5↓β4↑ topology is formed by five parallel β strands, β2 (residues 43-50), β1 (12-18), β3 (72-76), β6 (131-136), β4 (97-98), and one antiparallel β5 (124-128) inserted between β6 and a very short β4. The β sheet is sandwiched between four α helices, a1 (residues 23-40) and α5 (139-150) on one side and α2 (53-67) and α3 (86-92) on the other. The three remaining helices are α4 (99-115), a one-turn α6 (164-168), and a 310 helix (116-121). Helices α1 and α5 are distorted to various degrees. Each of the molecules in the asymmetric unit is incorporated in a compact trimer generated by the 3-fold crystallographic axis. In this formation, each monomer interacts with two other monomers (Fig. 2A). The buried surface area within each pair of monomers in the trimer is ∼1700 Å2, whereas the total surface area of a monomer is ∼8400 Å2. The major contributor to trimer stability is the insertion of the 310 helix of one monomer into the hydrophobic groove of another, which is formed between helices α4, α5, and the loop connecting α5 and α6. There is also a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between each pair of monomers (Table III).Table IIIPolar interactions in the interface within the trimerAtom in monomer 1Atom in monomer 2Distance(Å)O Glu83NH-2, Arg973.17OE-2 Glu89NH-2 Arg973.29OE-2 Glu89NZ Arg972.78OE-1 Glu89NH-1 Arg1223.30NH-2 Arg107OE-2 Glu1003.32NH-2 Arg107OE-2 Glu1042.98NZ Arg107OE-1 Glu1042.62OG Ser117N Cys1623.21OG Ser117O Cys1622.65OG-1 Thr116NE-2 Gln1542.89NE-2 Gln120OE-1 Gln1542.85 Open table in a new tab Two trimers form a hexamer, mostly through hydrophobic interactions at their interface. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that MoaB is a hexamer in solution as well (Fig. 3). In crystals, hexamerization buries a total of 2680 Å2 (32%) of the surface of each monomer. Strong interactions in the observed hexamer, together with the conservation of some residues involved in its formation (Table III), lead us to believe that the oligomeric state of MoaB in crystals is the same as in solution and is biologically relevant. The shape of the hexamer can be roughly described as an ∼62-Å-high cylinder with a radius of ∼35 Å. It has an equatorial groove formed between the trimers and three vertical clefts each formed by four molecules of the hexamer (Fig. 2B). The vertical clefts of the hexamer are lined with polar and mostly positively charged residues. The sides of the hexamer between each pair of vertical clefts are mostly neutral but with some negatively charged and a considerable number of hydrophobic residues. Three holes, ∼8 × 11 Å, on the sides of the hexamer lead to a large cave inside of it. The bases of the cylinder are rather flat, formed by three pairs of helices α1 and α5 from each monomer of the trimer. Judging by the area of buried surface and the number and character of interactions, the trimer appears to be a more stable formation than the hexamer. Analysis of Structural Similarities and the Putative Active Site—A structural similarity search using the DALI algorithm (37Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) indicated that MoaB shares a common fold with several proteins also involved in Moco synthesis. MoaB had highly significant similarity with the G domains of the multifunctional mammalian protein gephyrin (12Sola M. Kneussel M. Heck I.S. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and with the largest domain of MoeA (21Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Schrag J.D. Huang W. Sivaraman J. Smith C. Plamondon J. Larocque R. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Z-scores were 22.0, 21.9, 19.5, and 10.9, respectively. The corresponding root mean square deviations with these homologous structures were 1.38 Å for the 150 aligned Cα atoms, 1.47 Å for 147 Cα atoms, 1.73 Å for 147 Cα atoms, and 1.88 Å for 126 Cα atoms. In addition to the structural conservation of several proteins along the Moco pathway, oligomerization of these proteins is also remarkably well preserved (Fig. 4). Thus, the functional trimer of MogA (19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is also seen in gephyrin and Cnx1 oligomers, although the latter two are multidomain proteins. The MoaB hexamer comprises two such trimers (Fig. 4C). The extent of structural similarity between MoaB and the gephyrin and Cnx1 proteins is not reflected in amino acid sequence similarity. The sequence identities of MoaB with the G domains of Cnx1 and gephyrin, with MogA, and with the largest domain of MoeA are 33, 32, 27, and 21.5%, respectively. The structural similarity between MoaB and two other proteins from the Moco synthesis pathway, MoaC and MobA, is significantly lower, with respective root mean square deviations of 3.22 Å for 57 Cα atoms and 3.38 Å for 72 Cα atoms. A number of residues are highly conserved among MoaB orthologs. Asp27, Gly30, Asp85, Glu89, Gly126, Gly138, Ser139, and the motif Gly77-Gly78-Thr79-Gly80 are invariant in MoaB proteins from 22 genomes. Pro137, which is conserved in all but two of these sequences forms another conserved motif Pro137-Gly138-Ser139. Sixteen other residues are similar, indicating conservation of mostly hydrophobic and a few polar interactions. These residues are Ile/Leu/Val15, Leu/Ile/Val16, Ala/Thr87, Leu/Ile/Val94, Phe/Leu/Ile95, Arg/Lys97, Phe/Ile102, Phe/Ile106, Arg/His107, Ser/Thr121, Arg/Lys-122, residues 132-134, Met/Leu136, and Ile/Leu/Val150. When the MoaB sequence is aligned with the sequences of four other Moco synthesis proteins (referred to here as the Moco synthesis group), E. coli MogA, mammalian gephyrin, insect cinnamon, and plant Cnx1, 19 residues are invariant and a number of others show strong conservation (Fig. 5). Most of the invariant residues in the MoaB orthologs and the Moco synthesis group overlap, and only a few belong to either group exclusively. For example, the amino acids in positions (according to the MoaB sequence) 57, 90, 98, and 119 are invariant only in the Moco synthesis group, whereas the residues Gly30, Gly126, and Ser139 are highly conserved in MoaB orthologs only. All of the invariant residues throughout the MoaB orthologs and the Moco synthesis group are in or near the depression on the surface of MoaB between two monomers of the MoaB trimer (Fig. 2B) where two of the bound sulfates are found (Figs. 2B and 6). A very similar depression is found in the MogA, gephyrin, and Cnx1 structures. The polypeptide segments in the area of the MoaB surface depression are structurally the most preserved. These segments are formed by two motifs, Gly77-Gly78-Thr79-Gly80 and Pro137-Gly138-Ser139. In both the MoaB and MogA structures, these motifs are responsible for binding one of the sulfates (Fig. 6B). The Ser121 side chain, using the MoaB nomenclature, also contributes to binding. This residue is Ser or Thr in all MoaB orthologs conserving the interacting hydroxyl group. It is likely that these structurally conserved sites are occupied by phosphate groups of physiological compounds, a conjecture that is supported by the electron density map. As can be seen on Fig. 7, the electron density in this region cannot be entirely accounted for by Pho1. Remarkably, a very similar feature can be found in the structure of MogA. It has been suggested (19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that this could be a remnant of some phosphate-containing compound that was bound to the protein strongly enough so as not to be completely dissociated during purification and crystallization. Another sulfate in our structure is bound to a much less conserved region of the same depression (see Figs. 6 and 7). This region is generally quite flexible as indicated by high B factors. Part of this binding site is missing in the MogA model due to disorder as is the second bound ion. Two more sulfate ions in molecule A and one in molecule B are bound at the C terminus. It is difficult to assess the physiological importance of these ions, because two of the residues at this end are adducts of cloning. Labeled GTP Binding in Solution—Our modeling studies indicate that GTP may bind in the putative active site of MoaB. To establish reaction conditions for potential GTP binding by the MoaB protein, pH was modulated from 5.0 to 8.0, and [α-32P]GTP binding was monitored by protein precipitation followed by scintillation counting. GTP binding was most efficient at pH 7.5; therefore, reactions were performed at pH 7.5. Between 5 and 20% of input radioactivity was recovered, compared with less than 1% in mock reactions containing no protein, indicating the binding of GTP. Various divalent cations were added to determine their effect on MoaB GTP binding. The results showed that Mg2+ had no impact on binding, Ca2+ was inhibitory, and Mn2+ was stimulatory (Fig. 8A). GTPase activity was assessed by monitoring reaction products with thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 8B). Ca2+ again appeared to decrease overall activity, whereas Mn2+ acted both to increase overall binding and to modulate the ratio of GDP to GTP bound to the MoaB protein. In the presence of all three cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+) simultaneously, the stimulatory and modulatory effects of Mn2+ were abated. The exact role of MoaB in Moco biosynthesis is unknown. Strong structural similarity of MoaB to MogA and to G domains of mammalian gephyrin and plant Cnx1 (Fig. 4), which are also involved in the Moco biosynthesis, together with the sequence (Fig. 5) and spatial (Fig. 6) conservation of several residues, suggests a conserved function among these proteins. Although the bound molybdopterin has not been observed crystallographically, MogA, mammalian gephyrin, and plant Cnx1 bind to it with high affinity (12Sola M. Kneussel M. Heck I.S. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25294-25301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence and structural conservation in the surface depression suggests that this cavity may be a consensus binding site for molybdopterin. Liu et al. (19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) mutated several highly conserved residues in MogA to Ala to study their possible role in function. The MogA residues studied were Ser12, Asp49, Thr76, Arg81, Asp82, Ser107, and Ser117; the corresponding residues in MoaB are Ser19, Glu52, Thr79, Arg84, Asp85, Ser110, and Ser121, many of which are also well conserved (Figs. 4, 5, 6). The only mutations that had a measurable effect on MogA activity were D49A and D82A. They were assumed to disrupt catalysis, because molybdopterin binding in the two mutant proteins was shown to be improved (19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in MoaB, Glu52 and Asp85, are highly conserved both in primary and in tertiary structures and could play a similar role. In MogA, the proposed catalytic site contained electron density that was modeled as a sulfate ion but was proposed to correspond to the remnants of molybdopterin (19Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the MoaB structure, we observed very similar electron density (Fig. 7). Thus, the overall conservation of the binding site and of the interaction with the bound anion suggests that MoaB might bind MTP similarly to MogA, gephyrin, and Cnx1. The two presumed phosphate ions in MoaB could be consistent with a binding of GTP, which was easily modeled in the putative binding site of MoaB (Fig. 7). In this model, the α and γ phosphate groups of GTP are very close to the positions of the ions bound in the crystal structure. The putative catalytic Asp85 and Glu52 interact directly with these phosphates and are ideally poised to play a role, perhaps in the transformation of GTP into precursor Z. The base of the modeled GTP fits very well in the deep cavity, which is occupied by several water molecules in our crystal structure. The invariant Ser110 (Figs. 5 and 6) is located in a deep cleft where the base of the modeled GTP is bound (Fig. 7) and could interact with the N-1 and/or N-2 atoms of the latter. Our results show that MoaB indeed binds GTP (Fig. 8A), but with low affinity. The protein also possessed a low GTPase activity (Fig. 8B). Both binding and enzymatic potential were affected by some divalent ions, especially by Mn2+. Coincidentally, when some divalent ions were added in crystallization trials of another Moco synthesis protein, MoeA, Mn2+ appeared to have more drastic effects than the others. 2R. Sanishvili, unpublished results. Based on the possibility of binding various compounds of Moco pathway by MoaB and on its structural similarity with MogA and MoeA, we suggest that MoaB might play a substrate-shuttling role in the biosynthetic process. The intermediates of Moco synthesis and the cofactor are unstable, suggesting that the reactions, including the transfer of Moco to apomolybdoenzymes, occur while the corresponding compounds are still bound to the enzymes or to transporter/storage proteins, avoiding their dissociation into the external solvent. The protection of the substrates against solvent might occur through specific protein-protein interactions among the enzymes. It is becoming apparent that protein-protein interactions play crucial role in Moco biosynthesis. Magalon et al. (40Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that numerous protein pairs from the Moco pathway do form complexes in vivo, including MobB-MoeA, MobBMogA, MoeA-MogA, MoeA-MobA, and MobB-MobA and that some compounds of this pathway influence these interactions. Divalent ions, as shown here, can also influence binding of some compounds in the Moco pathway, although the mechanism of such influence is not yet clear. Possible involvement of MoaB in such protein-protein interactions is supported indirectly by several observations. First, in Synechococcus sp., the MoaC ortholog is fused to the homolog of either MoaB or MogA (41Rubio L.M. Flores E. Herrero A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1200-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, MogA and MoeA are combined to form the multifunctional protein gephyrin in mammals (13Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Cnx1 in plants (15Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and cinnamon in insects (14Kamdar K.P. Primus J.P. Shelton M.E. Archangeli L.L. Wittle A.E. Finnerty V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All of the protein-protein complexes observed in vivo (40Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, except for MobB-MobA, contain either MogA or MoeA, the structural homologs of MoaB. If MoaB can indeed bind GTP, precursor Z, or molybdopterin as discussed above and if it can form complexes with several other proteins of Moco synthesis pathway, it is tempting to suggest that MoaB plays a transporting and/or storage role. The presence of six independent binding sites in the MoaB hexamer would enhance the capacity of the protein in such a role. As reported by Schwarz et al. (39Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the G domain of Cnx1 can be present in both hexameric and trimeric forms. Because the trimer of Cnx1 G domain is very similar to the trimer of MoaB, and because the trimer of MoaB seems to be much more stable than its hexamer, it is possible that MoaB is also present in these two states of oligomerization. In our experiments with size-exclusion chromatography, MoaB was not found in a trimeric state. However, equilibrium between trimeric and hexameric states could be modulated by particular compounds, such as reaction substrates and products, ions, or other proteins of the pathway, all of which were absent in our experiments. In the trimeric state MoaB could bind MobB and MoeA much the same way as does MogA (40Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MogA could replace one-half of the MoaB hexamer, as shown on Fig. 4C. The largest structural differences between MoaB and MogA are at the bases of the MoaB hexamer, away from the trimer-trimer interface. Formation of such heterooligomers could be an effective way of substrate/product exchange along the Moco pathway without their dissociation into the external solvent. An inferred promiscuity of MoaB in protein-protein complex formation would be an asset for a transporter/storage protein. Summary—The crystal structure of E. coli MoaB was determined at 1.6-Å resolution. The strong structural similarity of MoaB with other Moco synthesis proteins, such as MogA, gephyrin, and Cnx1, along with the amino acid conservation patterns, indicated that MoaB might bind some of the same compounds, namely molybdopterin. The presence of a sulfate ion in the putative binding site, the experimental verification of MoaB/GTP binding, and modeling studies suggest that GTP and possibly precursor Z could bind in the same binding site. MoaB displayed very strong structural similarity to MogA and MoeA, two proteins that form numerous complexes with other proteins within the Moco synthesis pathway in E. coli, suggesting that MoaB might be part of such complexes and may play a role in transport or storage of several compounds in the Moco synthesis pathway."

Although this unusual RNA polymerase has no nucleic acid template, it can construct the CCA sequence one nucleotide at a time using CTP and ATP as substrates.

RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar) and is an essential biosynthetic activity in eukaryotes (7Aebi M. Kirchner G. Chen J.Y. Vijayraghavan U. Jacobson A. Martin N.C. Abelson J. J. Biol.

Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that both the class I and class II nucleotidyltransferase families include CCA-adding enzymes and poly(A) polymerases suggests that these two activities may interconvert over evolutionary time (6Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of pairs of CC- and A-adding enzymes in three widely different species of eubacteria is consistent with the postulated interconversion (14Tomita K. Weiner A.M.

Although class I and class II CCA-adding enzymes share little sequence similarity outside the signature structure, the mechanisms of action may be similar because tRNA binds almost identically to class I and class II enzymes (16Shi P.Y.

Soaking the class II B. stearothermophilus apoprotein crystals in CTP or ATP yielded cocrystals exhibiting a single nucleotide binding site that could function as a protein template by recognizing both CTP and ATP; this protein template, consisting of aspartate (Asp-154) and arginine (Arg-157) residues contributed by the neck domain, appears to “base pair” with the Watson-Crick face of both nucleotides (20Li F.

Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, the class I archaeal A. fulgidus enzyme apparently binds nucleotides nonspecifically, at least in the absence of tRNA substrates (18Xiong Y.

The CCA-adding enzyme is unique among members of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily because the enzyme synthesizes a precise sequence without using a nucleic acid template (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Cho H.D. Tomita K. Suzuki T. Weiner A.M. J. Biol.

Five different models have been proposed to explain CCA addition in the absence of a nucleic acid template (5Deutscher M.P. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 182-215Google Scholar, 16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4521-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). First, the two-site model postulates at least two nucleotide binding sites, one for CTP and the other for ATP (5Deutscher M.P. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 182-215Google Scholar, 23Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 469-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the poly(C) polymerase model argues that the CCA-adding enzyme is a poly(C) polymerase that undergoes a significant conformational change after two rounds of CTP addition; this conformational change would block further poly(C) synthesis and allow the addition of a single, possibly prebound ATP (25Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Ueda T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Seth M. Thurlow D.L. Hou Y.M.

Third, the “collaborative templating” model proposes that the growing 3′-end of the tRNA is progressively sequestered within a pocket near the active site; progressive packing of this pocket would create a binding site for the incoming nucleotide, and CCA synthesis would cease when the pocket was full (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fourth, the “scrunching-shuttling” model proposes that two identical subunits of the tRNA-induced tetrameric enzyme would function nonequivalently (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One subunit would add C74 and then “scrunch” or bulge C74 to allow the addition of C75; the CC terminus would then be long enough to “shuttle” to a nonequivalent subunit, which would add A76. Fifth, the “protein-assisted scrunching” model (20Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D. Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) proposes that the scrunching of the 3′-terminal CC (but not C74 alone) would cause a conformational change that switches the specificity of the nucleotide binding pocket from CTP to ATP. The scrunching-shuttling model of CCA addition attempts to explain the otherwise puzzling observation that the dimeric Sulfolobus shibatae CCA-adding enzyme is a tRNA-inducible tetramer that binds two tRNA molecules (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test whether the growing 3′-end of tRNA can shuttle within the tetramer from one quasi-equivalent active site that adds CTP to a second quasi-equivalent active site that adds ATP (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we performed intersubunit complementation experiments. Using the wild type S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme as well as three different mutants that block the addition of C74 (Y95V), the addition of A76 (H93V), or the addition of both CTP and ATP (K153A), we generated heterodimers by the reassortment of tagged and untagged subunits under partially denaturing conditions. We found that a single wild type subunit in an immobilized heterodimer can still add CCA; moreover, by cross-linking the tRNA substrate to the enzyme before or after subunit reassortment, we were able to show that the inactive subunit in an active heterodimer contacts the tRNA substrate. Thus, our data rule out shuttling models in which the 3′-end of the tRNA shuttles from one quasi-equivalent active site to another (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but are consistent with a protein-assisted scrunching model for a CCA addition 1H. D. Cho, C. L. Verlinde, and A. M. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. (20Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D. Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in which the scrunching of CC (but not C74 alone) switches the specificity of nucleotide binding site from CTP to ATP. Preparation of tRNA Substrates—tRNA substrates lacking A, CA, or CCA (tRNA-DCC, tRNA-DC, or tRNA-D, where D is the discriminator base) were prepared as described previously by in vitro transcription of FokI- or BbsI-digested pmBsDCCA encoding Bacillus subtilis tRNAAsp (17Cho H.D. Oyelere A.K. Strobel S.A. Weiner A.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following purification by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, the tRNA band was visualized by UV shadowing, excised, eluted, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Untagged and Histidine-tagged CCA-adding Enzymes—Untagged and histidine-tagged S. shibatae CCA-adding enzymes were expressed and purified as described previously 1H. D. Cho, C. L. Verlinde, and A. M. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. (6Yue D. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 895-908PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M.

All constructs expressing mutant enzymes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Hexahistidine-tagged enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) 2The abbreviation used is: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. resin (Qiagen), and untagged enzymes were purified by ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An untagged S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme migrated as a single band of 48 kDa upon SDS-10% PAGE, and the hexahistidine-tagged enzyme migrated as a single band of 50 kDa. Heterodimers of the S. shibatae CCA-adding Enzyme—To prepare heterodimers of the S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme, a 4:1 mixture of untagged and hexahistidine-tagged enzyme (100 μg/ml total protein concentration) in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was denatured by the addition of solid urea to 8 m followed by incubation at 20 °C for 1 h. The enzyme was renatured and the subunits were reassorted by diluting the urea to 6, 4, 2, and 0 m with Buffer B; heterodimers and hexahistidine-tagged homodimers were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin and recovered from the column as described (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). CCA Addition Assays—Standard assays for CTP or ATP incorporation were carried out in a 10-μl solution containing 100 mm glycine/NaOH (pH 9.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm CTP (or 50 μm ATP), 0.25 μm tRNA substrates, 0.05 μm [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) or [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 10 nm enzyme (17Cho H.D. Oyelere A.K. Strobel S.A. Weiner A.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 3 min, terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm sodium EDTA (pH 8.0), xylene cyanol (0.2%), and bromphenol blue (0.2%)), resolved by denaturing with 12% PAGE, and quantified by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). Use of Ni-NTA HisSorb Plates to Prevent tRNA-induced Tetramer Formation—To avoid tRNA-induced tetramer formation, heterodimers generated as described above were adsorbed on Ni-NTA HisSorb plates essentially as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Briefly, 200 μl of CCA-adding enzyme in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was added to each well of an Ni-NTA HisSorb plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the wells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween detergent to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The reaction volume was increased from 10 to 100 μl when the assay was performed on Ni-NTA HisSorb plates. The 100 μl reactions were identical to the standard 10-μl reactions, except that CTP and [α-32P]CTP were increased to 500 and 0.5 μm, respectively; ATP and [α-32P]ATP were increased to 1 and 0.5 μm, respectively; tRNA was increased to 2 μm; and the CCA-adding enzyme was increased from 10 nm (in solution) to 10 pmol (immobilized on the HisSorb plate), which would be equivalent to 100 nm enzyme if it were free to diffuse throughout the 100-μl reaction volume. After incubation at 55 °C for 3 min the reactions were withdrawn from the Ni-NTA HisSorb plates, and the tRNA was purified by phenol extraction and concentrated by ethanol precipitation using glycogen as a carrier. Reaction products were resolved by denaturing 12% PAGE and quantified by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). CCA Addition to UV Light-cross-linked tRNA-Enzyme Complexes—UV light cross-linking was carried out essentially as described previously (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme was denatured with 8 m urea for 1 h, diluted into 4 m urea, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 5 μg of unlabeled tRNA-D in standard reaction buffer lacking CTP and ATP. After irradiation at 254 nm with a hand-held UV light (Spectronics Corp.) for 10 min on ice, uncross-linked tRNA was removed by Amicon YM-30 filtration (Millipore). To generate heterodimers bearing cross-linked tRNA, 5 μg of cross-linked tRNA-enzyme complex was mixed with 20 μg of histidine-tagged wild type or mutant enzyme, and the reactions were denatured and renatured; heterodimers were recovered on a Ni-NTA affinity column, eluted with imidazole in buffer A, dialyzed into buffer B, and concentrated by Amicon YM-30 filtration. The CTP addition to UV-cross-linked tRNA-enzyme complexes was assayed using 0.5 μm [α-32P]CTP and 50 μm ATP; ATP addition was assayed by using 0.5 μm [α-32P]ATP and 50 μm CTP. All reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and quantified by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). tDNA Minihelix for UV Cross-linking—tDNA minihelices with a 13-base pair stem were generated by annealing equimolar amounts of two gel-purified oligonucleotides, namely 5′-CC*CGTCATCACCCArC-3′ (where C* is 5-bromocytidine and rC is a cytidine ribonucleotide) and 5′-GGGTGATGGCGGG-3′ (DNAgency). The oligonucleotides were brought to a concentration of 15 μm in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, denatured by heating to 80 °C for 3 min, and quick-cooled on ice for 10 min (29Shi P.Y. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. RNA. 1998; 4: 276-284PubMed Google Scholar). A 200-μl reaction containing 6 μm (1200 pmol) tDNA minihelix and 6 μ m (1200 pmol) S. shibatae enzyme was incubated in 100 mm glycine/NaOH (pH 9), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature and then on ice for 10 min before irradiation. The 200-μl reaction was spotted in 10-μl aliquots onto a sheet of Parafilm© resting on an aluminum block in ice and irradiated at 312 nm for 30 min at a distance of 2 cm using a hand-held Spectroline medium wavelength UV transilluminator (Spectronics Corporation) as described (30Gott J.M. Willis M.C. Koch T.H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6290-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Willis M.C. LeCuyer K.A. Meisenheimer K.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Koch T.H.

When required, the tDNA minihelix was 5′-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) as described by the supplier (New England Biolabs). Tryptic Digestion and Purification of the Cross-linked Peptide—After 312-nm irradiation, cross-linked samples were subjected to Amicon YM-30 filtration (Millipore) to remove uncross-linked tRNA. The cross-linked complexes were brought to 2 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8). After the addition of 3 μg (a 1:20 weight ratio) of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega), digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with an additional 3 μg of trypsin for another 1 h. The reaction was stopped by quick freezing, diluted with buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) to a salt concentration of 50 mm and passed over a 300-μl DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with low salt buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) to remove free peptides, and cross-linked peptides were then recovered by stepwise elution with 100-1000 mm KCl in the same buffer. The 400 mm KCl fraction contained cross-linked tDNA-peptide and was sent for microsequencing by Edman degradation (Yale Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory). Generating Heterodimers That Contain a Single Active Subunit—We established previously that the S. shibatae CCA-adding enzyme has only a single active site (28Yue D. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29693-29700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that the enzyme can faithfully add CTP and ATP to tRNA substrates that have been cross-linked to the enzyme by UV light irradiation (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These data ruled out conventional translocation of the tRNA minihelix along the enzyme as CCA is added and suggested instead that the 3′-end of the tRNA substrate refolds (16Shi P.Y. Maizels N. Weiner A.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3197-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or “scrunches” (20Li F. Xiong Y. Wang J. Cho H.D. Tomita K. Weiner A.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 815-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) to reposition the growing 3′-end in a single active site. However, subsequent discovery that the dimeric S. shibatae enzyme is a tRNA-inducible tetramer suggested a very different model in which the growing 3′-end could shuttle within the tetramer from one quasi-equivalent active site that adds CTP to a second quasi-equivalent site that adds ATP (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The quasi-equivalent sites would have different nucleotide specificity either because the tetramer is intrinsically asymmetric or because tRNA binding induces an asymmetric conformational change. In the simplest version of this shuttling model, the tRNA minihelix would remain fixed on the enzyme; however, the 3′-end of the shorter tRNA-N and tRNA-NC substrates could only reach the CTP addition site, whereas the 3′-end of the longer tRNA-NCC substrate could reach the ATP addition site. We set out to test this alternative model by asking whether an active subunit can complement inactive subunits within a heterodimeric enzyme. To generate heterodimers of mutant and/or wild type enzymes, hexahistidine-tagged and untagged homodimers were combined pairwise, denatured in urea, and renatured by stepwise dilution, and dimers bearing the hexahistidine tag were recovered on Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 1A). In addition to wild type, three different S. shibatae mutant enzymes were used as follows. 1) Y95V blocks the addition of C74 but not the addition of C75. 2) H93V blocks the addition of A76; and 3) K153A blocks both CTP addition and ATP addition. 1H. D. Cho, C. L. Verlinde, and A. M. Weiner, manuscript in preparation. As shown in Fig. 1B, 6 m urea is sufficient to cause a complete reassortment of subunits. A 1:4 mixture of tagged and untagged subunits was denatured in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 m urea and renatured by dilution, and tagged dimers were recovered on a Ni-NTA column. Above 6 m urea, the ratio of tagged to untagged subunits is constant and roughly 5:4, as expected for complete subunit reassortment. Confirming the selectivity of the purification, only tagged subunits are retained on Ni-NTA resin when the urea denaturation step is omitted (Fig. 1B). Although complete subunit reassortment requires 6 m urea, significant reassortment is seen at 4 m urea, a concentration that is only mildly denaturing for most proteins; thus, it seems likely that urea preferentially weakens the dimer interface rather than completely denaturing the subunits. Heterodimers were generated as in Fig. 1, eluted from the Ni-NTA resin with imidazole, concentrated by Amicon YM-30 filtration, and assayed for CCA-adding activity (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, heterodimers of a wild type subunit with the C74-defective Y95V mutant, the A76-defective H93V mutant, and the catalytically inactive K153A mutant were all able to add CCA. We cannot conclude from this experiment alone that CCA is added by a single catalytically active subunit, because the addition of the tRNA substrate induces heterodimers to form tetramers (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These tetramers could, in principle, juxtapose two wild type subunits as postulated by the “shuttling” model, where one quasi-equivalent active site would add CTP and the other ATP. We can conclude, however, that the heterodimers are well behaved; heterodimerization does not inactivate the wild type subunit, nor is activity of the heterodimer mutant-specific (Fig. 2). Use of Immobilized Enzymes to Generate Functional Heterodimers—Our dissociation/reassociation protocol allows functional subunit reassortment (Fig. 2), but we could not distinguish whether CCA was added by a single wild type subunit in the tRNA-induced heterotetramer (a dimer of heterodimers) or by sequential activity (possibly CC and A addition) of the two wild type subunits within a tRNA-induced heterotetramer (24Li F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test whether a single wild type subunit in a heterodimer can add CCA, we took advantage of Ni-NTA HisSorb plates (Qiagen) to immobilize histidine-tagged dimers in the absence of tRNA, thus preventin"

Rab9 mediates late endosome to trans-Golgi transport and has recently been found to be a key cellular component for human immunodeficiency virus-1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles virus replication, suggesting that it may be a novel target in the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs. As part of our structure-based drug design program, we have determined the crystal structure of a C-terminally truncated human Rab9 (residues 1-177) to 1.25-Å resolution. The overall structure shows a characteristic nucleotide binding fold consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices with a tightly bound GDP molecule in the active site. Structure-based sequence alignment of Rab9 with other Rab proteins reveals that its active site consists of residues highly conserved in the Rab GTPase family, implying a common catalytic mechanism. However, Rab9 contains seven regions that are significantly different in conformation from other Rab proteins. Some of those regions coincide with putative effector-binding sites and switch I and switch II regions identified by structure/sequence alignments. The Rab9 structure at near atomic resolution provides an excellent model for structure-based antiviral drug design.

Biochemical and genetic studies of chimeric and mutant Rab proteins have identified several hypervariable regions, including the N and C termini and the α3/β5 loop, that play an important role in determining functional specificity (8Brennwald P.

By targeting Rab9 mRNA for degradation with small interfering RNA, Rab9 has just been identified to be a key cellular component for HIV-1, Ebola, Marburg, and measles virus replication, 2J. L.

As part of a new structure-based antiviral drug design program, we have determined the crystal structure of a C-terminally truncated human Rab9 (residues 1-177) to near atomic resolution of 1.25 Å. Cloning and Expression—The gene for human Rab9 (GenBank™ accession number NM_004251) was obtained from the IMAGE clone collection (IMAGE ID number 4139714) through distribution by Open-Biosystems. A C-terminally truncated fragment coding for residues 1-177 (20.1 kDa) was PCR subcloned using primers 5′-G ACA GCT AGC ATG GCA GGC AAA TCA TCA CTT TTT AAA G-3′ and 5′-C ATG GAT CCT TCA GTC CTC GGT AGC AAG AAC TCT TC-3′ into the NheI/BamHI restriction sites of pET28b (Novagen); the resulting construct encodes for a Rab9-(1-177) protein product with an N-terminal His6-containing fusion (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAS). The pET28-Rab9-(1-177) vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and overproduction of the fusion protein was induced at an A600 nm of ∼2.0 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 310 K for 2 h; the cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at 253 K. Protein Purification—The cell pellet was resuspended in nickel buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 277 K. The soluble fraction was filtered through a 0.45-micron filter and applied to chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which had been previously charged with 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with nickel buffer A. The column was then washed with nickel wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 55 mm imidazole), and the His6-Rab9-(1-177) fusion protein was eluted with nickel elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 350 mm imidazole). The His6-Rab9-(1-177) fusion protein was then dialyzed against Thr buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at 277 K, and precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 277 K. To the soluble fraction, 1 unit of thrombin protease (Novagen) was added per milligram of fusion protein, and the His tag was removed by digestion for 4 h at 298 K (thrombin cleavage results in a Rab9a-(1-177) protein with an N-terminal GSHMAS extension). The thrombin cleavage reaction was diluted (1:3, v/v) with 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, and applied to Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), which had been previously equilibrated with Q buffer A (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl). Native Rab9-(1-177) was eluted from Q-Sepharose with a 50-750 mm NaCl linear gradient in MES, pH 6.5; fractions containing native Rab9-(1-177) were identified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and pooled. The pooled Q fractions were then further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) in MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl; fractions containing Rab9-(1-177) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Crystallization and Data Collection—The stock protein solution used for crystallization contained 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 150 mm sodium chloride with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Crystals were grown at 277 K by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 as crystallization solution. Crystals formed in space group P1 with a = 38.40 Å, b = 45.62 Å, c = 51.22 Å, α = 99.8°, β = 107.2°, and γ = 101.8° and contained two monomers in the unit cell. X-ray diffraction data to 1.25-Å resolution were collected at beamline 22-ID in the facilities of the South East Regional Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.

The composite omit map was calculated to guide electronic density fitting of the model. Energy-restrained crystallographic refinement was carried out with maximum likelihood algorithms implemented in Crystallography NMR software (14Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The addition of two GDPs and 473 water molecules and refinement up to 1.25 Å resulted in R and Rfree values of 0.213 and 0.232, respectively. Further refinement was continued with SHELX-97 (17Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 227: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) by subjecting the structure to cycles of isotropic conjugate gradient least squares refinement; then tightly restrained anisotropic displacement parameters were introduced and refined. The final refinement cycle resulted in R/Rfree values of 0.139/0.196. The final model contains residues 2-34 and 39-175 of monomer A, residues 5-34, 39-110, and 115-175 of monomer B, and 2 GDP molecules plus 508 water molecules. The phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Protein Fold Analysis—Secondary structure elements were defined by the hydrogen-bonding patterns in combination with visual inspection. The Dali algorithm of comparing protein domain structures by alignment of distance matrices was used to search for structural homologues of Rab9 and also used for structure-based sequence alignment (18Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar, 19Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1998; 33: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ribbon diagrams were prepared by the program MOLSCRIPT (20Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The human Rab9 variant we used for crystal structure determination included residues 1-177, lacking its last 24 residues (Fig. 1). Known as the C-terminal hypervariable region, the amino acid sequence of this region in Rab9 is poorly conserved with respect to other Rab proteins. Therefore, we excluded the C-terminal 24 residues from our cloning and crystallographic studies. We will refer below to this truncated form of the protein as Rab9. Rab9 bound to GDP was crystallized, and its structure was determined by molecular replacement (Table I). The structure was refined against 1.25-Å resolution data, making it one of the highest resolution structures in the Rab protein family. Both N and C termini (residues 1 and 176-177 of monomer A and residues 1-4 and 176-177 of monomer B) and some loop regions (residues 34-38 of both monomers and residues 111-114 of monomer B) were disordered and could not be seen in the experimental electron density map. The final refined model, which includes residues 2-34 and 39-175 of monomer A, residues 5-34, 39-110, and 115-175 of monomer B, 2 GDP molecules, and 508 ordered water molecules, has a working R value of 0.139 and a free R value of 0.196. The stereochemistry is excellent with r.m.s. deviations for bond lengths and angle distances of 0.013 Å and 0.032 Å, respectively (Table I). The Ramachandran plot statistics showed that 93.2% of the backbone dihedral angles were in the most favored regions, 6.8% in the additional allowed regions, and none of the non-glycine residues were in the disallowed regions. The two crystallo-graphically unique Rab9 molecules in the crystal unit cell have almost identical structures with the r.m.s. deviation between the 161 equivalent Cα atoms of 0.40 Å. We will use monomer A in our description of Rab9 structure. Overall Structure of Rab9—Like other members of the Rab GTPase family, Rab9 adopts a classical nucleotide binding fold consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (Figs. 2 and 3). The five α-helices (H1-H5) and six β-strands (Β1-Β6) connect with a B1-H1-B2-B3-H2-B4-H3-B5-H4-B6-H5 topology containing 30.5% (54/177) α-helix, 28.8% (51/177) β-sheet, 37.3% (66/177) turn/loop, and 3.4% (6/177) other (Figs. 1 and 3). The six β-strands arrange in the order of B2-B3-B1-B4-B5-B6, forming a mostly parallel β-sheet except that B2 is antiparallel to the rest in strand direction.Fig. 3Ribbon representation of Rab9 structure. A rainbow ramp color coding of blue to red is used to mimic chain trace from the N terminus to the C terminus. Both termini and the secondary structure elements are labeled.

Gray, carbon atoms; blue, nitrogen atoms; red, oxygen atoms; purple, phosphorus atoms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Active Site Structure—The crystal structure reported here contains a tightly bound GDP molecule in the active site (Figs. 3 and 4). Rab9 residues making hydrogen bonds with GDP include Gly-17, Gly-19, Lys-20, Ser-21, Ser-22, Thr-34, Asn-124, Lys-125, Asp-127, and Ala-155 (Table II, Fig. 4, and as shown by the color red in Fig. 5). These residues together with Gly-16, Val-18, Phe-32, Ile-126, and Lys-156 form a tight binding pocket accommodating the GDP molecule. There are more than a dozen hydrogen bonds formed between Rab9 and GDP, indicating a strong binding affinity of Rab9 for GDP. This is supported by the observation that the GDP molecule has been kept inside the active site throughout Rab9 purification, that is it comes naturally bound to Rab9 from the cell culture. Residues Thr-39 and Gly-65 are highly conserved in the Rab GTPase family and are predicted to interact with the γ-phosphate of GTP in the active state of Rab9.Table IIHydrogen bonds between Rab9 and GDPRab9 atomsGDP atomsHydrogen bond distancesÅMonomer AGly-17 NO1B2.83Gly-19 NO3A3.13Lys-20 NO2B2.85Lys-20 NZO2B2.81Ser-21 NO3B2.91Ser-22 NO1A2.84Ser-22 OGO1A2.68Thr-34 OG1O3aDenotes atoms from sugar rings.3.02Thr-34 OG1O2aDenotes atoms from sugar rings.3.05Lys-125 NZO4aDenotes atoms from sugar rings.3.04Asp-127 OD1N12.82Asp-127 OD2N22.83Ala-155 NO62.86Monomer BGly-17 NO1B2.89Gly-19 NO3A3.13Gly-19 NO2B3.02Lys-20 NO2B2.88Lys-20 NZO2B2.75Ser-21 NO3B2.96Ser-22 NO1A2.93Ser-22 OGO1A2.70Thr-34 OO2aDenotes atoms from sugar rings.2.50Asn-124N73.17Lys-125 NZO4aDenotes atoms from sugar rings.2.99Asp-127 OD1N12.72Asp-127 OD2N22.83Ala-155 NO62.82a Denotes atoms from sugar rings.

Among those, Rab9 has the highest sequence identity with Ypt7p (54% over 153 equivalent positions), followed by Rab11a (43% over 161 equivalent positions). The structural similarity Z-scores (18Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar, 19Holm L. Sander C.

Structure-based sequence alignment reveals that the active site of Rab9 consists of residues highly conserved in the Rab GTPase family (Fig. 5), implying a common catalytic mechanism. However, Rab9 contains seven hypervariable regions that are significantly different in conformation from other Rab proteins (Figs. 5 and 6). Some of those regions coincide with putative effector-binding sites and conformational switch I and switch II regions identified by earlier crystallographic studies of other Rab proteins. Regions II and IV correspond to the switch I and switch II, respectively, whereas regions I, V, and VII correspond to the three effector-binding sites/complementary determining regions. These seven hypervariable regions in Rab9 structure may serve as sites for antiviral drug binding and provide an excellent target for structure-based drug design and development.Table IIIAlignment statistics of Rab9 with structurally similar proteinsProtein nameProtein Data Bank codeZaZ-score, strength of structural similarity in standard deviations above expected.RMSDbPositional root mean square deviation of superimposed Cα atoms in Å.LALIcTotal number of equivalent residues.LSEQ2dLength of the entire chain of the equivalent structure.IDEePercentage of sequence identity over equivalent positions.Ref.%GDP-bound Rab91WMS35.30.0168168100This paperGpp(NH)p-bound Ypt7p1KY226.62.01671805322Gppsp-bound Rab11a1OIW25.41.41581664115Gpp(NH)p-bound p21Ras1CTQ25.21.61611663121GDP-bound Rab11a1OIV25.11.61611684315GDP-bound Ypt7p1KY324.91.51531625422Gpp(NH)p-bound Sec41G1724.71.6159168387Gpp(NH)p-bound Rab5a1N6H24.21.81601673823Gpp(NH)p-bound Rab5c1HUQ24.01.81591643924GDP-bound Sec41G1623.31.5150156357Gpp(NH)p-bound Ypt511EK023.21.8159168406a Z-score, strength of structural similarity in standard deviations above expected.b Positional root mean square deviation of superimposed Cα atoms in Å.c Total number of equivalent residues.d Length of the entire chain of the equivalent structure.e Percentage of sequence identity over equivalent positions.

https://openalex.org/W1973207117,"During hemostasis the zymogen factor X (FX) is converted into its enzymatically active form factor Xa by the intrinsic FX-activating complex. This complex consists of the protease factor IXa (FIXa) that assembles, together with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, on a phospholipid surface. We have studied the functional properties of a FIXa-specific monoclonal antibody, 224AE3, which has the potential to enhance intrinsic FX activation. Binding of the antibody to FIXa improved the catalytic properties of the intrinsic FX-activating complex in two ways: (i) factor VIIIa bound to the FIXa-antibody complex with a more than 18-fold higher affinity than to FIXa, and (ii) the turnover number (kcat) of the enzyme complex increased 2- to 3-fold whereas the Km for FX remained unaffected. The ability of 224AE3 to increase the FXa-generation potential (called the “booster effect”) was confirmed in factor VIII (FVIII)-depleted plasma, which was supplemented with different amounts of recombinant FVIII. In the presence of antibody 224AE3 the coagulant activity was increased 2-fold at physiological FVIII concentration and up to 15-fold at low FVIII concentrations. The booster effect that we describe demonstrates the ability of antibodies to function as an additional cofactor in an enzymatic reaction and might open up a new principle for improving the treatment of hemophilia.

One of the key events during normal hemostasis is the conversion of the zymogen factor X (FX) 1The abbreviations used are: FX, factor X; FXa, factor Xa; rFVIII, recombinant factor VIII; FU, fluorescence units. 1The abbreviations used are: FX, factor X; FXa, factor Xa; rFVIII, recombinant factor VIII; FU, fluorescence units. into its enzymatically active form factor Xa (FXa) via the intrinsic coagulation pathway, a process that subsequently leads to activation of prothrombin and the formation of a fibrin clot (1Mann K.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The FX-activating protease factor IXa (FIXa) assembles (together with FVIIIa as well as Ca2+ ions) on a phospholipid surface to form the intrinsic FX-activating complex (2van Dieijen G. van Rijn J.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 53: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this complex FVIIIa serves as a cofactor for the enzyme FIXa and increases the turnover number (kcat) of FIXa by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude (3van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Binding of the stoichiometric FVIIIa-FIXa complex and the substrate FX to a phospholipid surface strongly reduces the Km for the substrate (3van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Treatment of hemophilia is successfully achieved by supplementing the blood of patients with either human FVIII or human FIX. Both proteins can be derived from human plasma or produced as recombinant protein in mammalian cell culture (6Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Furie B.C. Furie B. Shoemaker C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9622-9628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although progress in the production of coagulation factors to ensure their purity, efficacy, and viral safety has been made over the last 20 years, treatment of hemophilia is still beset with several difficulties. First, production of recombinant and plasma-derived, therapeutic coagulation factors is expensive, and products predominantly reach only the industrialized world. Second, ∼30% of patients with hemophilia A and 1.5–3% of patients with hemophilia B develop antibodies against FVIII or FIX that inhibit the respective coagulation factor and complicate treatment (8Brettler D.B. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1996; 9: 319-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Penner J.A. Haemophilia. 2001; 7: 103-108PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bolton-Maggs P.H. Pasi K.J.

A major focus of the research on the intrinsic FX-activating complex has been to overcome some of the limitations in hemophilia treatment mentioned above and to improve the production yields, reduce immunogenicity, and increase the specific activity of FVIII and FIX (11Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Haemophilia. 1998; 4: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For these purposes genetically engineered FVIII-derivatives (e.g. B-domain-deleted FVIII (12Toole J.J. Pittman D.D.

Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) have been produced.In this study a completely different approach toward improving the efficiency of FX activation by the FIXa-FVIIIa complex is described. We isolated mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human FIXa applying hybridoma technology. When we studied the influence of these antibodies on the intrinsic FX-activating complex we discovered an antibody, named 224AE3, that binds to FIXa and enhances both the formation and the catalytic activity of the intrinsic FX-activating complex. We call this effect of the 224AE3 antibody the “booster effect.”EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human α-thrombin and human FIX, FIXa, FX, and FXa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant human coagulation FVIII (rFVIII) was prepared by Baxter BioSciences (Glendale, CA). Bovine serum albumin was purchased from Calbiochem. Human FVIII-depleted plasma was obtained from Baxter BioSciences (Vienna, Austria). Nonspecific mouse IgG was purchased from Sigma. Phospholipid vesicles (60% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 40% dioleoylphosphatidylserine) were prepared by Baxter BioSciences (Vienna, Austria) from synthetic phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Pathromtin SL was purchased from Dade Behring (Deerfield, IL), and Ancrod was purchased from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK). Chromogenic substrate Pefachrome FXa (Pefa-5523) and the thrombin inhibitor Nα-(2-naphthylsulfonylglycyl)-4-amidino-(d,l)-phenylalanine piperidide were purchased from Pentapharm (Basel, Switzerland). The fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC.HCl was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland).Hybridoma Cell Lines—Balb/c mice were immunized four times with human FIXa at intervals of 1 week. At each immunization 100 μg of antigen was applied using Al(OH)3 as adjuvant. Spleen cells were obtained 3 days after the last immunization, and hybridoma cell lines were generated according to standard procedures (16Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12580) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing antibodies specific for human FIXa (all of them also bound to non-activated human FIX) were subcloned four to six times to ensure that the cell line was monoclonal and stable.Production and Purification of Antibodies and F(ab′)2 and Fab Fragments—Monoclonal hybridoma cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) for 2–3 weeks. IgG were purified over protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard procedures (17Jungbauer A. Tauer C. Reiter M. Purtscher M. Wenisch E. Steindl F. Buchacher A. Katinger H. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 476: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fab fragments and F(ab′)2 fragments were prepared from the purified antibody using the ImmunoPure Fab Preparation Kit and the ImmunoPure F(ab′)2 Preparation Kit, respectively (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.FXa Generation Assay—Reactions were performed in polypropylene tubes (Micronic, Lelystad, The Netherlands) in a water bath at 37 °Cas follows: 152 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 13.4 μm phospholipid vesicles was prewarmed to 37 °C, and 25 μl of an antibody/FIXa mixture, 50 μl of rFVIII, and 5 μl of thrombin were added. After incubation for 2 min to activate FVIII, 23 μl of FX was added to start FXa generation. The final reaction mixture contained 8 μm phospholipid vesicles, 6 mm CaCl2, 10 n m thrombin, and concentrations of FIXa, rFVIII, FX, and antibody as described under “Results.” After different time intervals, 20-μl aliquots from the reaction mixture were transferred to 230 μl of EDTA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 9 mm EDTA, and 428 mm NaCl to stop FXa formation. The amount of FXa generated was determined by mixing 210 μl of the diluted aliquots with 40 μl of a mixture containing 5 mm FXa-specific chromogenic substrate Pefa-5523 and 6 μm thrombin inhibitor Nα-(2-naphthylsulfonylglycyl)-4-amidino-(d,l)-phenylalanine piperidide in a 96-well microplate and measuring the rate of chromogenic substrate conversion at 405 nm (ΔA/min) at 37 °C in a microplate reader (iEMS-Reader, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The FXa concentration was calculated for each point in time from a calibration curve made with known amounts of FXa, and control experiments ensured that the antibody did not influence the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Pefa-5523 by FXa.Thrombin Generation Assay—FVIII-depleted plasma was defibrinated with 1 units/ml Ancrod, and fibrin was removed with a plastic stirring rod. 40 μl of defibrinated plasma, 10 μl of antibody, 10 μl of rFVIII, and 25 μl of Pathromtin SL were mixed in 96-well microplates (black flat bottom, Greiner, Kremsmuenster, Austria) and prewarmed at 37 °C. 15 μl of a substrate-CaCl2 mixture was added to each well to give final concentrations of 7.5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm thrombin-specific fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC.HCl. The concentrations of rFVIII and antibody are described under “Results.” Fluorescence (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 440 nm) was read immediately after substrate/CaCl2 addition every 30 s for 30 min in a fluorescence reader at 37 °C (SPECTRAFluor Plus Reader, Tecan, Groedig, Austria). The resultant curve shows the fluorescence units (FU) as a function of time. The tangent at each time point (ΔFU/min) is proportional to the thrombin concentration present in the plasma mixture. Thus, the first derivative of the resultant curve divided by a calibration factor for fluorogenic substrate conversion by thrombin (ΔFU/min/nm thrombin) gives a thrombin generation curve, i.e. the thrombin concentration in plasma as a function of time. The calibration factor was determined from a standard curve made with known amounts of human α-thrombin.RESULTSFeatures of Antibody 224AE3—We isolated a series of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bound to human FIX as well as human FIXa. In preliminary tests of a number of these antibodies in a FXa-generation assay we discovered (in addition to antibodies that inhibited or had no effect on FX activation) one monoclonal antibody, termed 224AE3, that was able to strongly increase the rate of FX activation, and we called this effect the booster effect. Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments showed that monoclonal antibody 224AE3 specifically bound to the heavy chain (protease domain) of human FIX and FIXa and did not cross-react with other coagulation factors such as prothrombin, factor VII, FVIII, FX, or their activated counterparts. Biacore experiments revealed that this antibody bound with a very high affinity to FIXa, which was immobilized on a sensor chip. The on-rate was 1.1 × 106m–1 s–1 but the off-rate was too low to be determined properly. Affinity thus was estimated to be in the low picomolar range (Kd < 50 pm) (data not shown).The Effect of Antibody 224AE3 on FXa Generation—In our first set of experiments we investigated the booster effect in more detail by determining the rate of FXa generation at 33 pm FIXa and different concentrations of FVIIIa. The experiments were done either without antibody (Fig. 1A), at equimolar FIXa and antibody concentrations (33 pm, Fig. 1B), or with a large molar excess of antibody (1000 pm, Fig. 1C). The FX concentration was kept at 100 nm, which is at least 3-fold above Km (see below). FXa generation curves were linear during the initial phase of the activation reaction, indicating that FXa was formed at a constant rate. After ∼3 min, the rates of FXa generation decreased, which probably reflects inactivation of FVIIIa through dissociation of the A2 domain (18Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of FXa formation (nm/min) were calculated from the slope of the linear part of FXa generation. Surprisingly, we found that the FXa formation rates with the antibody were higher than without antibody and that the booster effect of 224AE3 became more pronounced at low FVIII concentrations. At 2 nm rFVIIIa the FXa generation rate increased ∼4-fold, whereas at 100 pm rFVIIIa (concentrations of FIXa and antibody were 33 pm), the antibody increased the rate of FXa generation ∼35-fold.Plots of rates of FXa formation as a function of the FVIIIa concentration (Fig. 2) could be fitted to a single-site ligand-binding model (19Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which enabled calculation of the FVIIIa concentration required to obtain half-maximum rates of FXa formation (Table I). This value corresponds to the apparent Kd (Kd(app)) for dissociation of the phospholipid-bound FIXa-FVIIIa complex. Binding of 224AE3 to FIXa led to an 18-fold decrease of the Kd(app), which dropped from 2.4 nm without antibody to 0.13 nm in the presence of antibody. This effect appeared to be independent of the antibody concentration because the Kd(app) at 1000 pm antibody did not differ greatly from the value obtained at 33 pm antibody.Fig. 2The effect of antibody 224AE3 on FIXa-FVIIIa complex formation. FXa generation assays were performed at 33 pm FIXa, 100 pm FX, 8 μm phospholipid vesicles, 6 mm CaCl2, and different concentrations of FVIII either without antibody (○) or with 33 pm antibody (▴) or 1000 pm antibody (□). FXa formation rates were plotted as a function of the FVIII concentration. The inset shows the entire scope of the hyperbola determined without antibody.

In the presence of equimolar amounts of antibody and FIXa, the Vmax was ∼2-fold higher than without antibody. However, at very high antibody concentrations, the Vmax was the same as without antibody. To further investigate the dependence of the Vmax on the antibody concentration, the amount of antibody present in the reaction mixture was varied. In this experiment (Fig. 3A) the reaction mixture contained 33 pm FIXa, 100 nm FX, different concentrations of 224AE3 (0–2.5 nm), and FVIIIa concentrations that were at least 2.5-fold above Kd. Maximum acceleration of FXa generation (2.8-fold compared with the control experiment without 224AE3) was observed when FIXa and antibody were present in the equimolar range. At high antibody concentrations the rate of FXa formation returned to the value obtained in the absence of antibody.Fig. 3The effect of varying concentrations of antibody 224AE3 or its fragments on FXa generation. FXa generation assays were performed at 33 pm FIXa, 100 nm FX, 8 μm phospholipid vesicles, 6 mm CaCl2, and 6 nm FVIII without antibody or 3 nm FVIII when different antibody or antibody fragment concentrations were added. The graphs show the FXa formation rates plotted as a function of (A) the corresponding antibody concentrations (0–2.5 nm) and (B) the corresponding F(ab′)2 or Fab concentrations (0–1.0 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Optimal enhancement of Vmax seems to occur at a FIXa: antibody ratio at which most antibody molecules have bound two FIXa molecules. In contrast, the decrease of the Kd(app) appears to be independent from such a double saturation. To prove this, we prepared monovalent Fab and divalent F(ab′)2 fragments of antibody 224AE3. These fragments were used in FVIIIa-titration experiments, and at all antibody fragment concentrations tested both fragments were able to enhance the affinity of FIXa for FVIIIa to a similar extent as the antibody; the monomeric Fab fragment gave a Kd(app) of 0.25 nm, and the dimeric F(ab′)2 fragment gave a Kd(app) of 0.11 nm. But at saturating FVIIIa concentrations the F(ab′)2 fragment (but not the Fab fragment) increased the rate of FXa generation. As in the case of the antibody, an ∼3.5-fold enhancement was observed at a molar FIXa:F(ab′)2 ratio where double saturation of the dimeric fragment with FIXa can be expected (Fig. 3B).Effect of Antibody 224AE3 on the Kinetic Parameters of Intrinsic FX Activation—To obtain more information on the influence of 224AE3 on the turnover number (kcat) of the intrinsic FX-activating complex and on the affinity of the complex for FX (Km), we performed a Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis. Rates of FX activation were determined as a function of the FX concentration (Fig. 4) (i) at 33 pm FIXa without antibody, (ii) at equimolar antibody and FIXa concentrations (both 33 pm), and (iii) at an excess of antibody (1000 pm antibody and 33 pm FIXa), whereas FVIIIa concentrations were kept at least 2.5-fold above Kd. The maximum rate of FXa generation (Vmax) and the Km for FX were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the turnover number (kcat) was obtained by dividing the Vmax by the concentration of the FIXa-FVIIIa complex (Table I). The kcat was increased 2.5-fold at equimolar concentrations of FIXa and antibody, but at high antibody concentrations the kcat returned to the value determined without antibody. The Km for FX (26 ± 3 nm) was not affected by the presence of antibody, and in all cases its value was below the physiological (plasma) FX concentration (136 nm). Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis with the Fab and the F(ab′)2 fragments of antibody 224AE3 showed that the F(ab′)2 fragment, like the antibody, increased the kcat of the intrinsic FX-activating complex 3-fold (246 min–1) only when FIXa and the F(ab′)2 fragment were present in the same concentration range and that the monomeric Fab fragment had no effect on the kcat (74 min–1).Fig. 4Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of FX activation by FIXa-FVIIIa and FIXa-FVIIIa-antibody complexes. FXa-generation assays were performed at 33 pm FIXa, 8 μm phospholipid vesicles, 6 mm CaCl2, 3 nm FVIII with antibody, or 6 nm FVIII without antibody and at different FX concentrations (0–100 nm). The resultant FXa formation rates were plotted as a function of the FX concentration. Hyperbolas were obtained without antibody (○), with 33 pm antibody (▴), and with 1000 pm antibody (□). Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the kcat and Km values obtained are summarized in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effect of Antibody 224AE3 in Thrombin Generation Assays—The experiments described so far show the booster effect of the procoagulant 224AE3 antibody on intrinsic FX activation in a well defined model system containing purified proteins. We used thrombin generation assays to test whether the antibody also has a beneficial effect in plasma. The thrombin generation assay probes the whole intrinsic coagulation cascade from contact activation to the formation of thrombin as well as the inactivation of activated coagulation factors by plasma protease inhibitors. All reactants were present in plasma at their physiological concentrations except FVIII, as FVIII-depleted plasma was used and rFVIII was added at known concentrations. The method applied was a modified version of the thrombin generation assay described by Hemker and Beguin (20Hemker H.C. Beguin S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In our approach, all reactants, including a fluorogenic thrombin substrate, were present in the reaction mixture, and after initiation of coagulation fluorescence was measured every 30 s. The first derivative of these curves, divided by the calibration factor for fluorogenic substrate conversion by thrombin, yielded the thrombin concentration in plasma as a function of time (Fig. 5A). After a lag period, there was a burst of thrombin formation followed by inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin and α2-macroglobulin. The time required to reach the maximum thrombin concentration (hereafter referred to as the peak time) was strongly dependent on the FVIII-concentration and became shorter at increasing FVIII concentrations. This is consistent with the clotting time in the one-stage clotting assay and enabled us to quantify the FVIII activity in plasma from thrombin generation curves. Recombinant FVIII was added to FVIII-depleted plasma to give rFVIII concentrations of 0 to 1000 milliunits/ml (corresponding to 0–100% rFVIII activity), and thrombin generation assays were performed in the various plasma mixtures. The peak time appeared to be a linear function of the logarithm of the FVIII concentration present in plasma (linear range of the calibration curve from 0.1 to 50 milliunits/ml). Extrapolation of the calibration curve enabled estimation of the residual FVIII activity in FVIII-depleted plasma. A corrected calibration curve was obtained by iterative correction of the calibration curve for the residual FVIII activity (Fig. 5B). Thus, we calculated that FVIII-depleted plasma had a residual FVIII activity of 0.1 milliunits/ml.Fig. 5Thrombin generation in plasma containing different FVIII concentrations.A, thrombin generation curves were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” at rFVIII concentrations (milliunits/ml) indicated in the figure. B, calibration curve representing peak times of thrombin generation depicted as a function of the log of the corresponding FVIII concentrations (log milliunits/ml) obtained after correction by five iteration rounds as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thrombin generation assays at different FVIII concentrations were repeated with antibody 224AE3 added to the plasma mixture. In the presence of antibody peak times were shorter than that in the control experiment in which no antibody had been added to plasma. The most pronounced effects were obtained at 45–60 nm antibody, the concentration range where double saturation of antibody (2 FIX per antibody) can be expected as the FIX concentration in human plasma is 90 nm. Using the calibration curve presented in Fig. 5B, the calculated FVIII activities were 2- to 15-fold higher than the actual FVIII concentrations present in the plasma mixture when 60 nm antibody were added. These increased FVIII activities reflect an enhanced thrombin formation potential or coagulant activity mediated by 224AE3. The enhancement of the coagulant activity with antibody (booster effects) at the different FVIII concentrations is depicted in Fig. 6. At 1000 milliunits/ml FVIII, the antibody enhanced the coagulant activity 2-fold, but the booster effect became gradually more pronounced at lower FVIII concentrations. At a FVIII concentration of 10 milliunits/ml the peak time measured corresponded to ∼60 milliunits/ml FVIII. Below 1% FVIII (the region of severe hemophilia A) the presence of antibody increased the coagulant activity up to 15-fold. Thrombin generation assays were repeated with nonspecific mouse IgG, which had no influence on thrombin generation (data not shown).Fig. 6Effect of antibody 224AE3 on the coagulant activity (determined in FVIII-depleted plasma supplemented with different FVIII concentrations). Thrombin generation assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in FVIII-depleted plasma containing 60 nm 224AE3 and supplemented with different FVIII concentrations. The resultant peak times were used to determine the FVIII activity applying the calibration curve presented in Fig. 5B. The value for the booster effect (y axis) represents the enhancement of the FVIII-activity (coagulant activity) as a function of the total FVIII concentration (0.1 milliunits/ml residual FVIII concentration and rFVIII added) present in the plasma mixture (x axis). The graph shows an average of three independent determinations. Error bars depict the highest and the lowest booster factor determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONFVIIIa functions as a cofactor of FIXa, which depending on the assay conditions increases the rate of FXa formation ∼20,000- to 200,000-fold (3van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rawala-Sheikh R. Ahmad S.S. Ashby B. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which FVIIIa enhances the catalytic activity of FIXa toward FX is still unknown. It is generally believed that FVIIIa has three functions within the intrinsic FX-activating complex: (i) FVIIIa stabilizes a conformation of FIXa that has strongly increased protease activity toward FX, (ii) FVIIIa acts as a receptor for FIXa on activated platelets (2van Dieijen G. van Rijn J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2108007975,"Previous studies have postulated the presence of two bile salt-binding sites regulating the activity of the pancreatic bile salt-dependent lipase. One of these sites, located in an N-terminal basic cluster, has been identified as the specific bile salt-binding site. Interaction of primary bile salts with this proximal site induces the formation of a micellar binding site from a pre-existing nonspecific or pre-micellar bile salt-binding site. Here we have investigated the functional significance of another basic cluster comprised of amino acid residues Arg423, Lys429, Arg454, Arg458, and Lys462, distal from the catalytic site. For this purpose these residues were mutagenized in Ile or Ala residues. The mutagenized enzyme lost activity on both soluble and emulsified substrates in the presence of bile salts. However, in the absence of bile salts, the mutagenized enzyme displayed the same activity on soluble substrate as the wild-type recombinant enzyme. Consequently, the distal basic cluster may represent the nonspecific (or pre-micellar) bile salt-binding site susceptible to accommodate primary and secondary bile salts. According to the literature, tyrosine residue(s) should participate in this site. Therefore, two tyrosine residues, Tyr427 and Tyr453, associated with the distal basic cluster were also mutagenized. Each tyrosine substitution to serine did not inhibit the enzyme activity on soluble substrate, independently of the presence of primary or secondary bile salts. However, the enzyme activity on cholesteryl oleate solubilized in primary bile salt micelles was decreased by mutations substantiating that these residues are part of the nonspecific bile salt-binding site.

Bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL, 1The abbreviations used are: BSDL, bile salt-dependent lipase; 4-NPC, 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate; CMC, critical micellar concentration; NaTC, sodium taurocholate; NaTDC, sodium taurodeoxycholate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PA, phosphatidic acid; Mes, 4-morpho-lineethanesulfonic acid; FCS, fetal calf serum. EC 3.1.1.13), also referred to as cholesteryl ester hydrolase or carboxyl ester lipase, is a lipolytic enzyme secreted by the acinar pancreatic cell into the duodenum where it plays a significant role in dietary lipid digestion. BSDL has been shown to display wide substrate reactivities ranging from the hydrolysis of both long-chain and short-chain fatty acid esters of glycerol as well as phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and esters of cholesterol and of the fat-soluble vitamins A, E, and D (1Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). BSDL, unlike other lipases, is characterized by a unique activation mechanism requiring the binding of bile salts. Early studies (2Lombardo D. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have proposed that bile salts interact with two sites on the protein. One site, specific for primary bile salts, is associated with enzyme dimerization and activation, whereas the second site is less specific, able to bind indistinctly primary and secondary bile salts, and is involved in the enzyme binding to micellar or aggregated substrates (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Campèse D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently the presence of these two bile salt-binding sites has been detected on the human milk counterpart enzyme referred to as bile salt-stimulated lipase (5Bläckberg L. Hernell O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These two bile salt-binding sites have been tentatively localized on each BSDL molecule forming the dimeric BSDL-taurocholate complex crystal (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Terzyan S. Wang C.-S. Downs D. Hunter B. Zhang X.-C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The first one, proximal to the catalytic site, could be identified as the specific binding site (8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The second one distal to the active site locates in a region on the back side of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. For instance, binding of a monomeric primary bile salt to the specific site leads to the opening of an active site loop comprised of residues His115 to Tyr125 of the bovine BSDL, a loop that otherwise is in a closed conformation that might hinder substrate binding (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Terzyan S. Wang C.-S. Downs D. Hunter B. Zhang X.-C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This loop is flexible when bile salts are absent (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), giving access to water-soluble substrates. Conflicting results were obtained with the truncated human BSDL crystal suggesting that the opening of the loop does not require bile salts (8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the full-length glycosylated native structure of human BSDL shows that the active site loop is in a closed conformation (8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By using chemical modification approaches, tyrosine and arginine have been identified as key residues for BSDL interaction with bile salts (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Campèse D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 5Bläckberg L. Hernell O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study (9Liang Y. Medhekar R. Brockman H.L. Quinn D.M. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24040-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Arg63 is essential for the enzyme activity on substrate such as cholesteryl oleate solubilized by sodium taurocholate. Crystal structure analysis shows that the N-terminal cluster of positively charged residues forms a cationic protrusion at the surface of the protein (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The side chains of Lys31, Lys56, and Lys58 lie on one side of a groove, whereas those of Lys61, Lys62, and Arg63 lie on the other side (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These latter cationic residues are common to all BSDL (10Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this N-terminal basic cluster likely represents the so-called specific (or proximal) bile salt-binding site of BSDL also susceptible to accommodating anionic ligands such as acidic phospholipids (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Functionally, this site may be involved in regulating the enzyme activity (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Another basic cluster (referred to as the C-terminal or distal basic cluster) consisting of seven positively charged residues (Lys336, Arg423, Lys429, Arg454, Arg458, Lys462, and Lys503) has been localized on the BSDL surface at the back side of the N-terminal basic cluster (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Five residues of the distal basic cluster, at positions 423, 429, 454, 458, and 462 are well conserved (see Fig. 1). On the surface of the bovine (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and human (8Moore S.A. Kingston R.L. Loomes K.M. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Baker H.M. Baker E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) BSDL, these residues form a row of positively charged residues which in the protein dimer are parallel to each other and could facilitate the binding to micelles (6Wang X. Wang C.-S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.-C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, cationic residues of the distal basic cluster could represent the nonspecific bile salt-binding site of BSDL accommodating both primary and secondary bile salts (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Campèse D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to use a site-directed specific mutagenesis approach to determine the functional significance of the distal basic cluster of BSDL. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Ham's F-12 culture medium was from Invitrogen. Taq polymerase was purchased from Clontech and was a part of the GC-rich PCR kit. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbL10) against a peptide sequence (Val590 to Gln605) of the rat BSDL were raised in rabbit and purified on protein A-Sepharose. These antibodies are specific for the rat pancreatic BSDL. Cell Cultures—Transfected CHO-K1 cells were routinely cultured in Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% (by volume) fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells, in 100-mm diameter culture dishes, were maintained under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pECE-1 plasmid, initially containing the full-length cDNA encoding the rat BSDL (12Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells and mutagenized. For this purpose, oligonucleotide primers designed to cover the sequence encoding each residue to be mutagenized were used in PCR in combination with the overlap extension method (13Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Méjean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers that allow the mutagenesis of the Arg into Ala residues, Lys into Ile residues, and Tyr into Ser residues, respectively, are presented in Table I. The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the cDNA sequence of BSDL in pECE-1 vector, were extended by using the Advantage GC-rich PCR kit from Clontech. The amount of the initial substrate was maintained below 100 ng. Independently of the pair of primers used, the amplification was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 GeneAmp PCR system using a pre-run cycle (94 °C, 140 s), and 12 reaction cycles program as follows: denaturation (94 °C, 20 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (68 °C, 4 min). The reaction was terminated by incubation at 68 °C for 4 min. A treatment with DpnI endonuclease was used to eliminate the methylated parental DNA template. About 10 μl of the digested material were used to transform competent E. coli cells (Top10 F′ strain) that were spread on agar plates containing ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Colonies were picked up and cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were pelleted, and plasmid cDNA was isolated by using a miniprep kit method (NucleoSpin Plus, Macherey-Nagel). The first mutagenized plasmid was obtained using the first pair of primers (Table I) allowing the mutagenesis of Arg423 and Lys429 into Ala and Ile residues. This latter plasmid, including sequences encoding Ala and Ile residues at positions 423 and 429, was totally sequenced and used as template to substitute Arg454, Arg458, and Lys462 residues by Ala454, Ala458, and Ile462. At the end one plasmid was obtained bearing mutations on a codon encoding residues Arg423, Lys429, Arg454, Arg458, and Lys462, representing the distal basic cluster of BSDL. The final plasmid was completely sequenced by using specific primers for the BSDL sequence (10Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to detect any misincorporation of bases by the polymerase in the BSDL cDNA. Mutagenized cDNA of BSDL were then digested using EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into the pECE-1 vector from which the wild-type cDNA encoding BSDL had been excised previously by following the same restrictive digestion procedure. This eliminates undesired substitution in the vector. The plasmid pECE-1-5MC was thus obtained and, bearing the desired mutations, was amplified and sequenced as above. The same protocol was used to obtain pECE-1-E and pECE-1-L plasmids, which include mutagenized cDNA encoding Y427S and Y453S recombinant mutants of BSDL. Plasmids with the right orientation were transfected into CHO-K1 cells.Table IOligonucleotide primer used for site-directed mutagenesisI.

This material was transfected into the CHO-K1 cell line by using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were stabilized in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml). The different clones were then isolated by the end-dilution procedure and was maintained under G418 selection for at least 3 weeks. Cell clones expressing the Y427S and Y453S mutagenized BSDL were obtained after cotransfection of CHO-K1 cells with pMAM-neo and pECE-1-E or pECE-1-L plasmids, respectively. These cell clones were isolated and selected according to the same procedure. Control cells were transfected, according to the same protocol, with the empty pMAM-neo vector, and corresponding positive clones (CHO-control) were selected as above described. The CHO-K1 cell line expressing the wild-type BSDL referred to as clone 3B has been described previously (14Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation—Transfected CHO cells were grown to about 80% confluence, and they were then washed twice with incomplete phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.15 m NaCl and without Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions) and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cells obtained from a 100-mm diameter dish culture were sedimented and homogenized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm Mes, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 6.0) by sonication (15 s, 4 watts, 4 °C). Homogenates were quickly cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immediately used for enzymatic assays. Recombinant BSDL variants were produced by transfected CHO-K1 cells cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 16-24 h in the absence of FCS. Cell culture media were then used as recombinant enzyme source. Enzyme Activity and Protein Determinations—The esterolytic activity of BSDL was recorded by using 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate (4-NPC) as substrate (15Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in the absence or in the presence of sodium taurocholate (NaTC) or of sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) added in the cuvette. The critical micellar concentration (CMC) of bile salts in the assay condition of BSDL was recorded by the absorbance of rhodamine 6G as described previously (3Lombardo D. Campèse D. Multigner L. Lafont H. De Caro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cholesterol esterase activity of BSDL was determined on cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium). Briefly, to a mixture made with 125 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5) with or without ligand (sodium taurocholate, sodium taurodeoxycholate, and phosphatidic acid) at indicated concentrations, 25 μl of recombinant enzyme and 100 μl of water were added to 10 μl of an ethanolic solution of cholesteryl [14C]oleate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C under agitation, the reaction was stopped with 0.83 ml of Dole mixture (16Vérine A. Salers P. Boyer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E175-E181PubMed Google Scholar) containing 100 μm of cold oleic acid used as vector. The released [14C]oleic acid was extracted from the medium by a liquid-liquid system partition as described (16Vérine A. Salers P. Boyer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: E175-E181PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was estimated by counting (PCS mixture, Amersham Biosciences) with a scintillation counter. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid test from Pierce using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed in 7.5% polyacrylamide and 0.1% SDS as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. After electrophoretic migration, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 mA/cm2 for 18 h. The efficiency of the electrotransfer was checked by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 2% Ponceau S solution. Nitrocellulose membranes were air-dried, and transferred proteins were detected by immunodetection using polyclonal antibodies pAbL10 (1 μg/ml) specific for the rat pancreatic BSDL. Membranes were developed for 10 min with a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.5 mm each) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 and then analyzed by densitometric scanning and quantified using the Image program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Expression of R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I Recombinant Mutagenized BSDL—The expression of BSDL bearing mutations of the distal basic cluster R423A, K429I, R454A, R458A, and K462I (R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I BSDL) was examined in all clones selected for G418 resistance and compared with that of the wild-type 3B clone (14Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to that of the control clone (i.e. transfected with the empty pMAM-neo plasmid). For this purpose all positive clones were cultured to subconfluence; their respective conditioned media were withdrawn for further analyses, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed. First, dot blot and Northern blot analyses were used to assess the mRNA abundance and size in selected clones. Dot blot quantification (18Vérine A. Bruneau N. Valette A. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Pasqualini E. Lombardo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 179-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the BSDL mRNA can be detected in stably transfected CHO cell clones expressing wild-type (clone 3B) or R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I BSDL, whereas mRNA encoding BSDL cannot be detected in control clone C1. Among transfected clones, clone MC9 expressed the same amount of mRNA encoding mutagenized BSDL than that of clone 3B expressing mRNA of wild-type BSDL. The mRNA encoding BSDL detected in clone 3B expressing the wild-type enzyme and that detected in clone MC9 expressing R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I mutagenized variant of BSDL respectively, was of the expected size (i.e. 2.0 kb) (12Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Also, the cDNA probe for β-actin hybridized with a transcript of the right size (10Sbarra V. Bruneau N. Mas E. Hamosh M. Lombardo D. Hamosh P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), present in selected clones (data not shown). The presence of BSDL was examined in conditioned medium of selected clones. Western blotting (Fig. 2) showed that BSDL is present in culture media of 3B and MC9 clone excepted that of control clone C1. However, clone 3B expressed and secreted two glycoforms of the wild-type BSDL migrating at 74 and 70 kDa, respectively (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Bruneau N. Nganga A. Fisher E.A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27353-27361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These two glycoforms are also detected in rat pancreatic AR4-2J cells expressing BSDL (19Abouakil N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Benajiba A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25755-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clone MC9 only secreted the BSDL glycoform associated with the highest migration (see Fig. 2A). The rates of secretion of mutagenized and wild-type variants of BSDL are identical (Fig. 2B); nevertheless, the activity on 4-NPC recorded in culture media did not parallel the amount of BSDL as quantified from Western blotting. Obviously, no activity can be recorded in the culture medium of MC9 cells. Those data suggest that substitutions significantly affect the enzyme activity on 4-NPC when recorded in the presence of activating concentrations of bile salt (4 mm NaTC). We have shown that unfolded BSDL cannot be secreted and instead is degraded by the proteasome (20Le Petit-Thevenin J. Vérine A. Nganga A. Nobili O. Lombardo D. Bruneau N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 184-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Nganga A. Bruneau N. Sbarra V. Lombardo D. Le Petit-Thevenin J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). No degradation product can be detected on Western blotting performed on MC9 clone lysates (not shown). Furthermore, the secretion of mutagenized BSDL suggests that mutations did not affect the overall structure of the enzyme. We thus have hypothesized that mutagenized residues could be involved in BSDL activation by bile salts. Activation of Esterolytic Activities of R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I Mutagenized and Wild-type BSDL by Bile Salts—We then examined the effect of primary and secondary bile salts on the esterolytic activity of mutagenized and wild-type BSDL. As shown in Fig. 3A, the activities of wild-type and R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I BSDL, albeit low, are identical (see also Fig. 3B) when recorded in the absence of bile salt (without bile salt, see Fig. 3B, inset). These activities were corrected for the background esterolytic activity detected in conditioned medium of control clone C1. However, wild-type BSDL activity on 4-NPC largely increased in the presence of 4 mm NaTC, whereas NaTC (125 μm) or NaTDC (125 μm or 4 mm) activates BSDL to a relatively lesser extent (∼50%) compared with NaTC. The activity of mutagenized R423A/K429I/R454A/R458A/K462I BSDL cannot be activated by NaTC or by NaTDC when used at lower (125 μm) or higher (4 mm) concentrations than their respective critical micellar concentration (CMC) determined under BSDL assay conditions that were 1.4 and 0.5 mm for NaTC and NaTDC, respectively (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In previous studies (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) we have shown that the bile salt-binding site specific for primary bile salts, which is constituted by the basic N-terminal cluster of BSDL (11Aubert E. Sbarra V. Le Petit-Thévenin J. Valette A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34987-34996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), may accommodate acidic phospholipids. These acidic phospholipids have a similar activating effect than a primary bile salt such as NaTC at comparable concentrations. Therefore, we have tested the effects of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid (PA) on BSDL esterolytic activity on 4-NPC. As shown on Fig. 3B, whereas PA, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine are activators of the wild-type enzyme on 4-NPC, they are more or less inefficient in activating the mutagenized BSDL. Note that zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine did not promote the increase in activity of both the wild-type and mutagenized recombinant BSDL. Therefore, the distal basic cluster of BSDL could also be able to recognize acidic phospholipids, and mutations of basic residues involved in t"
