Transport activity was specific for glutamate, was H+-dependent, was stimulated by Cl− ion, and was inhibited by Rose Bengal and trypan blue. Northern analysis revealed higher mRNA levels in early postnatal development than in adult brain. Restricted patterns of mRNA expression were observed in presumed interneurons in cortex and hippocampus, and projection systems were observed in the lateral and ventrolateral hypothalamic nuclei, limbic system, and brainstem. Double in situ hybridization histochemistry for vesicular acetylcholine transporter identified VGLUT3 neurons in the striatum as cholinergic interneurons, whereas VGLUT3 mRNA and protein were absent from all other cholinergic cell groups. In the brainstem VGLUT3 mRNA was concentrated in mesopontine raphénuclei. VGLUT3 immunoreactivity was present throughout the brain in a diffuse system of thick and thin beaded varicose fibers much less abundant than, and strictly separated from, VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 synapses. Co-existence of VGLUT3 in VMAT2-positive and tyrosine hydroxylase -negative varicosities only in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in subsets of tryptophan hydroxylase-positive cell bodies and processes in differentiating primary raphé neurons in vitroindicates selective and target-specific expression of the glutamatergic/serotoninergic synaptic phenotype.

Like other classical neurotransmitters, vesicular uptake and storage of glutamate is dependent upon the proton electrochemical gradient established by the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (3Masson J. Sagne C.

The accumulation of glutamate from the cytoplasm into vesicles is mediated by a selective low affinity transport system (6Disbrow J.K. Gershten M.J. Ruth J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, the brain-specific Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter (10Ni B. Rosteck P.R. Nadi N.S. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 142-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two sets of glutamatergic neurons in the central nervous system have now been defined with VGLUT1 being the dominant system in telencephalic regions and VGLUT2 predominantly expressed in the diencephalic regions of the brain and in the spinal cord (11Aihara Y.

VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 define two sets of synaptic vesicles (13Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar,14Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their pathway-specific expression (e.g. VGLUT1 in learning and memory and VGLUT2 in sensory processing, i.e.nociception) in distinct sets of synapses along the pathway indicates that they may have unique intrinsic activity, trafficking patterns, or regulatory properties (16Fremeau R.T., Jr. Troyer M.D. Pahner I.

Erickson J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 142-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their combined distribution pattern can account for most, if not all, of the presumed glutamatergic neurons in the central nervous system. The expression of a vesicular glutamate transporter is necessary and may be sufficient for exocytotic release of glutamate from a nerve terminal (13Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Recently, the human genome project has revealed the presence of a highly related sequence to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. The existence of a third isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter may therefore define a novel excitatory phenotype in the brain. Glutamate is a likely candidate for the substrate of this transporter. Aspartate is also released from some excitatory nerve endings (23Gundersen V. Chaudhry F.A. Bjaalie J.G. Fonnum F. Ottersen O. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6059-6070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neither VGLUT1 nor VGLUT2 recognize aspartate as a substrate. Considerable evidence also exists to suggest that some monoaminergic (24Sulzer D. Rayport S. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2000; 19: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and cholinergic neurons (25Saji M. Miura M. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 123: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Kaneko T. Mizuno N. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Manns I.D. Mainville L. Jones B.E. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have high concentrations of glutamate that might be important for excitatory neurotransmission. Monoaminergic neurons in primary culture also exhibit mixed chemical neurotransmitter phenotypes and appear to co-release glutamate. The fast excitatory responses are apparently blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists and are followed by slower inhibitory responses mediated by 5-HT or dopamine in postsynaptic electrophysiologic recordings at autapses (28Johnson M.D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Sulzer D. Joyce M.P. Lin L. Geldwert D. Haber S.N. Hattori T. Rayport S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4588-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report the cloning of a novel cDNA from newborn mouse brain with high sequence identity to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, and we describe its functional properties following transient transfection of cultured neuroendocrine cells. Northern analysis was performed to examine the relative abundance of mRNA expression in developing whole brain compared with VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Antibodies were raised against the N and C terminus of the mouse homologue and were used to examine the presence of protein on synaptic vesicles and the distribution pattern in the mouse and rat brain compared with VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 by immunohistochemistry. In addition, double-confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy and double in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with classical neurochemical phenotypic markers were also used to identify aminergic neurons where co-existence with vesicular glutamate storage might occur. Finally, dissociated primary cultures of raphé nuclei were examined by double fluorescence deconvolution microscopy of VGLUT3 and the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TrypH) to determine whether a subpopulation of developing serotoninergic neurons exhibit a mixed classical neurotransmitter phenotype. We searched a translated mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data base with rat VGLUT2 amino acid sequence, and we found two ESTs (GenBankTMaccession numbers BB650431 and BB396899) that were highly homologous to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Specific forward and reverse primers containingEcoRI sites were then designed (5′-ggaattcctccatcgccccccgttcaaaatgcaattt and 5′-ggaattccagttgtaagctgaggtgaagccaga) to amplify a cDNA containing the protein coding region of the mouse homologue byPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from postnatal day 1 mouse brain cDNA. This product was sequenced on both strands by the ThermoSequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). VGLUT3 cDNA was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for functional studies. For the preparation of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, sequences corresponding to the coding region of the terminal 56 hydrophilic amino acids of VGLUT3 (** in Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR from the VGLUT3 cDNA. The following primers (5′-cgggatccgaactcaaccacgagactttcgtaagt and 5′-ggaattcttaggatgtttctgagaagtctccttcggc) were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI sites that facilitated cloning into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT (APBiotech). For the preparation of riboprobes, sequences corresponding to the non-conserved C terminus were amplified by PCR from the VGLUT3 cDNA. The following primers (5′-cgggatccgaactcaaccacgagactttcgtaagt and 5′-ggaattccagttgtaagctgaggtgaagccaga) were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI sites that facilitated cloning into pBluescript (Stratagene) to drive expression from T7 (sense) and T3 promoters (antisense). This sequence (205 bp) corresponds to the portion of the C-terminal sequence used for GST fusion protein and antibody production and also includes some 3′-non-coding sequences of VGLUT3. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the N terminus of mouse VGLUT3 in rabbits and the C terminus of mouse VGLUT3 in guinea pigs. A cysteine-linked N-terminal peptide (MPFKAFDTFKEKILKP-C) containing amino acids that are specific for VGLUT3 was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and used as immunogen in White New Zealand rabbits. Antibodies were affinity-purified using the immunogenic peptide and SulfoLink kit (Pierce). The C-terminal fusion protein was prepared from the recombinant GST fusion plasmid prepared above as described previously (18Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K.-H. Zhu H. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 142-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (10 mg) were dialyzed overnight against 10 mmTris, adjusted to pH 6.0 with HCl, and then mixed with 10 ml of colloidal gold (d = 20 nm, Sigma) under stirring at room temperature. This solution was centrifuged (20,000 ×g; 15 min), and the reddish pellet was resuspended in a solution containing dialyzed GST-VGLUT3 fusion protein (2 mg/ml), mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and used as the immunogen in guinea pigs. A similar immunogold immunization protocol has successfully produced extremely high titer polyclonal antibodies (30Pow D.V. Crook D.K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Antisera and affinity-purified antibodies were first screened by immunocytochemistry in transfected cells to assess the relative titers and cross-reactivities of VGLUT3 antibodies toward VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. CV-1 fibroblasts were plated onto collagen (type IV)-coated 2-well chamber slides (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected using the vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 hybrid system (see below) with plasmids containing VGLUT1, VGLUT2, VGLUT3, or mock controls. After 18 h, the cells were fixed and processed as described (31Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K.-H. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Antigens were visualized under bright field after incubation with rabbit or guinea pig VGLUT antibodies (1:4000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies (Vectastain Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories) and reaction with the peroxidase substrate 3′3-diaminobenzidine. Specificity of the VGLUT3 antibodies and cross-reactivity of the VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 antibodies toward VGLUT3 were also assessed by Western blot. Post-nuclear homogenates from probe-sonicated PC12 cells (10 μg of protein) were resuspended in sample buffer containing 62 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol, fractionated by SDS-PAGE through an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and electrotransfered onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Following a 30-min preincubation in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk, the blots were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with primary antibodies in TBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. For preadsorption studies, VGLUT3 peptide or GST fusion protein (1 μm; final concentration) was added during the incubation period with the primary antibodies. The VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGLUT3 fusion protein antibodies (1:3000 to 1:10,000) and the VGLUT3 anti-peptide antibody (1:3000) were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibodies (Sigma), respectively, and enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (SuperSignal WestPico substrate; Pierce) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit and guinea pig antibodies raised against different epitopes of mouse VGLUT3 sequence were completely cross-reactive with rat as identical distribution patterns were observed using these antibodies in both species (see below). RNA was purified from whole mouse brain at various developmental ages (E18, P1, P7, P14, P26, and P60) by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and ultracentrifugation through a cesium trifluoroacetic acid cushion followed by a single round of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (32Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA were electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels, electroblotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes in buffer containing 4× SSC (600 mm NaCl, 60 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0); 50% formamide; 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)); 0.25 mg/ml tRNA for 18 h at 45 °C. Blots were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Four VGLUT3 oligonucleotide probes from non-conserved regions of the mouse VGLUT3 sequence were used simultaneously for hybridization as follows: 5′-gctcagactggccaagttggccccttctcctatgcttgtctctatg from the N terminus; 5′-ctttgtaagatgcccagcgagtctcccacggcattcttcactccttcc from the predicted lumenal loop between TMD V and VI; 5′-ctcgtggttgagttctgtctcctcagctaactcatcttggtcaatgattcc; and 5′-gtaagctgaggtgaagccagacatttaggatgtttctgagaagtctccttcg from the C terminus and 3′-non-coding region. Specific probes against the N-terminal sequences of mouse VGLUT1 (5′-ccgccagcttccgaaactcctcctgccggaactccatggtggctgtgc; derived from mouse EST data base GenBankTM accession numbersBE950784, BB649955, and BB650431) and VGLUT2 (5′-cttaccgtcctctgtcagctcgatggtctctcggttgtcctgcttcttc; GenBankTM accession number NM080853) were also prepared. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled to a similar specific activity using terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The VGLUT probes were hybridized sequentially to the developmental Northern blot of whole mouse brain mRNA beginning with VGLUT3 and then VGLUT2 which was followed by VGLUT1. Oligonucleotides were stripped from the blot by incubation at 60 °C in 95% formamide containing 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min followed by a thorough wash in 1× SSC. Blots were placed against an image plate for various times and developed with a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Frozen serial sections through the mouse brain and spinal cord were cut to 14-μm thickness on a cryostat, thaw-mounted on adhesive slides, and stored at −70 °C until subjected to the prehybridization procedure as described (33Schäfer M.K.-H. Herman J.P. Watson S.J. London E.D. The Imaging of Drug Action. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 337-378Google Scholar). Tissues were post-fixed on the slide by immersion in ice-cold 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution for 1 h and then washed in 10 mmphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, three times for 10 min each and once in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 at room temperature. After a short rinse in distilled water, the sections were washed in 0.1m triethanolamine, pH 8.0 (Sigma), followed by a second wash in 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, containing acetic anhydride (0.25% v/v) for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation in 2× SSC, sections were dehydrated in graded alcohols (50 and 70%) and air-dried. Radioactive probes were generated by in vitro transcription using 35S-UTP and 35S-CTP as radioactive label and diluted in hybridization buffer (3× SSC, 50 mmNaPO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 50% formamide) to a final concentration of 5 × 104dpm/μl, and 30–50 μl of hybridization solution was applied to each section, and slides were coverslipped and incubated for 14 h at 60 °C in a humid chamber. Slides were washed in 2× SSC and 1× SSC for 20 min each followed by incubation in RNase A buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA) containing 20 μg/ml RNase A and 1000 units/ml RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C. The slides were washed at room temperature in 1, 0.5, and 0.2× SSC for 20 min each at 60 °C in 0.2× SSC for 60 min and at room temperature in 0.2× SSC and distilled water for 10 min each. Tissues were dehydrated in 50 and 70% 2-propanol, air-dried, and then exposed to x-ray film for 20–40 h. Autoradiographic detection of 35S was performed with NTB-2 nuclear emulsion (Eastman Kodak). After an exposure time of 14 days, slides were developed. Bright and dark field microscopic analysis was performed using the Olympus AX-70 microscope. Detection of two different RNA transcripts in the same tissue section was performed with radioactive- and nonradioactive-labeled probes as published previously with some modifications (34Schäfer M.K.-H. Day R. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 16-44Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A 678-bp digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe for rat VAChT (GenBankTM accession number NM031663; nucleotides 1863–2540, 90% identity to mouse VAChT) was generated by in vitro transcription with a digoxigenin labeling mix containing 10 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; 6.5 mm UTP, and 3.5 mm dioxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For VMAT2 mRNA detection, a 269-bp DNA fragment of the rat VMAT2 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 233–500 (GenBankTMaccession number NM013031) was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). Transcription with SP6 yielded probes in antisense orientation (identity to mouse VMAT2 = 94%). After hydrolysis, probes were purified by sodium acetate precipitation and then added to the appropriate radioactive hybridization solution to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Hybridization and washing procedures were performed as described above. For the detection of nonradioactive hybrids, slides were equilibrated to buffer A (100 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck). Blocking was performed by incubation for 1 h in blocking buffer (buffer A containing 2% normal lamb serum). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were diluted to 1 unit/ml in blocking buffer. After the slides were rinsed with buffer A, the diluted antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Excessive antibody was removed by two 15-min washes in buffer A. Slides were equilibrated in buffer B (100 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, pH 9.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then the color reaction took place in buffer B containing 0.2 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.2 mm nitro blue tetrazolium salt (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction was stopped by washing the slides in double-distilled water for 24 h. For detection of 35S-labeled probes, slides were covered with K5 photoemulsion (Ilford) diluted 1:1 in water for 14 days in the dark. Mice and rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with PBS containing procaine-HCl (5 g/liter) followed by Bouin Hollande fixative as described (35Nohr D. Schäfer M.K.-H. Persson S. Romeo H. Nyberg F. Post C. Ekstrom G. Weihe E. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 759-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Stumm R. Culmsee C. Schäfer M.K.-H. Krieglstein J. Weihe E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 798-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The perfused brains were removed, dissected into anterior, middle, and posterior parts, and post-fixed for 24–48 h in Bouin Hollande fixative. After dehydration in a graded series of 2-propanol solutions, tissues were embedded in Paraplast Plus (Merck). Deparaffinized serial sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by heating at 92–95 °C for 15 min in 0.01 m citrate buffer (pH 6). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS followed by an avidin-biotin blocking step (avidin-biotin blocking kit, Boehringer Ingelheim). For single peroxidase immunostaining, sections were alternately incubated with the primary affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit (1 μg/ml) or polyclonal guinea pig (diluted 1:4000) antibodies raised against VGLUT3 overnight at 18 °C followed by an additional incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. Polyclonal rabbit or guinea pig antiserum against VGLUT1 (diluted 1:4000) and VGLUT2 (diluted 1:8000) was used to identify the two dominant excitatory systems in the brain in adjacent sections. A polyclonal sheep antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase (diluted 1:1000; Chemicon) was applied to identify catecholaminergic cell groups and terminals. Polyclonal rabbit (37Weihe E.

Fujiyama F. Hioki H. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 444: 39-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). After several washes in distilled H2O followed by rinsing in 50 mm PBS, species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies (Dianova) were applied for 45 min at 37 °C. Following another series of washes, sections were incubated for 30 min with the AB reagents (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit). Immunoreactions were visualized with 3′,3-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) enhanced by the addition of 0.08% ammonium nickel sulfate (Fluka) resulting in a dark blue staining. The specificity of VGLUT3 immunostaining was tested by preadsorption with the antigens used as the immunogen (1 μm final concentration). Confocal laser scanning double immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (38Schäfer M.K.-H. Schwaeble W.J. Post C. Salvati P. Calabresi M. Sim R.B. Petry F. Loos M. Weihe E.

The specificity of VGLUT3 immunostaining obtained with the crude and immunity-purified antisera and with the guinea pig antiserum was tested by preadsorption with the peptide used as the immunogen (10 μm) and with the fusion protein (10 μm), respectively. Immunoreactions obtained were preabsorbed with the respective homologous antigen (data not shown). For double labeling, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with a mixture of polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit (4.5 μg/ml) or guinea pig VGLUT3 (diluted 1:600), the polyclonal rabbit or guinea pig VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 antibodies (diluted 1:400 or 1:800), the polyclonal rabbit or guinea pig VMAT2 antibodies (diluted 1:200), a polyclonal goat antibody (diluted 1:400), and a polyclonal rabbit antibody (diluted 1:150) against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) (39Erickson J.D.

The biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids is developmentally activated in specific tissues and cell types and also in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli such as wounding, pathogen infection, and ultraviolet irradiation (1Dixon R.A.

Cinnamic acid, the reaction product of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase catalysis, is further modified by the action of hydroxylases andO-methyltransferases, leading to the synthesis of a wide range of hydroxycinnamic acids (see Fig. 1). The enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase catalyzes the formation of CoA esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, which are activated intermediates in the biosynthesis of diverse compounds via specific branches of the pathway leading to lignins, lignans, flavonoids and isoflavonoids, stilbenes, coumarins, and numerous esters and amides (see Fig. 1) (6Petersen M. Strack D. Matern U. Annu. Plant Rev. 1999; 2: 151-221Google Scholar,7Zenk M.H. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1979; 12: 139-176Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase from various plant species acceptsp-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate as substrates in this decreasing preferential order, but does not accept sinapate (8Allina S.M.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that sinapoyl-CoA is formed via the alternative pathway involving caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, which produces feruloyl-CoA (10Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Ye Z.-H. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Varner J.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which is the substrate of cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, the first committed enzyme of monolignol synthesis (see Fig. 1). Recently, it has been shown that coniferaldehyde, the product resulting from cinnamoyl-CoA reductase action, is a preferential substrate for the cytochrome P450 hydroxylase that introduces the hydroxyl group in the 5-position of the aromatic ring (see Fig. 1) (12Humphreys J.M.

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that C-3 hydroxylation does not take place at the free acid level, as is the case for C-4 hydroxylation. By a functional genomics approach,p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to be a P450 enzyme that accepts the shikimate and quinate esters of p-coumarate as substrates, but not the free acid form or the p-coumaroyl-CoA ester (15Schoch G.

Mutants tagged in the p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase gene are characterized by a reduced epidermal fluorescence phenotype (and called ref8) and have been shown to accumulatep-coumarate esters and to be affected in lignin biosynthesis, thus providing direct evidence thatp-coumaroyl shikimate and/or p-coumaroyl quinate is probably an important intermediate in the phenylpropanoid pathway (16Franke R.

Here, we report the characterization of an acyltransferase from tobacco that uses p-coumaroyl-CoA as acyl donor and shikimic acid or quinic acid as acceptor, yielding the shikimate or quinate ester, respectively. The enzyme has been purified from tobacco stems, and determination of its N-terminal sequence allowed us to clone the cognate cDNA by PCR. The tobacco enzyme shares 46% identity with the carnation anthranilate benzoyl-CoA benzoyltransferase, which catalyzes anthranamide phytoalexin biosynthesis (18Yang Q. Rheihard K. Schlitz E. Matern U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and belongs to a large plant acyltransferase gene family (19St. Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently synthesizesp-coumaroyl esters from p-coumaroyl-CoA, in agreement with a putative role upstream of p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase in the phenylpropanoid pathway. It also catalyzes the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic ester), one of the most widespread soluble phenolic compound in the plant kingdom. The tobacco acyltransferase can also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e.transfer of the caffeoyl moiety of chlorogenic acid to CoA to form caffeoyl-CoA, the precursor of guaiacyl and syringyl units of lignin. Thus, in plants, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)1 appears to play a critical role in the phenylpropanoid pathway, both upstream and downstream of the 3-hydroxylation step. Commonly used chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity readily available. Bradford protein dye reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad (Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Restriction enzymes and buffers were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France). T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, ATP, and purified oligonucleotides used for cloning and DNA sequencing were purchased from Invitrogen. Glutathione-agarose, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and LB broth were purchased from Sigma. DNA amplification using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) was performed in the iCyclerTM thermocycler (Bio-Rad). Plasmid and PCR products were extracted and purified from agarose gels using kits purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Hilden, Germany). Cloning into the pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Biosciences) and PCR screening for positive clones were carried out as described by Martzet al. (20Martz F. Maury S. Pinçon G. Legrand M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein expression was performed using E. coli BL21-G612, a kanamycin-resistant strain. E. coliBL21-G612 cells carry the plasmid pLysS and express rare prokaryotic tRNAs. DNA sequencing was performed using the rhodamine dye terminator cycle ready kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer (Model 373A). Tobacco stems (200 g) were ground at 4 °C in a Waring Blendor in 200 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.2 g of charcoal (Merck). After filtration through four layers of cheesecloth, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (4 × 70 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The clear supernatant obtained after centrifugation constituted the crude extract. The crude extract was loaded onto a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with 200 ml of a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. Active fractions exhibiting HCT activity were pooled. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 200 μl on Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), filtered, injected onto a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences), and eluted with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The basic procedures used for electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and silver nitrate staining have been described (21Legrand M. Kauffmann S. Geoffroy P. Fritig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6750-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation under denaturing conditions, proteins were immobilized onto Problott membrane (Bio-Rad), stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and microsequenced with an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer (Model 470A). Reverse transcription with total RNA from 2-month-old Nicotiana tabacum stems was carried out using poly(dT) primer and SuperscriptTM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Partial cDNAs were produced by PCR using cDNA generated by reverse transcription as template. Based on the amino acid sequence of the purified protein, a sense degenerate oligonucleotide primer (SP1) was synthesized (see also Fig. 5): 5′-ATGGTIAARCCIGCIACIGARACICC-3′, where I and R indicate inosine and A/G, respectively. The antisense primer (ASP1) was based upon a conserved region (DFGWG) near the C terminus of acyltransferase proteins (see Fig. 6) and had the following sequence: 5′-CC CCA ICC RAA RTC-3′. DNA amplification was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. At the end of the 35 cycles, the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of the expected size (1130 bp) was isolated and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) prior to sequencing.Figure 6Sequence alignment of representative members of the plant acyltransferase family.

To identify the 5′-end of the HCT transcript, the 5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends Version 2.0 (Invitrogen) was used. First, ASP2 and total RNA fromN. tabacum stems were used for cDNA synthesis. Then, a first round of PCR was performed using the nested antisense primer ASP3 along with the anchored RACE-specific primer furnished by the manufacturer. A second round of PCR was performed using 1/100th of the first-round PCR mixture as template and the nested antisense primer ASP4 along with the universal RACE-specific primer (Invitrogen). The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of the correct size (600 bp) was isolated and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO prior to sequencing. To identify the 3′-end of the HCT transcript, PCR was performed using poly(dT) reverse transcription mixture as template and SP2 and poly(dT) oligonucleotides as primers. The sequence information required for generation of a full-length cDNA was derived from the nucleotide sequence of the 5′- and 3′-ends of HCT transcripts (see also Fig. 5). The full-length clone was amplified using the end-specific primers SP3 (5′-GCTCTAGACATGAAGATCGAGGTGAAAGAATCG-3′) and ASP5 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCGACCCATGGTCAAAAGTCATACAAGAACTTCTC-3′). SP3 and ASP5 contain recognition sites for the restriction endonucleasesXbaI and XhoI, which permit subcloning into the pGEX-KG plasmid for heterologous expression in E. coli. DNA amplification was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and four cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 46 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles as above except that the third step was at 55 °C for 1 min. After the 30 cycles, the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of the correct size (1347 bp) was isolated and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO prior to sequencing. The full-length cDNA generated by reverse transcription-PCR was ligated into the pGEX-KG plasmid, which had been digested with the restriction endonucleases XbaI and XhoI. The pGEX-KG plasmids containing the HCT gene coding region were electroporated into E. coli strain BL21-G612. A 10-ml preculture was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. It was used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh medium. Bacteria were grown for 3 h at 37 °C and then transferred to 18 °C overnight after addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce protein expression. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm, the bacteria were resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were lysed by two passages through a French press (Aminco). The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min; the pellet was discarded; and glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the supernatant containing soluble proteins. After 2 h at room temperature, the beads were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the fusion protein was directly cleaved by incubation of the beads with thrombin for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant contained the recombinant HCT protein. The different steps of purification were assessed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of recombinant HCT protein was quantified by densitometry of the bands on polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Fluka) and by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent. CoA esters were prepared according to the method of Stöckigt and Zenk (27Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with some modifications (23Negrel J. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 31-34Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and identified and quantified by spectroscopy as described (24Lüderitz T. Shatz G. Grisebach H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). During enzyme purification from plant extracts, 10 nmol of p-coumaroyl-CoA was added to 100 μl of protein mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The activity was determined by the decrease in the absorbance at 346 nm measured against a blank reaction mixture containing a boiled protein extract. The reaction mixture contained (in a total volume of 20 μl) 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 ng to 1 μg of purified enzyme, and the different substrates at 10 μm to 10 mm. The reaction was initiated by enzyme addition, incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and terminated by addition of 20 μl of HPLC solvent. Reaction products were analyzed by HPLC. ForK m determination, varying substrate and enzyme concentrations were used depending on the substrate tested. ForK m with quinate, 50 ng/μl purified enzyme, 1 mm p-coumaroyl-CoA, and 1–10 mmquinate were used. For K m with shikimate, 1 ng/μl purified enzyme, 1 mm p-coumaroyl-CoA, and 250–4000 μm shikimate were used. Forp-coumaroyl-CoA K m measurement, we used 5 ng/μl purified enzyme with quinate as acceptor and 1.8 ng/μl with shikimate as acceptor, 4 mm quinate or shikimate, and 10–100 μm p-coumaroyl-CoA. For caffeoyl-CoA affinity determination, 20 or 1 ng/μl purified enzyme with quinate or shikimate as acceptor, respectively; 4 mm quinate or shikimate; and 20–500 μm caffeoyl-CoA were tested. Finally, for feruloyl-CoA K m measurement, 8 ng/μl purified enzyme, 4 mm shikimate, and 20–200 μm feruloyl-CoA were used. K m andV max values were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots. Cinnamoyl-CoA, sinapoyl-CoA, and benzoyl-CoA were tested as acyl donors at a concentration of 100 μm each in the presence of 50 ng/μl purified enzyme and 4 mmquinate or shikimate. Anthranilate, glucose, malate, tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine, and agmatine were tested as possible acyl acceptors at a concentration of 4 mm each in the presence of 50 ng/μl purified enzyme and 4 mm p-coumaroyl-CoA. 10 ng/μl purified enzyme was incubated in the presence of 100 μm chlorogenate and 100 μm CoA. Incubation mixtures were diluted with 1 volume of 0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile in water and resolved on a Waters reverse-phase C18 column (Novapak, 4 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) using an increasing gradient of acetonitrile (5–50%) in water containing 0.1% formic acid. For the characterization of caffeoyl-CoA formed after incubation of HCT in the presence of chlorogenate and CoA, 20 mm phosphate (pH 5.3) was dissolved in water, and a 5–25% acetonitrile gradient was applied for column elution. Reaction products were characterized by their elution time, and their UV absorption spectra were recorded with a Waters photodiode array detector. 3-O- and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acids were produced from chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid; Fluka) by heating for 30 min at 90 °C in 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (25Strack D. Gross W. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The isomers were separated by HPLC and collected. Sequence alignment and analysis were performed with ClustalW software. The phylogenetic tree was built using the TreeView program. As shown in Fig. 1, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters are important metabolic intermediates in the phenylpropanoid pathway. We have previously shown that caffeoyl-CoA is methylated by tobacco caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase to yield feruloyl-CoA (10Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when a crude extract from tobacco stems was used as the enzyme preparation, TLC analysis of reaction products revealed the presence of feruloyl-CoA, ferulic acid, and another unknown compound (data not shown). These results suggest that ferulic acid arises from hydrolysis of either feruloyl-CoA or caffeoyl-CoA, followed by the methylation of caffeic acid, which is known to be catalyzed by caffeic/5-hydroxyferulic acidO-methyltransferase I in vitro (10Maury S. Geoffroy P. Legrand M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Legrand M. Fritig B. Hirth L. Planta. 1978; 144: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reactions involved are indicated by the dotted box in Fig. 1. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we first investigated the stability of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters in the presence of protein extracts from tobacco stems. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the UV absorption spectrum of caffeoyl-CoA presents three maxima of absorption. The peak at 346 nm is characteristic of the presence of the thioester bond (27Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation of caffeoyl-CoA at 30 °C in the presence of tobacco stem extract (Fig. 2 B), the absorbance of the two first peaks remained roughly unchanged, whereas the third absorption peak had markedly decreased. These observations indicate that hydrolysis of caffeoyl-CoA is catalyzed by the crude enzyme extract. No change in the absorption spectrum was recorded in the absence of protein extract (data not shown) or in the presence of a boiled protein extract (Fig. 2 A). The total protein extract from tobacco stems was clarified by centrifugation and filtration. Proteins were first fractionated by anion exchange chromatography under fast protein liquid chromatography conditions (Fig. 3 A). Fractions containing thioesterase activity (as measured by the decrease in absorbance at 346 nm) were then pooled, concentrated, and submitted to two successive molecular sieving chromatography steps (Fig. 3, B and C). TableI summarizes the purification factor and yield values measured at each purification step. Likely due to some enzyme instability, a final enzyme activity recovery of 0.6% was observed, resulting in a low apparent purification factor. All our attempts to further purify the enzyme were unsuccessful and led to a complete loss of thioesterase activity. However, when the content of active protein fractions from the second molecular sieving step was analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS gels, only a limited number of protein species were detected (Fig. 3 D). Among the protein bands, those in the 45–51-kDa range displayed intensity variations, which correlated with enzyme activity levels. Therefore, fractions 34–40 were pooled, concentrated, and submitted to preparative SDS gel electrophoresis, followed by blotting on membrane. Every protein band in the 45–51-kDa range was microsequenced, and one amino acid sequence revealed important homology to protein sequences available in the data banks: as shown in Fig. 4, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a 51-kDa tobacco protein (Fig. 3 D, arrow) displayed 12 of 18 residues identical to the N terminus of a carnation protein that has been characterized as a hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyl-CoA:anthranilateN-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of dianthramides (18Yang Q.

Laflamme P. Alarco A. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) were used to design primers for the first step of PCR cloning (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the end of the cloning procedure, a nearly full-length tobacco cDNA clone was obtained, the sequence of which is shown in Fig. 5. The closest match found in the data banks (considering only characterized gene products) was still with the anthranilateN-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyl transferase from carnation, which shares 46% identity and 62% similarity with the tobacco protein. Both proteins belong to a multifunctional superfamily of plant acyltransferases (19St. Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 presents a few sequences of typical members of the family, the catalytic properties of which have been well characterized. They catalyze the transfer of acetyl, benzoyl, or hydroxycinnamoyl groups onto a variety of acceptor molecules, including alkaloids (salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase and deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase), anthranilate (anthranilateN-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase), benzyl alcohol (benzyl-alcohol acetyltransferase), anthocyanins (anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase), and diterpenoids (3′-N-debenzoyl-2′-deoxytaxolN-benzoyltransferase). As shown in Fig. 6, all these proteins have structural features in common, in particular an HXXD motif (His153–Asp157) that may function in acyl transfer catalysis and the DFGWG block (Asp382–Gly386) that was used to design cloning primers (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Monkeys were trained to discriminate among 'baton' stimuli consisting of discrete top and bottom parts joined by a vertical stem. With separate features at each end, we were able to manipulate the two parts of each baton independently. After training the monkeys, we used single-cell recording to compare neuronal responses to learned and unlearned batons. Responses to learned batons, though not enhanced in strength, were enhanced in selectivity for both individual parts and for whole batons. Whole-baton selectivity arose from a form of conjunctive encoding whereby two parts together exerted a greater influence on neuronal activity than predicted by the additive influence of each part considered individually. These results indicate a possible neural mechanism for holistic or configural effects in expert versus novice observers."

Together, our results suggest that Set2 through association with the elongating form of RNA polymerase II plays an important role in transcription elongation. Transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II is a highly regulated process in eukaryotes and involves the cooperative assembly of multicomponent protein complexes (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 2Kornberg R.D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; 6AU, 6-azauracil; TAP, tandem affinity purification; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is phosphorylated in a manner correlated with ongoing transcription. Before transcription initiation, RNA polymerase II with an unphosphorylated CTD is recruited to the promoter by association with general initiation factors and the mediator complex. Shortly after initiation, the CTD becomes partially phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of CTD stimulates dissociation of initiation factors from RNA polymerase II and promotes the recruitment of pre-mRNA 5′-end capping enzymes. Further phosphorylation of CTD during transcription elongation permits it to interact with a variety of elongation, splicing, and 3′-end processing factors (3Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 4Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Orphanides G.

The CTD consists of multiple tandem repeats (26 in yeast and 52 in mammals) of an evolutionarily conserved heptapeptide with the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7(7Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD occurs primarily at Ser2and Ser5 of the heptapeptide, and phosphorylation at each site may play distinct roles (8Patturajan M. Conrad N.K. Bregman D.B. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27823-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was found that in budding yeast, Ser5 is strongly phosphorylated at initiation and early elongation phase, whereas Ser2 is predominantly phosphorylated during the elongation phase (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 10Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the CTD is the docking site for some RNA polymerase II-interacting proteins and phosphorylation of Ser2 or Ser5 of the CTD affects its interaction with other proteins (6Prelich G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of yeast mutants defective in transcription elongation is their sensitivity to the uracil analog 6-azauracil (6AU), which inhibits enzymes in the nucleotide metabolism pathway and leads to depletion of UTP and GTP in yeast cells (11Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Nucleotide depletion affects the elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase II. Thus, 6AU is a useful tool for identifying proteins important for elongation. It has been shown that mutations in the largest and second largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2), factors important for elongation such as PPR2 (TFIIS), SPT4, SPT5, ELP1 (elongator), and PAF1, and the CTD kinase CTK1 which phosphorylates Ser2 (8Patturajan M.

Histone methylation has been recently recognized as an important mechanism for regulation of chromatin structure and gene transcription. Site-specific methylation of histones is involved in regulation of DNA methylation, recruitment of chromatin-associated proteins, heterochromatic assembly, transcriptional activation, and repression (23Rice J.C.

Caldwell J.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Although Set2-LexA could repress transcription of the LacZ reporter gene when tethered to a heterologous promoter (31Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the in vivo role of Set2 in transcription is still unclear and needs further investigation. To elucidate the function of Set2, we sought to identify proteins associated with Set2 by using tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry (36Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the histone methyltransferase Set2 in S. cerevisiae physically interacts with RNA polymerase II. Set2 interacts with RNA polymerase II through the putative WW domain in Set2. The interaction between Set2 and RNA polymerase II depends on phosphorylation, and Set2 associates with elongating RNA polymerase II with Ser2-phosphorylated CTD. Furthermore, deletion of SET2 results in sensitivity to 6AU, suggesting that Set2 is required for transcription elongation. These results indicate that Set2 is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation. The yeast strain used for making TAP-tagged constructs was SF10 (BJ5459, MATaura3-52 trp1 lys2-801 leu2 1 pep4::HIS3 prb11.6R can1). TheSET2-TAP and RPB2-TAP constructs were generated by integration of the TAP tag immediately before the stop codon of the genes (carboxyl-terminal tagging), as described previously (36Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar).SET2-WWΔ-TAP construct was made by integration of the TAP tag immediately after the codon for Leu472 of the Set2 protein, which excluded the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acid residues from 473 to 733) containing the putative WW domain of the Set2 protein. Transformations of yeast strains were performed using the lithium acetate method (37Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). TAP-tagged constructs were confirmed by PCR, Western blotting (detecting the IgG-binding sites of TAP tag using peroxidase anti-peroxidase complex), and sequencing of the tagged protein using tandem mass spectrometry (see below). Yeast pellets (10–20 g) from the TAP-tagged strains grown to an OD600 of around 2.0 were resuspended in about 1 volume of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween-20, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml of bestanin, leupeptin and pepstatin A, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), lysed by agitation with glass beads using a BioSpec bead beater, and then centrifuged at 47,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C as described (27Roguev A.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The TAP-tagged protein in the supernatant was purified using IgG-agarose (Sigma) and calmodulin-Sepharose (Stratagene) essentially as previously described (36Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) except that cleavage by tobacco etch virus protease was performed at 4 °C overnight. Purified proteins were separated on a 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver. For the binding assay of Set2 to phosphorylated CTD and synthesized CTD peptides, Set2-CBP was obtained by elution of the calmodulin-Sepharose (∼200 μl of beads) with five × 200 μl of elution buffer, combining the last four fractions (discard the first fraction), and concentrating them using Centricon (Millipore). Protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) as described (39Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3193) Google Scholar). Digested samples were pressure loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary C18 column (Magic beads, Michrom BioResources) packed in-house (75 μm inner diameter, 10 cm long). An Agilent 1100 high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent Technologies) was used to deliver a gradient across a flow splitter to the column. Eluting peptides from the column were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed by an LCQ-Deca XP ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). Peptide ions were dynamically selected by the operating software for fragmentation. The peptide fragmentation spectra were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using the Sequest computer algorithm (40Eng J.K. McCormak A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). For searching methylation sites, a differential modification of +14 Da (monomethylation), +28 Da (dimethylation), or +42 Da (trimethylation/acetylation) on lysine was included in the search parameters. Methyltransferase assays were carried out by incubating purified Set2-TAP in 30 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing 10 μg of calf thymus histones (Roche) as substrate and 1 μCi ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (60 Ci mmol−1, Amersham) as methyl donor. After incubation for 60 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by boiling in SDS loading buffer, and proteins were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining and fluorography. Equal amounts of Set2-TAP preparations were resolved in parallel on a 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and proteins in the gel were electrophoretically transferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h at room temperature with rocking, and then the blots were incubated with CTD monoclonal antibodies H5 (Covance, 1:1000 dilution), H14 (Covance, 1:500 dilution), or 8WG16 (a gift of S. Buratowski, 1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes with buffer A, the blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) for 1 h. The blots were washed four times with buffer A and then developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and Biomax film (Kodak). Recombinant GST-CTD and GST were produced in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione agarose column using standard techniques (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CTD using HeLa nuclear extract as a source of kinase activity was performed as described (42McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-CTD or GST (10 μg) was incubated with or without HeLa nuclear extract (100 μg) in buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 μg/ml of BSA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.01 μg/μl of aprotinin, 0.01 μg/μl of pepstatin A, 0.02 μg/μl of leupeptin, and 80 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then incubated with preequilibrated glutathione agarose beads for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. After three washes with buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0,03% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the glutathione agarose beads were incubated with purified Set2-TAP in buffer C for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The beads were washed four times with buffer C and then boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The supernatants were run on a 5–15% SDS-PAGE gel, and proteins in the gel were visualized by silver staining and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Sequence analysis by tandem mass spectrometry of the CTD was accomplished chymotrypsin digestion because no trypsin cleavage sites were present. The procedure used for assay of Set2 binding to synthesized CTD peptides is basically as described (10Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol.

Buratowski (13Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)) were immobilized on avidin beads (Pierce). After washing the beads three times with buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate), equal amounts of purified Set2-TAP in buffer D were added to the CTD peptide-bound beads. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, beads were washed four times with buffer D. Bound proteins to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry as above. All yeast strains used for the 6-AU sensitivity assay contained a URA3+ allele in the genome. The URA3 marker in pRS306 was amplified by PCR and used to replace ura3-52 in the SF10 strain. The set2 deletion mutant generated from theSaccharomyces Genome Deletion Project was obtained through Invitrogen (record No. 1257). To generate a set2 deletion mutant in the SF10 strain containing a URA3+allele, KanMX4 flanked by noncoding Set2 sequences were amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA from the set2deletion strain 1257 with primers: 5′-AACTGCATAGTCGTGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GCCCCAAATATGCATGTCTG-3′. The resulting PCR product was then used for transformation of the SF10 strain containing aURA3+ allele, and positive transformants were selected by geneticin (200 mg/liter) in YPD medium. Media containing 6-AU were prepared by supplementing SD-Ura media with 100 μg/ml 6-azauracil (product no. 12,329-3, Aldrich). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 and grown to log phase at 30 °C. Five microliters of 10-fold serial dilutions of each culture in water were spotted on SD-Ura plates with or without 6-AU. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 to 4 days and photographed using a Nikon digital camera. To identify proteins that associate with the histone methyltransferase Set2, the tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach was used. In this approach, two protein A repeats and a calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP), linked by the tobacco etch virus protease recognition site, are fused to the protein of interest and used for sequential affinity purification on resins containing immobilized immunoglobulin G and calmodulin. Because expression of the targeted gene is still controlled by its own endogenous promoter, protein complexes isolated through the target protein are expressed at their natural levels (36Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). We targeted Set2 at its carboxyl terminus with a TAP tag and purified Set2-TAP as outlined above. Consistent with previous reports (31Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the purified Set2-TAP has methyltranferase activity against histone H3 (data not shown), indicating that Set2-TAP is functional. After affinity purification of Set2-TAP, the proteins were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and stained by silver (Fig.1). Peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the largest and the second largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2) and Set2 were found in the preparation (Fig. 1). As an example, the amino acid sequence analysis of RPB1 is shown in Fig. 2. These results suggest that Set2 associates with RNA polymerase II. As a further test, RPB2 was tagged with a TAP tag, and its associated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. We found 11 subunits of the RNA polymerase II as well as Set2 (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Set2 interacts with RNA polymerase II.Figure 2Nanoscale microcapillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of RPB1 band from Fig. 1A.A, eighteen peptides (underscored) from RNA polymerase II subunit 1 were unambiguously matched to acquired tandem mass spectra.

Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). WW domains, named for two signature tryptophan (W) residues that are spaced 20–22 amino acids apart, are small modules found in a number of unrelated proteins and have been implicated in binding to proteins with proline-rich sequences (43Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Some WW domain-containing proteins interact with RNA polymerase II through their WW domains (43Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 44Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine whether the putative WW domain in Set2 is involved in the interaction of Set2 with RNA polymerase, we constructed a TAP-tagged version of Set2 that lacked the WW domain. As shown in Fig.4 B, Set2 with deleted WW domain could not interact with RPB1 and RPB2, indicating that the WW domain in Set2 protein is required for the interaction between Set2 and RNA polymerase II. In addition, when the RPB2-TAP complex isolated from the IgG-agarose column was treated with alkaline phosphatase and then run through the calmodulin affinity column, Set2 could not be detected in the complex (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II is important for its interaction with Set2 protein. Furthermore, it suggests that the absence of phosphatase inhibitors during purification steps may result in an inability to detect the interaction between Set2 and RNA polymerase II. The CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase functions as a platform for interaction with other proteins that associate with RNA polymerase II (6Prelich G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether the association of Set2 with RNA polymerase II is through the CTD, in vitro binding assays using purified Set2-TAP and recombinant GST-CTD were carried out. GST-CTD was phosphorylated in HeLa nuclear extract in the presence of ATP (phosphorylation of GST-CTD was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-phosphorylated CTD antibody H5, data not shown). In parallel, GST protein was treated by incubation of HeLa nuclear extract and ATP. Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated GST-CTD proteins as well as GST untreated or treated with HeLa nuclear extract in the presence of ATP were immobilized onto glutathione agarose. After incubation with purified Set2-TAP, the glutathione bead-bound proteins were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. One band was found in the unphosphorylated GST-CTD sample (Fig. 5 A, lane 1), whereas two bands were found in the phosphorylated GST-CTD sample (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). Peptide sequencing (chymotrypsin digestion) by mass spectrometry confirmed that the band found in the untreated sample (Fig. 5 A, lane 1) and the higher band (Fig.5 A, lane 2) in the GST-CTD sample treated with HeLa nuclear extract were GST-CTD (phosphorylation of GST-CTD by HeLa nuclear extract resulted in mobility shift of GST-CTD), whereas the lower band found only in phosphorylated GST-CTD sample was Set2 (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). No bands were found in the corresponding regions of the gel from GST untreated or treated with HeLa nuclear extract (Lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4). These results indicate that Set2 interacts only with phosphorylated GST-CTD. To further determine which phosphorylation sites in CTD are important for Set2 binding, equal amounts of purified Set2-TAP protein complex were resolved in parallel on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with CTD monoclonal antibodies H5, H14, and 8WG16, which recognize CTD with phosphorylated Ser2, CTD with phosphorylated Ser5, and unphosphorylated CTD, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 B, RPB1 pulled down by Set2 was mainly recognized by H5 but not by H14 or 8GW16, indicating that Set2 mainly associates with RPB1 with CTD phosphorylated at Ser2 positions. In addition, when purified Set2-TAP was incubated with immobilized biotinylated CTD peptides, Set2 was found to bind to CTD peptide phosphorylated on Ser2 but not phosphorylated on Ser5 or unphosphorylated CTD peptide (Fig. 5 C). Together, these results indicate that Set2 interacts with RNA polymerase II through binding to Ser2-phosphorylated CTD of the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II. In budding yeast, Ser2 of CTD is predominantly phosphorylated during the elongation phase (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 10Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); therefore, Set2 may be associated with elongating RNA polymerase II by binding to phosphorylated Ser2 of CTD (Fig. 5). Mutants defective in transcription elongation render yeast cells sensitive to 6-AU; therefore, sensitivity to 6-AU has been used as an assay for involvement in transcription elongation (46Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To determine whether Set2 is important for transcription elongation, we tested the Δset2 strain for sensitivity to 6-AU. As shown in Fig.6, the Δset2 strain grew more slowly on medium containing 6-AU than did the parent strain. In contrast, the Δset2 strain grew like the parent strain on medium lacking 6-AU (Fig. 6). These results suggest that Set2 play a role in transcription elongation in vivo. In yeast, the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 binds both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CTD through its WW domains (45Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 47Chang A. Cheang S. Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20562-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas the splicing factor Prp40 and the prolyl isomerase Ess1 only associate with the phosphorylated CTD through their WW domains (44Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 45Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is little difference in the affinity of Ess1 for CTD peptides phosphorylated at Ser2 or Ser5 (48Myers J.K. Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8479-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Set2 binds preferentially to CTD with phosphorylated Ser2 and the WW domain in Set2 is required for the binding of Set2 to RPB1. Whereas Ser5 of CTD is strongly phosphorylated at initiation and early elongation phase, Ser2 is predominantly phosphorylated during the elongation phase (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 10Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The yeast CTD kinase I phosphorylates the CTD on Ser2 of the heptapeptide repeats. This is distinct from the sites of phosphorylation by transcription factor IIH and Srb10, which reside mostly at positions Ser5, and Ser5 and Ser2, respectively (49Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). CTD kinase I is composed of three subunits termed Ctk1, Ctk2, and Ctk3. Deletion of the geneCTK1, encoding the catalytic subunit of CTD kinase I, causes a loss of phosphorylation of the CTD at Ser2 of the heptad repeat (8Patturajan M. Conrad N.K. Bregman D.B. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27823-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies using a HeLa nuclear extract showed that yeast CTD kinase I could promote transcription elongation but had little effect on initiation (50Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10990-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies thus suggested a role for CTD kinase I in transcription elongation. Phosphorylation of CTD on Ser2 may allow RNA polymerase II to associate with other factors such as Set2 that allow efficient elongation. Consistent with the above hypothesis, we found that Δset2is sensitive to 6-azauracil (Fig. 6). Mutations in genes that encode elongation factors and elongation-defective forms of RNA polymerase II are 6-azauracil-sensitive (11Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the gene CTK1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the CTD kinase I being responsible for phosphorylation of Ser2 of the CTD heptad repeat, resulted in the yeast sensitive to 6-azauracil (19Murray S. Udupa R. Yao S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser2 of the CTD heptad repeat creates a binding site for the Set2 protein. Methylation of histone H3 at Lys36 by Set2 is therefore likely to be important. During transcription elongation, phosphorylation of Ser2increases (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 10Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and this may create the binding sites for Set2 to associate with RNA polymerase II. Association of Set2 with elongating RNA polymerase II may allow Set2 to methylate histone H3 and then affect local nucleosome structure. It is also possible that Set2 affects transcription elongation by targeting non-H3 protein components associated with the elongating RNA polymerase II, and this affects elongation, although we did not detect any methylation of the largest and second largest subunits of RNA polymerase II treated by Set2 (data not shown). In the future, it would be interesting to determine the consequence of H3 Lys36 methylation on transcription elongation as well as to see whether Set2 can methylate other nuclear proteins. We thank Stephen Buratowski for providing GST-CTD strain, 8WG16 monoclonal antibody, and synthesized CTD peptides; Adam Rudner for pRS306 plasmid; Martin Cohn for HeLa nuclear extract; Junmin Peng for technical assistance; and members of the Gygi and Moazed laboratories for helpful discussion and technical advice."

In higher eukaryotes, this enzyme is a heterodimer comprising a catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a modifier subunit (GCLM), which change the catalytic characteristics of the holoenzyme. To define the cellular function of GCLM, we disrupted the mouse Gclm gene to create a null allele. Gclm(−/−) mice are viable and fertile and have no overt phenotype. In liver, lung, pancreas, erythrocytes, and plasma, however, GSH levels in Gclm(−/−) mice were 9–16% of that in Gclm(+/+) littermates. Cysteine levels inGclm(−/−) mice were 9, 35, and 40% of that inGclm(+/+) mice in kidney, pancreas, and plasma, respectively, but remained unchanged in the liver and erythrocytes. Comparing the hepatic GCL holoenzyme with GCLC in the genetic absence of GCLM, we found the latter had an ∼2-fold increase inK m for glutamate and a dramatically enhanced sensitivity to GSH inhibition. The major decrease in GSH, combined with diminished GCL activity, rendered Gclm(−/−) fetal fibroblasts strikingly more sensitive to chemical oxidants such as H2O2. We conclude that theGclm(−/−) mouse represents a model of chronic GSH depletion that will be very useful in evaluating the role of the GCLM subunit and GSH in numerous pathophysiological conditions as well as in environmental toxicity associated with oxidant insult.

Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant non-protein thiol found in most aerobic organisms (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5947) Google Scholar, 2Fahey R.C. Sundquist A.R. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 1-53PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is an antioxidant and, by way of direct scavenging and enzymatic reduction reactions, participates in cellular protection against both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. GSH also regulates the cellular redox balance by maintaining the essential thiol status of proteins (3Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Moreover, GSH serves as a storage depot for cysteine and as a cofactor for the enzymic reduction of ribonucleotides (4Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Because of one or more of these functions, GSH has been shown to be involved in decisions concerning the fate of the cell, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (6Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 7Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). GSH is synthesized from its precursor amino acids in two sequential enzymatic reactions. Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) 1The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate-cysteine ligase; GCLC, GCL catalytic subunit; GCLM, GCL modifier subunit; γ-GC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GSH-EE, GSH monoethyl ester; MFF, mouse fetal fibroblast; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography1The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate-cysteine ligase; GCLC, GCL catalytic subunit; GCLM, GCL modifier subunit; γ-GC, γ-glutamylcysteine; GSH-EE, GSH monoethyl ester; MFF, mouse fetal fibroblast; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-GC) from glutamate and cysteine. Glutathione synthetase then couples glycine to γ-GC to form GSH. The reaction catalyzed by GCL is rate-limiting in GSH biosynthesis, and the product GSH is a feedback inhibitor of GCL activity. Higher eukaryotes contain GCL as a heterodimer comprised of a 72.8-kDa catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a 30.8-kDa modifier subunit (GCLM), which are encoded by genes on different chromosomes (8Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 9Anderson M.E. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 10Griffith O.W. Mulcahy R.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 209-267PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with both native and recombinant GCL protein demonstrate that the catalytic subunit is necessary and sufficient for γ-GC biosynthesis (11Yan N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1588-1593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Gclc gene in mice demonstrated that GCLC and most likely GSH are essential for embryonic development but not survival of cells in culture (13Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding about the function of the modifier subunit has been the result of studies examining the catalytic activity of the purified GCLC protein versus the GCL holoenzyme. Experiments with both rat and human preparations indicated that GCLM modifies GCLC catalytic properties by decreasing the K m of glutamate and diminishing the inhibition by GSH (15Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because intracellular levels of glutamate are typically lower and those of GSH are typically higher than the K m andK i for GCLC, respectively, GCLC alone has been predicted to function poorly in maintaining cellular GSH levels (15Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental support for this hypothesis, however, is mixed. Overexpression of GCLM increases the cellular GSH by 2-fold, rendering cells resistant to oxidative stress (17Tipnis S.R. Blake D.G. Shepherd A.G. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In agreement with this result, down-regulation of GCLM mRNA by ribozyme expression leads to a decrease of GSH levels in cultured pancreatic islet cells (18Kijima H. Tsuchida T. Kondo H. Iida T. Oshika Y. Nakamura M. Scanlon K.J. Kondo T. Tamaoki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, up-regulation of GCLC alone has also been reported to support high levels of intracellular GSH (19Mulcahy R.T. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4771-4775PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yao K.S. Godwin A.K. Johnson S.W. Ozols R.F. O'Dwyer P.J. Hamilton T.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4367-4374PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite a decrease in GCLM following antisense RNA inhibition of GCLM translation, no changes in GSH were noted in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cultures (21Soltaninassab S.R. Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Freeman M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Lu S.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1169-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To define better the cellular function of GCLM, we have generated a mouse line with a targeted disruption of the Gclm gene. Mice homozygous for the null allele are viable and fertile; we show here that this mouse appears to be an excellent model system for studying animals that are severely compromised in their response to oxidative stress. Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) and phorone were purchased from Sigma. The GSH monoethyl ester (GSH-EE) was prepared as described previously (23Anderson M.E. Levy E.J. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A λ-Fix II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) 129/SvJ mouse genomic library was screened with a GCLM cDNA probe (24Solis W.A. Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Freshwater S. Harrer J.M. He L. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1739-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and several overlapping clones were mapped. A targeting construct was then prepared using portions of these clones (Fig.1). 2For a detailed description of the targeting construct, please contact the corresponding author. The Gclm gene was targeted in the same J1 and D embryonic stem cell lines as described previously (14Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J blastocysts were used for embryonic stem cell injection (14Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Resultant male chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6J females, and the offspring were of mixed (C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ) genetic background. All mouse experiments were conducted on littermates having the three possible genotypes following the Gclm(+/−) × Gclm(+/−) intercross, and all studies were approved by the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Genomic DNA isolated from embryonic stem cells or mouse spleen was digested overnight with BglII and processed for Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled 3′ probe outside the region encompassed by the targeting construct (Fig. 1). Following targeting, the mice were routinely genotyped using PCR. The targeted allele was detected as a 250-bp fragment using primers OL183a (5′-AACGTTGCAAGCTACTGC-3′) external to the targeted region of intron 1 and OL184a (5′-ATATGCGAAGTGGACCTG-3′) within the NEO gene. The wild-type allele was detected as a 200-bp fragment using primers OL183a and OL185s (5′-AGTTGAGAGCCTTCACTG-3′) within the deleted region of intron 1. Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation, and tissues were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored at −70 °C until use. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from various tissues and analyzed for the presence of GCLC and GCLM mRNA as described previously (25Maier A. Dalton T.P. Puga A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Equal loading was determined by rehybridizing blots with a probe for β-actin mRNA. For detection of GCLC protein, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide QEKGERTNPNHPC (amino acids 79–91 of the mouse GCLC) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The cytosolic fractions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted with the above antibody (1:5000). The amount of GCLM protein was determined as described previously (14Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) using anti-GCLM antibody (a gift of T. Kavanagh). Liver samples were homogenized immediately in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (154 mm KCl, 5 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) using a Teflon homogenizer. The cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously (14Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and then separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were applied to a Superose-6 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with the homogenization buffer, and the protein was separated with homogenization buffer. GSH, GSSG, and cysteine levels were determined as described previously (26Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 27Shertzer H.G. Vasiliou V. Liu R.M. Tabor M.W. Nebert D.W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The formation of γ-GC froml-glutamate and l-cysteine was performed at 37 °C under the conditions described previously (28Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding a 50-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture to 50 μl of 10 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in 40 mm HCl and 10% trichloroacetic acid. A fluorescent derivative of γ-GC was generated using o-phthalaldehyde (26Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the derivative was separated from GSH and quantified using HPLC. The reverse-phase HPLC utilized isocratic elution from a Nova-Pak (4 μm, 60 Å, 3.9 × 150 mm) C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with a mobile phase consisting of 7.5% methanol, 92.5% 150 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. Fluorescence was determined at 365 nm excitation and 430 nm emission against standards of known concentration. Under the conditions utilized, the assay was linear with protein concentration and with time for at least 60 min. MFFs were prepared from gestational day 14.5 fetuses (29Cooke J.E. Godin I. Ffrench-Constant C. Heasman J. Wylie C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 37-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) derived from theGclm(+/−) x Gclm(+/−) intercross. The cells from individual fetuses were cultured until the Gclmgenotype was determined by PCR (as above) following which the cells from three or four fetuses were pooled for subsequent analyses. For toxicity measurements, MFF cells were seeded in 24-well plates (4 × 104 cells/well) 14 h before treatment. Cells were then administered by direct addition into the culture medium, 100× concentrated stocks of the indicated compound in phosphate-buffered saline. The cultures were then incubated for an additional 8 h before the toxicity measurements; longer incubations did not lead to greater toxicity. H2O2-induced cell death was determined by both the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and neutral red assay (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' protocols. All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Group means were compared by one-way analysis of variance using the SAS program (Windows version 8.0). pvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. When the overall test of significance led to rejection of the null hypothesis, a multiple comparison was performed to determine the source of the effect. We constructed a targeting vector in which the NEO minigene cassette disruptsGclm exon 1 and removes the 3′ splice donor site of intron 1 (Fig. 1 A). Transcripts initiated at either of the two previously identified transcriptional start clusters of the Gclm gene (24Solis W.A. Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Freshwater S. Harrer J.M. He L. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1739-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) would be expected to encode only the N-terminal 61 amino acids of GCLM and terminate in the out-of-phase NEO gene, producing, if any, a nonfunctional protein. Of the 270 (agouti, 129/SvJ-derived) embryonic stem clones resistant to both G418 and ganciclovir, four homologous recombinant clones were identified (data not shown); these clones were used for injecting into the (non-agouti C57BL/6J) blastocyst to generate chimeric mice. Such mice were mated with C57BL/6J female mice, and agouti animals were tested for germ line transmission of the targetedGclm(−) allele, which would result in Gclm(+/−) heterozygous mice. Gclm(+/−) mice were then intercrossed, and the resultant offspring were genotyped by Southern blot (Fig.1 B) and PCR analysis (Fig. 1 C). Because the probe used was outside the targeting construct, Southern blots confirmedGclm targeting as opposed to random integration of the targeting construct. Of 126 mice genotyped, 28 (23%) were Gclm(+/+), 63 (50%) were Gclm(+/−), and 35 (27%) were Gclm(−/−). These numbers approximate the expected Mendelian percentages of 25:50:25 and indicate that no embryonic lethality occurred as the result of the Gclm targeting. Fig. 2, A and B, confirmed that we could detect neither GCLM mRNA nor GCLM protein, respectively, in the Gclm(−/−) homozygote. Tissues surveyed included liver, kidney, pancreas, lung, heart, and spleen (liver and kidney shown). Taken together these data indicate that the targeted Gclm(−) allele, as experimentally planned, is a null allele. Gclm(−/−) mice are viable and appear overtly healthy up to 6 months of age. Moreover, we have crossed Gclm(−/−) mice and found both sexes to be fertile. Female Gclm(+/+),Gclm(+/−), and Gclm(−/−) mice show no statistical differences in body weights from 2 to 11 weeks of age; maleGclm(−/−) mice weigh ∼10% less thanGclm(+/+) or Gclm(+/−) littermates, however, beginning at week 5 (Fig. 3). A histological survey performed at 5 weeks of age revealed no evidence for abnormalities, however, in tissues of knockout mice, including liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and spleen (data not shown). The reason for the sex-linked weight difference has not yet been investigated further. GCLM is known to bind to GCLC and change the catalytic characteristics of GCLC in vitro. In the context of cellular glutamate and GSH concentrations, GCLC alone (in a Gclm(−/−) mouse) is predicted to function poorly in synthesizing γ-GC. Would GCLC alone lead to lowered levels of GSH? We therefore measured the intracellular levels of GSH in several tissues (Table I). In liver, kidney, pancreas, red cells, and plasma, GSH levels were dramatically decreased in Gclm(−/−) mice (9–16% of that in wild-type animals) and significantly diminished in Gclm(+/−) heterozygotes (43–82% of that in wild-type animals). Alterations in GSSG levels in Gclm(−/−) mice followed a trend similar to that of GSH (data not shown); consequently, there were no significant differences in the ratio of GSSG/GSH + GSSG among the three genotypes. Lower GSH synthesis, presumably by liver, resulted in a dramatic decrease of GSH in plasma, and compared with that inGclm(+/+) mice, plasma GSH levels in Gclm(−/−) and Gclm(+/−) mice dropped to 16 and 48%, respectively, of that in Gclm(+/+) wild-type mice.Table IGSH and cysteine levels in tissues of mice of the three Gclm genotypesThiol levelsGclmLiverKidneyPancreasErythrocytesPlasmaGSH(+/+)6.1 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.167.5 ± 3.762.1 ± 4.8(+/−)4.7 ± 0.1*1-ap < 0.01 when comparing (+/+) and (+/−) mice.

Values are means ± S.E. of three or four mice. Numbers in parentheses are percentage of the wild type. Circulating GSH is believed to replenish the intracellular cysteine pools via the membrane-bound enzymes γ-glutamyltranspeptidase and dipeptidase, which are especially abundant in kidney and pancreas (30Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z.Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C.N. Chevez-Barrios P. Wang Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, we found that cysteine levels in the kidney, pancreas, and plasma of Gclm(−/−) mice were markedly decreased, whereas no significant changes in cysteine levels were seen in liver or erythrocytes (Table I). GCLM (30.8 kDa) interacts with GCLC (72.8 kDa) to produce the GCL holoenzyme (100 kDa). Using Gclm(+/+) hepatic cytosol and anti-GCLC and anti-GCLM (Fig.4 A), we found two overlapping chromatographic peaks, one ∼100 kDa and the other ∼72 kDa. The occurrence of the 100-kDa GCLC peak corresponded with the elution of GCLM (Fig. 4 A), and no additional GCLM peak was detected in the remaining eluent or void-volume peak (not shown). These data indicate that the 100-kDa peak represents the GCL holoenzyme. Chromatography of Gclm(−/−) hepatic cytosol (Fig.4 B) supports this notion because the 100-kDa GCLC peak is absent in this sample as is the associated GCLM. These analyses support previous data implicating GCLM as the major, if not sole, dimerization partner for GCLC. Measurement of GCL specific activity from the hepatic cytosol ofGclm(+/+) and Gclm(−/−) mice (1.4 ± 0.2 and 2.0 ± 0.3 nmol/h/mg of protein, respectively) revealed a modest increase in the knockout mouse. This result is not surprising because we used saturating glutamate concentrations (15 mm) and no GSH in our assay system. Thus, the measured activity actually reflects the amount of GCLC present in the hepatic cytosol, which is somewhat elevated in Gclm(−/−) mice (Fig.2 B). Following gel filtration, partially purified fractions containing only the GCL holoenzyme or GCLC alone were isolated (Fig. 4), and the catalytic characteristics of these fractions were tested to investigate the role of GCLM in mouse GCL holoenzyme function. These analyses were performed on GCL holoenzyme partially purified as shown in Fig. 4 or on GCLC prepared by three different methods: 1) GCLC from aGclm(−/−) hepatic cytosol without purification, 2) GCLC from a Gclm(+/+) hepatic cytosol chromatographically separated from GCLM (Fig. 4), and 3) partially purified GCLC from aGclm(−/−) hepatic cytosol (Fig. 4). All preparations provided similar results. Shown are data from GCLC prepared by method 3. Under all conditions for kinetic analysis the production of γ-GC was linear for at least 1 h, and data were collected for these analyses 30 min following the start of enzymatic reactions. Shown for comparison are results from two previous studies that examined theK m for glutamate and cysteine for the recombinant rat and human GCL holoenzyme and GCLC alone (TableII). The apparent K mfor l-glutamate is increased for GCLC compared with that for the GCL holoenzyme, whereas the apparent K m forl-cysteine does not differ significantly (Table II). Except for the large difference between the rat and both mouse and human with regard to a change in the K m for glutamate, the kinetic constants are similar between species. A striking difference between the GCL holoenzyme and GCLC is the dramatic inhibition of the latter by GSH (15Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Fraser J.A.

Using partially purified mouse GCL holoenzyme versus GCLC alone, we obtained a similar result. GCLC was more sensitive than the GCL holoenzyme to GSH inhibition (Fig.5). Taken together these data suggest that GSH deficiency in the Gclm(−/−) mice is at least in part due to differences in catalytic characteristics between the GCL holoenzyme and the GCLC subunit.Table IIKinetic constants for the GCL holoenzyme or the GCLC aloneEnzymeKm forl-GluKm for l-CysMouse GCL0.86 ± 0.060.17Mouse GCLC1.70 ± 0.100.14Rat GCL2-aValues from Huang et al.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent determinations. To obtain further insight into the cellular function of Gclm, we studied cultured primary MFFs derived from Gclm(+/+), Gclm(+/−), and Gclm(−/−) mice. GCL activity (measured with saturating glutamate and no GSH), GCLC, and cysteine levels did not differ significantly in MFFs of any genotype (data not shown). GSH levels in Gclm(−/−) cells, however, were about 20% of that in Gclm(+/+) cells (3.27 versus15.31 nmol/mg of protein). To test the possibility that cells without GCLM might be sensitive to oxidant stress, we measured MFF viability following exposure to the cellular oxidant H2O2 (Fig.6 A). This dose-response analysis demonstrated that Gclm(−/−) cells are strikingly more sensitive (∼10-fold) than Gclm(+/+) cells to cell killing by H2O2. In an effort to normalize toxicity between Gclm(+/+) and Gclm(−/−) MFFs, GSH was depleted in the former using phorone (32Plummer J.L. Smith B.R. Sies H. Bend J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 33Meister A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 155-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and replenished in the latter using the cell-permeable GSH-EE (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5947) Google Scholar, 23Anderson M.E. Levy E.J. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Preliminary dose-response experiments first defined the concentrations of phorone and GSH-EE needed to normalize within 5% the GSH concentrations between Gclm(−/−) and Gclm(+/+) cells (data not shown). Thus, at the time MFFs were exposed to H2O2, the Gclm(+/+) MFFs treated with phorone contained GSH levels similar to that inGclm(−/−) MFFs, and the Gclm(−/−) MFFs treated with GSH-EE contained GSH levels similar to that inGclm(+/+) MFFs. Depletion of GSH by phorone enhanced the sensitivity of Gclm(+/+) cells to H2O2 (Fig. 6 B); however, these cells were still significantly more resistant than Gclm(−/−) cells. On the other hand, increases of intracellular GSH level by GSH-EE offered only moderate protection against H2O2 for the Gclm(−/−) cells. In this study, we have described the generation and initial characterization of the Gclm(−/−) mouse line.Gclm(−/−) mice are viable and fertile and show no overt phenotype compared with their Gclm(+/+) orGclm(+/−) littermates. GSH levels in several tissues and cells from Gclm(−/−) animals, however, are severely depressed. Based on the enzymatic characteristics of GCLC, previous reports (15Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had suggested that loss of the GCLM protein might lead to extreme phenotypic abnormalities or even early mortality, similar to the phenotype found for the Gclc(−/−) homozygote (13Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14Dalton T.P. Dieter M.Z. Yang Y. Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Gclc(−/−) mice die between gestational days 7.5 and 8.5 apparently as the result of apoptosis of cells in the distal portion of the developing embryo (13Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Since Gclm(−/−) homozygotes do not suffer such consequences, it is possible thatGclm(−/−) mice maintain GSH above some critical level below which cell death signaling pathways would be activated. It should be noted that indeed most, if not all, cellular roles previously ascribed to GSH are redundant, and cells can survive in culture without GSH provided they are supplied with an alternate sulfur source (13Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another obvious difference betweenGclc(−/−) and Gclm(−/−) cells is the capacity of the latter to synthesize γ-GC, and although the concentration of this intermediate is extremely low in cells, one cannot dismiss the possibility that γ-GC serves some critical cellular function(s) aside from GSH biosynthesis. Various studies suggest that intracellular GCLC and GCLM do not exist in equimolar amounts (21Soltaninassab S.R. Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Freeman M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Gipp J.J. Bailey H.H. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The lowered GSH levels in tissues fromGclm(+/−) mice further support this premise. One must be cautious with the interpretation of these data, however, because diminished GSH concentrations may also be attributed to lower levels of the GCL substrate, cysteine. This is very likely to be the case for kidney and pancreas where cysteine levels are well below normal; yet, this is unlikely for liver and erythrocytes. Further, the chromatographic separation of GCL in Gclm(+/+) hepatic cytosol shows an excess of GCLC (Fig. 4) and little evidence for free GCLM. On the other hand, free GCLM was detected whenGclm(+/+) MFF cytosol was chromatographed, and this may explain why the heterozygous Gclm(+/−) MFFs do not exhibit intermediate toxicity when challenged with H2O2(Fig. 6 A). Support for the idea that GCLM may be limiting can also be gleaned from the literature. For example, in HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice, a 59% decrease of GCLM leads to lowered hepatic GSH levels (35Choi J. Liu R.M. Kundu R.K. Sangiorgi F. Wu W. Maxson R. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3693-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutation in the 5′-flanking region of the humanGCLM gene results in a diminished reporter gene response to oxidant insult and is associated with susceptibility to ischemic heart disease (36Nakamura S. Kugiyama K. Sugiyama S. Miyamoto S. Koide S. Fukushima H. Honda O. Yoshimura M. Ogawa H. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Since GCLC and GCLM are regulated at the transcriptional level by oxidative stress and regulation of the two proteins might not be coordinated, it is intriguing to speculate that some cell types may respond by up-regulating GCLM and others by up-regulating GCLC in contexts where their respective dimerization partner is in excess. Such regulation remains to be rigorously demonstrated. The present study clearly shows that GCLM is not essential for viability but that loss of GCLM severely lowers GSH and renders cells susceptible to oxidant stress. Is lower GSH, per se, a principle reason for sensitivity to oxidants? Several studies have shown that the resistance to drug and/or radiation treatment of tumor cells does not necessarily correlate with cellular GSH levels but rather with GCL activity (33Meister A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 155-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 37Lee F.Y. Siemann D.W. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 60: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, decreasing GSH in Gclm(+/+) MFFs or elevating GSH inGclm(−/−) MFFs is only modestly effective in normalizing the phenotypes of these cells (Fig. 6 B). This finding may suggest that recovery from oxidative insult requires a robust GSH synthetic potential and that the GCL holoenzyme is necessary for this capacity. Thus, a major function of GCLM may be to improve GSH synthetic capacity as a defense against oxidative insult. Such a role may be predictable based on kinetic properties of the GCL holoenzymeversus GCLC provided by this and previous reports (15Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The long term physiological consequence of chronic GSH deficiency has not yet been investigated. As mentioned above, a functional polymorphism in the 5′-flanking region of human GCLM gene has been identified and is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (36Nakamura S.

Chronic GSH deficiency has also been suspected as a causative factor in a number of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases, aging, diabetes mellitus, cataracts, and AIDS (38Bains J.S.

Most evidence supporting a pivotal role for decreased GSH in these conditions is correlative, however, rather than direct.Gclm(−/−) mice have incredibly lowered GSH levels but seem to be normal. Observation of this mouse line for another 12–24 months of its life span may prove interesting. We thus believe that these mice will provide an exciting model system for the study of chronic GSH deficiency and enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress, especially that caused by environmental chemicals.

We have proposed that Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL (the Bax-like cleavage fragment of Bcl-xL) function by forming pores that are at least partially composed of lipids (lipidic pore formation). Since the membrane monolayer must bend during lipidic pore formation, we here explore the effect of intrinsic membrane monolayer curvature on pore formation. Nonlamellar lipids with positive intrinsic curvature such as lysophospholipids promoted membrane permeabilization, whereas nonlamellar lipids with negative intrinsic curvature such as diacylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine inhibited membrane permeabilization. The differential effects of nonlamellar lipids on membrane permeabilization were not correlated with lipid-induced changes in membrane binding or insertion of Bax or ΔN76Bcl-xL. Altogether, these results are consistent with a model whereby Bax-type proteins change the bending propensity of the membrane to form pores comprised at least in part of lipids in a structure of net positive monolayer curvature.

While a variety of triggers initiate apoptosis, many signaling pathways converge at the mitochondria to release cytochromec and other apoptogenic proteins needed to start a cascade that ultimately leads to cellular demise (1Wang X. Genes Develop. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, Bax-type proteins localizing to the outer mitochondrial membrane elicit the release of cytochrome c and other intermembrane proteins that promote cell death (2Antonsson B.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), suggesting that Bax also functions as a pore former. However, when incorporated into purely lipidic planar phospholipid bilayer membranes, Bax (and homologous proapoptotic molecules) induce highly fluctuating changes in membrane conductance and decrease membrane stability (6Basañez G.

Since there are no constant, unitary conductance steps in these recordings, they do not resemble recordings from typical ionic channels where the conduit from one side of the membrane to the other is exclusively lined by protein. Instead, these results reveal striking similarities to lipidic pores, in which the pore is lined by lipid headgroups (9Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Melikyan G.B. Abidor I.G. Markin V.S.

We proposed that Bax-type molecules alter the properties of the lipid bilayer so that lipids are able to rearrange and form a lipidic pore (6Basañez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A.

One test of the hypothesis that pores formed by Bax-type proteins are at least partially lipidic is the prediction that lipidic pores by their nature should depend more strongly upon the lipid composition of the membrane than purely proteinaceous pores. Lipid pore formation is thought to involve a bending of the lipid monolayer of the membrane (9Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Melikyan G.B. Abidor I.G. Markin V.S. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 643-655Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The energy for monolayer bending is a function of the intrinsic curvature of its lipid constituents (18Gruner S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Roughly, the relation between the effective cross-sectional areas of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of a lipid molecule determines its intrinsic curvature (19Zimmerberg J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Major lipid components of biological membranes including phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; ANTS, 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate; DPX, p-xilenebis piridinium bromide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; O-LPC, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine; O-LPE, oleoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine; DOG, dioleoylglycerol; DOPE, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; DOPG, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) hold similar cross-sectional areas in hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts and thereby organize themselves into flat lamellar structures (lamellar lipids). On the other hand, certain naturally occurring lipid species display an imbalance between the effective cross-sectional areas of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts; such lipids spontaneously self-organize into curved morphologies (nonlamellar lipids). Nonlamellar lipids with a large effective hydrophilic part relative to the effective hydrophobic part, exemplified by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), possess positive intrinsic curvature, whereas nonlamellar lipids with a small effective hydrophilic part relative to the effective hydrophobic part such as unsaturated species of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and diacylglycerol possess negative intrinsic curvature (20Basañez G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1478-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test if the pore formed by Bax-type proteins is sensitive to the tendency of the membrane monolayer for bending, nonlamellar lipids were incorporated into phospholipid bilayer membranes, and then the pore-forming activity of proapoptotic proteins was measured. Our results show that lipids of positive intrinsic curvature favored membrane permeabilization, whereas lipids of negative intrinsic curvature inhibited membrane permeabilization, in agreement with the idea that Bax-type proteins form pores together with lipid molecules. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). KCl, Hepes, EDTA, Triton X-100, and horse heart cytochrome c were from Sigma. 8-Aminonaphtalane-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) andp-xylenebis(piridinium bromide) (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Full-length Bax was produced in Escherichia coli as a chitin fusion-binding protein using the pTYB1 plasmid and was purified by affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography (5Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The peak protein fraction was concentrated, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Bax oligomerization was induced by a 1-h incubation of the protein with 1% octylglucoside (21Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that, at the concentrations used in the liposome assays, octylglucoside alone did not significantly increase membrane permeability. Oligomeric full-length Bcl-xL and oligomeric ΔN76Bcl-xLwere obtained as described previously (8Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31083-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In all cases, lipid mixtures at indicated ratios were co-dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Organic solvents were removed by evaporation under an argon stream, followed by incubation for 2 h in a vacuum. The buffers used for resuspension of dry lipid films were as follows, (i) ANTS release assays: 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.0; (ii) cytochrome c release assays: 100 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.01 mm cytochrome c; (iii) membrane-binding and membrane-insertion assays: 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in D20 (D20-buffer). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were formed by extrusion under N2 pressure through Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes of 0.1-μm pore size using the method of Mayeret al. (22Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Untrapped ANTS and cytochrome c were removed by gel filtration in Sephadex G-25 and Sephacryl S-400 HR columns, respectively. Dynamic light scattering measurements (Coulter Model N4 Plus) showed that the different LUV populations used in this study had unimodal size distributions with mean diameters (± S.D.) ranging from 124 ± 27 nm to 142 nm ± 33 nm. Release of ANTS from LUV was monitored in an SLM-2 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments), in a thermostatted 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring, at 37 °C. λex was 350 nm, and λem was 520 nm (slits = 4 nm). The extent of ANTS release was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation %ANTS release=(Ff−F0/F100−F0)×100Equation 1 where F f is the measured fluorescence of protein-treated LUV after a fully stable signal (plateau) was achieved,F 0 is the initial fluorescence of the LUV suspension before protein addition, and F 100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of LUV by addition of TX-100 (final concentration, 0.2% w/v). Release of cytochromec from LUV was measured as described previously (8Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31083-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, protein and lipid concentrations were 50 nm and 50 μm, respectively. To measure the total amount of protein bound to membrane, a method was used based on the fact that lipid-associated protein, but not free protein, floats in D20-buffer (23Ostolaza H. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, LUV in D20-buffer were incubated with protein for 30 min, followed by ultracentrifugation of the mixture (2 h, 100,000 × g) and determination of the protein contents in lipid-associated and lipid-free fractions on the basis of their fluorescence intensities at λex 280 nm and λem 345 nm after addition of the detergent dodecyl octaethyleneglycol mono ether (final concentration, 300 μm). To discriminate between protein inserted into and adsorbed to the membrane, the same protocol was followed except that a second incubation was performed at pH 11.5 for 30 min, the alkaline pH being maintained during sample centrifugation. Upon alkaline pH incubation, the fraction of protein inserted to some degree into the membrane hydrophobic matrix remains associated to LUV, whereas the fraction of protein only peripherally associated with the membrane is detached from the vesicles. Membrane lifetime experiments were done in decane-containing planar lipid bilayers formed by the Mueller-Rudin technique across a 550-μm hole in a lucite chamber (Warner Inst., Hamden, CO). Prior to voltage application across the membrane, purified proteins were added to the aqueous subphase, and the solution was stirred for 5 min to ensure good mixing. A software program (BROWSE, available upon request) was modified to apply voltage pulses and facilitate membrane lifetime measurements. If the pore formed by Bax-type proteins is even partially lipidic, its properties should be affected by the lipid composition of the membrane and thus, by the physicochemical properties of the membrane. Classically, the membrane monolayer bends during lipidic pore formation (9Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Melikyan G.B. Abidor I.G. Markin V.S. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 643-655Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A key determinant of the propensity of the membrane monolayer to bend is the lipid intrinsic curvature. To test whether lipid intrinsic curvature makes an important contribution to pore formation by proapoptotic proteins, nonlamellar lipids with known intrinsic curvatures were chosen. Specifically, LUV were prepared in which the lamellar lipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was gradually replaced by the nonlamellar lipids of positive intrinsic curvature oleoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (O-LPC) and oleoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (O-LPE) (24Fuller N.L. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or by the nonlamellar lipids of negative intrinsic curvature dioleoylglycerol (DOG) (25Leikin S. Kozlov M.M. Fuller N. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2623-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Szule J.A. Fuller N.L. Rand R.P. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 977-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (24Fuller N.L. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Leikin S. Kozlov M.M. Fuller N. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2623-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Then, the ability of Bax to release the fluorescent probe ANTS encapsulated within those vesicles was studied. The larger the proportion of O-LPC and O-LPE incorporated in the membrane the higher the extent of vesicular ANTS released by Bax (Fig. 1). Conversely, the larger the proportion either of membrane-incorporated DOPE or DOG, the smaller the Bax-induced ANTS release. Hence, positive and negative membrane monolayer curvature promoted and inhibited, respectively, the release of LUV-encapsulated ANTS by Bax. Moreover, O-LPC, having an intrinsic curvature more positive than O-LPE (24Fuller N.L. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), promoted Bax-mediated vesicular ANTS release more effectively than did LPE; and DOG, having an intrinsic curvature more negative than DOPE (25Leikin S. Kozlov M.M. Fuller N. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2623-2632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), inhibited Bax-mediated vesicular ANTS release more effectively than did DOPE. A similar pattern of results was obtained at a wide range of Bax concentrations in LUV containing DOPG or tetraoleoylphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin, CL) (TableI). Likewise, membrane-incorporated O-LPC and O-LPE promoted and DOG and DOPE inhibited the dose-dependent release of vesicular ANTS induced by ΔN76Bcl-xL, the proapoptotic Bax-like caspase cleavage fragment of Bcl-xL (8Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol.

In the case of the full-length, antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, however, nonlamellar lipids had a more modest effect on ANTS release, and neither DOPE nor DOG inhibited this process (Table II). It is noteworthy that none of these proteins changed the overall structure of the LUV as deduced from dynamic light scattering measurements before and after treatment (data not shown), indicating that they did not induce ANTS release through vesicle fragmentation or aggregation.Table IDose dependence of Bax-elicited ANTS release in LUV of different lipid compositionsBax1545150nmnm % ANTS releasenmLipid composition (mol/mol)DOPC/DOPG (6/4)8 ± 026 ± 162 ± 4DOPC/DOPG/O-LPC (5/4/1)14 ± 147 ± 491 ± 6DOPC/DOPG/DOG (5/4/1)2 ± 012 ± 227 ± 3DOPC/CL (6/4)9 ± 122 ± 267 ± 5DOPC/CL/O-LPC (5/4/1)16 ± 239 ± 388 ± 7DOPC/CL/DOG (5/4/1)7 ± 016 ± 243 ± 4Values given as mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.

Efflux of cytochrome c across the outer mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol is a pivotal event during apoptosis, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that Bax-type proteins are actively involved in this process (1Wang X.

We have recently shown that ΔN76Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-xL, can form pores in pure lipid vesicles capable of releasing intravesicular cytochromec (8Basañez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A.

To examine the effect of membrane curvature on this system, cytochrome c-encapsulated LUV of different lipid compositions were incubated with ΔN76Bcl-xL, treated samples were filtered through a 100-kDa microconcentrator, and the cytochrome c contents of the retentate and the filtrate were analyzed by immunoblotting. As with ANTS release, the release of vesicle-entrapped cytochrome c induced by ΔN76Bcl-xL was decreased by incorporation in the membrane of negative curvature-inducing lipids DOG and DOPE, whereas positive curvature-inducing lipids O-LPC and O-LPE had the opposite effect (Fig.2). Next, we wished to examine whether O-LPC and O-LPE canceled the effect of DOG and DOPE on LUV permeabilization by proapoptotic proteins since the curvature of O-LPC and O-LPE is opposite to that of DOG and DOPE (24Fuller N.L. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Inclusion of increasing amounts of lysolipid in the membrane led to a progressive reversal of the inhibitory action of DOG and DOPE on the release of LUV-encapsulated ANTS and cytochrome c (Fig.3). O-LPC was a more potent antagonist of DOG- and DOPE-induced inhibition than O-LPE (Fig. 3 A), as expected from the fact that the intrinsic curvature of O-LPC is more positive than that of O-LPE (24Fuller N.L. Rand P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results argue against a specific pharmacological mode of action of DOG and DOPE,i.e. the possibility that some specific molecular recognition between nonlamellar lipids and proapoptotic proteins is responsible for the changes on vesicular ANTS release. Rather, they are consistent with the idea that nonlamellar lipids affect release of LUV contents through modulation of the intrinsic membrane monolayer curvature of the liposome. Bax-type proteins porate and destabilize planar phospholipid bilayer membranes (6Basañez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E. Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc.

Substitution of egg PC by egg PE inhibited the destabilization of planar membranes induced by Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL, whereas egg LPC increased planar membrane susceptibility to destabilization by proapoptotic proteins (Fig. 4). Interestingly, while the membrane-destabilizing effects of Bax and egg LPC were additive, those of ΔN76Bcl-xL and egg LPC were synergistic. A closer inspection revealed that the synergism of egg LPC and ΔN76Bcl-xL on planar membrane destabilization was voltage-dependent (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, Bcl-xL exerted no significant effect on membrane stability in the absence or in the presence of egg LPC (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the bending propensity of the membrane monolayer directed not only the release of vesicle contents elicited by Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL but also the reduction of planar membrane stability elicited by Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL. Membrane curvature has been shown to influence membrane binding and insertion of a number of proteins and peptides (28Lewis J.R. Cafisso D.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5932-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Attard G.S. Templer R.H. Smith W.H. Hunt A.N. Jacowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we decided to check whether the changes in lipid composition discussed above affected the membrane-binding and/or the membrane-insertion ability of apoptotic proteins. To quantify the total amount of protein bound to LUV we took advantage of the fact that free, but not vesicle-bound protein, sediments when centrifuged in D20-buffer (Ref. 23Ostolaza H. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and data not shown). Of the total protein population, the membrane-inserted protein fraction was determined by measuring the susceptibility of LUV-associated protein to alkaline pH extraction. We caution, however, that this method does not allow discrimination between proteins inserted at different depths of the membrane hydrophobic interior. As shown in Fig.5, even if differences were found depending on vesicle lipid composition in both the amount of protein bound to and inserted into the membrane, these effects alone could not explain the effect of nonlamellar lipids on Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL-induced vesicular ANTS release. For example, O-LPC and O-LPE favored Bax- and ΔN76Bcl-xL-induced vesicular ANTS release, yet lysolipids did not generally potentiate membrane association or insertion of Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL. On the other hand, although the proportion of membrane-bound and membrane-inserted Bax diminished by incorporation of DOPE or DOG, both nonlamellar lipids reduced Bax-induced ANTS release to a much larger extent. Most significantly, DOPE and DOG did not decrease but actuallyincreased membrane binding and insertion of ΔN76Bcl-xL. In short, these observations suggest that the effects of curvature on pore formation are unrelated to changes in the incorporation of the active proteins into the membrane. This study demonstrates that the capability of Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL to permeabilize purely lipidic phospholipid bilayer membranes depends upon intrinsic monolayer curvature. In all experiments, increasing intrinsic monolayer curvature toward positive values facilitated membrane permeabilization, whereas increasing intrinsic monolayer curvature toward negative values diminished membrane permeabilization. Such effects did not correlate well with changes in the membrane incorporation of Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL, suggesting that the tendency of the membrane monolayer for curvature is an important contributor of pore formation itself. Regulation of membrane permeabilization by intrinsic monolayer curvature is not unprecedented. A well known example is the alamethicin channel (33Keller S.L. Bezrukov S.M. Gruner S.M. Tate M.W. Vodyanov I. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 23-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Bezrukov S.M. Rand R.P. Vodyanov I. Parsegian V.A. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1998; 111: 173-183Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, alamethicin channels are much more uniform in size and dynamic behavior than Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xLpores, and alamethicin does not affect the stability of planar phospholipid bilayer membranes as do proapoptotic proteins. In addition, alamethicin channel formation is favored by nonlamellar lipids with negative intrinsic curvature (33Keller S.L. Bezrukov S.M. Gruner S.M. Tate M.W. Vodyanov I. Parsegian V.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 23-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Bezrukov S.M. Rand R.P. Vodyanov I. Parsegian V.A. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1998; 111: 173-183Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), contrary to what is observed in the case of Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL. Also, nonlamellar lipids are known to influence the avidity of alamethicin for lipid membranes, and this has been related to the effects of curvature on alamethicin channel formation (28Lewis J.R. Cafisso D.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5932-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the situation found with Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL, for which the effects of curvature-inducing lipids on pore formation could not be explained by changes in protein membrane binding affinity. Alternatively, the tendency of the membrane monolayer to curl may be an important determinant for the adoption of an active, pore-forming conformation by Bax-type proteins within the lipid milieu. For example, the quaternary status of membrane-incorporated Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL may depend upon intrinsic membrane monolayer curvature, with positive and negative curvature stabilizing and destabilizing, respectively, the assembly of active oligomers of Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL. Another possibility is that curvature influences the depth and/or mode of insertion of Bax-type proteins into the membrane interior which, in turn, may control their capacity to form proteinaceous channels. Similar explanations have been proposed to account for the effects induced by nonlamellar lipids on the activity of a variety of peptides and proteins (28Lewis J.R. Cafisso D.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5932-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Attard G.S. Templer R.H. Smith W.H. Hunt A.N. Jacowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Once again, however, in all those systems nonlamellar lipids with negative intrinsic curvature facilitated maximum protein activity, whereas the opposite trend was obtained here with Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xL. On the other hand, a number of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides exemplified by magainin (15Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Ishibe N. Ueha M. Nakata S. Miyajima K. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11856-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), as well as the syringomycin E channel (17Malev V.V. Schagina L.V. Gurnev P.A. Takemoto J.Y. Nestorovich E.M.

Both the magainin pore and the syringomycin E pore have been modeled as supramolecular assemblies of lipids and peptides with the shape of a torus having net positive curvature (15Matsuzaki K.

Interestingly, planar membrane destabilization is also thought to occur through expansion of positively curved toroidal-type lipidic pores (9Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Melikyan G.B. Abidor I.G. Markin V.S. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 643-655Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations speak in favor of the idea that Bax-type proteins function by increasing the tendency of the membrane to form lipid-containing toroidal pores. However, further work is required to unambiguously determine the mechanism by which intrinsic membrane monolayer curvature affects the pore-forming activity of Bax-type proteins, as well as the exact structure and composition of the Bax and ΔN76Bcl-xLpores in phospholipid bilayer membranes.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) depend upon membrane monolayer curvature. If the apoptotic pore that forms in the outer mitochondrial membrane is the same as the pore formed by Bax and its homologues in phospholipid bilayer membranes, then the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane elicited by Bax-type proteins during apoptosis will also be governed by membrane monolayer curvature. Alternatively, if Bax-type proteins induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization through modulation of endogenous mitochondrial channels, an effect of curvature on mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is not expected. Experimental maneuvers similar to the ones shown here but adapted for biological systems may thus be used to gain more insight into the molecular mechanism underpinning mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by Bax-type apoptotic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2017958592,"The mammalian GSPT, which consists of amino-terminal (N) and carboxyl-terminal (C) domains, functions as the eukaryotic releasing factor 3 (eRF3) by interacting with eRF1 in translation termination. This function requires only the C-domain that is homologous to the elongation factor (EF) 1α, while the N-domain interacts with polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP), which binds the poly(A) tail of mRNA and associates with the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G. Here we describe a novel role of GSPT in translation. We first determined an amino acid sequence required for the PABP interaction in the N-domain. Inhibition of this interaction significantly attenuated translation of capped/poly(A)-tailed mRNA not only in an <i>in vitro</i> translation system but also in living cells. There was a PABP-dependent linkage between the termination factor complex eRF1-GSPT and the initiation factor eIF4G associating with 5′ cap through eIF4E. Although the inhibition of the GSPT-PABP interaction did not affect the <i>de novo</i>formation of an 80 S ribosomal initiation complex, it appears to suppress the subsequent recycle of ribosome. These results indicate that GSPT/eRF3 plays an important role in translation cycle through the interaction with PABP, in addition to mediating the termination with eRF1."

We show here that high levels of expression of Bcl-xL promoted apoptosis of cells treated with an antisense oligonucleotide (5′Bcl-x AS) that shifts the splicing pattern of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from the anti-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xL, to the pro-apoptotic variant, Bcl-xS. This surprising finding illustrates the advantage of antisense-induced modulation of alternative splicing versus down-regulation of targeted genes. It also suggests a specificity of the oligonucleotide effects since non-cancerous cells with low levels of Bcl-xL should resist the treatment. 5′Bcl-x AS sensitized cells to several antineoplastic agents and radiation and was effective in promoting apoptosis of MCF-7/ADR cells, a breast cancer cell line resistant to doxorubicin via overexpression of the mdr1 gene. Efficacy of 5′Bcl-x AS combined with chemotherapeutic agents in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line may be translated to clinical prostate cancer since recurrent prostate cancer tissue samples expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL than benign prostate tissue.

Cancers not completely eradicated by surgery or radiation (localized therapy) may escape control by chemotherapy (systemic therapy) because some cancer cells, especially those resistant to apoptosis, survive treatment (1Han J.S.

For example, prostate cancer that recurs after potentially curative therapy, or that presents in an advanced stage, is palliated with androgen-deprivation therapy. Within several years most recur as androgen-independent, metastatic disease that leads to death. Recently, chemotherapy regimens have been developed that allow palliation in most patients.

Bcl-2 is regarded as one of the most important proteins protecting cancer cells from apoptosis and, to date, may be the most highly studied member of the Bcl-2 family. However, in an examination of 60 different cell lines from the National Cancer Institute, Bcl-xL was shown to provide equivalent or greater protection against cytotoxic agents than Bcl-2. Higher levels of Bcl-xL correlated with decreased cellular sensitivity toward a variety of chemotherapeutic reagents; there was no such correlation for Bcl-2 (6Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D.

Bcl-xS inhibits the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, possibly by forming heteroduplexes with these proteins (21Minn A.J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. J. Biol.

Decreasing Bcl-xL and increasing Bcl-xS levels may initiate pro-apoptotic events through various cellular mechanisms that, alone or in synergy with the action of antineoplastic agents, lead to cell death. We have shown previously that a 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleoside phosphorothioate (5′Bcl-x AS) 1The abbreviations used are: 5′Bcl-x AS, antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the downstream alternative 5′-splice site of Bcl-x pre-mRNA; 5-FdU, 5-flurodeoxyuridine; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; ASO, antisense oligonucleotide; FCS, fetal calf serum; ER, estrogen receptor; RPA, RNase protection assay; RT, reverse transcription; Gy, Gray; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MEM, modified essential medium targeted to the downstream alternative 5′-splice site in exon 2 of Bcl-x pre-mRNA shifted splicing from the Bcl-xL to Bcl-xS splice variants; this treatment decreased the levels of Bcl-xL and increased the levels of Bcl-xS proteins (23Mercatante D.R.

The shift in splicing induced cell death in oligonucleotide-treated PC3 prostate cancer cells and to a lesser extent in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In A549 lung epithelial cells, a similar treatment alone was ineffective; cell death resulted only from co-administration of radiation or cisplatin (24Taylor J.K. Zhang Q.Q. Wyatt J.R. Dean N.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate the differences in cellular responses as a result of oligonucleotide-induced modification of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing. We found that the endogenous level of Bcl-x is the main factor that determines the extent of cell death induced by 5′Bcl-x AS. Treatment of PC3 and MCF-7 cells (two cell lines that express different levels of Bcl-xL) with 5′Bcl-x AS sensitized both cell lines to various chemotherapeutic agents and radiation and increased cell death at lower doses of these agents. Finally, prostate cancer expressed higher levels of Bcl-xL protein than benign prostate. These results suggest that 5′Bcl-x AS treatment may augment the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

All cell lines were originally from the ATCC and grown in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All cells were cultured in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin or, for HeLa cells gentamycin/kanamycin, in the following media. PC3: DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS); MCF-7: MEM (modified essential medium), 10% FCS, 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen); MDA-MB 231 and Hs578T: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, insulin (10 μg/ml); BT 549: RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 10% FCS, insulin (1 μg/ml); HeLa: MEM, 5% FCS, 5% horse serum,l-glutamine (2 mm; Invitrogen); and DU145: MEM, 10% FCS, 1× sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids. Twenty-four hours prior to oligonucleotide treatment, all cells were plated in 1 ml of media in 24-well plates at a density of 7 × 104 per well. Research specimens were recovered from prostate tissue stored in liquid nitrogen. Androgen-independent prostate cancer had been obtained by transurethral resection from 10 men who presented with urinary retention from recurrent prostate cancer 7–92 months after androgen deprivation therapy. Histologic examination revealed poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Gleason scores 8–10) that represented an average of 92% (ranged from 72–99%) of the cross-sectional area of the tissue sections. Ten specimens of benign prostate tissue had been obtained from portions of adenoma removed at open prostatectomy; absence of cancer was confirmed by frozen section. 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleoside phosphorothioate 18-mer, antisense to the 5′-splice site of Bcl-xL (ACCCAGCCGCCGUUCUCC; 5′Bcl-x AS) was synthesized by Trilink Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA). 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleoside phosphorothioate 18-mers with randomized sequence and/or antisense to human β-globin IVS2–705 sequence (31Sierakowska H. Sambade M.J. Schumperli D. Kole R. RNA. 1999; 5: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were used as negative controls; they were synthesized by Hybridon, Inc (Cambridge, MA). Cells were treated with oligonucleotides complexed with DMRIE-C (8 μg/ml, Invitrogen) cationic lipid delivery agent (23Mercatante D.R. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Kole R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16411-16417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cisplatin, 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), 5-FdU (5-fluorodeoxyuridine), etoposide, and doxorubicin were obtained from Sigma. Their concentrations used in treatment of oligonucleotide-treated PC3 and MCF-7 cells were in the ranges of 0.001–10 μg/ml for cisplatin and 0.001–10 μm for the remaining four drugs. 48 h after oligonucleotide transfection, the cells were treated with the above compounds for the times indicated in the text and figure legends. The variations in treatment were designed to maximize the response in subsequent assays (see below). In radiation experiments, cells were replated in 10-cm plates 24 h after oligonucleotide treatment. After overnight culture, cells were irradiated using a 60Co γ-irradiator at doses indicated in Fig. 7. The numbers of re-plated and radiated cells were: control PC3 cells, 500 at 0–2 Gy, 1000 at 4 Gy; 5′Bcl-x AS-transfected PC3 cells: 500 at 0 Gy, 1000 at 1 and 2 Gy, 2000 at 4 Gy; control MCF-7 cells, 1000 at 0–2 Gy, 2000 at 4 Gy; 5′Bcl-x AS-transfected MCF-7 cells: 1000 at 0 Gy, 2000 at 1 and 2 Gy, 4000 at 4 Gy. After irradiation, cells were cultured, and colonies stained and counted on day 10 of culture (see below), and the percent viability (or replating efficiencies) was calculated. These procedures were carried out as previously described (23Mercatante D.R. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Kole R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16411-16417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after oligonucleotide transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of TRI-reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH), and total RNA was isolated. RT-PCR was performed with rTth DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Branchburg, NJ) in the presence of 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and forward (CATGGCAGCAGTAAAGCAAG) and reverse primers (GCATTGTTCCCATAGAGTTCC) at 70 °C, 15 min for the RT step followed by PCR: 95 °C, 3 min, 1 cycle; 22 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. 48 h after oligonucleotide treatment, 500 cells for PC3, DU145, MDA-MB 231, BT 549, MCF-7/ADR, and HeLa and 1000 cells for MCF-7 and Hs578T were re-plated in 10-cm plates. After 10 days under normal culture conditions surviving colonies were stained with 5% methylene blue (Sigma) in 50% ethanol for 10 min. Colonies larger than 50 cells were counted. For chemotherapeutic dose-response experiments, re-plated, oligonucleotide-treated cells were treated for 24 h with the chemotherapeutic agents. After treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, the cells were washed with HBSS (Hank's Buffered Saline Solution, Invitrogen), and fresh medium was added. The remainder of the procedure was the same. Total protein was prepared by lysing cells (one well of a 24-well plate) or lysing prostate tumor tissues (200 mg tissue sections finely ground to a powder) in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (15 μl for every 1 ml of RIPA buffer, Sigma). 20 μg of total protein were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with Bcl-xL (1:1000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Bio-Rad). Bcl-xL migrated at ∼30 kDa. Equal loading and transfer were confirmed by staining the membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma) and blotting with β-tubulin antibody (1:4000 dilution; Sigma) followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Sigma); β-tubulin protein migrated at ∼55 kDa. Protein was visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) treatment. Untreated cells were analyzed for levels of Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and GAPDH genes with a multiprobe template set (hAPO-2; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and RPA II RNase protection assay kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Reactions were carried out according to the manufacturers' protocols. Prism (Graph Pad) software was used to generate dose response curves, calculate LC50 values, and for other statistical analyses indicated in the figure and table legends. To shift the alternative splicing pathway of Bcl-x pre-mRNA from Bcl-xL to Bcl-xS, seven different cell lines were treated with 5′Bcl-x AS antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the downstream alternative 5′-splice site of exon 2 (Fig.1) and delivered to the cells with the aid of DMRIE-C cationic lipid reagent. The treated cell lines originated from prostate (PC3, DU145), breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T), and cervical (HeLa) cancers and represented distinct genetic backgrounds (see “Experimental Procedures”). RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from untreated cells showed that in all cell lines Bcl-xL mRNA was essentially the only expressed splice variant; Bcl-xS was barely or not at all detectable (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Since the uptake of the lipid-oligonucleotide complex or the oligonucleotide antisense activity may vary in different cells, for each cell line, the oligonucleotide concentration was adjusted such that the splicing was shifted ∼50–60%. Note that RT-PCR was carried out with32P-labeled dATP, which is incorporated into Bcl-xL and -xS spliced products with a 1.2:1 ratio. Thus, the autoradiograms shown in Fig. 2 A slightly underrepresent the amount of newly generated Bcl-xS mRNA. The extent of the oligonucleotide-induced shift in splicing was confirmed by RPA (data not shown). The effects of the treatment with 5′Bcl-x AS on the survival of the cells from all seven cell lines was determined by a colony formation assay. This method was chosen because it quantifies the cumulative cell death over a prolonged 10-day period of time. Short term apoptosis assays were not appropriate since the time course of apoptosis induction varies from cell line to cell line making it difficult to compare the overall extent of apoptosis among different cell lines. The results shown in Fig. 2 B demonstrated that the oligonucleotide treatment led to death of the cells from all cell lines; PC3 cells were the most, and HeLa cells were the least susceptible. Since the extent of Bcl-xL/xS splicing modification was normalized to approximately the same 50–60% level (Fig.2 A) it appeared that other factors must have contributed to the variability of the cellular response to 5′Bcl-x AS treatment. No clear correlation was found between susceptibility to 5′Bcl-x AS treatment and the level of expression of functional p53 or ER genes; this indicated that Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS effects are p53 (32Strasberg Rieber M. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Rieber M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1446-1451PubMed Google Scholar, 33Vrana J.A. Decker R.H. Johnson C.R. Wang Z. Jarvis W.D. Richon V.M. Ehinger M. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7016-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and ER-independent (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, there was no correlation between 5′Bcl-x AS susceptibility, and the levels of expression of several Bcl-2 family members (Bak, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bax) determined by RPA of total RNA from the seven cell lines (Fig.3). To further address this issue, an examination of the levels of Bcl-xL mRNA was carried out by RPA. The results showed that the levels of Bcl-xL were highest in PC3 cells, followed by MDA 231, DU145, Hs578T, MCF-7, BT549 and lowest in HeLa cells (Fig.4, A and B). Analysis of Bcl-xL protein by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL antibody established the same rank order of Bcl-xL expression levels (Fig. 4,C and D). There was a high degree of correlation (p value of < 0.0001 and r 2 = 0.9601, by Pearson correlation) between the levels of Bcl-xL protein in untreated cell lines and death of 5′Bcl-x AS-treated cells, indicating that cells containing higher levels of Bcl-xL were more susceptible to 5′Bcl-x AS oligonucleotide treatment. This counterintuitive result, that increased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL at the same time facilitates cell death of 5′Bcl-x AS-treated cells, is best explained by the data illustrated in Fig. 5, A and B. The seven different cell lines were treated with 5′Bcl-x AS at concentrations indicated in Fig. 2 A that resulted in 50–60% shift in Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing. Despite the fact that the relative amounts of Bcl-xL/xS mRNAs were the same in all cell lines (i.e. the ratio of Bcl-xL to -xS was ∼50–60%), RPAs of total RNA with a Bcl-xS-specific probe showed that the absolute levels of Bcl-xS mRNA varied substantially (Fig. 5). PC3 cells had the highest and HeLa cells the lowest content of this RNA, consistent with the expression levels of Bcl-xL and not the extent of the shift in splicing. These data suggest that highly expressing cells such as PC3 cells have high levels of Bcl-x pre-mRNA, which when spliced produced large amounts of Bcl-xL mRNA. When targeted with 5′Bcl-x AS oligonucleotide splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA resulted in large amounts of Bcl-xS mRNA (Fig. 5) and presumably Bcl-xS protein. Previously observed differences in the level of Bcl-xS protein in oligonucleotide-treated PC3 and MCF-7 cells support this conclusion (23Mercatante D.R. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Kole R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16411-16417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The 5′Bcl-x AS-induced shift in splicing may be less effective against cancers with low Bcl-x expression levels (see also “Discussion” for additional considerations). Thus, we sought to determine if the applicability of this approach could be extended to more resistant cells if the 5′Bcl-x AS treatment is combined with conventional antineoplastic agents. The experiments were carried out on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, a cell line relatively resistant to oligonucleotide treatment, and the oligonucleotide-susceptible PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Five apoptosis-inducing agents, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-FU, 5-FdU, and etoposide, which exert their cytotoxic effects through different mechanisms (see “Discussion”) were selected for these experiments. All of these chemotherapeutic agents are a part of the standard set of anticancer agents included in the National Cancer Institute's drug screen (6Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar). Dose response curves were generated for MCF-7 cells treated with 0.1 and 0.4 μm 5′Bcl-x AS followed by chemotherapeutic agents. 0.4 μm random oligonucleotide-transfected or mock-transfected cells served as negative controls. 0.1 and 0.4 μm 5′Bcl-x AS alone resulted in ∼35 and 50% shift in splicing and 59 and 38% viability, respectively (data not shown). The latter values were normalized to 100% in order to determine the LC50 of the different drugs (see “Experimental Methods”). Examples of the experimental data for cisplatin and doxorubicin are illustrated in Fig. 6,A and B.

Brain cholesterol metabolism is of interest because several lines of evidence suggest that elevated cholesterol increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We found a largely neuronal expression of ABCA1 in normal rat brain by in situ hybridization. ABCA1 message was dramatically up-regulated in neurons and glia in areas of damage by hippocampal AMPA lesion after 3–7 days. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated ABCA1 protein in cultured neuronal and glial cells, and expression was induced by ligands of the nuclear hormone receptors of the retinoid X receptor and liver X receptor family. ABCA1 was induced by treatment with retinoic acid and several oxysterols, including 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol. Expression of an ABCA1-green fluorescent protein construct in neuroblastoma cells demonstrated fluorescence in perinuclear compartments and on the plasma membrane. Because the Aβ peptide is important in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, we examined whether ABCA1 induction altered Aβ levels. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with retinoic acid and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol caused significant increases in secreted Aβ40 (29%) and Aβ42 (65%). Treatment with a nonsteroidal liver X receptor ligand, TO-901317, similarly increased levels of secreted Aβ40 (25%) and Aβ42 (126%). The increase in secreted Aβ levels was reduced by RNAi blocking of ABCA1 expression.

ABCA1 encodes an ATP-binding cassette protein that promotes efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids from intracellular compartments to high density lipoprotein, lipid-deficient apoAI, 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; LXR, liver X receptor(s); RXR, retinoid X receptor(s); AD, Alzheimer's disease; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; APP, amyloid precursor protein. and other apolipoproteins (1Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). Disruption of ABCA1 by Tangier disease mutations in humans or by engineered knock-out in mice is associated with a loss of cellular cholesterol efflux, an ablation of circulating high density lipoprotein, and, interestingly, peripheral neuropathies (2Walter M.

Like many genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, ABCA1 is regulated by the liver X receptors (LXR) (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A.

Both of these classes of receptors form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR), which bind retinoic acid; as heterodimers, they alter gene transcription.

Aβ formation in cell culture systems is inhibited by cholesterol depletion, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, and acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibition (14Simons M.

Amyloid deposition in transgenic mouse models of AD can be accelerated by oral cholesterol loading (17Refolo L.M. Pappolla M.A. Malester B. LaFrancois J. Thomas-Bryant T. Wang R. Tint G.S. Sambamurti K. Duff K.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 321-331Google Scholar) and reduced by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis (18Refolo L.M. Pappolla M.A. LaFrancois J. Malester B. Schmidt S.D. Thomas-Bryant T. Tint G.S. Wang R. Mercken M. Petanceska S.S. Duff K.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 890-899Google Scholar). Finally, hypercholesterolemia has been associated with AD risk (19Notkola I.L.

Hallikainen M. Alhainen K. Soininen H. Tuomilehto J. Nissinen A. Br. Med. J. 2001; 322: 1447-1451Google Scholar), and three recent epidemiological studies suggest that cholesterol-lowering drugs can reduce the risk of developing AD (21Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Google Scholar, 22Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G. Siegel G. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 1439-1443Google Scholar, 23Rockwood K. Kirkland S. Hogan D.B. MacKnight C. Merry H. Verreault R. Wolfson C. McDowell I. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 223-227Google Scholar). There is great need for better understanding of cholesterol transport and processing in the central nervous system. In this work, we found that ABCA1 was expressed in neurons and glia in vivo andin vitro. We found that ABCA1 was induced by ligands of LXR, and this induction lead to increased levels of secreted Aβ. These data suggest that increased cholesterol can alter Aβ levels through its effects on ABCA1. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (R-4643) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in ethanol at 10 mm. Oxysterols, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (H-9384), 25-hydroxycholesterol (H-1015), and 7-ketocholesterol (C-2394) were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in ethanol at 10 mm. 24-hydroxycholesterol was purchased from Medical Isotopes Inc (Pelham, NH) as a mixture of R and S stereoisomers. The LXR agonist, TO-901317, was purchased from Cayman Chemical and dissolved in ethanol. Anti-ABCA1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against human ABCA1 residues 2071–2261 fused to a histidine tag (24Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Google Scholar). This antibody also recognized rodent ABCA1 (see “Results”). A second anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody against a different ABCA1 epitope was obtained from Novus Biologicals. Unilateral hippocampal AMPA lesions were performed in four mice according to published procedures (25Page K. Hollister R. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14020-14024Google Scholar), and the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 3, 7, and 11 days post-surgery. The brains were removed under ether anesthesia and sectioned coronally or sagitally at 16 μm on a cryostat onto sterile Probe-On Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). Two nonlesioned rat brains were also examined. In situ hybridization was performed for ABCA1 expression utilizing a probe against GenBankTMsequence X75926, bases 209–253, according to previously published protocols (26Irizarry M.C. McNamara M. Fedorchak K. Hsaio K. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 965-973Google Scholar). The sections were fixed for 5 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in 95% ethanol at 5 °C. The sections were hybridized overnight with the [35S]adenosine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) end-labeled 45-mer oligonucleotide probes (10,000 cpm/μl) at 42 °C in sealed chambers humidified with 50% formamide, 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate water and then washed in 1× standard sodium citrate at 55 °C. The slides were exposed toAmersham Biosciences β-max autoradiography film for 13 days. The sections were dipped and exposed to Amersham Biosciences LM-1 emulsion for 3 months for cellular resolution. Mouse Neuro2A (neuroblastoma) cells and human IMR-32 (neuroblastoma) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Optimem (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse BV-2 (microglial) and rat C6 (glioma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Mouse primary neuronal cultures were generated as described (27Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 16 Swiss-Webster mice. Individual cortices was dissociated in calcium-free saline and plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated tissue culture dishes at the density of 1.5 × 106 cell/ml. The neurons were grown in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. One hour after plating, medium with serum was replaced with medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). Full-length ABCA1 cDNA with a green fluorescent protein tag fused to the second amino acid of ABCA1 was expressed from the pcDNA1 expression vector (24Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Google Scholar). Neuro2A cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Green fluorescence was observed 1–2 days later using the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 522 nm). Double-stranded RNA (RNAi) was generated homologous to a region of the 5′ end of the coding portion of the mouse ABCA1 gene, 5′-AAG TGG CCT GGC CTC TCT TTA-3′ (Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO). As a negative control, we used a sequence directed against the human Hsp70 gene. Neuro2A cells were transfected with the RNAi with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After an overnight exposure, the RNAi complex was removed, the cells were washed one time in growth medium, and the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium with 2% B-27 with or without LXR/RXR agonists for 1 day. Conditioned medium was collected and analyzed for Aβ. The cells were lysed in 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Sigma). The protein levels were quantified by the BCA assay (Pierce), and samples of 50 μg were held in SDS loading buffer with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature but were not boiled prior to loading. The proteins were separated by SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with the anti-ABCA1 antibodies (1:1000) and developed with anti-rabbit-linked horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody by chemiluminescence. The cells were cultured in neurobasal medium with 2% B-27 for 1 day in the presence or absence of LXR/RXR agonists. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the conditioned medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with BNT77 as a capture antibody and BA27-horseradish peroxidase for Aβ40 or BC05-horseradish peroxidase for Aβ42 as detection antibodies (28Fukumoto H. Tomita T. Matsunaga H. Ishibashi Y. Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. NeuroReport. 1999; 10: 2965-2969Google Scholar). We first wanted to determine whether ABCA1 was expressed in brain. In situ hybridization of rat brain demonstrated widespread expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 1). The highest expression was in the neuronal layers of the cerebellum, followed by the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, with low expression in the white matter tracts (Fig. 1, A and C). As a positive control, the ABCA1 antisense probe bound strongly to sections of mouse liver (Fig. 1B); as a negative control, the ABCA1 sense probe did not bind to brain sections (Fig. 1D). To investigate the regulation of ABCA1 after acute brain damage, we evaluated ABCA1 expression after excitotoxic lesion of the mouse hippocampus (Fig. 2). Stereotactic AMPA lesioning of the hippocampus resulted in an up-regulation of ABCA1 mRNA beginning gradually at 3 days and continuing to increase through 7 and 11 days post-lesion. No up-regulation was seen at 1 h (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the increased signal was not an artifact of the lesion procedure. Emulsion-dipped sections demonstrated increased expression in both neuronal and glial elements. To demonstrate ABCA1 protein expression in neurons, we examined proteins isolated from primary cultures of mouse neurons. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal ABCA1 antibody showed a protein of 220 kDa, the size expected from the published sequence (Fig. 3A). This protein co-migrated with ABCA1 from mouse Neuro2A cells transiently transfected with an ABCA1 expression vector (24Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that ABCA1 was up-regulated by hydroxysterols and retinoic acid (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Google Scholar), which interact with the nuclear receptors LXR and RXR, respectively. To determine whether these agents induce ABCA1 expression in neurons, we treated primary neurons with concentrations of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and retinoic acid from 100 nm to 10 μm. One-day treatments with 100 nm of both of these compounds led to an up-regulation of ABCA1 protein compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3A). Increasing concentrations of each compound further increased ABCA1 expression (Fig. 3A). We also examined whether ABCA1 was expressed in an immortalized cell line derived from mouse neuroblastoma, Neuro2A cells. ABCA1 protein was found at low or undetectable levels in Neuro2A extracts (Fig. 3B). However, when Neuro2A cells were treated with retinoic acid and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, expression of ABCA1 was clearly apparent (Fig. 3B). In some experiments, weak up-regulation of ABCA1 was observed in cells treated only with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol but not in cells treated only with retinoic acid. Similar experiments with human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells also showed detectable ABCA1 levels only after induction with retinoic acid and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. We examined whether other oxysterols were capable of increasing ABCA1 expression. Neuro-2A cells were treated with retinoic acid and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, or 24-hydroxycholesterol for 1 day (Fig. 3C). ABCA1 immunoblots demonstrated that treatments with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 24-hydroxycholesterol dramatically increased ABCA1 protein, whereas 7-ketocholesterol was not as efficacious. Our in situ hybridization data suggested that ABCA1 was also expressed in glial cells after brain lesion. We therefore examined a microglial cell line, BV-2, and a glioma cell line, C-6, for expression of ABCA1 protein. Both glial cell lines expressed detectable levels of ABCA1, and expression was increased after treatment with retinoic acid and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 4). Expression was also increased after treatment with the nonsteroidal LXR agonist TO-901317 and further increased when treated with TO-901317 in the presence of retinoic acid. The response of ABCA1 in glial cells to LXR ligands was similar to that seen in Neuro2A cells (Fig. 4). To visualize the subcellular localization of ABCA1 in Neuro2A cells, we transiently transfected these cells with an expression vector of full-length ABCA1 with green fluorescent protein fused to its amino terminus (24Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Google Scholar). Previous studies with this construct have shown that it is fully competent for cholesterol efflux and that it faithfully co-localizes with untagged ABCA1 at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles (24Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15137-15145Google Scholar). Similarly, in Neuro2A cells, confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated prominent expression of ABCA1 in the perinuclear compartments and on the cell surface (Fig. 5). ABCA1-green fluorescent protein was particularly noticeable on processes projecting from the rounded cell bodies (Fig. 5). Thus, ABCA1 is expressed in the plasma membrane of neuronal cells in a manner similar to its expression in non-neuronal cells (29Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Google Scholar), as expected of a protein whose function is lipid efflux. Aβ is a 40–42-amino acid, hydrophobic molecule generated by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (30Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Google Scholar). We tested whether levels of secreted Aβ were affected by activation of LXR/RXR heterodimers. Neuro2A cells treated with 10 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and retinoic acid secreted increased levels of both Aβ40 (29%) and Aβ42 (65%) (Fig. 6). Similar increases were observed in experiments with 1 or 3 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. We were concerned that we had altered the cholesterol content of cells in culture with the oxysterol treatments. Therefore, we treated cells with an LXR agonist that was not an oxysterol, TO-901317. Similar increases in secreted Aβ40 (25%) and Aβ42 (126%) were found from cells treated with TO-901317 and retinoic acid (Fig. 6). In all of the experiments, the increase in Aβ42 was greater than the increase in Aβ40. No marked differences were observed by Western blot analyses in the levels of cellular APP or secreted APP after treatment with LXR and RXR agonists; furthermore, no toxicity was observed by monitoring of released LDH activity. To determine whether induction of ABCA1 was partially responsible for the increased levels of secreted Aβ, we treated cells with RNAi to inhibit ABCA1 induction. Western blot analysis showed that RNAi inhibited ABCA1 induction by 30–41%. Consistent with the results above, the cells treated only with buffer showed significantly increased secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 after 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol/retinoic acid treatment. The cells treated with ABCA1 RNAi showed levels of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 that were not significantly increased after 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol/retinoic acid treatment (Fig. 7). As a control, we also treated cells with an RNAi against the human Hsp70 gene; these cells showed increased levels of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 similar to those seen in cells without RNAi. These data suggest that induction of ABCA1 increases levels of secreted Aβ. Translating knowledge gained about lipid metabolism in the periphery to the central nervous system is vital for understanding processes important to neuronal function, degeneration and repair. The cholesterol efflux molecule ABCA1 is expressed widely in the periphery (10Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Google Scholar, 31Wellington C.L. Walker E.K. Suarez A. Kwok A. Bissada N. Singaraja R. Yang Y.Z. Zhang L.H. James E. Wilson J.E. Francone O. McManus B.M. Hayden M.R. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 273-283Google Scholar), but ABCA1 message and protein have also been detected in the brain (10Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E.

Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 378-385Google Scholar). Our in situ (Figs. 1 and 2) and cell culture data (Figs. 3 and 4) show that ABCA1 expression is high in both neurons and glia. We hypothesized that cholesterol efflux might be very important after neuronal damages, when excess membranes need to be cleared from the brain. Indeed, excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus resulted in up-regulation of ABCA1 mRNA, beginning at 3 days and increasing through 11 days (Fig. 2). The time course of increase is similar to apoE and apoJ mRNA, as well as with the development of gliosis (34Page K. Hollister R.D. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 1161-1171Google Scholar), suggesting coordinate regulation of these cholesterol transport proteins during repair. Both neurons and glia expressed ABCA1 in response to injury, in contrast to the glial-expressed apoE, suggesting a more ubiquitous role in repair mechanisms. Oxysterols and agonists of LXR induce ABCA1 expression in many tissue types (6Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Google Scholar). We found in neuronal cells and glia that ABCA1 was increased by retinoic acid and LXR agonists (Figs. 3 and 4). Induction of the central nervous system ABCA1 message by LXR agonists was also recently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (35Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1378-1385Google Scholar). 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol is the most prominent oxysterol in the brain, produced by the brain-specific enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46) (36Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Google Scholar). 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol induces ABCA1 expression through interactions with either LXRα or LXRβ isoforms (37Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.-L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Google Scholar, 38Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Google Scholar); LXRβ is the isoform more strongly expressed in the brain (35Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1378-1385Google Scholar). A knock-out of LXRα and LXRβ genes in mice demonstrated accumulation of lipid-laden cells in the brain, particularly associated with the ventricles and blood vessels (39Wang L. Schuster G.U. Hultenby K. Zhang Q. Andersson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13878-13883Google Scholar), further emphasizing the importance of LXR in central nervous system lipid efflux. Oxysterols, like cholesterol, are components of cell membranes and soluble lipoproteins (40Bjorkhem I. Diczfalusy U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 734-742Google Scholar). There are several classes of lipoproteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, defined by their content of apoE and apoAI, and all are high density (41Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Google Scholar, 42Borghini I. Barja F. Pometta D. James R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 192-200Google Scholar, 43Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M. Stuerenburg H.-J. Buhmann C. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1143-1151Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, apoE is made by glia (44Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Google Scholar) and secreted as part of lipoproteins that are smaller and denser than cerebrospinal fluid lipoproteins (45LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Google Scholar). It was suggested that these glial lipoproteins accumulated lipids via cellular cholesterol efflux to become the larger lipoproteins found in the cerebrospinal fluid (45LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Google Scholar). Lipid-poor apolipoproteins, including apoAI and apoE, can interact with ABCA1 to promote cholesterol efflux to generate high density lipoproteins (46Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Google Scholar, 47Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Google Scholar). Indeed, cholesterol efflux has been demonstrated from fibroblasts to isolated cerebrospinal fluid lipoproteins (48Rebeck G.W. Alonzo N.C. Berezovska O. Harr S.D. Knowles R.B. Growdon J.H. Hyman B.T. Mendez A.J. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 175-182Google Scholar) and from neurons and astrocytes to purified apoE (49Michikawa M. Fan Q.-W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Google Scholar). Thus, ABCA1 transfer of lipids to many of the classes of apoE- and apoAI-containing lipoproteins can occur in the central nervous system, allowing elimination and redistribution of membrane components during degeneration. Epidemiological studies link high levels of plasma cholesterol with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (19Notkola I.L. Sulkava R. Pekkanen J. Erkinjuntti T. Ehnholm C. Kivinen P. Tuomilehto J.

Petanceska S.S. Duff K.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 890-899Google Scholar). We hypothesized that some of the effects of high cholesterol on Aβ may be due to production of oxysterols from cholesterol, causing changes in gene transcription via interactions with LXR. We focused on changes in ABCA1 because of its significant role in cholesterol efflux and its strong expression in the brain. In neuroblastoma cells, oxysterol induction of ABCA1 was accompanied by increased secreted Aβ species (Fig. 6); a similar effect was seen in C6 glial cells (data not shown). Importantly, the Aβ produced in these experiments was from endogenous sources of APP and not from cells overexpressing APP. The amino-terminal 12–14 amino acids of Aβ are hydrophobic, comprising part of the transmembrane domain of APP. Indeed, Aβ cleaved from APP is found in plasma membranes (50Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Walter M.F. Mason P.A. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Wood W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18801-18807Google Scholar). We reasoned that soluble Aβ levels are not only dependent on Aβ production and Aβ degradation but also on the transfer of Aβ between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Our data that the induction of ABCA1 increased the levels of secreted Aβ (Figs. 6 and 7) suggests that ABCA1 is a mechanism of Aβ secretion from the cell. We hypothesize that in vivo, Aβ is secreted from the cells associated with cholesterol and phospholipids. Our finding that a more hydrophobic isoform of Aβ, Aβ42, was increased to a greater extent than Aβ40 is consistent with this hypothesis. Endogenous plasma Aβ has been found associated with high density lipoproteins (51Koudinov A. Matsubara E. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1164-1171Google Scholar), further supporting this hypothesis. Increased extracellular Aβ has been observed after brain trauma (52Roberts G.W. Gentleman S.M. Lynch A. Murray L. Landon M. Graham D.I. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1994; 57: 419-425Google Scholar, 53Uryu K. Laurer H. McIntosh T. Pratico P. Martinez D. Leight S. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 446-454Google Scholar). Based on our findings here, we hypothesize that this increase may be due to increased ABCA1 after brain damage (Fig. 2) and increased ABCA1-related efflux of Aβ. The connection between acute brain injuries and chronic brain injuries such as Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although epidemiological studies have suggested a link (54Guo Z. Cupples L.A. Kurz A. Auerbach S.H. Volicer L. Chui H. Green R.C. Sadovnick A.D. Duara R. DeCarli C. Johnson K. Go R.C. Growdon J.H. Haines J.L. Kukull W.A. Farrer L.A. Neurology. 2000; 54: 1316-1323Google Scholar). In both brain trauma and AD, genetic associations have been observed between APOE and high Aβ load (13Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Google Scholar, 55Nicoll J.A.R. Roberts G.W. Graham D.I. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 135-137Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be biological links between trauma and AD related to cholesterol metabolism. The anatomical pattern of ABCA1 in mice expression closely matches the regional expression of the genes required for Aβ generation: APP, presenilin-1, and BACE (25Page K. Hollister R. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14020-14024Google Scholar, 56Irizarry M.C. Locascio J.J. Hyman B.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 173-177Google Scholar). Although each of these genes is expressed at high levels in cortical and limbic areas that develop senile plaques in human AD, high expression is also seen in the cerebellum, which does not develop significant amyloid deposition, indicating that other region-specific factors are necessary for plaque formation. Because LXR agonists induce secreted Aβ species, particularly Aβ42, in vitro, we hypothesize that an increase in LXR agonists in specific brain regions may increase Aβ deposition. Levels of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients (57Schoenknecht P. Lutjohann D. Pantel J. Bardenheuer H. Hartmann T. von Bergmann K. Beyreuther K. Schroeder J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 324: 83-85Google Scholar, 58Papassotiropoulos A. Lutjohann D. Bagli M. Locatelli S. Jessen F. Buschfort R. Ptok U. Bjorkhem I. von Bergmann K. Heun R. J. Psych. Res. 2002; 36: 27-32Google Scholar) but not in healthy aged individuals (59Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Google Scholar), suggesting that this compound may increase risk of AD. Furthermore, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol is reduced in individuals taking simvastatin (60Locatelli S. Lutjohann D. Schmidt H.H.J. Otto C. Beisiegel U. von Bergmann K. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 213-216Google Scholar), who are at decreased risk of AD (21Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Google Scholar, 22Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G. Siegel G. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 1439-1443Google Scholar, 23Rockwood K. Kirkland S. Hogan D.B. MacKnight C. Merry H. Verreault R. Wolfson C. McDowell I. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 223-227Google Scholar). Thus, approaches that reduce brain oxysterol production or act as LXR antagonists may reduce the risk of AD. In this study, we characterized the expression and regulation of the cholesterol efflux molecule ABCA1 in neurons and glia. We found that induction of ABCA1 increases secretion of Aβ from cells in culture, suggesting that molecules that regulate ABCA1 could regulate levels of Aβ in the brain. Thus, ABCA1 could constitute a new target in developing therapeutics for prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We thank Armando Mendez and Anne Cataldo for helpful discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2057811708,"The human leishmaniasis are persistent infections of macrophages caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania.The chronic nature of these infections is in part related to induction of macrophage deactivation, linked to activation of the Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in infected cells. To investigate the mechanism of SHP-1 activation, lysates ofLeishmania donovani promastigotes were subjected to SHP-1 affinity chromatography and proteins bound to the matrix were sequenced by mass spectrometry. This resulted in the identification ofLeishmania elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) as a SHP-1-binding protein. Purified Leishmania EF-1α, but not host cell EF-1α, bound directly to SHP-1 in vitro leading to its activation.

Second, confocal, fluorescence microscopy using Leishmania-specific antisera detectedLeishmania EF-1α in the cytosol of infected cells. Third, co-immunoprecipitation showed that Leishmania EF-1α was associated with SHP-1 in vivo in infected cells. Finally, introduction of purified Leishmania EF-1α, but not the corresponding host protein into macrophages activated SHP-1 and blocked the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression in response to interferon-γ.

According to the latest WHO report, 12 million people are affected by leishmaniasis worldwide and 2 million new cases occur each year (Leishmaniases Control, www.who.int/health-topics/leishmaniasis.htm, updated 2000). Moreover, the incidence of the leishmaniasis has been on the rise because of multiple factors including the AIDS epidemic, increased international travel, lack of effective vaccines, difficulty in controlling vectors, international conflicts, and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Progress in controlling the leishmaniasis will require improved understanding of pathogenesis to identify novel drug targets or vaccine candidates. Leishmania donovani is the major causative agent of human visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania live as either extracellular, flagellated promastigotes in the digestive tracts of their sand fly vectors or as nonflagellated amastigotes within macrophages, where they survive and replicate within phagolysosomes. Macrophages as part of both the innate and acquired immune systems are programmed to ingest and destroy intracellular pathogens. Hence, the mechanisms used by Leishmania and other intracellular pathogens to evade elimination by macrophages are important issues in cell biology and immunology. Infected macrophages are often refractory to cell activation (1Reiner N.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 374-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2Nandan D. Knutson K.L. Lo R.

In particular, several lines of evidence have converged to establish a role for the host macrophage Src homology 2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: SHP-1, Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase; EF-1α, elongation factor-1α; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the pathogenesis of infection with Leishmania (4Nandan D.

Notably, infected macrophages show increased SHP-1 activity and inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity reverses the abnormal phenotype of infected cells (4Nandan D. Lo R. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4055-4063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, resistance to Leishmania infection is enhanced in SHP-1-deficient macrophages and mice (8Forget G. Siminovitch K.A. Brochu S.R.S. Radzioch D. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The argument that activation of host SHP-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of infection with Leishmania is also supported by the recent finding that the first-line anti-leishmanial agent used clinically, sodium stibogluconate, is an inhibitor of SHP-1 (10Pathak M.K. Yi T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3391-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the mechanisms that regulate SHP-1 activation, few discrete SHP-1 activating ligands have been identified (11Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Blery M. Olcese L. Vivier E. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we show that elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) ofL. donovani is a novel SHP-1-binding protein and SHP-1 activator, properties not shared by the corresponding host protein. The results also show that introduction of Leishmania EF-1α, but not host EF-1α into cells, recapitulates the deactivated phenotype of Leishmania-infected macrophages. These findings identify Leishmania EF-1α as a novel, candidate virulence factor. RPMI 1640, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin), 1,4-diazabiocyclo[2.2.2]octane, DEAE-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, cellulose phosphate (fibrous form), anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein, and calmodulin-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Medium 199 was from Invitrogen. The RAW 264.7 cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Anti-EF-1α was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-iNOS and anti-cathepsin D were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, protein G-agarose, and electrophoresis reagents and supplies were from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of the GST-SHP-1 construct, its expression and purification has previously been described (13Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6985-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Protein delivery system Profect 1 was obtained from Targeting System, Santee, CA. Amastigotes of the Sudan strain 2S of L. donovani were maintained by serial intracardiac inoculation of amastigotes into female Syrian hamsters. Amastigotes were isolated from the spleens of hamsters infected 4 to 6 weeks earlier as described previously (14Gutierrez Y. Maksem J.A. Reiner N.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 114: 222-230PubMed Google Scholar). Promastigotes were prepared from freshly isolated amastigotes from spleens of infected hamsters by culturing in medium 199 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), adenosine (1 mm), folic acid (10 μg/ml), and hemin (6 μg/ml) at room temperature. Promastigotes were maintained in the laboratory by transferring every third day in medium 199 supplemented as described above. For most experiments, parasites in stationary phase (day 5 containing ∼50 × 106 per ml) were used. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). Exponentially growing RAW cells were infected with either stationary phase promastigotes or freshly isolated amastigotes at a parasite to cell ratio of ∼10:1. After incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, noninternalized parasites were removed by washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution. To determine the rate of infection, cytospin preparations were prepared from dislodged cells, which were stained with Diff-Quik. Leishmaniapromastigotes (2–3 × 109) were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mm NaCl) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min and supernatants were incubated with GST-SHP-1 affinity beads with end-over-end rotation for 2 h. After incubation, affinity beads were transferred to a column and washed extensively. Bound proteins were released with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. An aliquot of partially purified SHP-1 bound proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) followed by silver staining. L. donovani promastigotes in stationary phase were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and immediately processed for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation of EF-1α, parasites were lysed on ice in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 2 μg of pepstatin A/ml). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were incubated with anti-EF-1α antibodies for 16 to 18 h at 4 °C. After incubation with antibodies, protein G-agarose was added for 2 h at 4 °C for recovery of immune complexes. After extensive washing, immune complexes were released by boiling agarose beads in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with anti-EF-1α antibodies. After washing, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and developed using the ECL detection system. All operations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Approximately 1 × 108 exponentially growing RAW cells and 3 × 109 stationary phaseL. donovani promastigotes were washed extensively with Hanks' salt solution and suspended separately in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above for immunoprecipitation. Cells were sonicated to prepare a cell lysate and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column connected to the CM-Sepharose column previously equilibrated in buffer C containing 50 mmKCl. The columns were washed with equilibration buffer until all nonbound proteins had eluted. After disconnection of the CM-Sepharose column, bound proteins on this column were eluted with increasing KCl concentration in buffer C. The fractions containing EF-1α as analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-EF-1α, were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer C without KCl. The dialyzed material was then applied to a phosphocellulose column and bound proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations of KCl. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of EF-1α on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-EF-1α antibodies. The fractions containing near homogeneous EF-1α (as judged by silver staining) were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer C and used for further studies. For binding assays, purified EF-1α from L. donovani and RAW cells were incubated with 25 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-agarose beads containing equal amounts of GST-SHP-1. Binding was accomplished by mixing in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 1% glycerol) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with binding buffer. Bound EF-1α was eluted by boiling beads for 5 min in Laemmli SDS-gel electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-EF-1α. For this binding assay, purified EF-1α from L. donovani and RAW cells was incubated with 25 μl (packed volume) of calmodulin-agarose beads. Binding and analysis of bound EF-1α were performed essentially as described for GST-SHP-1 with minor modifications. Binding buffer contained 2 mm CaCl2 instead of EDTA. Immunoprecipitated SHP-1 on protein G-Sepharose beads or as GST-SHP-1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads was washed twice with ice-cold phosphatase assay buffer (62 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 6.25 EDTA, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 2 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of 0.2m NaOH and absorbance was measured at 410 nm. Macrophages were either left untreated or infected with Leishmania promastigotes at an approximate parasite to cell ratio of 10:1. After overnight (16 h) incubation, control and infected cells were washed and cytosolic fractions were prepared. Cells were treated with cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and passed through a 22-gauge needle to disrupt cells. Cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation and supernatant was supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.15 m. The cytosolic fractions were prepared further by centrifuging supernatants at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. These clarified, high speed supernatants were used as cytosolic fractions. L. donovani promastigotes were metabolically labeled with 5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free RPMI 1640 containing 1% nondialyzed fetal calf serum at room temperature. After 16 h of labeling, parasites were washed twice with RPMI to remove unincorporated [35S]methionine and immediately used for infection of macrophages at an approximate parasite to cell ratio of 10:1. After a 16-h incubation, cells were washed extensively with Hanks' balanced salt solution and processed to prepare cytosolic fractions as described before. The cytosolic fraction from infected macrophages was used to immunoprecipitate labeled LeishmaniaEF-1α essentially as described before. Polyclonal antisera against LeishmaniaEF-1α was raised in BALB/c mice. LeishmaniaEF-1α-specific peptide (KTVTYAQSRYD) was coupled to KLH to immunize mice and sera were collected after three booster immunizations. Macrophages grown on coverslips were incubated withL. donovani promastigotes at an approximate parasite to cell ratio of 10:1. After overnight incubation (16 h), control and infected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed at room temperature for 10 min with 2.5% paraformaldehyde. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with either commercial anti-EF-1α (1:10) or with Leishmania-specific anti-EF-1α (1:100) for 1 h, washed extensively, and stained for 45 min with anti-mouse IgG fluorescein (1:100). After further washing, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mounting media containing antifade (2.5% 1,4-diazabiocyclo[2.2.2]octane, 90% glycerol, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0). For staining of EF-1α promastigotes, organisms were transferred to glass slides using cytospin and processed essentially the same way as described above for macrophages. Preparations were examined using a Bio-Rad Radiance Plus confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with Zeiss Axiovert S100VT, using a ×63 oil immersion objective. Images of 256 × 256 pixels (50 × 50 μm) were acquired using LaserSharp software (Bio-Rad). Sections of 0.2 μm thickness in the z axis (40–50 slices per image) were assembled into stacks and projected using the Scion Image 4.0.2 software. Projections were then processed and merged using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Initial studies showed that crude lysates from bothLeishmania promastigotes and amastigotes contained a factor that activated SHP-1 in vitro (data not shown). To investigate this further, affinity chromatography ofLeishmania lysates was carried out using GST-SHP-1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose as matrix. Two prominent proteins with approximate subunit sizes of 56 and 44 kDa specifically bound to GST-SHP-1 (Fig. 1 A). A parallel affinity column consisting of GST-glutathione-Sepharose showed no detectable binding proteins (data not shown). The two bands shown in Fig. 1 A were excised from the gel, and tryptic peptide digests were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Whereas the identity of the 44-kDa band is as yet undetermined, eight of the peptides (TATGHLIYK, TIEKFEK, YAWVLDKL, VGYNVEK, SENMPWYK, LPLQDVYK, IGGIGTVPVGR, and KFAEIESKI) sequenced from the 56-kDa silver-stained band were found to match EF-1α from Leishmania braziliensis (NCBInr accession number 5834626) and covered 16.2% of the sequence. To confirm the identify of the 56-kDa protein, GST-SHP-1-binding proteins were prepared from a Triton X-100 lysate of stationary phaseL. donovoni promastigotes. The originalLeishmania lysate and the proteins eluted from the column were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-EF-1α antibody. Single bands of identical size in both theLeishmania lysate and in the GST-SHP-1 affinity column eluate (lane 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 B) were detected, thus confirming the internal protein sequence data indicating that the 56-kDa SHP-1-binding protein band contained EF-1α. Notably,Leishmania EF-1α was observed to be larger than its human homologue (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 3 in Fig. 1 B). These results identifiedLeishmania EF-1α as a SHP-1-binding protein. To investigate further the interaction ofLeishmania EF-1α with SHP-1, EF-1α was purified to near homogeneity from murine macrophages and from Leishmaniapromastigotes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions containing homogeneous EF-1α as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown) and silver staining (Fig.2, A and B) were pooled and dialyzed. The purity of these preparations was examined further by tryptic digestion and analysis by mass spectrometry and showed no detectable contamination by other proteins (data not shown). Purified EF-1α from both sources was incubated with GST-SHP-1 and binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results in Fig.3 A show that EF-1α fromLeishmania bound directly and selectively to SHP-1 as comparatively little binding of host EF-1α was detected. To determine that the relatively poor binding of host EF-1α to SHP-1 was not related to loss of functional integrity, both preparations of purified EF-1α were used in binding assays with calmodulin-agarose beads in the presence of Ca2+. It has previously been shown that EF-1α from both T. brucei and mammalian origin directly interacts with calmodulin and this interaction seems to require EF-1α in its native conformation (15Kaur K.J. Ruben L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23045-23050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the results in Fig.3 B show that EF-1α from Leishmania and macrophages bound to calmodulin. These findings indicated that purified host EF-1α was conformationally intact and confirmed that the interaction of Leishmania EF-1α and SHP-1 was specific.Figure 3GST-SHP-1 binds selectively toLeishmania EF-1α. EF-1α was purified to homogeneity from Leishmania promastigotes (Ld) and from macrophages as described in the legend to Fig.2 and “Experimental Procedures.” For binding to SHP-1 (A), purified EF-1α from either Leishmania or macrophages was incubated with 25 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-agarose beads containing equal amounts of GST-SHP-1. Binding was accomplished by mixing in 100 μl of binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with binding buffer.

To examine this possibility, purified Leishmania or macrophage EF-1α were incubated with freshly prepared GST-SHP-1 to measure in vitro activation. After incubation, unbound proteins were removed and affinity beads were assayed for SHP-1 phosphatase activity using pNPP as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown in Fig.4 A indicated thatLeishmania EF-1α, but not its mammalian homologue, was capable of activating SHP-1. Quantitatively, the results observed were comparable with those obtained by other investigators using model phosphotyrosyl containing peptides (16Wang L.L. Blasioli J. Plas D.R. Thomas M.L. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1318-1323PubMed Google Scholar) to activate SHP-1 in vitro. We also examined whether Leishmania EF-1α was able to activate SHP-1 in vivo. Purified EF-1α fromLeishmania, macrophages, or an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin were mixed separately with Profect 1 reagent in serum-free medium for delivery to macrophages. After 2–3 h of incubation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated for SHP-1. Immune complexes were recovered using protein A-Sepharose and after extensive washing, immune complexes were assayed for phosphatase activity using pNPP as a substrate. (Control rabbit serum brought down no SHP-1 activity, data not shown.) As shown in Fig. 4 B, delivery ofLeishmania EF-1α to macrophages resulted in SHP-1 activation in vivo. In contrast, activation of SHP-1 was not observed when purified macrophage EF-1α or bovine serum albumin were used as control proteins (Fig. 4 B). SHP-1 is predominantly a cytosolic protein, whereasLeishmania reside within a membrane-bound vacuole. This raises an important question of whether a factor from vacuole-boundLeishmania could access cytosolic SHP-1. To examine the subcellular distribution of Leishmania EF-1α in infected macrophages, Leishmania promastigotes were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine, washed to remove unincorporated isotope, and immediately used to infect macrophages. After overnight infection, cells were disrupted and cytosolic fractions were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EF-1α was immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic, infected cells under native conditions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Anti-EF-1α precipitated a protein of the correct size for Leishmania EF-1α (Fig.5 A, lane 2) suggesting the presence of Leishmania EF-1α in cytosol of infected macrophages. No [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were precipitated using irrelevant antibody (Fig. 5 A,lane 1). To control for the possibility that disruption of phagolysosomes during cell fractionation resulted in the release of EF-1α, cytosolic fractions were examined for the presence of mature cathepsin D, a marker of phagolysosomes. The absence of detectable cathepsin D in the cytosol of infected cells (Fig. 5 B,lane 1) suggests that any disruption of phagolysosomes was negligible and thus did not account for the presence ofLeishmania EF-1α this fraction. The presence of Leishmania EF-1α in cytosol of infected macrophages was also investigated using polyclonal antibody raised against Leishmania EF-1α peptide. The specificity of this antibody for Leishmania EF-1α was established by immunoblotting using total cell lysates of Leishmania and macrophages. The presence of a single band in the region ofLeishmania EF-1α in lysates of Leishmania and no detectable band in lysates of macrophages (Fig. 5 C, compare lanes 1 and 2) clearly shows that this antiserum is highly specific for Leishmania EF-1α. The specificity of anti-Leishmania EF-1α was confirmed using purified EF-1α from Leishmania and macrophages (data not shown). When the cytosolic fraction from infected macrophages was subjected to immunoblotting with this anti-peptide antiserum, the results showed (Fig. 5 D) the presence ofLeishmania EF-1α in this fraction. Scanning, confocal, immunofluorescence microscopy using antipeptide antisera was used to independently confirm the presence of Leishmania EF-1α in the cytosol of infected macrophages. Infected and control macrophages grown on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluoresence using either anti-peptide antiserum specific for Leishmania EF-1α or commercial anti-EF-1α antiserum that recognizes bothLeishmania and mammalian EF-1α. UsingLeishmania-specific anti-peptide antiserum, the results shown in Fig. 6, panels 2 and3, demonstrate Leishmania EF-1α in the cytosol of infected macrophages. As expected, staining of control, noninfected macrophages using the Leishmania-specific antiserum showed no signal (Fig. 6, panel 5), however, control cells showed intense, diffuse fluorescence when commercial anti-EF-1α antibody was used for staining (Fig. 6, panel 7). Taken together with the immunoprecipitation and Western blotting findings, direct detection using confocal microscopy, provides compelling evidence indicating the presence of Leishmania EF-1α in the cytosolic fraction of infected macrophages. The findings that Leishmania EF-1α bound to SHP-1 in vitro and evidence that it accessed the cytosol of infected cells, suggested that it may target SHP-1 in vivo. To examine this possibility, macrophages were infected with promastigotes for 14–16 h. Cytosolic fractions were then prepared from control and infected cells for immunoprecipitation of SHP-1. Immune complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis carried out using anti-EF-1α. (Fig. 7, lane 4) showed thatLeishmania EF-1α was associated with SHP-1 in vivo, whereas the association of host-EF-1α with host SHP-1 was not detectable. In parallel with its ability to activate SHP-1, we examined whether the introduction of EF-1α into cells would impact macrophage activation. PurifiedLeishmania or macrophage EF-1α was introduced into macrophages using Profect 1 reagent. After incubation for 2 h, macrophages were stimulated with murine IFN-γ. Cells were then lysed, separated on"
https://openalex.org/W1967225412,"In mammals, the superfamily of loop, ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), is assembled from a pool of more than 40 homologous subunits. These subunits have been classified into four families representing channels that are gated by acetylcholine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, or glycine. By searching anonymous genomic sequence data for exons that encode characteristic motifs of the channel subunits, we have identified a novel LGIC that defines a fifth family member. Putative exons were used to isolate a full-length cDNA that encodes a protein of 411 amino acid residues. This protein (ZAC) contains all of the motifs that are characteristic of Cys loop channel subunits but cannot be assigned to any of the four established families on the basis of sequence similarity. Genes for ZAC are present in human and dog but appear to have been lost from mouse and rat genomes. Transcripts of ZAC subunits were detected in human placenta, trachea, spinal cord, stomach, and fetal brain. Transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with ZAC subunit cDNA caused expression of spontaneous current. By screening with a broad range of potential agonists and antagonists, we determined that tubocurarine inhibits the spontaneous current whereas Zn(2+) activates the expressed receptors. The absence of Zn(2+)-activated channels in rats and mice may explain why this fifth member of the LGIC superfamily has evaded detection until now."

Werner syndrome occurs by mutation of the WRN gene, encoding a DNA helicase. WRN contributes to the induction of the p53 tumor suppressor protein by various DNA damaging agents.

In this regard, WRN has been suggested to be a functional component of various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. However, the precise physiological role of WRN remains to be elucidated. DNA damage alters the subcellular localization of many proteins, as exemplified by ING1 (21Scott M. Boisvert F.M. Vieyra D. Johnston R.N. Bazett-Jones D.P. Riabowol K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2052-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), 53BP1 (22Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J.

The effects of DNA damage are often exerted through post-translational modification of target proteins, as shown for instance for p53 and Mdm2 (24Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7666-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 25Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 26Liang S.H.

Although most of the work addressing the role of post-translational modifications in the DNA damage response has focused on protein phosphorylation, there is now growing evidence that protein acetylation may also play an important role (25Appella E.

Furthermore, acetylation can modulate the function of many proteins, their interaction with other proteins, and their subcellular localization (25Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J.

To explore possible links between WRN and the DNA damage response, we investigated the effect of several types of DNA damage on the subcellular distribution of WRN. We report that in response to UV exposure, WRN translocates from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic foci. The rate and extent of WRN redistribution are correlated with the UV dose. Importantly, p300 promotes WRN acetylation in vivo, while cotransfection with p300 or treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a deacetylase inhibitor, mimics the effect of DNA damage and causes translocation of WRN to discrete nucleoplasmic foci. Similarly, TSA inhibits the reentry of WRN from such foci back into the nucleolus at late times after irradiation. The nucleoplasmic foci to which WRN is recruited upon irradiation or TSA treatment exhibit partial colocalization with PML nuclear bodies, which are known to contain protein acetyltransferases. Together, these findings support the notion that WRN may play a role in the DNA damage response pathway, perhaps in signaling or in facilitating specific types of DNA repair, in a manner that is regulated by protein acetylation. WI-38 normal human fibroblasts, as well as fibroblasts from individuals diagnosed as WS patients (AG00780), were obtained from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37.0 °C in 5% CO2. The GFP-WRN expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. S. M. Weissman (36Hisama F.M. Chen Y.H. Meyn M.S. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2372-2376PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method as previously described (18Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29463-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For UV irradiation, U2OS cells (300,000 per 60-mm dish) or human fibroblasts (60,000 per 35-mm dish) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated in a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene), predominantly at 254 nm. Phosphate-buffered saline was then replaced with fresh medium. For ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, cells were exposed to a GB-150 cobalt-60 (Nordion Canada) γ-irradiation source. Cells were irradiated in their original medium. Camptothecin (CPT) and 4NQO (both from Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and used at 1 μg/ml and 0.2 μg/ml, respectively. TSA (Upstate) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 100 ng/ml. The anti-WRN polyclonal antibody was used for immunofluorescence and confocal analysis as previously described (13Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Images were acquired as single scans on a Zeiss confocal microscope using LSM software. Antibody against PML was a kind gift from Dr. A. Dejean. To detect WRN acetylationin vivo, 293T cells (2 × 106 per 10-cm dish) were transfected by the JetPEI method. WRN plasmid (3 μg) was transfected either alone or in combination with a p300 expression plasmid (7 μg). 48 h after transfection, 2 mci/ml [3H]sodium acetate, TSA(10 μm), and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Sigma, 25 μm) were added to the culture for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with anti-WRN polyclonal serum, previously conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads, for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels containing [3H]acetate-labeled WRN were first stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and then enhanced by impregnating with a commercial fluorography enhancing solution (Amplify, AmershamBiosciences) for 30 min. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C for 3–7 days. To investigate the effects of DNA damage on the subcellular localization of WRN, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were transfected transiently with a plasmid encoding a fusion protein between WRN and green fluorescent protein (GFP). In agreement with what has been reported previously for endogenous WRN (13Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), GFP-WRN was localized almost exclusively to the nucleolus (Fig. 1 A), as confirmed by staining for the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin/B23 (Fig. 1 C). Exposure of the cells to high dose UV radiation (40J/m2) resulted in translocation of GFP-WRN from the nucleolus into a large number of small nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 1 D). A similar pattern of GFP-WRN translocation was also seen after treatment with either camptothecin (1 μg/ml) or 4NQO (0.2 μg/ml) (data not shown). Exposure to IR (10 Gray), had a milder effect with nucleoplasmic translocation seen in only some of the cells (Fig. 1 F). Unlike the simple kinetics of induction by UV (Fig. 1 F) or camptothecin (data not shown), IR elicited a biphasic response: a very rapid wave of GFP-WRN exit from the nucleolus followed by a slower, extended, and rather limited second wave (Fig. 1 F). Endogenous WRN protein manifested an essentially similar behavior. Thus, in untreated WI-38 diploid human fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A), the vast majority of endogenous WRN was in the nucleolus, in agreement with earlier observations (13Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A variable amount of nucleoplasmic staining could also be observed under those conditions, typically residing in diffuse small foci (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that a minor fraction of WRN is present outside the nucleolus even without induced stress. Upon UV irradiation, WRN was effectively excluded from the nucleolus and translocated entirely to nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained with camptothecin and 4NQO (data not shown). A more detailed time course analysis is shown in Fig. 3. In untreated cells, GFP-WRN was exclusively in the nucleolus (Fig. 3 A). Shortly after irradiation at 40J/m2, some of the GFP-WRN was still retained in the nucleolus, whereas the rest of the protein had already translocated into the nucleoplasm and was visible either in a relatively small number of large foci or as diffuse nucleoplasmic staining (Fig. 3, E and F). Later on, WRN became undetectable in the nucleoli, and much of the protein was found in a large number of small foci distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3 G; quantitative analysis shown in Fig. 3 H). At later times after irradiation, the GFP-WRN protein began to reaccumulate in the nucleoli, such that 24 h postirradiation the majority of the cells again exhibited only nucleolar GFP-WRN (see Fig. 5 A, panel e).Figure 5Trichostatin A regulates the subnuclear localization of GFP-WRN. A, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-WRN expression plasmid. 24 h post-transfection, TSA (c, d, g,h) or Me2SO as a solvent control (a,b, e, f) was added for an additional 30 h, at which time the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (b, d, f, h). GFP-WRN was monitored as in Fig. 1 (a, c, e,g). In e–h, cells were exposed to 20J/m2 UV 6 h after the addition of TSA or Me2SO, such that the experiment was terminated 24 h after irradiation.

Shown is a quantitative analysis of the percentage of cells in which the endogenous WRN protein was exclusively in the nucleoplasm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent and pattern of WRN relocalization depended on the dose of radiation. Thus, in cells exposed to 3J/m2 UV, much of the GFP-WRN was retained in the nucleolus, whereas the remainder was present in a relatively small number of rather large nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 3 B), similar to the picture seen very early after exposure to a high dose of UV irradiation. This limited translocation reached a maximum rapidly and did not progress significantly beyond 30 min postirradiation (Fig. 3, B–D; quantitative analysis in Fig. 3 H). The correlation between UV dose and amount of nucleoplasmic WRN foci supports a role for WRN in the DNA damage response that ensues upon exposure of the cells to genotoxic agents. The progressive translocation following high dose irradiation may reflect the inability of the cell to deal successfully with such extensive DNA damage as fast as it does with a limited amount of damage. The rapid DNA damage response elicited by IR is mediated, to a large extent, by the ATM kinase (37Shiloh, Y. (2002) Ernst Schering Res. Found. Workshop 36, 51–70Google Scholar). To determine whether this was also the case for WRN translocation, the effect of IR on WRN localization was compared between normal human fibroblasts and cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients lacking ATM function. Detailed kinetic analysis revealed that in ATM-deficient cells, the first rapid phase of WRN translocation was completely abrogated (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that ATM can contribute to the initial response to IR-induced DNA damage by catalyzing the rapid mobilization of WRN into the nucleoplasm. It is conceivable that the extended, slow second phase of WRN translocation, which remains unaffected in ATM-deficient cells, may be due to the action of the ATM-related ATR kinase, although this remains to be formally proven. The intracellular localization of proteins can be modulated by a variety of post-translational modifications. This also relates to protein acetylation, as exemplified by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (34Soutoglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in acetylation in response to DNA damage can also modulate the functional state of proteins, as exemplified by p53 (25Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 30Grossman S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether protein acetylation may play a role in the observed relocalization of WRN. To that end, U2OS cells were transfected with GFP-WRN and incubated for 30 h in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. As shown in Fig. 5 A, panel c, TSA induced a prominent translocation of GFP-WRN from the nucleolus into discrete, rather large nucleoplasmic foci, similar to those observed early after exposure to high dose UV. Moreover, TSA also blocked the return of GFP-WRN from the nucleoplasmic foci back into the nucleolus. Thus, although 24 h after exposure to high dose UV the majority of the cells again displayed only nucleolar WRN, treatment with TSA significantly slowed this return and maintained much of the WRN in nucleoplasmic foci for longer periods (Fig. 5 A, panels e and g, and Fig. 5 B). These findings indicate that protein acetylation, augmented by TSA, plays a positive role in enabling the translocation of WRN from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic foci. Similar results were obtained when FLAG-tagged WRN was used instead of GFP-WRN (data not shown). The effect of TSA could also be observed on the endogenous WRN protein. Incubation of WI-38 cells with TSA for 30 h led to a substantial increase in the number of cells in which WRN was excluded from the nucleoli with concurrent accumulation in nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 5 C). Collectively, the data imply that the subcellular localization of WRN is regulated at least in part by protein acetylation. Furthermore, acetylation appears to play a role both in the exit of WRN from the nucleolus and in its subsequent return to the nucleolus, probably after the DNA damage response has subsided. In the absence of acetylation, WRN presumably retains its baseline nucleolar residence. The simplest way to account for these observations is by assuming that the regulatory acetylation events occur on the WRN protein itself. It was therefore important to determine whether WRN is subject to acetylation in living cells. To that end, 293T cells were transiently transfected with WRN expression plasmids, either alone or in combination with plasmids encoding the protein acetyltransferase, p300. Acetylated proteins were radiolabeled in vivo by incubation of the cultures with [3H]sodium acetate under conditions that are expected to restrict protein labeling largely to direct acetylation only. As shown in Fig. 6 A, lane 2, the immunoprecipitated WRN protein was specifically labeled in the presence of [3H]acetate, implying that it is indeed acetylatedin vivo. Cotransfection of WRN with p300 significantly increases WRN protein levels, presumably because of increased transcription from the transfected plasmids (data not shown). On the basis of previous calibration experiments, larger amounts of extract were therefore taken from cells transfected with WRN only. This indeed resulted in comparable amounts of total WRN protein in the different samples, as detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6 B). As seen in Fig. 6 A, cotransfection with p300 substantially increased the extent of WRN acetylation (lane 3). These data imply that WRN is acetylated in vivo and suggest that p300 can contribute to this acetylation. If acetylation of WRN plays an important role in facilitating its exit from the nucleolus into nucleoplasmic foci, it might be predicted that p300, which augments this acetylation in vivo, will also increase WRN translocation. This prediction was tested in WRN-transfected U2OS cells. As expected, TSA treatment led to a marked enhancement of the translocation of GFP-WRN from the nucleolus into large nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 7,WRN+ TSA). Importantly, cotransfection with p300 also resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells where GFP-WRN was present in such foci (WRN+p300); moreover, the microscopic pattern of these foci was indistinguishable from that elicited by TSA treatment (data not shown). Significantly, there was no apparent additive effect of p300 cotransfection and TSA treatment, supporting the notion that both agents were acting to increase WRN translocation via the same molecular mechanism, most probably acetylation. PML nuclear bodies (38Ruggero D. Wang Z.G. Pandolfi P.P. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) constitute one well studied type of nucleoplasmic foci. It was of interest to find out whether any of the foci to which WRN relocated in irradiated cells represented PML bodies, particularly because the interaction of the PML protein with the cAMP response element-binding protein binding-protein (CBP)/p300 acetyltransferase (39Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) could potentially underlie the coupling between WRN translocation and protein acetylation. Along this line, PML was shown to increase the acetylation of p53 by acetyltransferases residing in PML-NBs (40Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Therefore, U2OS cells were transfected with GFP-WRN, exposed to 4J/m2 UV, and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy, employing antibodies directed against PML. As seen in Fig. 8, panelsD–F, there was indeed a partial colocalization of the large nucleoplasmic GFP-WRN foci with PML bodies. A similar pattern of partial colocalization was also revealed in cells analyzed 2 h after exposure to 40J/m2 UV (data not shown). In contrast, PML did not colocalize with the many minute nucleoplasmic speckles harboring GFP-WRN at later times after exposure to 40J/m2UV. A pattern of partial colocalization of GFP-WRN with PML bodies was also observed in cells treated with TSA in the absence of UV (Fig. 9, D–F). The nature of the remainder of the large nucleoplasmic foci, which contain GFP-WRN but do not stain positive for PML, still remains to be determined.Figure 9Partial colocalization of WRN and PML in TSA-treated cells. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-WRN expression plasmid. 24 h later the cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of TSA (D–F) or Me2SO (A–C) as a control. Cell staining and image processing were as in Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proper WRN activity is required for the efficient maintenance of genomic integrity, as reflected by the augmented genetic instability of cells derived from WS patients and by the increased rate of cancer in these patients (2Goto M. Miller R.W. Ishikawa Y. Sugano H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1996; 5: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that several types of DNA damage mobilize WRN and cause its translocation from the nucleolus into discrete nucleoplasmic foci in a manner apparently dependent on the extent of DNA damage. These observations support a role for WRN in the DNA damage response, at least in some types of DNA damage. It is noteworthy that translocation of WRN from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm is also induced by other types of stress, such as serum starvation (41Suzuki T. Shiratori M. Furuichi Y. Matsumoto T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that WRN plays a role in the initial recognition of DNA damage or in the opening of the DNA damage site. Such a possibility is consistent with the fact that the helicase activity of WRN does not require the presence of a DNA terminus and particularly with the observations that WRN interacts with bubble structures (42Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which are good substrates for its exonuclease activity (10Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, WRN may play a role in later stages of the DNA repair process. For instance, WRN may act as a proofreading factor of the repair polymerase that seals up the DNA after removal of the initial damage-induced lesion. In line with such an idea, WRN has recently been shown to interact with the p50 subunit of DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) and to stimulate the polymerization activity of Pol δ in the absence of PCNA (20Szekely A.M. Chen Y.H. Zhang C. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11365-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (43Kamath-Loeb A.S. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4603-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The ability of WRN to act as a proofreading factor for Pol δ may rely on its helicase and exonuclease activities (8Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 9Huang S., Li, B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A role for WRN in the repair of DNA damage has also been deduced from studies exploring its functional interaction with the Ku protein (44Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (45Orren D.K. Machwe A. Karmakar P. Piotrowski J. Cooper M.P. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is of note, however, that we have not been able to demonstrate a colocalization of WRN with nuclear sites containing pyrimidine dimers, identified through the use of specific antibodies (data not shown). Furthermore, pyrimidine dimers were removed with similar kinetics in fibroblasts derived from WS patients as in their normal counterparts (data not shown). This suggests that if WRN indeed plays a role in the DNA repair process, its activity is not obligatory and is not rate-limiting for the process, at least in the case of UV damage, but rather may be important for ensuring the quality of the repair. An alternative possibility is that WRN is involved in the signaling events that follow the occurrence of DNA damage. This is consistent with the finding that proper WRN function is required for efficient induction of p53 by UV and several other types of genotoxic agents (46Blander G. Zalle N. Leal J.F. Bar-Or R.L., Yu, C.E. Oren M. Faseb J. 2000; 14: 2138-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For instance, WRN may transmit signals to upstream checkpoint control proteins, such as the CHK2 or ATM kinases (47Frei C. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (Pt 15): 2641-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Frei C. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of WRN from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm may enable it to interact with such proteins and transmit the activating signal to them. In this scenario, it is proposed that nucleolar WRN may be in a “standby” state, at least as it pertains to the DNA damage response, and that its mobilization into nucleoplasmic foci reflects its recruitment into an active mode. While this paper was under preparation, Sakamoto et al. (49Sakamoto S. Nishikawa K. Heo S.J. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) also reported that WRN translocates to nucleoplasmic foci in response to several types of DNA damage. The findings implied that WRN plays a role in the recombination repair of double strand DNA breaks and in the processing of stalled replication forks. The rapid kinetics with which WRN translocates to nucleoplasmic foci after exposure to UV (our study) suggests that WRN also has a role in the response to other types of DNA damage, subject to nucleotide excision repair. A novel aspect of the present study is the finding that exposure to TSA or excess activity of p300, both of which are known to increase the level of protein acetylation, can strongly enhance the recruitment of WRN to nucleoplasmic foci. Acetylation might either decrease the interaction of WRN with protein(s) that retain it in the nucleolus in the absence of genotoxic stress or enhance its interaction with proteins that anchor it to the nucleoplasmic foci; these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. The regulatory acetylation events may occur on any of a number of proteins that control the intracellular localization of WRN. However, the findings that WRN is acetylated in living cells and the demonstration that p300, which increases WRN acetylation in vivo, also promotes its translocation from the nucleolus into nucleoplasmic foci, argue strongly in favor of the notion that at least some of the critical acetylation events occur on the WRN protein itself. It is of note that nucleoplasmic WRN colocalizes partially with PML bodies. Interestingly, WRN can be modified by covalent attachment of SUMO-1 (50Kawabe Y. Seki M. Seki T. Wang W.S. Imamura O. Furuichi Y. Saitoh H. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and colocalizes with SUMO-1 in the nucleus (51Suzuki H. Seki M. Kobayashi T. Kawabe Y. Kaneko H. Kondo N. Harata M. Mizuno S. Masuko T. Enomoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Modification of the PML protein by SUMO-1 is thought to target PML to nuclear bodies (38Ruggero D. Wang Z.G. Pandolfi P.P. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that sumoylation of WRN is also involved in its recruitment to nuclear foci, particularly those coinciding with PML bodies. It is noteworthy that BLM, another member of the RecQ family, has also been shown to associate with PML bodies (52Wang X.W. Tseng A. Ellis N.A. Spillare E.A. Linke S.P. Robles A.I. Seker H. Yang Q., Hu, P. Beresten S. Bemmels N.A. Garfield S. Harris C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32948-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); in that case, p53 appears directly responsible for recruiting BLM to these bodies. Once recruited to PML bodies, WRN may be modified by acetyltransferases present within these nuclear bodies (40Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), including p300. Because p53 is also recruited to such PML bodies, at least under some circumstances (40Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S.

Bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis were not affected in IL-11 transgenic mice. In experiments in vitro, IL-11 stimulated transcription of the target gene for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) via STAT3, leading to osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of BMP-2, but inhibited adipogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells.

IL-11 may be a new therapeutic target for senile osteoporosis. Aging is associated with a sustained loss of bone. Histomorphometric analyses revealed that a decline in trabecular wall thickness with a reduction in the number and functions of osteoblasts is associated with the age-related bone loss (1Parfitt A.M. Villanueva A.R. Foldes J. Rao D.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 466-473Google Scholar). Thus, a reduction in bone formation because of a decrease in the recruitment of osteoblasts is the principal feature of senile osteoporosis, whereas the age-related decrease in the activation of vitamin D may cause an increase in parathyroid hormone secretion and an elevation in bone resorption (2Orwoll E.S. Meier D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 1262-1269Google Scholar, 3Eastell R. Yergey A.L. Vieira N.E. Cedel S.L. Kumar R. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner.

However, it is not yet fully understood how the recruitment of osteoblasts and bone formation are impaired with aging. Accumulating evidence indicates that local factors regulate differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into osteoblasts (5Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Google Scholar). Among them cytokines activating gp130 1The abbreviations used are: gp130, glycoprotein 130; IL, interleukin; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; SAM, senescence-accelerated mice; αMEM, α-modified minimum essential medium; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMPRE, BMP-response element; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; rh, recombinant human; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. could be involved in the differentiation of osteoblasts (6Taguchi Y.

Interleukin (IL)-11 that activates gp130 is also known to inhibit adipocytic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (10Du X.X. Williams D.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 2023-2030Google Scholar). An increase in the number of adipocytes in bone marrow correlates inversely with a decrease in the number of cells in an osteoblast lineage in age-related osteopenia (11Burkhardt R. Kettner G.

The P6 strain of senescence-accelerated mice (SAM) established from AKR/J mice shows several characteristics of senile osteoporosis (13Matsushita M. Tsuboyama T. Kasai R. Okumura H. Yamamuro T.

We have reported that there is a reduction in the expression of IL-11 in bone marrow cells of SAM-P6 and that such a change may be involved in the impaired osteoblastic differentiation and enhanced adipogenesis in the bone marrow of these mice (15Kodama Y. Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Murayama H. Yamato H. Fujita T. Kurokawa T. Matsumoto T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1370-1377Google Scholar). IL-11 is synthesized by bone marrow stromal cells and is shown to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine against actions of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (16Schwertschlag U.S. Trepicchio W.L.

These observations suggest that decreased IL-11 expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of bone loss and further imply a physiological role of IL-11 in bone metabolism through regulation of bone marrow cell differentiation. We report here stimulatory effects of IL-11 on bone formation. Overexpression of human IL-11 gene in transgenic mice resulted in the stimulation of bone formation to increase cortical thickness and strength of long bones and in the prevention of cortical bone loss with advancing age. In contrast, bone resorption was not affected in the transgenic mice. IL-11 stimulated transcription of the target gene for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) via transcription factor STAT3, leading to enhanced osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of BMP-2, but inhibited adipogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells. These results indicate that IL-11 is a stimulatory factor for osteoblastogenesis and bone formation to retain cortical bone mass, possibly by enhancing BMP actions on bone cells. The present studies were approved by the institutional animal care and oversight committee according to the guideline principles in the “Care and Use of Animals.” The Mx-human IL-11 transgene was constructed. A 762-bp BamHI-BglII fragment containing the coding region of human IL-11 (597 bp) was isolated from the pcD-20-2 plasmid (19Kawashima I. Ohsumi J. Mita-Honjo K. Shimoda-Takano K. Ishikawa H. Sakakibara S. Miyadai K. Takiguchi Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 199-202Google Scholar). The fragment was inserted into theBamHI site of the plasmid MxhGH in PGEM-42Z that had theMx gene promoter. The Mx promoter can be transiently activated to high amounts of transcription in many tissues upon application of interferon α/β (20Kuhn R. Frieder S. Michel A. Klaus R. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of this construct provided introns, exons, and poly(A) addition site from the human growth hormone gene. The 4.7-kb transgene was released by digestion with EcoRI and microinjected into the pronuclei of one-cell embryos (C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1) using standard techniques. Founder males were mated to C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1 females to establish lines. Transgenic offspring were identified by the method described by Saha (21Saha B.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 194: 77-83Google Scholar). For the probe, a fragment containing the hGH cDNA was inserted into PGEM-42Z plasmid and was labeled by digoxigenin using a PCR with T7 and SP6 primers (22Fukuda T. Yoshida T. Okada S. Hatano M.

Although several lines of transgenic mice were obtained, we demonstrate results in a representative strain that constitutively expressed human IL-11 gene in bone including bone marrow cells and other tissues without induction by interferon α/β (see Fig. 1a). Transgenic mice were grown with no injection of interferon, because treatment with interferon for several months may affect bone metabolism (23Takayanagi H. Kim S. Matsuo K. Suzuki H. Suzuki T.

Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blotting, 15 μg of total RNAs were denatured and fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde.

Total RNAs immobilized on nylon membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe for human IL-11 gene (TCAGCACACCTGGGAGCTGTAG) or the radiolabeled mouse IL-11 cDNA probe (15Kodama Y.

Tsuda E. Ogata E. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 632-637Google Scholar), and human IL-11 expressions, 1 μg of total RNA from each culture was reverse-transcribed after treatment with DNase I and subjected to PCR. The primers used were 5′-GGGGACATGAACTGTGTTTGCC-3′ and 5′-TCGCAGCCTTGTCAGCACAC-3′ for human IL-11, 5′-GCTTGGTGCACACCTA GCAG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCACAGGTCCTAAATAG-3′ for mouse osteocalcin, 5′-TCTGTTCCTGTACTTTCGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCTCAGTCTATGTCCTG-3′ for mouse RANKL, 5′-GACGGACTGCGGTCTCCTAA AG-3′ and 5′-TCTGCAGATGTGAGAAACTCGTCA-3′ for mouse BMP-2, and 5′-CGCCGTCATTCCGGATTACAT-3′ and 5′-GGCCCAATCTCCACTCCCTT-3′ for mouse BMP-4. The condition of PCR was 94 °C for 2 min for 1 cycle, 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, and 72 °C for 7 min for 1 cycle. In these experiments, 30 cycles of amplification were done, which was in the log-linear range of amplification. The sizes of PCR products were estimated from the relative migration of the 50-bp DNA ladder (AmershamBiosciences). Identity of PCR products was confirmed by fluorescence-based dideoxy sequencing of each PCR product using ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was also examined by RT-PCR as an internal control. Human IL-11 in sera and culture supernatants was measured with an enzyme immunoassay method using Quantikine human IL-11 immunoassay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Radiographic studies were performed using a soft x-ray apparatus (type SRO-M50; Sofron, Tokyo, Japan). Computed tomography scans at the diaphysis of excised femurs were taken using a composite x-ray analyzing system (NS-ELEX, Tokyo, Japan). Bone mineral density of excised femurs stored at −70 °C was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry using a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600, Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). For in vivo fluorescent labeling, a single intraperitoneal injection of calcein (6 mg/kg body weight) was administered at day 0 and 7 to 10-week-old mice, and they were sacrificed at day 10. Tibiae were fixed in 99.5% ethanol and embedded in methylmethacrylate without decalcification. Longitudinal serial sections (7 μm thick) were prepared using a microtome (model 2050, Reichert Jung). The sections were stained with toluidine blue or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) for histological analyses. Images were visualized by fluorescent light microscopy. Histomorphometry of bone sections was performed for at least eight optical fields of the secondary spongiosa using a semiautomated system for bone analysis (Osteoplan II, Carl-Zeiss, Germany) at 200-fold magnification (26Malluche H.H. Sherman D. Meyer W. Massry S.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 439-448Google Scholar). All sections were examined under blind conditions. The nomenclature, symbols, and units used are those recommended by the Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (27Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Google Scholar). Mechanical strength of femurs was evaluated with 3-point bending test using a physical property analyzing system (SHIMAZU AG-2000E; Shimazu Co., Tokyo, Japan) as described (28Nakamura T. Kurokawa T. Orimo H. Bone (New York). 1989; 10: 117-123Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were obtained from femurs and tibiae of 6-week-old male ddy mice (Japan SCL, Shizuoka, Japan) or 10-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice by flushing with α-modified minimum essential medium (αMEM), and red blood cells in marrow cells were hemolyzed in 17 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.8% ammonium chloride. Hemolyzed bone marrow cell suspensions were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Resuspended bone marrow cells were cultured on plastic dishes in αMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/liter ascorbic acid at 37 °C. For in vitro mineralization, media also contained 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. Media and reagents were freshly replaced twice a week. Mouse bone marrow stromal cell line ST2 (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) and osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 provided by Dr. Kodama (Ohu Dental College, Japan) were cultured in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/liter ascorbic acid. The medium was changed twice a week. Cells were treated with indicated reagents after being confluent in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures of bone marrow cells for 10 days were subjected to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and the number of ALP-positive colonies was counted as described (29Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4013-4021Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained for ALP by enzyme histochemical procedure using naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) as substrate and Fast BB salt (Sigma) as coupler. For ALP activity assay, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.2. The cell suspension was homogenized on ice after two cycles of freeze-thawing. Aliquots of supernatants were assayed for protein concentration with a Bio-Rad kit according to Bradford's method and for ALP activity (30Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixture contained 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 msodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2 and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After adding 0.1 m NaOH, the amount of p-nitrophenol liberated was measured by a spectrophotometer. The whole bone marrow cell suspensions after hemolysis (1.5 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in 24-well plates. On the 2nd day, they were treated with 1 nm1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the presence of indicated concentrations of recombinant human (rh) IL-11 (Genzyme Co., Cambridge, MA). On the 8th day of culture, cells were fixed in 10% formalin neutral buffer solution for 10 min, and TRAP-positive cells were stained (31Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki A. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Google Scholar). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells with more than three nuclei were counted. Bone marrow cells (1 × 104 cells/well) and ST2 cells were seeded on 8-well slide chambers (Lab-Tek chamber, Nunc). Cells were treated with 1 μm troglitazone (Sankyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) to induce adipocytic differentiation for 7 days in the presence and absence of indicated concentrations of rhIL-11. Cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 1 min and were rinsed with PBS. After the samples were immersed in Oil-Red O solution for 30 min, they were briefly rinsed with 60% isopropyl alcohol (32Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Fujita T. Bone (New York). 2000; 27: 769-776Google Scholar). Two kinds of plasmids with luciferase gene provided by Dr. Miyazono (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) were transfected as reporter for BMP signaling. One reporter construct containing an 8.5-kb fragment of the promoter region of mouse Smad6 (−9.5 kb/−1 kb) was generated by inserting the DNAs into pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (33Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar). Another one, 3GC2-lux, has an artificial promoter that contains three tandem repeats of a 28-bp BMP-response element (BMPRE) in the upstream of the core promoter of type X collagen and luciferase gene (33Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar). A cDNA for full-length rat Smad1 was cloned into an expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) (34Suzawa M. Tamura Y. Fukumoto S. Miyazono K. Fujita T. Kato S. Takeuchi Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 240-248Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for wild-type STAT3 and dominant negative STAT3 (35Yanagisawa M. Nakashima K. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Arakawa H. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 139-143Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. Nakashima and Taga (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). The complete coding regions of human PPARγ2 and mouse RXRα were amplified by PCR (32Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Fujita T. Bone (New York). 2000; 27: 769-776Google Scholar). Following amplification, the correct fragments were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and PSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively, and verified by DNA sequencing. A PPARγ-response element derived from the acyl-CoA oxidase promoter (GTCGACAGGGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGAGT) (36Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3483-3494Google Scholar) was amplified and cloned into pGL2 vector (Promega) as a reporter construct. For transient transfection, indicated plasmids were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) into cells at 50% confluence in 12-well plates. After transient transfection of the reporter, cells were further incubated for 24 h in the presence of indicated reagents, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured using a luminometer. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the Renilla luciferase activity. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's method. Differences between two measurements were analyzed by Student's t test. p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. To explore in vivo roles of IL-11 in bone formation, we generated transgenic mice expressing human IL-11 gene to examine whether overexpression of IL-11 has a positive effect on bone. The transgenic mice we examined constitutively expressed human IL-11 gene in bone including bone marrow cells and other tissues (Fig. 1a). Northern blotting using a human IL-11 oligonucleotide probe clearly detected the expression of human IL-11 mRNA isolated from bone of transgenic mice (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the expression of endogenous mouse IL-11 mRNA was too low to be detected in either transgenic or wild-type bone by Northern blotting using a mouse IL-11 cDNA probe in the absence of any stimulants (data not shown). Human IL-11 was detectable in bone marrow cell cultures (4.7 ± 0.2 pm, mean ± S.E., n = 3) but not in circulating blood (less than 1.4 pm of detection limit) from transgenic mice. Bone marrow cell cultures from wild-type mice did not contain the cytokine cross-reacted with the human IL-11 immunoassay kit. We examined transgenic male mice throughout the present study together with their wild-type male littermates. IL-11 transgenic mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates at birth. Radiographic analysis of 10-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice showed no apparent deformity in their skeletal system (Fig. 2a). However, contact x-ray analysis of bone (Fig. 2b) showed that the diameter in the middle of diaphysis of femurs from IL-11 transgenic mice was larger than that in wild-type littermates (3.01 ± 0.05 versus2.70 ± 0.04 mm, p < 0.01) at 10 weeks of age. The length of femurs was not different between transgenic and wild-type mice (16.8 ± 0.1 mm versus 16.7 ± 0.1 mm) at this stage. Microfocus computed tomography scans indicate an increase in cortical bone thickness at the diaphysis of femurs from transgenic mice (Fig. 2c). Bone mineral density of femurs estimated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was significantly higher in IL-11 transgenic mice than that in wild-type at 10 weeks of age (Fig. 2d). Contact x-ray analysis showed proportional changes of femurs in either dimension until 52 weeks of age and loss of trabeculae in the metaphysis in both IL-11 transgenic and wild-type mice with advancing age as expected (Fig. 2b). In contrast to trabecular bone, cortical bone thickness of femurs increased in IL-11 transgenic mice but decreased in wild-type with aging (Fig. 2,b and c). In accordance with this observation, bone mineral density of femurs increased in IL-11 transgenic mice, whereas it decreased in wild-type with advancing age (Fig. 2d). Histological analysis of proximal tibiae demonstrates similar changes with aging (Fig. 2e). There was no osteosclerotic change in long bones of IL-11 transgenic mice until 52 weeks after birth. There were no differences in serum level of calcium, phosphorus, and ALP between transgenic mice and wild-type littermates (data not shown). To determine whether the overexpression of human IL-11 affected the strength (maximal load) or flexibility (stiffness) of the cortical bone, biomechanical properties of the femurs from IL-11 transgenic and wild-type mice were measured in a 3-point bending test. There were no significant differences in the biomechanical properties of femurs from 10-week-old mice. Femurs from 52-week-old wild-type mice lost their strength as a result of normal aging, whereas the strength of bones from IL-11 transgenic mice increased to the level significantly higher than that in wild-type littermates (TableI). These results suggest that IL-11 overexpression caused an increase in cortical bone mass with intact overall architecture and a comparable increase in mechanical strength.Table IBiomechanical parameters of femurs excised from IL-11 transgenic mice (TG) and their wild-type littermatesAgeStrengthStiffnessweeksnn/mmWild type1020.9 ± 1.1aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.3.52 ± 0.29aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.IL-11 TG1021.3 ± 1.4aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.3.73 ± 0.46aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.Wild type5216.4 ± 2.4aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.2.89 ± 0.61aSignificantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice.IL-11 TG5242.1 ± 4.07.34 ± 0.80a Significantly lower than 52-week-old IL-11 transgenic mice. Open table in a new tab To study the cellular mechanisms that account for the progressive increase of bone mass, we performed static and dynamic histomorphometric analyses on the proximal tibiae of 10-week-old transgenic and wild-type mice. Trabecular bone volume (Fig. 3a) and osteoblast-covered bone surfaces (Fig. 3b) were higher in transgenic mice than in wild-type littermates. Histomorphometric parameters measuring the amount of newly formed bone matrix, such as an osteoid-covered surface, was also increased in transgenic mice (data not shown). Dynamic histomorphometry after the double labeling with calcein revealed a significant increase in mineral apposition rates (Fig. 3c) in transgenic mice, resulting in increased bone formation rates. On the other hand, the number of osteoclasts as determined by TRAP staining (Fig. 3d) and eroded surface per bone surface (Fig. 3e) was comparable with wild-type littermates. The structure of the epiphyseal growth plates seemed to be normal in transgenic mice (Fig. 2e). These results indicate that the increase in bone mass observed in transgenic mice is due to increased bone formation with no change in bone resorption. To investigate the consequences of IL-11 overexpression on the cellular level, we prepared and examined primary bone marrow cells from long bone in vitro. The number of ALP-positive colonies was higher in bone marrow cells of IL-11 transgenic mice than that of wild-type littermates (Fig. 4a). Addition of 10–100 pm rhIL-11 increased the number of ALP-positive colonies in wild-type bone marrow cell cultures but had no effect in transgenic cells (Fig. 4a). Adherent bone marrow cells were propagated for examination of osteoblastic differentiation. ALP activities associated with cell layers were higher in adherent bone marrow cells of IL-11 transgenic mice than those of wild-type littermates (15.1 ± 2.5 versus 7.4 ± 0.2 nmol/min/μg of protein,p < 0.01). In transgenic cell cultures, areas of mineralized extracellular matrix monitored by von Kossa staining were apparent at day 18 of culture, whereas few mineralized nodules were visible in wild-type cell cultures (Fig. 4b). Accordingly, the expression of mRNA for osteocalcin was higher in transgenic cells than wild-type cells, whereas mRNAs for BMP-2 and BMP-4 were equally expressed in transgenic and wild-type cells (Fig. 4c). The numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclast-like cells generated in bone marrow cell cultures were comparable in wild-type and transgenic cells in the presence of 1 nm1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig. 4d). Treatment with rhIL-11 did not further increase the number of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells in wild-type cell cultures in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Fig. 4d). Addition of rhIL-11 alone did not stimulate the formation of osteoclast-like cells (data not shown). Consistent with this, the expression of mRNA for RANK ligand was similar in bone marrow cells from either mouse (Fig. 4c). Bone marrow stromal cells contain precursor cells for both osteoblasts and adipocytes. We further investigated effects of IL-11 on bone marrow cells obtained from mice with a different genetic background from founders of IL-11 transgenic mice and on clonal bone marrow stromal cells. IL-11 at 10–1000 pm increased the number of ALP-positive colonies that include osteoblast precursors in bone marrow cell primary cultures derived from long bones of 6-week-old male ddy mice (Fig. 5a). In contrast, IL-11 decreased the number of Oil Red-O positive adipocytes (data not shown) as reported (37Okazaki R. Toriumi M. Fukumoto S. Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Tanaka K. Takeuchi Y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5060-5065Google Scholar). A mouse bone marrow stromal cell line ST2 has the potential to differentiate into either osteoblastic or adipocytic cells in vitro with specific stimulants (32Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Fukumoto S. Fujita T. Bone (New York). 2000; 27: 769-776Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Suda T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 393-411Google Scholar). We examined the effects of IL-11 on osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMP-2 and on adipocytic differentiation induced by troglitazone in ST2 cells. Treatment with 1000 pm IL-11 enhanced the increase in ALP activity in ST2 cells in the presence of 100 ng/ml BMP-2, although IL-11 had no effect on ALP activity in the absence of BMP-2 (Fig. 5b). In contrast, treatment with 10–1000 pm IL-11 decreased the number of Oil Red-O positive cells in the presence of 1 μm troglitazone (Fig. 5c). There were no Oil Red-O positive cells formed in the absence of troglitazone. BMP-2 signals that promote osteoblastic differentiation are in large part mediated by ligand-restricted Smads, such as Smad1, as transcription factors. Treatment of ST2 cells with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 increased the promoter activity of the mouseSmad6 gene that contains BMPRE where Smad1 directly binds (22Fukuda T. Yoshida T. Okada S. Hatano M. Miki T.

There is no information on the mechanism of vitamin C transport across the intestinal barrier, a step that determines the bioavailability of vitamin C in humans. We used the colon carcinoma cell line CaCo-2 as anin vitro model for vitamin C transport in enterocyte-like cells. The results of transport kinetics, sodium dependence, inhibition studies, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicated that CaCo-2 cells express the sodium-ascorbate co-transporters SVCT1 and SVCT2, the dehydroascorbic acid transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, and a third dehydroascorbic acid transporter with properties expected for GLUT2. Analysis by real time quantitative PCR revealed that the post-confluent differentiation of CaCo-2 cells was accompanied by a marked increase (4-fold) in the steady-state level of SVCT1 mRNA, without changes in SVCT2 mRNA levels. Functional studies revealed that the differentiated cells expressed only one functional ascorbic acid transporter having properties expected for SVCT1, and transported ascorbic acid with a V max that was increased at least 2-fold compared with pre-confluent cells. Moreover, post-confluent Caco-2 cells growing as monolayers in permeable filter inserts showed selective sorting of SVCT1 to the apical membrane compartment, without functional evidence for the expression of SVCT2. The identification of SVCT1 as the transporter that allows vectorial uptake of ascorbic acid in differentiated CaCo-2 cells has a direct impact on our understanding of the mechanism for vitamin C transport across the intestinal barrier.

Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient required for the maintenance of a normal human physiology. Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen and carnitine, as a cofactor in enzymes to maintain metal ions in their reduced form, and to protect tissues from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals (1Rose R.C.

Recent evidence (7Carr A.C. Frei B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 1086-1107Google Scholar) indicates that an increased intake of vitamin C is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease.Vitamin C exists in two chemically distinct forms in human plasma, the reduced ascorbate ion form (ascorbic acid (AA) 1The abbreviations used are: AA, ascorbic acid; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase; GLUT, glucose transporter; SGLT, sodium-glucose co-transporter 1The abbreviations used are: AA, ascorbic acid; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase; GLUT, glucose transporter; SGLT, sodium-glucose co-transporter and the oxidized non-ionic form (dehydroascorbic acid (DHA)). Human cells acquire both chemical forms of vitamin C by transporting them across the cell membrane with the participation of two different transporter systems that show absolute specificity for one or the other vitamin form (2Rose R.C.

One transporter system behaves as a low affinity, high capacity sodium-independent system and includes several members of the facilitative glucose transporter family (GLUTs) (10Kayano T. Burant C.F.

Twelve glucose transporter isoforms have been molecularly characterized, and there is evidence that the isoforms GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 are efficient dehydroascorbic acid transporters. A second transport system for vitamin C is a high affinity, low capacity sodium-dependent system (SVCTs) that corresponds to a recently described family of mammalian sodium-ascorbic acid co-transporters composed of two members, SVCT1 and SVCT2. These transporters display high affinity for reduced vitamin C (9Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W. Rumsey S.C. Levine M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Google Scholar,18Faaland C.A. Race J.E. Ricken G.

Supplementation studies in normal volunteers have determined that the step limiting vitamin C bioavailability in humans lies at the transcellular transport within the intestine (23Hodges R.E. Baker E.M. Hood J.H. Samberlich H.E. Manch S.C. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1969; 22: 535-548Google Scholar). However, we know very little regarding the most basic aspects of this process, including how vitamin C enters the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium, whether it is processed intracellularly, or how it exits the basolateral membrane (1Rose R.C.

These cells have been successfully used to study glucose transport regulation and to identify the molecular components by which glucose crosses the intestinal barrier. These studies revealed that CaCo-2 cells express several glucose transporters such as the Na+-glucose co-transporter SGLT, facilitative glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT3, and the fructose transporter GLUT5. It was also shown that the polarized distribution of the different transporters at the apical or basolateral membrane compartments is central to the capacity of these cells to transport glucose in a vectorial manner, i.e. apical to basolateral direction (24Harris D.S.

Transport analysis, together with competition and inhibition studies and RT-PCR analysis, revealed that vitamin C uptake by CaCo-2 cells is mediated by two transporter families. We conclude that CaCo-2 cells express the sodium-ascorbate co-transporters SVCT1 and SVCT2, the dehydroascorbic acid transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, and a third dehydroascorbic acid transporter with properties expected for GLUT2. Moreover, our data indicate that SVCT transporter expression is regulated during in vitrodifferentiation of CaCo-2 cells. Post-confluent differentiated CaCo-2 cells showed increased expression of SVCT1 at RNA and protein levels, and this increased expression was accompanied by selective sorting of SVCT1 to the apical membrane compartment. Our data have a direct impact on our understanding of the mechanism for vitamin C transport at the intestinal level, as well as on the vectorial transport of the vitamin across the intestinal barrier.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCaCo-2 cells were used at passages 20–60 from stock cells grown in T75 plastic flasks. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and fungizone. Cells were dispersed by treatment with 0.25% trypsin, 5 mm EDTA at 80% confluence (31Hidalgo I.J. Raub T.J. Borchardt R.T. Gastroenterology. 1989; 96: 736-749Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 34Briske-Anderson M.J. Finley J.W. Newman S.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 248-257Google Scholar). Cell viability was always greater than 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Tissue culture media, supplements, and tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen.Vitamin C uptake experiments were performed in 6-well plates containing 1 × 106 cells/well. For uptake assays, the cells were deprived of fetal bovine serum, growth factors, and other media supplements by replacing the culture media with incubation buffer (15 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 0.8 mm MgCl2) for 1 h before performing the assays. Uptake was done in incubation buffer containing labeled ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid transport assays were performed in 0.6 ml of incubation buffer containing 0.1–0.4 μCi of l-[14C]ascorbic acid (specific activity 8.2 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final concentration of 5–500 μm ascorbic acid (Sigma) in the presence of 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. For dehydroascorbic acid uptake, 1–10 units of ascorbic acid oxidase (50 units/mg protein, Sigma) was added to the ascorbic acid mixture and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before adding it to the cells at a final concentration of 0.5–12 mm. Uptake was finished by adding 5 volumes of cold stopping solution (NaCl 160 mm, KCl 5 mm, MgSO4 0.8 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, HgCl2 0.2 mm) (37Levitsky L. Zheng Q. Mink K. Rhoads D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E88-E94Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (38Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velásquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Google Scholar). Transport in the absence of sodium ions was accomplished by replacing the NaCl in the incubation media with 135 mm choline chloride (Sigma). When appropriate, competitors (deoxyglucose, fructose, sucrose, and α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside) and inhibitors (phloretin or genistein) were added to the uptake assays simultaneously with the transported substrate, or the cells were preincubated in their presence prior to the uptake assay (cytochalasin B and cytochalasin E). Hexose uptake assays were similarly performed using 1 μCi of 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (specific activity 26.2 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.1–50 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose (deoxyglucose) or 1 μCi of 3-O-[methyl-3H]d-glucose (specific activity 10 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.1–50 mm 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (methylglucose). Time course experiments measuring the transport of methylglucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog, showed that the rate of transport for 1 mm substrate was linear for the first 60 s, with an equilibrium being reached in about 30 min. This allowed us to estimate an intracellular water-exchangeable volume of 2 μl/106 cells.For RT-PCR, CaCo-2 total mRNA was isolated from cells growing in monolayers (∼5 × 106 cells) with the Micro Poly(A) PureTM kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total human brain RNA was obtained from Clontech. For both human brain and CaCo-2 cells, cDNA synthesis was performed by RT-PCR amplification using the AdvantageTM RT kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of hSVCT1 and hSVCT2 transporters in CaCo-2 cells and total human brain was verified by PCR. Oligonucleotide primer pairs for SVCT1 (forward primer, Fsvct1–733, 5′-ACTCTCCTCCGCATCCAGAT-3′; reverse primer, Rsvct1–1017, 5′-CCAGGCGGGCACAGGCGTAG-3′) and SVCT2 (Fsvct2–1025, 5′-AGTATGGCTTCTATGCTCGC-3′; Rsvct2–1464, 5′-TTCCGGATCCTGTGCTGGA-3′; or Fsvct2–733, 5′-TTGACCATTACACCCACGGT-3′; and Rsvct2–1020, 5′-CATAGAAGCCATACTTTGTG-3′) were designed based on GenBankTM sequence accession numbers AJ269477 and AJ269478, respectively. PCR amplification was done using 4 μl of cDNA template (diluted 1:100), 0.3 μm of each primer, 1 unitTaq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 250 μmdNTP mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the following set of reactions: 1) denaturation step, 4 min at 94 °C; 2) 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, 1 min 10 s at 72 °C; and 3) 7 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The 304-, 459-, and 307-bp PCR products were extracted and purified from agarose gels with the QIAX Kit (Qiagen), cloned in pBluescript II KS (Stratagene), sequenced, and analyzed by BLAST using the NCBI server at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from CaCo-2 cells cultured in monolayers for 1–20 days (seeded at 3–4 × 105 cells/well in wells coated with collagen from rat tails) by using the SV Total RNA Isolation SystemTM(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was done using the 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (avian myeloblastosis virus, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 μg of total RNA using the oligonucleotide primer pairs described above. Each PCR amplification product corresponding to 304 and 307 bp (for SVCT1 and SVCT2, respectively) was used as the standard for quantitative RT-PCR. Amplification of β-actin was used as the internal control. PCR amplification was done with the Light Cycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 2 μl of cDNA template, 0.5 μm each primer, 2–3 mm MgCl2(Invitrogen), and 2 μl of Fast-Start mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 20 μl under the following reaction conditions: 1) 10 min at 95 °C; 2) 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, 5–10 s at 65–55 °C (temperature gradient), and 15–20 s at 72 °C; 3) a final cycle of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with SYBR Green (Sigma).Data are presented as the average ± S.D. and correspond to a minimum of three assays performed independently in triplicate. Kinetic parameters were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation and by using the linear transformation of Eadie-Hofstee. In experiments that revealed the presence of more than one kinetic component,K m and V max data were corrected by using successive iterations (39Spears G.S.J. Loten E.G. Biochem. J. 1971; 125: 1149-1151Google Scholar).RESULTSTime course analysis of vitamin C uptake revealed that CaCo-2 cells take up both reduced and oxidized vitamin C but showed clear quantitative differences in their capacity to incorporate both forms of the vitamin (Fig. 1 A). The rate of dehydroascorbic acid incorporation (820 pmol/min per 106 cells) was 10-fold greater than the rate of ascorbic acid incorporation (80 pmol/min per 106 cells). Uptake of ascorbic acid was sodium-dependent, as shown by a greater than 90% decrease in the rate of uptake (to 1.5 pmol/min per 106 cells) when choline chloride replaced NaCl in the incubation buffer (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the rate of dehydroascorbic acid was similar in the presence (810 pmol/min per 106 cells) or absence (805 pmol/min per 106 cells) of NaCl (Fig. 1 C).A time course analysis of dehydroascorbic acid uptake using substrate concentrations from 50 μm to 30 mm revealed that the uptake rate was constant for at least 3 min at each tested concentration, indicating that these values represent real transport rates (Fig. 2 A). A study of dehydroascorbic acid transport dependence on the substrate concentration showed that the rate of transport approached saturation at 20 mm dehydroascorbic acid (Fig. 2 B). Transport data analysis using the Eadie-Hofstee method revealed the presence of at least two different functional components, involved in dehydroascorbic acid transport by CaCo-2 cells, each having different affinities for the substrate (Fig. 2 C). The higher affinity component had an apparent K m of 0.7 mmand a V max of 15 nmol/min per 106cells for the transport of dehydroascorbic acid. In comparison, the lower affinity component had an apparent transportK m of 4.5 mm and aV max of 30 nmol/min per 106 cells (Fig. 2 C). Competition and inhibition experiments revealed that 50 mm deoxyglucose decreased dehydroascorbic acid transport by more than 90%, whereas 50 mm sucrose, 50 mm fructose, or 10 mmα-methyl-d-glucoside had no effect. Furthermore, 20 μm cytochalasin B, but not cytochalasin E, inhibited transport by more than 85% (Fig. 2 D). In parallel experiments, we studied the transport of deoxyglucose. Time course analysis using deoxyglucose concentrations from 1 to 40 mmdefined a temporal window of 1 min for the transport assays (Fig.2 E). Dose-response analysis (Fig. 2, F–G) revealed the presence of at least two different kinetic components involved in deoxyglucose transport by CaCo-2 cells. The higher affinity component had apparent transport K m andV max values of 0.9 mm and 15 nmol/min per 106 cells, respectively. The lower affinity component had K m and V maxvalues of 23 mm and 90 nmol/min per 106 cells, respectively. The transport and kinetic data are compatible with expression of the transporters GLUT3 and GLUT2 in CaCo-2 cells. Expression of GLUT3 and GLUT2 was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for the different transporter isoforms and by immunolocalization experiments using antibodies specific for the glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 to GLUT5 (data not shown). These experiments also revealed that CaCo-2 cells express GLUT1, a transporter of intermediate affinity, and a closer analysis of the deoxyglucose transport data reveals the possible presence of a third functional component (Fig. 2 G) that would be consistent with the presence of GLUT1 in these cells. No such third component is evident from the dehydroascorbic transport data (Fig. 2 C), which is consistent with the similar transport K m of GLUT1 and GLUT3.Figure 2Dehydroascorbic acid and deoxyglucose transport in CaCo-2 cells.

Uptake experiments were performed at room temperature. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we examined the characteristics of ascorbic acid transport in CaCo-2 cells based on the initial evidence of its sodium dependence. Uptake proceeded in a linear fashion for at least 6 min at a substrate concentration of 10–500 μm (Fig.3 A). A detailed dose-response study showed that the transport of ascorbic acid approached saturation at about 500 μm substrate (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of the transport data by the Eadie-Hofstee method revealed the presence of at least two different functional components, involved in ascorbic acid transport by CaCo-2 cells, each with different affinities for the substrate (Fig. 3 C). The higher affinity component had an apparent transport K m of 8 μm and aV max of 40 pmol/min per 106 cells, whereas the lower affinity component had apparent K mand V max values of 125 μm and 670 pmol/min per 106 cells, respectively. Analysis of the sodium effect on ascorbic acid transport at 10 μm, conditions at which greater than 70% of the total transport is expected to be mediated by the higher affinity transporter, revealed that this transporter was strongly activated by sodium (Fig.3 D). The sodium effect was of a cooperative nature as indicated by the sigmoidal shape of the dose-dependent curve, a conclusion that was corroborated when the transport data were utilized to construct a Hill plot that resulted in a straight line having a Hill coefficient (the slope of the Hill graph) of 1.8 (Fig.3 F). Similar results were obtained when using 500 μm ascorbic acid, a concentration at which it is expected that greater than 70% of the total transport would be mediated by the lower affinity transporter. The dose-dependent curve was sigmoidal (Fig. 3 E) with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 (Fig.3 F). Competition and inhibition experiments revealed that deoxyglucose, sucrose, fructose, and cytochalasin B failed to affect ascorbic acid transport, indicating that the ascorbic acid transporters expressed by CaCo-2 cells are functionally unrelated to the dehydroascorbic acid transporters.Figure 3Ascorbic acid transport in CaCo-2 cells.

CaCo-2 cells were plated in 12-well plates, and uptake was measured at 24 h. Uptake experiments were performed at 37 °C. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We performed RT-PCR with primers specific for SVCT1 and SVCT2, the two human isoforms currently cloned, in order to confirm the existence of two sodium-dependent ascorbic acid transporters in CaCo-2 cells, as well as to identify them. RT-PCR experiments yielded amplification products having the expected sizes for SVCT1 (304 bp) and SVCT2 (459 or 307 bp) (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The specificity of the amplification reaction was verified by performing the RT-PCR assays using human brain for SVCT2 (Fig. 4) and human intestinal cells for SVCT1 (data not shown) as the RNA sources. PCR amplification products were isolated and submitted to automated sequencing, which confirmed their identities as corresponding to products amplified from the coding sequences of SVCT1 and SVCT2.Figure 4RT-PCR analysis of SVCT1 and SVCT2 expression in CaCo-2 cells. PCR analysis was performed using CaCo-2 cDNA (lanes 2–4) or total human brain cDNA (lanes 5–7) as templates with specific primers for SVCT1 (lanes 2 and 5) or SVCT2 (lanes 3 and6). Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) (lanes 4 and 7) was used as an internal control. The products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. DNA bands in lane 1 correspond to size markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When cultured in vitro for several days and allowed to reach confluence, CaCo-2 cells underwent further differentiation along the enterocyte pathway which is accompanied by changes in the expression of proteins that are considered markers of terminal differentiation. CaCo-2 cells cultured for 15 days reached a post-confluence state that was characterized by a notable increase in their capacity to transport ascorbic acid. Transport studies using 10 and 500 μmascorbic acid revealed that the increase in transport was fundamentally associated with the increased expression of the lower affinity component. At 10 μm ascorbic acid, the transport rate first increased from 11.5 pmol/min per 106 cells at day 2 post-seeding"

Forced expression of DEC1 in ATDC5 cells induced chondrogenic differentiation, and insulin increased this effect of DEC1 overexpression. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) suppressed DEC1 expression and the differentiation of ATDC5 cells, but DEC1 overexpression antagonized this inhibitory action of PTH/PTHrP. Transforming growth factor-β or bone morphogenetic protein-2, as well as insulin, induced DEC1 expression in ATDC5 cultures where it induced chondrogenic differentiation. In pellet cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells exposed to transforming growth factor-β and insulin, DEC1 was induced at the earliest stage of chondrocyte differentiation and also at the hypertrophic stage. Overexpression of DEC1 in the mesenchymal cells induced the mRNA expressions of type II collagen, Indian hedgehog, and Runx2, as well as cartilage matrix accumulation; overexpression of DEC1 in growth plate chondrocytes at the prehypertrophic stage increased the mRNA levels of Indian hedgehog, Runx2, and type X collagen, and also increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization.

The development of the vertebrate long bones occurs through the process of endochondral ossification, which is initiated in the embryo with the condensation of mesenchymal cells and then progresses with their commitment and differentiation into chondrogenic cells. By the late embryonic stage, the epiphyseal growth plate has developed with distinguishable, well organized and spatially distinct zones of resting, proliferating, and post-proliferative hypertrophic chondrocytes. The hypertrophic cartilage calcifies and is invaded by capillaries, and is subsequently replaced by new bone (1Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified several transcription factors involved in endochondral ossification. Among these, Sox9 is required for the condensation of prechondrogenic mesenchymal cells, and Sox5 and Sox6, as well as Sox9, are required for the activation of type II collagen expression during chondrogenesis (2Lefebvre V.

A mouse ortholog (Stra13) and a rat ortholog (Sharp2) of DEC1 were cloned from P19 embryonic carcinoma cells and rat brain, respectively (21Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P.

Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). DEC1/Stra13 works as a transcriptional repressor, decreasing its own transcription, as well as that of c-myc, through the histone deacetylase-dependent and general transcription factor-dependent mechanisms, respectively (23Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In P19 cells, DEC1/Stra13 overexpression promoted neuronal differentiation when the cells were exposed to retinoic acid in monolayer culture, or promoted it after aggregation in the absence of retinoic acid (21Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, DEC1/Stra13 expression was associated with growth arrest, and overexpression suppressed proliferation (23Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently, DEC1/Stra13-deficient mice have shown defects in several phases of T cell activation, resulting in lymphoid organ hyperplasia and chronic systemic lupus-like autoimmune disease (24Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 11: 1040-1047Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To explore the role of DEC1 in chondrocyte differentiation, we overexpressed human DEC1 in mouse ATDC5 cells, rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and rabbit chondrocytes. ATDC5 cells can mimic chondrocyte differentiation processes from chondroprogenitors to fully differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes in response to insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (25Atsumi T.

Bone marrow MSC can differentiate into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, tenocytes, adipocytes, muscle cells, and nerve cells in vitro and/or in vivo (27Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K.

Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). MSC in pellet, but not in monolayer cultures, undergo chondrogenic differentiation in response to insulin and TGF-β. We show here that forced expression of DEC1 promotes chondrogenic differentiation, hypertrophy, and/or mineralization in the cultures of ATDC5 cells, MSC, and chondrocytes. Furthermore, TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and insulin all induced DEC1 expression, whereas PTH/PTHrP suppressed this expression. DEC1 may play an important role in the control of chondrocyte differentiation from the early to the terminal stage. Chondrocytes were isolated from growth plates of the rib cartilage of 4-week-old male Japanese white rabbits, as previously described (30Shimomura Y. Yoneda T. Suzuki F. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1975; 19: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The experimental procedures on animal care and treatment were performed with permission, and following the rules and guidelines of Hiroshima University. Chondrocytes were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 or 7 × 104 cells in a 16- or 23-mm plastic tissue culture dish, respectively, and maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Sanko Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 32 units/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin (Meiji Seika Co., Tokyo, Japan), and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. ATDC5 cells (Riken, Tsukuba, Japan) were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Flow Laboratories) containing 5% FBS, 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), 3 × 10−8m sodium selenite, 32 units/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B in the absence (medium A) or presence of 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma) (26Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Inoculum density of the cells was 3 × 104 cells/23 mm in 12-multiwell plates or 6 × 104 cells/36 mm in 6-multiwell plates (Corning, New York, NY). The medium was replaced every other day. In some studies, ATDC5 cells were incubated with a medium containing 0.5% FBS for 3 days. Insulin (10 μg/ml) was added at 72 h, and BMP-2 (100 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), or bone extracts (2.5 μg/ml) were added 48 h before the end of the incubation. Bone extracts (Sangi BMP Mixture) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka Japan. BMP mixture induces alkaline phosphatase activity in osteogenic cells in vitro and induces bone formationin vivo. Marrow aspirates were obtained from three 4-week-old male Japan White rabbits. The cells were seeded at 2 × 108 cells per 100-mm tissue culture dish and maintained in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 32 units/ml penicillin, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air (29Tsutsumi S.

Three days after seeding, floating cells were removed and the medium was replaced by fresh medium. Thereafter, attached cells were fed with fresh medium every 3 days and used as MSC. Passages were performed when cells were reaching confluence. Cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes. For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/15-ml plastic centrifuge tube, and maintained in 0.5 ml of serum-free α-minimal essential medium (high glucose) supplemented with 6.25 μg/ml insulin, 6.25 μg/ml transferrin, 6.25 ng/ml selenite, 5.33 μg/ml linolate, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/ml TGF-β1, 100 nm dexamethasone, and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (Wako). The cultures were fed with 0.5 ml of the medium for 4 days after seeding. Thereafter, the cultures were fed with 1 ml of medium every other day (29Tsutsumi S. Shimazu A. Miyazaki K. Pan H. Koike C. Yoshida E. Takagishi K. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Full-length human DEC1 cDNA was cloned into the HindIII-XbaI site of the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) to yield pcDNA3.1/Zeo-DEC1. Stable transfection for pcDNA3.1/Zeo-DEC1 or pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) was carried out using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). After transfection, the cells were incubated in medium A containing 0.15 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), and several individual clones were isolated. Parental ATDC5 cells and clones transfected with pcDNA3.1/Zeo-DEC1 or pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) were cultured in 1 ml of medium A/23-mm dish in 12-multiwell plates for 20 days. The cells were exposed to [35S]sulfate (0.5 μCi/culture) for 8 h before the end of the incubation. We estimated the level of proteoglycan synthesis by measuring incorporation of [35S]sulfate into material precipitated with cetylpyridinium chloride after digestion with 2 mg/ml Pronase E (31Kato Y. Nomura Y. Tsuji M. Ohmae H. Nakazawa T. Suzuki F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycan content was determined as described previously (32Farndale R.W. Sayersm C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the amount of proteoglycan accumulation in the cell layer was estimated by toluidine blue staining. DNA was determined using bisbenzimidazole (Hoechst 33258) (33Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate/cesium trifluoroacetate method (34Smale G. Sasse J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) that had been enriched using Oligotex(dT)30 (Nippon Roche Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, and transferred to Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization was carried out with 32P-labeled specific cDNA probes. The membranes were washed at 65 °C for 30 min with 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS, and exposed to BioMax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript II preamplification system (Invitrogen). Pairs of oligonucleotides: 5′-AGAGACGTGACCGGATTAAA-3′ and 5′-CCATAGCCACTGTCTGTGTC-3′ for rabbit DEC1; 5′-AGAGACGTGACCGGATTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGTATCTTGTCTGGGTTCA-3′ for mouse DEC1; 5′-ATGATCCGCCTCGGGGCTCC-3′ and 5′-TCTGGGCACCACCACCAGCCTTC-3′ for rabbit type II collagen; 5′-CAGGAAAACCTGGACAGCAG-3′ and 5′-ACCCTTAGGACCATTGAGAC-3′ for mouse type X collagen; 5′-GCTTGATGACTCTAAACCTA-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGGGCCCAGTTCTGAA-3′ for Runx2; and 5′-CAAGCAGTTCAGCCCCAACG-3′ and 5′-ACGTGGGCCTTGGACTCGTA-3′ for Indian hedgehog (Ihh), were used as amplification primers. Other gene-specific primers were as previously described (35Kawamoto T. Pan H. Yan W. Ishida H. Usui E. Oda R. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Kawashima-Ohya Y. Fujii M. Shintani H. Okada Y. Kato Y. Eur. J.

PCR reactions were performed using an aliquot of the first-strand cDNA as a template, under standard conditions with KlenTaq polymerase (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) for 22 cycles, which proved optimal for comparison of the amplified products. The amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained by ethidium bromide, or subcloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to determine the cDNA sequences. Hybridizations were performed with 32P-labeled specific cDNA probes under the same conditions as above described. Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument and software (PE Appled Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). First-strand cDNA prepared by RT-PCR reaction was amplified using 5′-GCAAGGAAACTTACAAACTGCC-3′ and 5′-CAATGCACTCGTTAATCCGGT-3′ for mouse DEC1, 5′-GAAAGGATCGGCGCAATTAA-3′ and 5′-CATCATCCGAAAGCTGCATC-3′ for human DEC1, 5′-ACGGCCAGGTCATCATCACTATTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGA-3′ for β-actin, and 5′-AACTCACTGGCATGGCCTT-3′ and 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ for GAPDH. The amplified cDNAs were quantified using 6FAM-CACCGGCTGATTGAGAAAAAGAGACGT-TAMRA for mouse, DEC1, 5′-6FAM-CAAGAGTCCGAAGAACCCCCCACAAAA-TAMRA-3′ for human, DEC1, 5′-VIC-CAACGAGCGGTTCCGATGCCC-TAMRA-3′ for β-actin, and 5′-VIC-TGCCGCCTGGAGAAAGCTGCTAAGTA-TAMRA-3′ for GAPDH. DEC1-overexpressing, empty vector integrated and wild-type ATDC5 cells were maintained in 36-mm dishes in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml insulin. On days 4, 7, and 10, the growth was estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay, using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). The recombinant adenovirus was constructed as described (38Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Briefly, human DEC1 cDNA was subcloned into the I-CeuI and PI-SceI sites of pAdeno-X (Clontech), which is defective in adenovirus E1A, E1B, and E3 regions. Each cosmid bearing the expression unit and adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex was cotransfected into the E1 transcomplementing cell line HEK293. Adenovirus carrying human DEC1 was grown in HEK293 cells and purified. Infection of the recombinant adenoviruses into cells was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1–100. Adenovirus carrying LacZ was generously supplied by Dr. Kohei Miyazono (The University of Tokyo) (3Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined by the method of Bessey et al. (39Bessey O.A. Lowry O.H. Brock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 321-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calcium content was determined by the method of Gitelman (40Gitelman H.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 18: 521-531Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). To examine the changes in the DEC1 mRNA level during chondrocyte differentiation, we incubated rabbit growth plate chondrocytes in high density cultures. The chondrocytes underwent proliferation (day 6), cartilage-matrix synthesis (days 10–14), prehypertrophy (day 18), and hypertrophy (day 22) (41Jikko A. Murakami H. Yan W. Nakashima K. Ohya Y. Satakeda H. Noshiro M. Kawamoto T. Nakamura S. Okada Y. Suzuki F. Kato Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Yoshida E. Noshiro M. Kawamoto T. Tsutsumi S. Kuruta Y. Kato Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte differentiation was associated with the sequential expressions of types II and X collagen mRNA, which are the markers of cartilage-matrix synthesis and hypertrophy, respectively (Fig.1 A). In this system, PTHrP receptor mRNA was expressed at the highest level on day 18 (42). The DEC1 mRNA level was low during the proliferating stage, increased during the matrix-forming/prehypertrophic stages, and reached a maximum in the hypertrophic (terminal) stage. The mRNA level of GAPDH was consistent throughout the culture period (Fig.1 A). We also sliced the growth plate cartilage to identify the expression of DEC1 mRNA in vivo (S1, the proliferating zone; S2, the matrix forming zone; and S3, the hypertrophic zone) (43Kawashima-Ohya Y. Satakeda H. Kuruta Y. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Akagawa Y. Hayakawa T. Noshiro M. Okada Y. Nakamura S. Kato Y. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2120-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aggrecan mRNA was expressed in all zones, with the level decreasing in the hypertrophic zone. Type X collagen mRNA was undetectable in the proliferating zone, whereas it was abundant in the hypertrophic zone. DEC1 mRNA was expressed in the proliferating, matrix-forming and hypertrophic zones at low, moderate, and high levels, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Mouse embryo cell line ATDC5 cells in confluent cultures exposed to a high concentration of insulin undergo chondrogenic differentiation. In ATDC5 cultures, DEC1 mRNA was barely detectable before the addition of insulin, increased during the earliest stage of chondrogenic differentiation in response to insulin, when the expressions of type II collagen and aggrecan were initiated (6 days after adding insulin), and further increased during the hypertrophic stage (14–18 days after adding insulin) (Fig. 1 C). These findings obtained with primary chondrocytes, growth plate slices, and ATDC5 cells suggest that DEC1 expression starts at the early stage of chondrocyte differentiation and reaches a maximum at the hypertrophic stage. To determine whether the bHLH protein DEC1 is functionally involved in chondrogenic differentiation, we isolated several zeocin-resistant clones (D1–D7) expressing human DEC1. Northern blot analysis showed that human DEC1 mRNA was expressed in D1, D2, and D7 cultures at high levels, and in D3, D4, D5, and D6 cultures at low or moderate levels (Fig.2). The endogenous mouse DEC1 mRNA level in undifferentiated wild-type ATDC5 cultures was very low compared with the human DEC1 mRNA levels in D1, D2, and D7 cultures on day 5 (Fig. 2), but it markedly increased during chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the human DEC1 mRNA level in mouse D1, D2, and D7 cultures may be comparable with the endogenous DEC1 level in differentiated chondrocytes. In pilot studies, D1, D2, and D7 cells showed prominent chondrogenic differentiation even in the absence of insulin, estimated under a phase-contrast microscope, whereas D3, D4, D5, and D6 cells showed low or moderate levels of differentiation. The degree of chondrogenic differentiation correlated with the human DEC1 mRNA levels. Thus, subsequent studies used the D1, D2, and D7 clones as DEC1-overexpressing cells unless otherwise specified. In the absence of insulin, D1, D2, and D7 cells mimicked the insulin-inducible cell changes, including cellular condensation, cartilage nodule formation, and the growth of cartilage nodules, after the cultures became confluent. The cell shape changes in D1, D2, and D7 cultures were observed from day 10, and most D1, D2, and D7 cells were morphologically altered from fibroblast-like cells to spherical cells with a refractile extracellular matrix by day 20. In the absence of insulin, such cell shape changes were rarely observed with parental ATDC5 cells (AT) or vector-integrated cells (Pc1 and Pc2) throughout the culture period (Fig. 3 A). Accordingly, the intensity with which toluidine blue stained cartilage proteoglycan was much greater in D1, D2, and D7 cultures than in AT, Pc1, and Pc2 cultures (Fig. 3 B). Proteoglycan synthesis by these cells was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into glycosaminoglycans precipitated with the cetylpyridinium chloride on day 20. The level of proteoglycan synthesis was higher in D1, D2, and D7 cultures than in AT, Pc1, and Pc2 cultures (Fig. 3 C). Northern blot analysis showed that DEC1 overexpression markedly increased the expression of aggrecan, type II collagen, and type X collagen mRNAs, whereas these mRNAs were barely detectable in the control cultures (Fig. 3 D). These findings indicate that the expression of DEC1 initiates chondrogenic differentiation from the early to the terminal stage. In other studies, D1, Pc1, and AT cells were seeded and maintained in 36-mm dishes in the presence or absence of insulin, and on days 4, 7, and 10, the growth was estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. The cells proliferated at similar growth rates under these conditions (Fig. 3 E). In addition, we repeatedly observed, using a phase-contrast microscope, that DEC1 overexpression had little effect on the proliferation of ATDC5 cells. Because insulin also induces chondrogenic differentiation, the effect of DEC1 overexpression was compared with that of insulin. The intensity with which toluidine blue stained the cell-matrix layer in human DEC1-expressing cultures (D1 and D2) without insulin was similar to that in the control cultures (Pc1 and Pc2) maintained with insulin on days 10 and 18 (Fig.4 B, left andmiddle lanes). Furthermore, DEC1 overexpression plus insulin elicited a synergistic enhancement in proteoglycan accumulation on days 10 and 18 (Fig. 4 B, middle lanes). Because PTH/PTHrP suppresses the cellular condensation process and subsequent chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells (26Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PTH/PTHrP on chondrogenic differentiation in DEC1-overexpressing cells. PTH abolished both the cell shape changes, from fibroblast-like cells to spherical cells (Fig. 4 A,right lane), and proteoglycan accumulation (Fig.4 B, right lanes) in insulin-exposed Pc1 and Pc2 cultures. In contrast, PTH had little, if any, effect on chondrogenic differentiation or proteoglycan accum"

Malfunctioning of connexin channels often cause disease, such as the mutations M34T and R75W in human connexin 26, which are associated with hereditary deafness. Another residue known to be essential for normal channel activity in the connexin is Cys-64. To obtain structural and functional insights of connexin 26, we studied the roles of these three residues by expressing mutant connexins in insect Sf9 and HeLa cells. The M34T and M34A mutants both formed gap junction plaques, but dye transfer assays showed that the M34A mutant had a significantly reduced permeability, suggesting that for proper channel function a side chain of adequate size is required at this position. We propose that Met-34 is located in the innermost helix of the channel, where it ensures a fully open channel structure via interactions with other transmembrane helices. Gap junction channels formed by the R75W and R75D mutants dissociated upon solubilization in dodecyl maltoside, whereas the R75A mutant remained hexameric. All gap junctions formed by Arg-75 mutants also showed only negligible activity in dye transfer experiments. These results suggest that residue Arg-75 plays a role in subunit interactions needed to retain a functional and stable connexin hexamer. The C64S mutant was suggested to be defective in oligomerization and/or protein folding even in the presence of wild-type connexin.

Gap junction channels formed by the R75W and R75D mutants dissociated upon solubilization in dodecyl maltoside, whereas the R75A mutant remained hexameric. All gap junctions formed by Arg-75 mutants also showed only negligible activity in dye transfer experiments. These results suggest that residue Arg-75 plays a role in subunit interactions needed to retain a functional and stable connexin hexamer. The C64S mutant was suggested to be defective in oligomerization and/or protein folding even in the presence of wild-type connexin. connexin dodecyl maltoside green fluorescent protein wild type dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin endoplasmic reticulum Gap junctions are assemblies of intercellular communication channels that mediate the direct transfer of metabolites, cytoplasmic ions, and molecules lower than about 1 kDa in size between neighboring cells (1Loewenstein W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 829-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Gap junctions contribute to various biologically important processes such as cell growth, normal organ function, embryogenesis, and development (2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Whereas all connexin (Cx)1 subtypes share a common topology consisting of four transmembrane helices (M1–M4), two extracellular loops (E1 and E2), and cytoplasmic N and C termini (3Beyer E.C.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the main differences are found in their C-terminal tails. Six connexin subunits assemble into a hexameric hemichannel, named connexon, and the docking of two connexons from adjacent membranes produces a complete gap junction channel, resulting in a narrowing of the extracellular gap between adjacent lipid bilayers to about 40 Å (8Yeager M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These characteristic structures have not yet been found in prokaryotes, indicating the necessity for more complex cell-cell communication networks in higher organisms. First structural studies were performed on rat liver gap junctions, mostly composed of connexin 32 (Cx32) and connexin 26 (Cx26) (9Unwin P.N.T. Zampighi G. Nature. 1980; 283: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10Unwin P.N.T. Ennis P.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which confirmed the model of gap junction channel with six membrane-spanning subunits forming the oligomeric channel through the plasma membrane (11Caspar D.L.

Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Electron crystallography further demonstrated that a connexin channel is formed by two hemichannels docking to each other with a rotational displacement (13Perkins G.A. Goodenough D.A. Sosinsky G.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Perkins G.A. Goodenough D.A. Sosinsky G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). More recently, electron crystallography was used to study the three-dimensional structure of C-terminally truncated recombinant connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction channels, and the 7.5-Å (21 Å in the vertical direction to the membrane surfaces) three-dimensional map revealed for the first time the arrangement of the α-helices in gap junctions (15Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Despite our growing understanding of the structure of gap junction channels, an atomic model is still lacking. Knowledge of the gap junction channel in atomic detail is needed, however, for a complete understanding of the molecular basis for the function of this important family of channel-forming membrane proteins. Mutations in the Cx26 gene have been proven to be responsible for nonsyndromic neurosensory autosomal deafness. 2R. Rabionet, P. Gasparini, and X. Estivill, personal communication.2R. Rabionet, P. Gasparini, and X. Estivill, personal communication. Cx26 is expressed in the cochlea of rat and human (17Kikuchi T. Kimura R.S. Paul D.L. Adams J.C. Anat.

Kimura R.S. Paul D.L. Takasaka T. Adams J.C. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 32: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The importance of Cx26 for cochlear functioning is elucidated with targeted ablation mice, suggesting that the apoptotic process is essential for the auditory function (20Cohen-Salmon M. Ott T. Michel V. Hardelin J.-P. Perfettini I. Eybalin M., Wu, T. Marcus D.C. Wangemann P. Willecke K. Petit C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1106-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The M34T mutation was first identified to cause the deafness and shown to have a dominant-negative effect by preventing functional channel coupling (18Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Stevens H.P. Lench N.J.

However, the dominant-negative effect of the M34T mutation has been argued, because families carrying the M34T mutation homozygously or heterozygously exhibit recessive phenotypes (23Kelley P.M.

Genet. 2001; 68: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the exact role of residue Met-34 in the context of the gap junction channel is still unclear. Whereas the R75W mutation in Cx26 was originally found in a family displaying both deafness and palmoplantar keratoderma and was shown to have a dominant-negative effect by pairedXenopus oocyte experiments (29Richard G. White T.W. Smith L.E. Bailey R.A. Compton J.G. Paul D.L. Bale S.J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), no report studying the effect of the mutation on gap junction assembly was published yet. Residue Arg-75 is located at the very beginning of the second transmembrane helix (M2). This residue as well as the sequence around it, is highly conserved among all connexin subtypes (29Richard G. White T.W. Smith L.E. Bailey R.A. Compton J.G. Paul D.L. Bale S.J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), indicating that this residue plays an important role in all gap junctions. It is noteworthy that the motifs of extracellular cysteines are conserved in all the connexin subtypes with the sole exception of Cx31. Previous studies (30John S.A. Revel J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Rahman S. Evans W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the cysteines might be involved in disulfide bonds, implying a role in stabilizing the characteristic fold of the extracellular domains. Moreover, a mutational analysis showed that substitution of any one of the six cysteines in Cx32 to serine resulted in loss of channel conductance in paired Xenopus oocyte experiments (32Dahl G. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Werner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62 (, 180–182): 172-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on studies using systematic mutations of conserved cysteines, a β-sheet structure was proposed for the extracellular loops (34Foote C.I. Zhou L. Zhu X. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this report, we studied the roles of residues Met-34, Cys-64, and Arg-75 in human Cx26 by introducing mutations at each position, focusing on the effect on formation of connexons and gap junction plaques. Because it has been shown that connexins expressed in insect Sf9 cells form gap junction plaques in the insect cell membranes (35Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we used this system to express mutant connexins. All mutants were also fused to GFP at the C terminus and transiently expressed in HeLa cells to investigate their trafficking to the plasma membrane and to characterize their channel activities (36Falk M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4109-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the three residues studied here all play important but different roles in gap junction channels. Here we propose a model for the location of the molecular structure and functional roles of three key residues of Met-34, Cys-64, and Arg-75 based on our mutational studies of Cx26 combining with results from previous physiological, functional, and structural studies. For expression in Sf9 cells, human Cx26 cDNA (37Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Paul D. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was ligated into the EcoRI/NotI sites of the pVL1393 vector (Invitrogen). Point mutations were introduced using the following oligonucleotide primers: M34T, 5′-TTCATTTTTCGCATTACGATCCTCGTTGTGGCT-3′; M34A, 5′-TTCATTTTTCGCATTGCGATCCTCGTTGTGGCT-3′; R75W, 5′-CAGGGCCCATAGCCAGATGTGGGAGATGGGGAA-3′; R75A, 5′-CAGGGCCCATAGCGCGATGTGGGAGATGGGGAAGTA-3′; R75D, 5′-CAGGGCCCATAGGTCGATGTGGGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTG-3′; and C64S, 5′-CAGGGCCCATAGCCGGATGTGGGAGATGGGGAAGTAGTGATC- GTAGGACACGTTCTTGCAGCC-3′. A hexahistidine (His−) tag with a thrombin recognition sequence (LVPRGS) was fused to the C terminus of Cx26 to enable protein purification by nickel-affinity chromatography. For expression in HeLa cells, the genes were introduced into pcDNA3.1(+) vectors (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI/NotI sites. A sequence encoding KTETSQVAPA, the epitope for the anti-rhodopsin monoclonal antibody 1D4, was attached to the C terminus of WT-His and C64S-His, and the constructs were ligated into theEcoRI/HindIII site of the pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen) and the pBlueBac4.5 vector (Invitrogen). Tagged genes were cut out from the pcDNA3.1(+) vectors by EcoRI andBamHI treatment and inserted into pEGFP-N3 vectors (Clontech) using theEcoRI/BamHI sites. Recombinant viruses were prepared with linearized BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) or linearized Bac-N-Blue DNA (Invitrogen) following the protocols given by the manufacturers. After transfection, single viruses were isolated using the plaque assay. Sf9 cells were grown in 400-ml suspension cultures as described (38Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agri. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar) using Sf900II-SFM medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Pluronic F68, and antibiotic-antimicotic (Invitrogen). At a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2 and cultured for 90 h. When wild-type and mutant viruses were co-transfected, wild-type:mutant virus ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 were used because the wild-type virus usually showed a lower expression level than those of the mutants (see “Results”). Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Membranes were enriched in gap junctions using the alkaline extraction method (35Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Membrane aliquots corresponding to 100-ml culture cells were frozen and stored at −80 °C. For EM analysis, 2 μl of membranes were applied to carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Isolated membranes were pelleted and sonicated in solubilization buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2% DoDM, 0.005% NaN3) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min using a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor, the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) in 10 mm imidazole for 60 min. The beads were washed with washing buffer (1 mNaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% DoDM, 0.005% NaN3, 10 mm imidazole), and proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA kit (Pierce). For thrombin digestion, the purified proteins were treated with thrombin (0.1 units/300 μg of proteins) at room temperature overnight. The oligomeric state of connexins was determined by analytical gel filtration. 500 μl of protein solution was filtered through a Ultrafree-MC (Millipore) using a 0.22-μm filter unit and applied to a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 0.2% DoDM, 10 mm DTT, 0.005% NaN3 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 1 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10–20% gradient acrylamide gels, and the protein bands were visualized by silver staining. Negatively stained samples were examined with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope operating by magnification of 80,000 at 100 kV. For the immunogold labeling, membrane-mounted grid was washed with water at room temperature for 10 min, washed with 5% goat serum in BSA-Tris buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mg/ml gelatin, 20 mmNaN3) for 15 min, and treated with primary antibody (25 μg/ml 1D4 monoclonal antibody, 1% goat serum) for 1 h. Then samples were washed three times with BSA-Tris buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to 10-nm gold (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. They were washed three times with water and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded on FUJI FG film. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transfection, cells were seeded the day before to ∼70% confluency and transfected with the plasmid DNAs described above using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were seeded on serum-coated coverslips in 6-well dishes, transfected, and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Cells were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 with simultaneous quenching with 50 mm glycine and washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. For GFP fusion proteins, the coverslips were mounted directly on glass slides, and the fluorescence was imaged with an LSM Pascal confocal microscope (Zeiss). For co-expression of GFP-fused mutant proteins with 1D4-tagged WT connexin, fixed cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) before primary antibody 1D4 was added for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with blocking buffer, incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature, and imaged with a confocal microscope as described above. HeLa cells were grown in 35-mm glass bottom dishes and transfected with GFP-tagged connexin genes. 18 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with PBS, and cells were injected with a 2% solution of the fluorescent dye sulforhodamine (Molecular Probes) at room temperature. Injected cells were chosen by the criteria that GFP-labeled gap junction plaques had formed between neighboring cells. In the case of the C64S mutant, cell pairs that were both clearly transfected were chosen. Non-transfected cells were injected as a control. Although Lucifer Yellow is the tracer commonly used to monitor gap junction activity, its fluorescence emission wavelength was too close to the emission wavelength of GFP. To avoid interference, we therefore used sulforhodamine dye instead of Lucifer Yellow to monitor gap junction activity. The positions of the three residues Met-34, Cys-64, and Arg-75 in human Cx26 are represented in Fig. 1 A, and the Cx26 constructs used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1 B. Residue Met-34 is located in the first transmembrane helix (M1) near the extracellular side, and residue Arg-75 is found at the boundary of the first extracellular loop (E1) and the second transmembrane helix (M2). In addition to the human hearing loss or palmoplantar keratoderma mutants, M34T and R75W (18Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Stevens H.P. Lench N.J. Liang J.N. Parry G. Mueller R.F. Leigh I.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 29Richard G. White T.W. Smith L.E. Bailey R.A. Compton J.G. Paul D.L. Bale S.J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we also made M34A, R75A, and R75D substitutions to examine the roles of these two residues more closely. Residue Cys-64 is the third cysteine in E1, and the mutation C64S results in a loss of the electric coupling activity in Cx32 (33Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62 (, 180–182): 172-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To allow for affinity purification of the expressed proteins, a hexahistidine tag was fused to the C termini of the wild-type and the mutant connexins (named WT-His, M34T-His, etc.). We also produced GFP- and 1D4-tagged fusion proteins (called WT-GFP and WT-1D4), which were used to detect the proteins in transiently transfected mammalian cells. A thrombin-recognition sequence was inserted in all tagged proteins so that the tags could be removed. The total numbers of amino acid residues for the expressed connexins were 238 for WT-His, 471 for WT-GFP, and 248 for WT-1D4. Negative staining technique of electron microscopy was used to check for the formation of gap junction plaques in Sf9 cells expressing WT and mutant Cx26. We isolated membranes from transfected cells and enriched the gap junctions by alkaline extraction (35Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared in this way were negatively stained and imaged in the electron microscope (Fig. 2). Preparations from Sf9 cells expressing WT connexin frequently showed the typical gap junction plaques consisting of partially ordered hexagonal connexon arrays (Fig. 2 A). Plaques of identical appearance were seen at the similar frequency in membrane preparations obtained from Sf9 cells expressing mutant connexins, where residue Met-34 was substituted either by a threonine (Fig. 2 B) or an alanine residue (Fig. 2 C). The R75A and R75D substitutions had also no significant effect on the appearance and frequency of gap junction plaques (Fig. 2,E and F). Although the R75W substitution also produced gap junction plaques (Fig. 2 D), in this case the frequency at which gap junction plaques could be observed was much lower. We found more than 10 plaques per grid square in membrane preparations from Sf9 cells expressing WT, R75A, or R75D connexin, but we only found less than one plaque per grid square in membrane preparations from cells expressing R75W. Although it is difficult to quantify the occurrence of gap junction plaques accurately by electron microscopy, the difference between R75W and all the other connexins were significantly high to reliably conclude that the R75W substitution had an effect on the frequency of gap junction formation. The C64S connexin was the only mutant that did not form gap junctions in our mutations. The expression of the mutant into membranes was confirmed by the immunogold labeling of the alkali membranes (Fig. 2 G). In the case of the control Sf9 membranes, no gold particles were observed as shown in Fig. 2 H. When the insect cells, which were maintained in suspension culture, were harvested, there were no signs of cell-cell adhesion. Therefore, the gap junctions seen in the electron micrographs had to be assembled in the ER or other intracellular membranes. Gap junction formation in the ER is a known phenomenon that has already been described with connexins overexpressed in mammalian cells (39Kumar N.M. Friend D.S. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis of freeze-fractured and thin-sectioned specimens confirmed that the gap junction plaques found in ER membranes were similar to those found on the cell surface (39Kumar N.M. Friend D.S. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results were thought to reflect the ability of all mutant connexins with the exception of C64S to adopt the correct tertiary structure and to form gap junction plaques in Sf9 cell membranes. A negative staining technique for electron microscopy was used to examine the oligomeric states of mutant connexins expressed in Sf9 cells. To this end, alkaline-extracted membranes were solubilized with 2% dodecyl maltoside (DoDM), and the His-tagged connexins were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. This one-step purification was necessary to remove impurities that made it difficult to image solubilized connexins in the electron microscope and yielded highly purified protein as shown in Fig. 3. Electron micrographs of negatively stained WT-His, M34T-His, M34A-His, and R75A-His Cx26 revealed mostly homogeneous connexon particles (Fig. 3, A–C andE, respectively), whereas the R75W-His and R75D-His connexins tended to aggregate (Fig. 3, D and F). The C64S-His Cx26 mutant also showed protein aggregates rather than homogeneous particles (Fig. 3 G), consistent with the lack of gap junction plaques seen in the membrane preparations as shown in the previous section. To confirm our EM results on the oligomeric states of Cx26, all the purified protein samples were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 column that was calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (230 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa) as standards. For each connexin sample, fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). WT-His Cx26 eluted mainly in fraction 14, corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass of about 550 kDa (Fig. 4 A). The appearance of the connexons in the EM as well as their molecular weight are both consistent with connexin hexamers, confirming previous studies on the connexon structure (35Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Unwin N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 40Stauffer K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6768-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A fraction of the protein also eluted in fractions corresponding to higher molecular weights, an effect that is most probably caused by binding of large amounts of detergent to the connexins (40Stauffer K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6768-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutants M34T-His and M34A-His behaved similar to WT-His Cx26 and eluted around fraction 14 with no significant peaks in the lower molecular weight fractions (Fig. 4, B andC), showing that these two mutants also form DoDM-resistant hexamers. By contrast, the R75W-His, R75D-His, and C64S-His Cx26 mutants eluted mainly around fraction 17, corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa (Fig. 4, D, F, andG). Although we could not unambiguously exclude the formation of small amounts of oligomers, a similar elution profile was observed when WT-His Cx26 was solubilized by 1% SDS (data not shown), suggesting that DoDM solubilized R75W-His, R75D-His, and C64S-His Cx26 exist predominantly in a monomeric form (41Diez J.A. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among all the Arg-75 mutants, only R75A formed stable connexons (Fig. 4 E), suggesting that certain amino acid substitutions can be tolerated at this position without causing dissociation upon detergent solubilization. These results show the importance of Arg-75 for the structural stability of connexons. The C64S mutant formed neither connexons nor gap junction plaques. The severe effect of this substitution is not unexpected, because residue Cys-64 is located in the extracellular domain of Cx26 and is thought to be involved in stabilizing the docking surface of connexons by the formation of a disulfide bond (31Rahman S.

Residue Cys-64 might therefore be crucial in the early phase of gap junction formation, e.g. in the correct folding of the protein, as discussed below. To test the possibility whether the His tag had an effect on the oligomeric state of wild-type and mutant Cx26, the tags were removed by treatment with thrombin. Because the proteins with or without tag behaved identically on SDS-PAGE and revealed the same connexon structures when observed in the electron microscope (data not shown), we conclude that the His tag at the C terminus had no significant effect on the properties of the Cx26 mutants used in our studies. By using analytical gel filtration, we then tested whether the oligomerization of the three mutants, M34T-His, R75W-His, and C64S-His, could be rescued by co-expression of WT connexin.

We describe here a novel regulator of heat shock response, Phr, from the hyperthermophilic archaeonPyrococcus furiosus that is conserved among Euryarchaeota. The protein specifically inhibited cell-free transcription of its own gene and from promoters of a small heat shock protein, Hsp20, and of an AAA+ ATPase. Inhibition of transcription was brought about by abrogating RNA polymerase recruitment to the TBP/TFB promoter complex. Phr bound to a 29-bp DNA sequence overlapping the transcription start site. Three sequences conserved in the binding sites of Phr, TTTA at −10, TGGTAA at the transcription start site, and AAAA at position +10, were required for Phr binding and are proposed as consensus regulatory sequences of Pyrococcus heat shock promoters. Shifting the growth temperature from 95 to 103 °C caused a dramatic increase of mRNA levels for theaaa+ atpase and phrgenes, but expression of the Phr protein was only weakly stimulated. Our findings suggest that heat shock response in Archaea is negatively regulated by a mechanism involving binding of Phr to conserved sequences.

The overwhelming majority of information on these heat-induced heat shock proteins (Hsps)1 and heat shock genes comes from bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, several independent mechanisms of regulation of heat shock promoters have been elucidated. Regulation in Escherichia coli is brought about by the use of alternative sigma factors that direct RNA polymerase to heat shock promoters differing from the standard consensus promoter sequence (1Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1382-1399Google Scholar). A different mechanism operates in Gram-positive bacteria, which involves binding and dissociation of a repressor to a DNA control element upstream of the groEL and dnaK operons (2Hecker M. Schumann W. Völker U. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Recent analyses suggest that bacteria have evolved sophisticated regulatory networks often combining positive and negative control mechanisms to allow a time-tuned expression of heat shock genes (3Narberhaus F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes stress-induced transcription requires activation of a heat shock factor, HSF, which binds as a trimer to the heat shock DNA element, thereby stimulating transcription. The monomeric form of HSF lacks both promoter binding and transcriptional activity (4Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Regulators of the heat shock response in the domain of Archaea have not yet been identified, but studies of stress genes in archaeal genomes revealed the presence of homologues of Hsp70/DnaK, Hsp60, Hsp40, GrpE, and of small heat shock proteins (5Macario A.J.L. Lange M. Ahring B. Conway de Macario E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 923-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70 is only present in about 50% of the archaeal species inspected; GroEL and GroES seem not to exist in Archaea (5Macario A.J.L. Lange M. Ahring B. Conway de Macario E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 923-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their function in peptide folding is apparently performed by the archaeal thermosome, which has been studied in some molecular detail in Thermoplasma (6Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O.

Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar), using a cell-free transcription system (10Hethke C. Geerling Ans C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The transcriptional machinery of Archaea is eukaryotic-like. It consists of a pol II-type of RNA polymerase, a TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), and a homologue of the transcription factor TFIIB, TFB (11Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Archaeal TBP and TFB interact with the archaeal promoter elements TATA-box and B-recognition element (BRE) of an archaeal promoter in a similar manner as their eukaryotic counterparts (13Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Science U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The information on the regulation of transcription in Archaea is scarce but in contrast to the eukaryotic nature of the basal archaeal transcriptional machinery many homologues of bacterial regulators have been identified in archaeal genomes (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4648-4670Google Scholar, 16Bell S.D. Magill C.P. Jackson S.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A transcriptional activator of gas vesicle proteins containing a leucine zipper motif has been identified in the extreme halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum (17Plosser P. Pfeifer F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), although this protein did not show significant sequence similarity to eukaryotic activators. Archaeal homologues of the general bacterial regulator leucine responsive regulatory protein, Lrp, have been shown to inhibit transcription from their own promoters in vitro (18Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31624-31629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Dahlke I. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since archaeal cells do not have sigma factors or homologues of eukaryotic heat shock factors (HSF) or sequences similar to heat shock factor elements (HSE) the mechanism of control of heat shock response and the components involved in this process are completely unclear. We describe here an archaeal transcriptional repressor that shows, with the exception of the region of its helix-turn-helix motif, no sequence similarity to eukaryotic or bacterial regulators. It binds specifically to the transcriptional start site of an archaeal heat shock gene thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase recruitment. We also show that mRNA levels of this regulator are induced after heat shock and during stationary growth phase. By contrast, levels of the regulator protein were only slightly elevated during heat stress. P. furiosus cells were grown at 95 °C in a 100-liter fermentor in marine medium as described previously (9Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). To study the effects of heat shock on the transcription of the hsp20, theaaa + atpase, and the putative heat shock regulator (phr) genes, the temperature during logarithmic growth phase (OD578 of 0.5) was shifted to 103 °C. Before heat shock treatment and after 30, 60, and 90 min at 103 °C, aliquots of 2 liters of culture broth were taken and rapidly cooled down using a heat exchange device. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The sediment was resuspended in TBS (300 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) and stored at −70 °C. To analyze the effects of growth phase on the expression of heat shock genes, Pyrococcus cells were grown at 95 °C in a 100-liter fermentor, and aliquots of 6.2, 4.5, 3.0, and 2.0 liters were taken at an OD578 nm of 0.14, 0.27, 0.6, and 0.58, respectively. Cells were harvested as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cells grown at 95 °C at different stages of the “growth curve” and from heat shocked cells following the protocol of DiRuggiero and Robb (20DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Sowers K.R. Schreier H.J. DasSarma S. Fleischmann E.H. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 97-99Google Scholar). The gene encodingphr was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers pftrpexp1-F (5′-GGAATTCAATATGGGAGAGGAGCTAAACAG-3′) and pftrpexp1-R (5′-CGCGGATCCTTAAATGGTAATGTTTAGG-3′), which include the restriction sites for BamHI and NdeI, respectively. The resulting 625-bp PCR fragment and the plasmid pET19b (Novagen) were hydrolyzed with BamHI and NdeI. The fragment was cloned into pET19b, and the sequence of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing. For expression of the recombinant histidine-tagged Phr, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21CP(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Cells were grown in LB medium with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 68 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C while shaking. When an OD600 nm of 0.6 was reached, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After incubation for 3 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PING buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mmimidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). Cells were then disrupted by a French pressure cell (American Instruments) at 140 MPa, and the cell-free extract was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), and the column was washed with 10 volumes of PING buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and 1 m NaCl. The recombinant protein was eluted by a linear increasing imidazole gradient (20 mm to 0.5 m imidazole in PING buffer containing 300 mm NaCl) and eluted from the column at 300 mm imidazole. Fractions of 0.5-ml size were collected and tested for the presence of Phr by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). For gel shift analyses with oligonucleotides, Phr that did not contain a His tag was used. Expression of the protein was refined as described above. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL 21-CP(DE3)-RIL carrying plasmid pET17b containing the phrgene sequence as insert and a pLysE plasmid. Cells were lysed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) using a French pressure cell at 140 MPa. The cell extract was incubated at 70 °C for 15 min and after centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (Beckman L60 ultracentrifuge, rotor 70 Ti) additionally at 75 °C for 15 min. After a further centrifugation step, the supernatant was applied to a heparin affinity column (HiTrap Heparin, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a salt gradient ranging from 0 to 1000 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Phr were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM3 Membrane (Millipore). 2 ml were applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 16/60, Amersham Biosciences). Gel filtration was carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.2). Fractions containing Phr were concentrated by cation exchange chromatography using a sulfopropyl Sepharose column (SP XL, Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted by a linear salt gradient ranging from 0 to 1000 mmNaCl. Phr was eluted at an approximate salt concentration of 500 mm NaCl. To determine the native molecular mass of Phr the protein was applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 column. The column was calibrated using apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anydrase (29 kDa) as standards. Phr showed an apparent molecular mass of 48,000 during gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm phosphate buffer. This finding indicated that recombinant Phr forms a dimer in solution. The P. furiosus aaa + atpase, hsp20, andphr promoters were amplified by PCR using primers ATPF1 (5′-GTTGAATAGCTTTAGTACCC-3′) and ATPR1 (5′-CTCAACAACATCTCCTGGTG-3′) for the aaa+ atpase promoter, 20F3 (5′-CTTCGTGGAGAGAATTTACTG-3′) and 20R1 (5′-CTTGGCCTGCTGAAGAATTC-3′) for the hsp20 promoter and PfPr1F1 (5′-GCTGGAGTTACCGTTGTTC-3′) and PfPr1R (5′-GCTCGCTGACAAAGTAAGG-3′) for the phr promoter. The PCR products were ligated into SmaI-digested pUC18 (pUC19 in the case of cloning the phr promoter). This resulted in the plasmid constructs upatpase,uphsp20, and upphr. The sequences of the archaeal DNA in the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA was purified by centrifugation in CsCl density gradients as described previously (22Frey G. Thomm M. Brüdigam B. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription assays were performed as described previously (10Hethke C. Geerling Ans C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Assays were composed of 300 ng of linearized template DNA (XbaI-digesteduphsp20 or upphr or KpnI-digestedupatpase), 0.012 μm Pyrococcus RNA polymerase (RNAP), 0.076 μm recombinant TFB, 0.68 μm recombinant TBP, and different amounts (0.37–1.5 μm) recombinant Phr in a 25-μl reaction mixture. The control template was XbaI-digested plasmid pUC19 containing the P. furiosus gdh promoter sequence from −95 to +163 (10Hethke C. Geerling Ans C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reactions were assembled at 4 °C and then incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. The transcripts were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (22Frey G. Thomm M. Brüdigam B. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activities were quantified using a PhosphorImager (FLA 5000 Fuji, Aida Imaging Software, Raytest). For analyses of the transcriptional start sites in vitro, cell-free transcription reactions with unlabeled precursors (0.44 mm each) were performed. The end-labeled primers used for the reactions were: ATPR1 (5′-CTCAACAACATCTCCTGGTG-3′), complementary to nucleotides +139 to +159 of the aaa + atpase gene, 20R1 (5′-CTTGGCCTGCTGAAGAATTC-3′), complementary to nucleotides +116 to +136 of the hsp20 gene and PfPr1R (5′-GCTCGCTGACAAAGTAAGG-3′), complementary to nucleotides +107 to +126 of the phr gene. Primer extension reactions were performed as described previously (10Hethke C. Geerling Ans C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For in vivo RNA analyses primer extension was performed with 30 μg of total RNA of P. furiosus. The RNA was isolated from cells cultured under different growth conditions as described above. Primer extension products were quantified using a PhosphorImager. DNA probes for EMSA were generated by PCR using the end-labeled primers ATPF2 (5′-GGTTCTATTATCAATTAATTCC-3′) and M13/pUCrev (5′-GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′), and plasmid upatpase as template. The PCR products were excised from a 6% native polyacrylamide gel, eluted in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 01.mm EDTA) and precipitated with ethanol. Oligonucleotides (MWG Oligo) were hybridized as follows: 3000 pmol of complementary oligonucleotides (sequence of the noncoding strand shown in Fig. 6 B) dissolved in hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl) were heated to 95 °C and allowed to cool down to room temperature overnight. Double-stranded DNA was purified via native gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Double-stranded DNA was excised from the gel, the gel slices were immersed in gel elution buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.5 mNH4Ac, pH 7) and eluted overnight at 37 °C. Eluted DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer, pH 8. Double-stranded DNA fragments were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas) according to the MBI protocol. DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The 10-μl binding reaction mixture contained 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 325 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(d(IC)) as nonspecific competitor DNA. Each reaction contained 1–10 ng of labeled DNA. Binding reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 30 min and contained 0.23 μmrecombinant TBP, 0.13 μm recombinant TFB, 0.008 μm RNAP, and 0.74, 1.9, or 3.7 μmrecombinant Phr. DNA protein complexes were analyzed on nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gels buffered in Tris borate/EDTA buffer (TBE) (23Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.39-6.43Google Scholar). Probes containing the promoter region of the aaa+atpase gene were generated by PCR using a combination of one unlabeled primer and a second primer that was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For the nontemplate strand labeled ATPF2 (5′-GGTTCTATTATCAATTAATTCC-3′) and unlabeled M13/pUCrev (5′-GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3′) and for the template strand labeled ATPR1 (5′-CTCAACAACATCTCCTGGTG-3′) and unlabeled M13/pUCf (5′-GCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGA-3′) were used. The probe for footprinting analysis of the nontemplate strand contained the DNA region from −95 to +225, the second probe the DNA sequence from −236 to +160. For purification, PCR products were excised from a native 6% polyacrylamide gel and eluted in TE buffer, pH 7 overnight at room temperature. After ethanol precipitation, about 10 ng of this DNA was used per footprinting reaction in a total volume of 10 μl. Buffer conditions were identical to those used for EMSA, except that in the footprinting reactions CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. DNaseI footprinting reactions contained 0.93 μm TBP, 0.55 μm TFB, and/or 3.7 μm Phr. Binding reactions were preincubated at 70 °C for 30 min and then 100 milliunits of DNaseI were added. After 30 s of DNaseI treatment at 70 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 18 μl of a solution containing 1.5 mNH4Ac, 70 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 and 114 ng/μl tRNA. The samples were extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA fragments were resuspended in formamide-loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and were electrophoresed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Purified native His-tagged Phr (500 μg) was used for immunization of a rabbit using the standard protocol (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The preimmune and anti-Phr IgG fractions were isolated from the serum by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). 0.2 g (wet weight) of P. furiosus cells harvested before and after heat shock were suspended in PBSEG buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and lysed by sonication (Branson Sonifier 250). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and 20 μg of the cell-free extract were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) by semi-dry blotting and detected immunologically using purified anti-Phr IgG essentially as described previously (24Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The relative amount of Phr was quantified using a PhosphorImager. A putative heat shock regulator from P. furiosus, Phr, is composed of 202 amino acids encoded by an open reading frame of 609 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession no. Q8U030). It has a predicted pI of 7.68, a molecular mass of 24,034, and forms a dimer in solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The His-tagged protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 26,000 under denaturating conditions (Fig. 1). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of Phr with putative heat shock regulators from other Archaea revealed that the related Pyrococcus strainsP. abyssi and P. horikoshii have the highest percent identity and similarity to Phr (TableI). The putative regulator of a moderate thermophilic methanogenic archaeon Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus shows lower percent identity and of the hyperthermophilic archaeal sulfate reducer Archaeoglobus the lowest percent identity. The availability of a cell-free transcription system for P. furiosus allowed us to investigate the function of Phr as transcriptional regulator.Table IAmino acid similarity of Phr from P. furiosus to archaeal homologuesOrganismGene nameIdentitySimilarity%Pyrococcus horikoshiiPH17448192Pyrococcus abyssiPAB02088491Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicusMTH12884054Archaeoglobus fulgidusAF12983350Percent identity and percent similarity in comparison to P. furiosus Phr are shown. Alignments and calculations were performed using HUSAR Heidelberg. Open table in a new tab Percent identity and percent similarity in comparison to P. furiosus Phr are shown. Alignments and calculations were performed using HUSAR Heidelberg. To characterize these putative archaeal heat shock genes, the promoter regions of the Pyrococcus aaa + atpaseand hsp20 gene and of the Phr were cloned by PCR and used as templates in cell-free transcription reactions. The in vitrotranscription start sites were identified by primer extension analyses of RNA products synthesized by the cell-free Pyrococcussystem. All these templates showed typical archaeal TATA-boxes and BRE-elements (Fig. 2 B). As expected, they were expressed in the cell-free system (Fig. 2 A). Transcription initiated at a distance of 24, 23, and 20 nucleotides downstream of the TATA-box at a G, T, or A residue, respectively. To study the effect of Phr on the expression of these genes the protein was added to cell-free transcription reactions containing different putative heat shock genes as templates, and the labeled RNA products were analyzed directly in denaturing gels. When increasing amounts of Phr were added to the templates encoding hsp20, theaaa + atpase or to the gene encoding the regulator Phr itself, synthesis of the run-off transcripts was reduced at lower concentrations and strongly or completely inhibited at higher concentrations of Phr (Fig. 3,A and C). The inhibitory activity of Phr was highest at the aaa+ atpase promoter (complete inactivation at a molar ratio DNA: regulator is 1:125; addition of 500 ng) and lowest at the phr promoter (no complete inhibition at a molar ratio of 1:250; addition of 1000 ng). The effect of Phr on cell-free transcription of the P. furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase promoter (Fig. 3 B) was studied as a control. Addition of Phr did not affect the rates of transcription from this promoter. These findings suggest that Phr is a negative regulator of heat shock response. To investigate the interaction of Phr with the archaeal transcriptional machinery in more detail Phr was added to DNA binding reactions containing the aaa+atpase promoter, TBP/TFB, and RNAP. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that Phr bound to a labeled DNA fragment encoding the DNA region from position −95 to +225 (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). No shift was observed when a DNA fragment containing the gdhpromoter region was used (data not shown), indicating that binding of Phr to the aaa+ atpase promoter was specific. TBP/TFB formed a complex with lower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4, lane 3). Addition of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to binding reactions containing TBP/TFB resulted in the formation of a third, slowly migrating complex (lane 5). We have recently shown the presence of TBP/TFB and of RNAP in similarly migrating complexes formed at the lrpA promoter of P. furiosus by serological analyses (19Dahlke I. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore assume that these components are also present in the corresponding complexes observed at the aaa+ atpase promoter. When Phr was added to binding reactions containing TBP/TFB, binding of the archaeal transcription factors was not affected, but a third complex of lower mobility was observed (lane 4). This finding and the decrease in intensity of the band corresponding to the Phr-DNA complex in lane 4 suggest that this third complex consisted of TBP/TFB and Phr. When Phr was added in low concentrations (molar ratio RNAP:Phr of 1:92) to binding reactions containing both TBP/TFB and RNAP, the Phr-DNA, the TBP/TFB-DNA, the TBP/TFB-Phr-DNA, and the TBP/TFB-RNAP-DNA complexes were observed (lane 6). However, addition of increasing amounts of Phr to the binding reaction containing TBP/TFB and RNAP decreased the amount of the TBP-TFB-RNAP-DNA complex and increased the amount of the TBP/TFB-Phr-DNA complex (molar ratio RNAP:Phr of 1:237 in lane 7 and 1:462 in lane 8). This finding supports the conclusion that binding of Phr to DNA did not affect binding of TBP/TFB, but inhibited association of RNAP with the TBP/TFB promoter complex. To analyze the DNA binding region of Phr and of Pyrococcustranscriptional components at theaaa+atpase promoter in molecular detail, DNase I footprinting experiments were performed. Phr protected the DNA region from −15 to +14 on the nontemplate (Fig. 5 A, left panel,lanes 1–4) and from −17 to +12 on the template DNA strand (Fig. 5 A, right panel, lanes 1–4) from DNase I digestion. The TBP/TFB footprint extended from position −41 to −17 on the nontemplate (Fig. 5 A, left panel, lanes 5 and6) and from −36 to −19 (Fig. 5 A, right panel, lanes 5 and 6) on the template DNA strand. The TBP/TFB-binding site was centered at the TATA-box and Phr bound to the DNA region overlapping the transcription start site (Fig. 5 B). This DNA segment downstream of the TBP/TFB binding site has been shown to be bound by the archaeal RNAP (25Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Phr and TBP/TFB can bind simultaneously to the same DNA molecule. To investigate this both Phr and TBP/TFB were added to binding reactions. Phr and TBP/TFB induced a footprint both on the nontemplate and template DNA strand (Fig. 5 A,left and right panel, lanes 7 and8). The extension of the protected DNA regions was the same as with individual components. On the nontemplate DNA strand a hypersensitivity site located at position −6 was observed in complexes containing both TPB/TFB and Phr (left panel, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, binding of Phr to the region of the transcription start site prevents the association of RNAP with the TBP/TFB promoter complex. To identify the structural determinants of archaeal heat shock promoters required for operator recognition by Phr, binding experiments with short double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type aaa+ atpase DNA binding region and mutated sequences were performed. Inspection of sequences in the Phr binding site, which are conserved between the three promoters investigated revealed the existence of three common signals: The consensus sequences TTTA at −10, TGGTAA at the transcription start site, and AAAA centered at position +10 (Fig. 2 B). DNA fragments of 36 and 30 bp containing these three conserved elements were sufficient for Phr binding (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and4 and 7 and 8). Phr did not form a complex with single-stranded 36-nucleotide DNA (Fig. 6 A, la"
https://openalex.org/W2028908252,"Phosphopantetheinyl-dependent carrier proteins are part of fatty-acid synthases (primary metabolism), polyketide synthases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (secondary metabolism). For these proteins to become functionally active, they need to be primed with the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety of coenzyme A by a dedicated phosphopantetheine transferase (PPTase). Most organisms that employ more than one phosphopantetheinyl-dependent pathway also have more than one PPTase. Typically, one of these PPTases is optimized for the modification of carrier proteins of primary metabolism and rejects those of secondary metabolism (AcpS-type PPTases), whereas the other, Sfp-type PPTase, efficiently modifies carrier proteins involved in secondary metabolism. We present here a new type of PPTase, the carrier protein synthase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an organism that harbors merely one PPTase, namely PcpS. Gene deletion experiments clearly show that PcpS is essential for growth of P. aeruginosa, and biochemical data indicate its association with both fatty acid synthesis and siderophore metabolism. At first sight, PcpS is a PPTase of the monomeric Sfp-type and was consequently expected to have catalytic properties typical for this type of enzyme. However, in vitro characterization of PcpS with natural protein partners and non-cognate substrates revealed that its catalytic properties differ significantly from those of Sfp. Thus, the situation in P. aeruginosa is not simply the result of the loss of an AcpS-type PPTase. PcpS exhibits high catalytic efficiency with the carrier protein of fatty acid synthesis and shows a reduced although significant conversion rate of the carrier proteins of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases from their apo to holo form. This association with enzymes of primary and secondary metabolism indicates that PcpS belongs to a new sub-class of PPTases.

The superfamily of CP includes the acidic acyl and aryl carrier proteins and the neutral peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs). They can be part of a larger polypeptide chain or exist as distinct proteins but always fulfill the same job; during the multistep assembly of the product, the reaction intermediates of the growing acyl or polypeptide chain remain covalently tethered to the Ppant cofactor moiety of these proteins. This moiety is about 20 Å in length and enables the bound intermediates to move between the reaction centers of multifunctional proteins. The thioester linkage that is used to bind the intermediates and final product is energy-rich, which facilitates cleavage after the final step of the assembly. After ribosomal synthesis, however, the carrier protein exists only in the inactive apo form. The Ppant moiety is post-translationally transferred from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue of the CP in a Mg2+-dependent reaction by a dedicated phosphopantetheine transferase (PPTase), thus converting it to the active holoCP (3Flugel R.S.

Many organisms utilize more than one Ppant-dependent pathway. For instance, aside from fatty acids, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli produce the cyclic lipopeptide surfactin and the catecholic siderophore enterobactin, respectively (4Quadri L.E.

Both products that are secondary metabolites of these organisms were name-giving when the associated PPTases, Sfp and EntD, were discovered. The conversion of ACPs of fatty acid synthesis (primary metabolism) is catalyzed by a second PPTase, namely the acyl carrier protein synthase (AcpS), that does not recognize the CPs of the NRPS systems (1Lambalot R.H.

It has been shown that EntD does not cross-interact with primary metabolism, whereas B. subtiliscan sustain fatty acid synthesis even if AcpS is not present (7Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The substrate spectrum of the PPTases has, apart from the difference in size, lead to a classification into three groups. The name-giving prototype of the first group is AcpS of E. coli. PPTases of this group have a narrow substrate specificity, are about 120 aa in size, and are shown to act as homotrimers (8Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J.

Drueckhammer D.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, these results were further supported by the characterization of other AcpS-type PPTase, especially AcpS of B. subtilis (7Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PPTases of the second, Sfp group, are about twice the size of AcpS, have an extraordinarily broad substrate spectrum, and are active as monomers. Sfp has proven to recognize every CP tested so far, including PCPs of NRPSs and ACPs of FASs and PKSs. PPTases of the third group act as integrated domains on their cognate ACP of type I FAS, as is the case in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example (11Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Because Sfp has been shown to accept ACPs of FAS as substrate, the question remained whether the presence of a second AcpS-type PPTase would be essential for the survival of B. subtilis. Although many organisms contain both a PPTase of the AcpS type and one of the Sfp-type, some of the recently sequenced organisms seem to have lost its AcpS in the course of evolution (TableI). Mootz et al. (7Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) simulated this loss by the deletion of AcpS in an sfp+strain of B. subtilis. The phenotype of this mutant was that of the wild type, but further in vitro characterization of Sfp revealed that the catalytic efficiency was low with the ACP of primary metabolism. This PPTase is evidently optimized for the modification of CPs of secondary metabolism.Table IPresence of PPTases of the AcpS- and Sfp-type in selected bacteriaAcpS-type PPTaseSfp-type PPTaseAcpS-type PPTaseSfp-type PPTaseA. acolicus+−M. tuberculosis++B. burgdorferi+−N. meningitidis+−B. halodurans++Nostoc sp.

Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas spp. secret toxic compounds such as elastase, proteases, or cyanide and are very resistant to treatment with antimicrobial agents (13Pessi G. Williams F. Hindle Z. Heurlier K.

Infect. 2001; 7: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Two siderophores, namely pyoverdin (pvd) and pyochelin (pch), which are produced during iron-limiting growth conditions, are associated with the high virulence of P. aeruginosa (15Patel H.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9023-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Cox C.D. Adams P. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 130-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cox C.D. Graham R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the synthesis of these two non-ribosomally produced peptides has proven to reduce significantly the virulence of this organism (18Takase H. Nitanai H. Hoshino K. Otani T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This would make the PPTase responsible for the modification of the pvd- and pch-NRPSs an excellent target for the development of new antibiotics. Our blast searches using E. coli EntD and B. subtilis AcpS as probes revealed that P. aeruginosaharbors merely one putative ORF encoding a PPTase (PA1165, GenBankTM accession number AAG04554 ) of 242 aa (27 kDa) with a pI of 6.77. According to these characteristics this enzyme ought to belong to the Sfp-type PPTases but exhibits only minor similarity to Sfp (13.9%) (Fig. 2). In contrast to Sfp, this PPTase is not clustered with any NRPS. We report here on the genetic and biochemical characterization of the PPTase of P. aeruginosa in vivo and in vitro with its natural substrates. The PPTase was renamed according to its function as aP. aeruginosacarrier protein synthase (PcpS). As we will show, this enzyme is of special interest because it represents a new type of PPTase, essential for the modification of both the CPs of primary and secondary metabolism. Unlike Sfp, which exhibits poor catalytic efficiency with the ACP of FAS and high efficiency with CPs of secondary metabolism, PcpS behaves like a PPTase of primary metabolism toward ACP substrates.

Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The presence of the respective protein in the fractions was detected using SDS-PAGE analysis (15% Laemmli gels). Fractions containing the desired protein were pooled and subsequently concentrated using Vivaspin (Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) with a molecular mass cut-off of 5 kDa in the case of all carrier proteins and a cut-off of 10 kDa in the case of PcpS. The concentrated fractions were applied to a SuperdexTM G-75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0); 4-ml fractions were collected. Those fractions containing the desired protein were pooled and concentrated as described above, brought to 10% glycerol (v/v), and stored at −80 °C. In the case of PcpS, all buffers contained 30% glycerol. TycC3-PCP, AcpS from B. subtilis, Sfp from B. subtilis, and ACP from B. subtilis, hereafter referred to as PCP, AcpS, Sfp and B.s.-ACP, respectively, were produced and purified as described previously (6Mofid M.R.

Protein concentrations were determined based on the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm: PcpS-His6 38,220m−1 cm−1; ACP-His61280 m−1 cm−1; ArCP-His6 13,020 m−1cm−1. A SuperdexTM G-75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) was calibrated using the following proteins (numbers in parentheses indicate the size of the protein and the amount used): aprotinin (6.5 kDa, 3 mg), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa, 2 mg), carboanhydrase (29 kDa, 2 mg), and egg albumin (45 kDa, 5 mg). Determination of the void volume, V 0, of the column was carried out using ferritin (450 kDa, 5 mg). Isocratic elution at 1 ml/min of the proteins was performed with buffer 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0) using an Äkta purifier system (Amersham Biosciences); absorbance at 220 nm was monitored. The retention times, V, of the proteins are as follows: aprotinin, 247.14 ml; cytochrome c, 214.97 ml; carboanhydrase, 186.21 ml; egg albumin, 163.15 ml; ferritin, 108.96 ml (V 0). The V/V 0values of the proteins were plotted against the log(kDa), and a linear fit was applied. 5 mg of the His6-tagged PcpS was injected onto the same column and eluted in the same manner. The retention time of the His6-tagged PcpS was 185.67 ml. PcpS activity was assayed using a radioactive assay method essentially as described previously (7Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This method measures the incorporation of the 3H-labeled 4′-phosphopantetheine group from [3H]CoA into apoenzymes. Reaction mixtures (in duplicate) containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 64.1 μm ACP, ArCP, orB.s.-ACP, 20 μm CoA, 200 nm[3H]CoA (specific activity: 40 Ci/mmol, 0.95 mCi/ml), and 112 nm AcpS, 120 nm Sfp, or PcpS were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.8 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and 15 μl of bovine serum albumin (25 mg/ml). Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was washed twice with 0.8 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and resuspended in 180 μl of formic acid. The resulting suspension was mixed with 3.5 ml of Rotiszint Eco Plus scintillation fluid (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and counted using a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co., Dreieich, Germany). For kinetic studies, the amount of holo-carrier protein formed was determined by an HPLC method essentially as described previously (7Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 800-μl reaction mixtures contained the apo-carrier protein (1.5–250 μm ACP, 2.2–200 μm B.s.-ACP, 1–154 μm ArCP, and 0.9–150 μm PCP), 75 mm MES/NaAc (pH 6.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1–500 μm CoA. The reaction was started by the addition of PcpS to a final concentration of 5.15–34.3 nm; reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min. The reaction was stopped and the protein precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min using a microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 120 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.8). In the case of PCP, a 3–100-μl sample of this solution was injected onto an analytical reversed phase HPLC column (Nucleosil C18, 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Macherey & Nagel, Germany) that had been equilibrated with 60% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Absorbance at 220 nm was monitored. Apo- and holoPCP could be separated by applying a 13.5-ml linear gradient to 57.3% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a 0.9-ml linear gradient to 95% solvent B (flow rate of 0.9 ml/min and temperature of 45 °C). Under these conditions, holoPCP migrates faster than apoPCP (10.52 and 12.15 min, respectively). The amount of holoPCP formed was determined by comparing the peak area of the holoPCP formed with those of both apoPCP and holoPCP and subtracting the amount of holoPCP that was already present after the heterologous expression of the protein in E. coli(see “Results”).

In C5a-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization assay with human neutrophils, W-54011 did not show agonistic activity at up to 10 μm and shifted rightward the concentration-response curves to C5a without depressing the maximal responses. Examination on the species specificity of W-54011 revealed that it was able to inhibit C5a-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils of cynomolgus monkeys and gerbils but not mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs. In gerbils, oral administration of W-54011 (3–30 mg/kg) inhibited C5a-induced neutropenia in a dose-dependent manner.

The present report is the first description of an orally active non-peptide C5a receptor antagonist that could contribute to the treatment of inflammatory diseases mediated by C5a. The complement component C5a is a 74-amino acid peptide generated during the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways of complement activation (1Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 775-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Ember J.A. Hugli T.E. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). C5a is a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils and other leukocytes and is a potent inflammatory mediator. Moreover, C5a causes histamine release from mast cells, smooth muscle contraction, increase in vascular permeability, eliciting of superoxide anion production, enhancement of neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, induction of several cytokines (i.e. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) from leukocytes, and augmentation of the humoral and cell-mediated immune response. C5a exerts these activities by binding to G-protein-coupled C5a receptor (C5aR) 1The abbreviations used are: C5aR, C5a receptor; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; GPI, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase; rhC5a, recombinant human C5a; FCS, fetal calf serum; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; ROS, reactive oxide species; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; gZAS, gerbil zymosan-activated serum on the plasma membrane of target cells (3Wetsel R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These biological activities of C5a are implicated in a variety of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (4Jose P.J.

Yoshida M. Surg. Today. 1996; 26: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pathogenic action of C5/C5a is also shown in some animal models. For instance, in murine collagen-induced arthritis, an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), administration of anti-C5 antibody during the disease induction or after the onset suppresses or ameliorates the disease (18Wang Y. Rollins S.A. Madri J.A. Matis L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8955-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Anti-C5 antibody is also effective in a new RA model (19Ji H. Ohmura K. Mahmood U. Lee D.M. Hofhuis F.M. Boackle S.A. Takahashi K. Holers V.M. Walport M. Gerard C. Ezekowitz A. Carroll M.C. Brenner M. Weissleder R. Verbeek J.S. Duchatelle V. Degott C.

Furthermore, the anti-GPI antibody-induced arthritis does not occur in C5aR-deficient mice, indicating that C5a is important in the development of arthritis rather than C5b, which is another part of C5 and is a component of the membrane attack complex. Inhibition of C5a function has been attempted with anti-C5a antibodies and C5aR antagonists (for review, see Refs. 23Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wong A.K. Investig. Drugs. 1999; 2: 686-693Google Scholar). Anti-C5a antibodies inhibit immune complex-induced inflammation and reperfusion injury and are effective in septic primates and rats (25Stevens J.H. O'Hanley P. Shapiro J.M. Mihm F.G. Satoh P.S.

On the other hand, although C5aR antagonists, including non-peptides, small peptides, C5a mutants, and anti-C5aR antibodies, have been studied for the past 2 decades, only a few candidates have been discovered as non-peptide antagonists. These non-peptide antagonists, however, are not so potent (IC50, more than subhundreds nmin 125I-rhC5a binding assay) and have not been reported on as to their in vivo activities. As a small peptide antagonist, hexapeptide (MeFKP-d-ChaWr, C089) was first reported in 1994 (28Konteatis Z.D. Siciliano S.J. Van Riper G. Molineaux C.J. Pandya S. Fischer P. Rosen H. Mumford R.A. Springer M.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4200-4205PubMed Google Scholar). C089 exhibits an IC50 value of 70 nm in 125I-rhC5a binding assay and has been reported recently to inhibit the late airway response in allergic rats and inhibit thrombotic glomerulonephritis in rats (29Kondo C. Mizuno M. Nishikawa K. Yuzawa Y. Hotta N. Matsuo S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 124: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recent reports describe two other types of C5aR antagonists, one of which is a group of F-[OP-d-ChaWR] derivatives (30Paczkowski N.J. Finch A.M. Whitmore J.B. Short A.J. Wong A.K. Monk P.N.

Intravenous injection of these C5aR antagonists inhibits immune complex-induced inflammation and reperfusion injury. Based on these findings, the appearance of non-peptide C5aR antagonists that can be used against various human disorders is expected (38Kirschfink M. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe the discovery and pharmacological characterization of an orally active non-peptide C5aR antagonist. Recombinant human C5a (rhC5a) was purchased from Sigma. 125I-labeled recombinant human C5a (125I-rhC5a) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody (clone: S5/1) (39Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Gotze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794PubMed Google Scholar) was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Fresh isolated whole blood of cynomolgus monkeys, anticoagulated with EDTA, was purchased from Shin-nihonkagaku (Kagoshima, Japan). BALB/c mice (AnNCrj) and Wistar rats (Crj) were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). Mongolian gerbils (MGS/Sea), Hartley guinea pigs (Std), rabbits (KBT JW), and beagle dogs were purchased from Seac Yoshitomi (Fukuoka, Japan), Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan), Biotec (Saga, Japan), and Keari (Osaka, Japan), respectively. N-[(4-dimethylaminophenyl)methyl]-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)-7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-carboxamide hydrochloride (W-54011) was synthesized as follows: a solution of 7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-carbonyl chloride (16.3 g, 72.7 mmol) and [(4-dimethylaminophenyl)methyl](4-isopropylphenyl) amine (19.5 g, 72.7 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (200 ml) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted two times with CHCl3. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed over silica gel using a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (1:4) as eluent to give a yellow oil (29.9 g, 90.1%). To a solution of the oil (29.9 g, 63.5 mmol) in ethanol (300 ml) was added hydrogen chloride (4.0 m solution in 1,4-dioxane, 17.5 ml), and the resulting solid was filtered, recrystallized from ethanol:water to afford W-54011 (24.2 g, 75.8%) as yellow crystals. The melting point was 147 °C; mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization) wasm/z 457 [M + H]+. The cyclic C5aR antagonist F-[OP-d-ChaWR] was synthesized according to the method reported by Finch et al. (31Finch A.M. Wong A.K. Paczkowski N.J. Wadi S.K. Craik D.J. Fairlie D.P. Taylor S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The human histocytic lymphoma line U-937 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood of various species, anticoagulated with 0.2% EDTA. Whole blood was collected from healthy volunteers and animals via vein puncture (human, cynomolgus monkey, dog, and rabbit) or inferior vena cava puncture (guinea pig, rat, gerbil and mouse under anesthesia). The blood was then layered on an equal volume of Lympholyte®-poly (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Hornby, Canada) in a centrifuge tube and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the polymorphonuclear cells were harvested, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen) containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS), and used as neutrophils. Polymorphonuclear cells in this fraction were >95%. This assay was performed in 96-well filtration plates (Multiscreen MADV NOB, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a total volume of 100 μl. Human neutrophils (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with125I-rhC5a (200 pm) and varying concentrations of test compounds in the binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3, adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH) at 4 °C for 2 h. Filters were washed four times by vacuum filtration with 300 μl/well cold binding buffer, then dried, punched, and measured for radioactivity in a gamma counter (Packard Cobra, GMI, Inc., Albertville, MI). The nonspecific binding was defined by the binding in the presence of 20 nmunlabeled rhC5a. Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 40 min at 37 °C. After two washes, the cells were suspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS containing 1% FCS. The studies were conducted by a microtiter plate-based assay using a functional drug screening system (FDSS6000, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) in black wall 96-well plates (Corning, Acton, MA) in a total volume of 140 μl. The cells (1 × 105 cells/100 μl/well) and varying concentrations of test compounds (20 μl/well) in HBSS containing 1% FCS were plated in black wall 96-well plates. The plates were placed into a FDSS6000, and then the changes in fluorescence were monitored at 37 °C at excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. 10 s after the start of monitoring, stimulators (20 μl/well) were added. Calculation of Ca2+ concentration was performed using a K d for Ca2+binding of 224 nm (40Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The maximal change in Ca2+ concentration after stimulator addition was quantitated. Neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and loaded with 5 μm Calcein-AM (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washes, the cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells (1 × 105 cells/200 μl/well) and varying concentrations of test compounds (200 μl/well) in RPMI 1640 containing 25 mmHEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin were placed into chemotaxicells (3-μm pore size, Kurabou, Osaka, Japan) within 24-well plates containing 100 pm rhC5a (300 μl/well). The plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After removing the chemotaxicells, migrated cells were lysed by adding 100 μl/well cell lysing solution (10% SDS, 0.01 n HCl), and the fluorescence was measured using a fluoro-plate reader (Cyto FlourII, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The studies were conducted by a microtiter plate-based assay using a microplate luminometer (Microlumat Plus LB96V, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) in white wall 96-well plates (Berthold) in a total volume of 200 μl. The cells (1 × 105 cells/150 μl/well) and varying concentrations of test compounds (25 μl/well) in HBSS containing 1% FCS and 1 mm luminol (Wako, Osaka, Japan) were plated in white wall 96-well plates. After the plates were incubated in a Microlumat at 37 °C for 5 min, rhC5a (25 μl/well) was added at a final concentration of 3 nm, and the luminescence was monitored for 15 min. The maximal change in luminescence was quantitated as ROS generation. The C5a-induced neutropenia was based on the observation that neutrophils transiently disappear from circulation after systemic infusion of chemoattractants such as C5a or leukotrien B4 (32Short A.

Male mongolian gerbils (6–12 weeks) were orally treated with W-54011 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) suspended in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 4 h before rhC5a injection. The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL), and the skin was incised to expose the jugular veins for rhC5a injection and blood collection using syringes. RhC5a was injected at time 0. Blood was sampled at –1, 1, 3, and 5 min into EDTA-treated tubes (Capiject, Terumo Medical, Somerset, NJ) and counted using Technicon H*1E Hematology System (Technicon, Macon, GA). To determine the levels of C5a-induced neutropenia, data were expressed as percentages of the neutrophil counts 1 min before rhC5a injection. To identify a non-peptide C5aR antagonist, a high capacity radioligand screening was configured using 125I-rhC5a and C5aR-expressing U-937 cells. In consequence of the followed chemical optimization, we identified a novel non-peptide C5aR antagonist,N-[(4-dimethylaminophenyl)methyl]-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)-7-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-carboxamide (W-54011, Fig. 1). W-54011 inhibited125I-rhC5a competitive binding to human neutrophils with aK i value of 2.2 nm and was more potent than anti-C5aR antibody (S5/1) with a K i value of 8.1 nm and F-[OP-d-ChaWR] with aK i value of 15 nm (Fig.2).Figure 2Inhibition of125I-rhC5a binding to human neutrophils by C5a, W-54011, anti-C5a R antibody and F-[OP-d-ChaWR]. Human neutrophils were incubated with 0.2 nm125I-rhC5a in the absence and presence of a range of concentrations of C5a, W-54011, anti-C5a R antibody, or F-[OP-d-ChaWR], and specific binding was determined. Data are means ± S.E. of multiple experiments (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether W-54011 was a functional antagonist for human C5aR or not, we measured the ability of this compound to inhibit rhC5a-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and generation of ROS in human neutrophils. W-54011 inhibited these responses with IC50 values of 1.6–3.1 nm and was more potent than F-[OP-d-ChaWR] (TableI) as was observed in125I-rhC5a competitive binding. Further, at concentrations up to 10 μm, W-54011 had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in human neutrophils, indicating that this compound is a full antagonist (data not shown). Next, to determine the selectivity for the C5aR, W-54011 was tested for the ability to inhibit Ca2+ mobilization stimulated with other G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands, such as fMLP, platelet-activating factor, and IL-8. At concentrations up to 10 μm, W-54011 did not affect Ca2+ mobilization stimulated with submaximally effective concentrations of fMLP (1 nm), platelet-activating factor (0.3 nm), and IL-8 (0.1 nm) (data not shown). This result demonstrates that W-54011 is highly specific for C5aR.Table IEffects of W-54011 and F-[OP-d-ChaWR] on rhC5a-induced calcium mobilization, chemotaxis, and ROS release in human neutrophilsAssay systemrhC5a added in assayIC50 (95% CL)W-54011F-[OP-d-ChaWR]nmnmCa2+ rise (N = 6)0.13.1 (2.4–3.9)55 (42–73)Chemotaxis (N = 3)0.12.7 (1.6–4.5)18 (13–26)ROS release (N = 6)3.01.6 (1.4–1.8)12 (9.6–14)The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C5a concentration used in each assay, IC50values, and the 95% confidential limit of tested compounds are indicated.

The mechanism of the antagonistic effect of W-54011 was examined with human neutrophils by Schild analysis (42Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar). The concentration-response curves for Ca2+ mobilization induced by rhC5a were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of W-54011 (Fig. 3). W-54011 shifted rightward the concentration-response curves to C5a without depressing the maximal responses. This result indicates that W-54011 has a competitive antagonist-like function, but the response curves at low concentrations (0.3–3 nm) of W-54011 were not parallel to those at the other concentrations. The species selectivity of W-54011 was examined in rhC5a-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization of neutrophils in various species. The responses of neutrophils to rhC5a were different among these species (Fig. 4 A, mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs; data not shown). The W-54011 was able to inhibit the response in cynomolgus monkeys and gerbils with IC50 values of 1.7 and 3.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 B) but not in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs (data not shown). The in vivo effect of W-54011 was examined in the C5a-induced neutropenia model of mongolian gerbils. Intravenous injection of 100 μg/kg rhC5a caused a rapid and transient neutropenia, which reached nadir at 1 min after the rhC5a injection and returned to baseline within 5 min. When W-54011 (3–30 mg/kg) was orally administered 4 h before rhC5a injection, it inhibited the neutropenia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5). This inhibition by W-54011 was also observed when it was administered 1 or 8 h before rhC5a injection but not 24 h (data not shown). Because the model described above was based on the reaction between different species, human C5a and gerbil C5aR, it is unclear whether the compound inhibits the interaction between gerbil C5a and C5aR. So, we next used gerbil zymosan-activated serum (gZAS) as a source of gerbil C5a. Intravenous injection of gZAS caused a rapid and transient neutropenia in a dose-dependent manner similar to that of rhC5a (Fig.6 A). When W-54011 (10, 30 mg/kg) was orally administered 4 h before gZAS (5-fold dilution, 2 ml/kg) injection, it inhibited this neutropenia (Fig.6 B).Figure 6Neutropenia induced by gZAS and effects of W-54011 on gZAS-induced neutropenia in gerbils. A, gerbils were treated with gZAS (3-, 10-, and 30-times dilution, 2 ml/kg, intravenous). Blood was sampled at –1, 1, 3, 5 min after gZAS injection, and neutrophils were counted. B, gerbils were orally treated with W-54011 (10, 30 mg/kg) 4 h before gZAS (5 times dilution, 2 ml/kg, intravenous) injection. Vehicle control was treated with vehicles of W-54011 and gZAS. Neutropenia control was treated with a vehicle of W-54011 before gZAS injection. Blood was sampled at –1, 1, 3, 5 min after gZAS injection, and neutrophils were counted.

W-54011 inhibited C5a binding and C5a-induced functions in human neutrophils with IC50 values of less than 5 nm and was more potent than F-[OP-d-ChaWR], which has been considered to be the most potent small C5aR antagonist. The C5aR antagonistic activity of W-54011 was species-specific and C5aR-specific. W-54011 also exhibited C5a antagonistic activity in vivo(gerbils). The binding site of W-54011 is not fully investigated, but we considered that it binds to C5aR by the following three observations. 1) In Ca2+ mobilization assay, the inhibitory activity of W-54011 remained after W-54011-treated cells were washed briefly in assay buffer to remove this drug (data not shown). This observation indicates that W-54011 reacts with C5aR-expressing cells, but not C5a. 2) W-54011 does not inhibit IL-8-, PAF-, or fMLP–induced Ca2+ mobilization. This observation indicates that W-54011 does not inhibit signal machineries commonly used by GPCRs. 3) The antagonistic action of W-54011 was exhibited only in the neutrophils of human, cynomolgus monkeys, and gerbils, but not in those of other examined species. The homology of C5aRs is more than 90% between human and Rhesus monkeys (43Alvarez V. Coto E. Setien F. Gonzalez-Roces S. Lopez-Larrea C. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is about 60–70% between humans and mice (44Gerard C. Bao L. Orozco O. Pearson M. Kunz D. Gerard N.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2600-2606PubMed Google Scholar), rats (45Rothermel E. Zwirner J. Vogt T. Rabini S. Gotze O. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), rabbits (46Bachvarov D.R. Houle S. Bachvarova M. Bouthillier J. St-Pierre S.A. Fukuoka Y. Ember J.A. Marceau F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), dogs (47Perret J.J. Raspe E. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or guinea pigs (48Fukuoka Y. Ember J.A. Yasui A. Hugli T.E. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that W-54011 binds to a region that is conserved in the C5aRs of humans and cynomolgus monkeys and does not exist in those of other species. Although the C5aR sequence of gerbils has not been defined, it is considered that the binding site of W-54011 is conserved similarly to that of humans. On the other hand, in the Ca2+mobilization assay, W-54011 shifted rightward the concentration-response curves to C5a without depressing the maximal responses. The response curves were not parallel between the low concentrations (0.3–3 nm) of W-54011 and the high concentrations (10–300 nm), although the curves were parallel among the high concentrations (10–300 nm) of W-54011. These results suggest that W-54011 inhibits competitively the action of C5a at high concentrations, but not at low concentrations. However, the binding mechanism of W-54011 remains to be resolved. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been exerted to discover C5aR antagonists, then C-terminal mimic peptides of C5a and C5a mutants were identified, but potent and non-peptide antagonists had not been discovered. On this point, Wong (24Wong A.K. Investig. Drugs. 1999; 2: 686-693Google Scholar) and Pellas and Wennogle (23Pellas T.C. Wennogle L.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 737-755PubMed Google Scholar) review in detail. Briefly, bezodiazepine derivatives and spiroindane-bearing hydantoin derivatives discovered by de Laszloet al. have affinity to C5aR, but they are partial agonists (49de Laszlo S.E. Allen E.E. Li B. Ondeyka D. Rivero R. Malkowitz L. Molineaux C. Siciliano S.J. Springer M.S. Greenlee W.J. Mantlo N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 213-218Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lanza et al. also reported substituted 4,6-diaminoquinolines as C5aR antagonists, but their activity is not so potent (IC50, 2 μg/ml in C5a binding assay) (50Lanza T.J. Durette P.L. Rollins T. Siciliano S. Cianciarulo D.N. Kobayashi S.V. Caldwell C.G. Springer M.S. Hagmann W.K. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to these compounds, Astles et al. reported phenylguanidine derivatives as C5aR antagonist with an IC50value of 0.8 μm (51Astles P.C. Brown T.J. Cox P. Halley F. Lockey P.M. McCarthy C. McLay I.M. Majid T.N. Morley A.D. Porter B. Ratcliffe A.J. Walsh R.J.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 907-912Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but these compounds seem to be cytotoxic. Thus, non-peptide C5a binding inhibitors reported previously are not so potent, and some are partial agonists. Moreover, most of these compounds are positively charged. That reason is considered since C5a is a highly cationic polypeptide. C5a binding to its receptor is predominantly through two-site binding of charge-charge interactions (3Wetsel R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 52Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 53Zhang X. Boyar W. Galakatos N. Gonnella N.C. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), one of which is an interaction of the positive charged N-terminal disulfide-linked core of C5a and the negative charged N-terminal domain of its receptor, and the other, which is an interaction of the positive charged C-terminal tail of C5a and the interhelical region of its receptor and which is essential for the functional response to C5a. Based on this information, we dared to pick up an uncharged compound to discover a new type of C5a receptor antagonist after we screened our chemical libraries by binding assay using 125I-labeled C5a according to the similar method for C5a inhibitors described previously. In addition to this point, we used whole cells of stimulated U-937 cells as a source of C5aR in the binding assay instead of the plasma membrane, which have been used in previously reported C5a inhibitors. Moreover, we used two screening systems for chemical optimization, a binding assay system the same as for the first screening and a ROS assay system with human neutrophils. Although it is not clear whether the former contributed to the discovery of potent C5aR antagonists, the latter is thought to be important for this study for the following reasons: structure activity relationships obtained during chemical optimization did not completely coincide between ROS assay using intact human neutrophils and binding assay using human tumor line, U-937 cells (data not shown). Namely, it is thought to be important to use intact human cells. We discovered a potent and orally active non-peptide C5aR antagonist. Since C5a is implicated in a variety of diseases, it is anticipated that an orally active non-peptide C5aR antagonist may have potential as novel therapeutics."

Most MMPs are composed of a regulatory, a catalytic, and a hemopexin subunit. In many tumors the expression of MMP-9 correlates with local tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. To analyze the role of the hemopexin domain in these processes, the MMP-9 hemopexin domain (MMP-9-PEX) was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After proteolytic cleavage, the isolated PEX domain was purified by size exclusion chromatography. In a zymography assay, MMP-9-PEX was able to inhibit MMP-9 activity. The association and dissociation rates for the interaction of MMP-9-PEX with gelatin were determined by plasmon resonance. From the measured rate constants, the dissociation constant was calculated to be K d = 2,4 × 10−8m, demonstrating a high affinity between MMP-9-PEX and gelatin. In Boyden chamber experiments the recombinant MMP-9-PEX was able to inhibit the invasion of melanoma cells secreting high amounts of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrate for the first time that the hemopexin domain of MMP-9 has a high affinity binding site for gelatin, and the particular recombinant domain is able to block MMP-9 activity and tumor cell invasion. Because MMP-9 plays an important role in metastasis, this antagonistic effect may be utilized to design MMP inhibition-based cancer therapy.

They are responsible for most of the turnover of matrix components. The MMPs are produced as zymogens with a signal sequence and propeptide segment that has to be removed during activation. The propeptide domain contains a conserved cysteine that chelates the zinc in the active site. The gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 contain fibronectin type II domains that are inserted in the middle of the catalytic domain, presumably to enhance substrate binding (1Allan J.A. Docherty A.J. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). MMP-9 also has a collagen type V-like domain located between the catalytic and the C-terminal hemopexin domain (Fig. 1). All but two MMPs (MMP-7 and MMP-26) contain a regulatory subunit, the hemopexin domain, separated from the catalytic domain by a variable hinge region (2de Coignac A.B. Elson G. Delneste Y.

This domain is thought to confer much of the substrate specificity to the MMPs (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E.

The hinge region also confers specificity to the MMPs either by direct binding of the substrate or by setting the orientation of the hemopexin domain and the catalytic domain (6Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Smith B. Tschesche H. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hemopexin domain of MMP-2 is known to bind heparin (7Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Heparin has been shown to potentiate the activities of some MMPs, and MMPs are often found associated with heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface (8Yu W.H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4183-4191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure of the hemopexin domain is a four-bladed propeller with a calcium binding site nestled in the folds (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F.

A fragment of MMP-2, which comprises the C-terminal hemopexin domain, has been shown to inhibit MMP-2 activity by preventing enzyme binding to αvβ3 integrin and blocks cell surface collagenolytic activity (9Brooks P.C.

Dancewicz A. Przegl Lek. 1974; 31: 435-439PubMed Google Scholar), MMP-9 has been implicated in the degradation of the extracellular matrix in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. MMP-9 is important for the migration of different cell types (e.g. leukocytes and cancer cells) because of its ability to degrade basement membranes and components of the extracellular matrix such as collagens, elastin, and aggrecan. MMP-9 is present in large amounts in the granules of neutrophils and plays an important role in inflammation diseases (11Dubois B. Masure S. Hurtenbach U. Paemen L. Heremans H van den Oord J. Sciot R. Meinhardt T. Hammerling G. Opdenakker G. Arnold B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tumor cells themselves induce MMP-9 production in the neighboring cells and use MMP-9 for their migration when becoming invasive and metastatic (12Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar,13Roeb E. Dietrich C.G. Winograd R. Arndt M. Breuer B. Fass J. Schumpelick V. Matern S. Cancer. 2001; 92: 2680-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-9 is important for the formation of new blood vessels essential for tumor growth and triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis (14Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G., Vu, T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is also responsible for the processing of cytokines, e.g. pro-interleukin-1β and pro-tumor necrosis factor-α into their active forms (15Gearing A.J.H. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H. Galloway W.A. Gilbert R. Gordon J.L. Leber T.M. Mangan M. Miller K. Nayee P. Owen K. Patel S. Thomas W. Wells G. Wood L.M. Woolley K.

In hepatocellular carcinomas the expression of MMP-9 is correlated with local tumor growth, invasion, and intrahepatic metastases (17Sakamoto Y. Mafune K. Mori M. Shiraishi T. Imamura H. Mori M. Takayama T. Makuuchi M. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar).Furthermore, MMPs participate in cell migration (18Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and may be expressed on the surface of cells, thus allowing for localized proteolysis (19Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 20Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is necessary for the migration of Langerhans cells, on which it is expressed on the cell surface, and can be inhibited by a broad spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (21Ratzinger G. Stoitzner P. Ebner S Lutz M.B. Layton G.T. Rainer C. Senior R.M. Shipley J.M. Fritsch P. Schuler G. Romani N. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).In the present work we demonstrate that MMP-9 activity (in gelatin zymography) can be inhibited by a recombinant MMP-9 hemopexin (PEX) domain. Because this construct lacks the known gelatin binding region of MMP-9, i.e. the fibronectin type II domain T2HU-2 within the catalytic domain, we assumed a second gelatin binding domain to be present within the MMP-9 hemopexin domain. We demonstrate a high affinity binding between MMP-9-PEX and gelatin. Furthermore, we show that MMP-9-PEX inhibits the migration of MMP-9-expressing melanoma cells.DISCUSSIONReported here is the gelatin binding property of the C-terminal hemopexin domain of murine gelatinase B, the first such report for any of the MMPs.

Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) described the crystal structure of porcine synovial collagenase (MMP-1) consisting of a catalytic domain and a second domain of ∼200 amino acids homologous to hemopexin, a heme-binding glycoprotein. The MMP-1 hemopexin domain contains four units of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets stabilized on its 4-fold axis by a cation (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The domain constitutes a four-bladed β-propeller structure and was assumed to control the specificity of MMPs, affecting both substrate and inhibitor binding (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Two cysteines at either end are conserved in all hemopexin domains of the MMP family.Since 1992 it has been known that the gelatin binding of MMP-9 is mediated by the second fibronectin-type II domain (T2HU-2), although the presence of another gelatin binding site could not be excluded. Although T2HU-2 mediates binding, it is not the rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of gelatin by the enzyme (29Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A. Strongin A.Y. Birkedal-Hansen H. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6776-6781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Me2SO inhibits gelatin binding but not its degradation (29Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A. Strongin A.Y. Birkedal-Hansen H. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6776-6781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the hemopexin structure depends on the joining of the two cystein residues susceptible to Me2SO, this would suggest that Me2SO inhibits gelatin binding by destroying the hemopexin structure. Therefore, we postulated a second gelatin binding site within the MMP-9 hemopexin domain.To obtain high amounts of protein, the MMP-9 hemopexin domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. A short sequence of buffer amino acids at the N terminus of the protein (GIPETKKLM) was attributed to the cloning procedure and most probably does not influence the binding properties in a significant way. MMP-9 activity in gelatin zymography and the migration of MMP-9-producing tumor cells was not influenced by the peptide GIPETKKLM (Figs. 3 and5). The precise mass of the hemopexin domain, including the buffer amino acids, was measured to be 25,034 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 D), which is close to the estimated molecular mass. The difference of 42.58 Da compared with the theoretical mass of 24,991.42 Da (M + H+) might be explained by acetylation, a rather common phenomenon also observed for proteins from E. coli (30Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Dekker C. de Kruijff B. de Korte-Kool G. Kroon J. Gros P. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 237-242Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The difference between the experimental and theoretical mass of the protein is 0.55 Da, which is an acceptable error of the instrument. However there may also be differences due to oxidation reactions occurring somewhere in the protein. MMP-9-PEX contains three cysteines and two methionines, which may all be candidates to undergo oxidation. Immunoreactivity with two different polyclonal antibodies further verified the identity of the purified protein, and circular dichroism spectra indicated the correct folded protein. When the enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) reaction was allowed to proceed, a few bands of higher molecular weight turned up on the Western blots, which might represent cross-linked multimeric forms of the recombinant protein.Secondary structure analysis (28Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar) of the far UV CD spectrum reflects the β-sheet character of the protein (α-helix = 21%, β-sheet = 35%, turn = 17%). Inspection of the x-ray structures of the hemopexin domains of MMP-2 and MMP-13 revealed β-sheets only and no helical secondary structure (32Gohlke U. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Crabbe T. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Gomis-Ruth F.X. Gohlke U. Betz M. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The overestimation of the calculated α-helical content of the MMP-9-PEX is due to the negative band around 228 nm, which might originate from aromatic side chain contributions (34Sreerama N. Manning M.C. Powers M.E. Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10814-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).For MMP-2 it could already be shown that the C-terminal domain exhibits strong binding properties for fibronectin and heparin and that binding depends on the structural Ca2+ but not Zn2+ ion in this domain (7Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, the influence of the hemopexin domain on enzymatic activity was not tested. By gelatin zymography, an easily practicable in vitro assay to determine gelatinase activity, we demonstrated a reduction of MMP-9 activity as a consequence of the presence of recombinant MMP-9-PEX by 60–71%. A greater reduction in the case of smaller amounts of MMP-9 may be explained by reaching the nonlinear range of zymography and densitometry when loading high amounts like 1 ng of MMP-9 protein (Fig. 3, A and B).To explain a reduction of MMP-9 activity in the presence of recombinant MMP-9-PEX, we carried out a comprehensive study to determine the kinetic parameters for the binding of MMP-9-PEX to gelatin. By plasmon resonance, we measured a dissociation constant of K d= 2.64 × 10−8m. TheK d values of TIMP-1 for the MMP-9 latent and active species are 35 and 23.9 nm for the high affinity site (35Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). That means that the binding affinity of gelatin to MMP-9-PEX is as high as the binding of MMP-9 to TIMP-1. These results indicated that the association of MMP-9-PEX and gelatin was rather rapid (k on ∼3.8 × 105m−1 s−1). Furthermore, the dissociation of the complex was quite slow (k off∼10−2 s−1), resulting in a very effective binding. Collectively, these findings support the importance of the C-terminal domain of MMP-9 for an efficient binding to the substrate gelatin. Others (36Olson M.W. Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10672-10681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have also characterized the binding parameters of pro-MMP-9 and demonstrated that the proenzyme binds with high affinity (K d ∼20–30 nm) to the surface of a variety of cell types, and the K d values of the α2(IV) chain of collagen IV for pro-MMP-9 were calculated to be ∼45 nm. However, because a pro-MMP-9-TIMP-1 complex and MMP-9 binds to α2(IV), the authors suggested that neither the C-terminal (binds to TIMP-1) nor the N-terminal domain of MMP-9 (which is processed during activation) is directly involved in α2(IV) binding, but the domain was not identified further. From our results, we concluded that the C-terminal domain of MMP-9, although known to bind TIMP-1 with high affinity (35Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37O′Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J.P. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 21: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), is also able to bind to gelatin with a comparable high affinity.We extended our characterization of MMP-9-PEX with respect to its impact on cell migration and found that migration of malignant human melanoma cells (A375) was reduced in the presence of recombinant MMP-9-PEX (Fig. 5). Because MMP-9-PEX was able to inhibit the migration of MMP-9-expressing A375 cells but not of mesangial cells known to express MMP-2 (but no detectable amounts of MMP-9), we speculate that MMP-9-PEX interferes specifically with the MMP-9-dependent migration. MMP-9 is not crucial for only migration and metastasis but also for hematopoiesis. Recently, it has been published (38Heissig B. Hattori K. Dias S. Friedrich M. Ferris B. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Besmer P. Lyden D. Moore M.A. Werb Z. Rafii S. Cell. 2002; 109: 625-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) that recruitment of stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow requires MMP-9-mediated release of serum Kit ligand (sKitL). The relative deficiency of serum Kit ligand at baseline or after myelosuppression in MMP-9−/− mice strongly suggests that MMP-9 plays a physiological role in releasing sKitL, setting up the stage for hematopoietic reconstitution. Thus, inhibition of MMP-9 (e.g. by MMP-9-PEX) may provide a novel mechanism for regulating hematopoiesis in sKitL-dependent myeloproliferative disorders.We have presented MMP-9-PEX as an inhibitor of MMP-9 activity in vitro and in cell culture, which raises many questions and perspectives for further investigations. One important issue is the identification of the gelatin binding epitope within the MMP-9 hemopexin domain. In addition, the recombinant MMP-9-PEX offers the possibility for determining other substrate specificities. Another important question relates to the effects of MMP-9-PEX in vivo. Because the catalytically inactive MMP-9-PEX binds with high affinity to gelatin, a substrate of MMP-9, we consider MMP-9-PEX as a candidate to antagonize MMP-9-activity in the context of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Recombinant MMP-9-PEX may be used as a new approach in the treatment of diseases with high MMP-9 activity such as melanomas or colorectal carcinomas. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 are a family of zinc metallo-endopeptidases secreted by cells. They are responsible for most of the turnover of matrix components. The MMPs are produced as zymogens with a signal sequence and propeptide segment that has to be removed during activation. The propeptide domain contains a conserved cysteine that chelates the zinc in the active site. The gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 contain fibronectin type II domains that are inserted in the middle of the catalytic domain, presumably to enhance substrate binding (1Allan J.A. Docherty A.J. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). MMP-9 also has a collagen type V-like domain located between the catalytic and the C-terminal hemopexin domain (Fig. 1). All but two MMPs (MMP-7 and MMP-26) contain a regulatory subunit, the hemopexin domain, separated from the catalytic domain by a variable hinge region (2de Coignac A.B. Elson G. Delneste Y. Magistrelli G. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Berthier O. Schmitt D. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3323-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This domain is thought to confer much of the substrate specificity to the MMPs (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hinge region also confers specificity to the MMPs either by direct binding of the substrate or by setting the orientation of the hemopexin domain and the catalytic domain (6Knäuper V. Docherty A.J. Smith B. Tschesche H. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The hemopexin domain of MMP-2 is known to bind heparin (7Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Heparin has been shown to potentiate the activities of some MMPs, and MMPs are often found associated with heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface (8Yu W.H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4183-4191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure of the hemopexin domain is a four-bladed propeller with a calcium binding site nestled in the folds (3Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A fragment of MMP-2, which comprises the C-terminal hemopexin domain, has been shown to inhibit MMP-2 activity by preventing enzyme binding to αvβ3 integrin and blocks cell surface collagenolytic activity (9Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Since its discovery in 1974 (10Sopata I. Dancewicz A. Przegl Lek. 1974; 31: 435-439PubMed Google Scholar), MMP-9 has been implicated in the degradation of the extracellular matrix in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. MMP-9 is important for the migration of different cell types (e.g. leukocytes and cancer cells) because of its ability to degrade basement membranes and components of the extracellular matrix such as collagens, elastin, and aggrecan. MMP-9 is present in large amounts in the granules of neutrophils and plays an important role in inflammation diseases (11Dubois B. Masure S. Hurtenbach U. Paemen L. Heremans H van den Oord J. Sciot R. Meinhardt T. Hammerling G. Opdenakker G. Arnold B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tumor cells themselves induce MMP-9 production in the neighboring cells and use MMP-9 for their migration when becoming invasive and metastatic (12Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar,13Roeb E. Dietrich C.G. Winograd R. Arndt M. Breuer B. Fass J. Schumpelick V. Matern S. Cancer. 2001; 92: 2680-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-9 is important for the formation of new blood vessels essential for tumor growth and triggers the angiogenic switch during carcinogenesis (14Bergers G. Brekken R. McMahon G., Vu, T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is also responsible for the processing of cytokines, e.g. pro-interleukin-1β and pro-tumor necrosis factor-α into their active forms (15Gearing A.J.H. Beckett P. Christodoulou M. Churchill M. Clements J. Davidson A.H. Drummond A.H. Galloway W.A. Gilbert R. Gordon J.L. Leber T.M. Mangan M. Miller K. Nayee P. Owen K. Patel S. Thomas W. Wells G. Wood L.M. Woolley K.

In hepatocellular carcinomas the expression of MMP-9 is correlated with local tumor growth, invasion, and intrahepatic metastases (17Sakamoto Y. Mafune K. Mori M. Shiraishi T. Imamura H. Mori M. Takayama T. Makuuchi M. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MMPs participate in cell migration (18Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and may be expressed on the surface of cells, thus allowing for localized proteolysis (19Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar, 20Murphy G. Gavrilovic J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is necessary for the migration of Langerhans cells, on which it is expressed on the cell surface, and can be inhibited by a broad spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (21Ratzinger G. Stoitzner P. Ebner S Lutz M.B. Layton G.T. Rainer C. Senior R.M. Shipley J.M. Fritsch P. Schuler G. Romani N. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that MMP-9 activity (in gelatin zymography) can be inhibited by a recombinant MMP-9 hemopexin (PEX) domain. Because this construct lacks the known gelatin binding region of MMP-9, i.e. the fibronectin type II domain T2HU-2 within the catalytic domain, we assumed a second gelatin binding domain to be present within the MMP-9 hemopexin domain. We demonstrate a high affinity binding between MMP-9-PEX and gelatin. Furthermore, we show that MMP-9-PEX inhibits the migration of MMP-9-expressing melanoma cells.

The interaction between SOX9 and Lc-Maf was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, which mapped the interacting domain of SOX9 to the high mobility group box DNA binding domain and that of Lc-Maf to the basic leucine zipper motif.

Tracella S. Dozin B. Quarto R. Robino G. Cancedda R. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These mesenchymal condensations prefigure the shape of the cartilages that are the models for endochondral bone formation. Whereas the cells in the center of the condensations differentiate into mature chondrocytes, the more peripheral cells form a layer of cells that becomes the perichondrium. In the epiphyseal growth plate of endochondral bones, chondrocytes undergo a unidirectional proliferation that is mainly responsible for the longitudinal growth of bones and then change their genetic program and become hypertrophic. Several cytokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix components, and transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in discrete stages of chondrogenesis (2Cancedda R. Descalzi C.F.

Sox9 is a typical transcription factor containing a high mobility group (HMG)1-box DNA binding domain and a potent transcription activation domain. Heterozygous mutations of SOX9 in humans cause campomelic dysplasia, a disease characterized by hypoplasia of most endochondral bones and often associated with sex reversal (5Houston C.S. Opitz J.M.

More importantly, Sox9 null mutant cells in mouse embryo chimeras were excluded from mesenchymal condensations and failed to express Col2a1 and other chondrocyte-specific marker genes such as Col9a2, Col11a2, and aggrecan, indicating that Sox9 is required for mesenchymal condensations and subsequent cartilage formation (10Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Heterozygous Sox9 mutant mice phenocopy the skeletal anomalies of patients with campomelic dysplasia. Histological analysis of these heterozygous mutant mice indicated that Sox9 haploinsufficiency results in defective cartilage primordia and premature skeletal mineralization. These results suggested the hypothesis that both mesenchymal condensations of cartilage primordia and the rate of transition of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes were sensitive to Sox9 dosage (11Bi W Huang W. Whitworth D.J. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6698-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Recently, we also showed that phosphorylation of SOX9 by protein kinase A increased its DNA binding and transcriptional activities (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The levels of phosphorylated Sox9 in the growth plate were shown to be highest in the prehypertropic chondrocytes, the same area where parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor is expressed at high levels. Because parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein also increased the transcriptional activity of SOX9 in DNA transfection experiments, it was suggested that Sox9 may mediate some of the effects of parathyroid hormone-related protein in regulating the transition from proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes (13Huang W. Chung U. Kronenberg H.M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sox9 binds to specific sequences in enhancers or promoters of several chondrocyte-specific genes and activates these DNA segments in reporter constructions (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopically expressed SOX9 activates one of these genes, the endogenousCol2a1 gene, in some noncartilaginous sites in transgenic mice (15Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Whearley S.C., Ng, L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Sox9 and Col2a1 are co-expressed in all chondrocyte precursors and chondrocytes but are not expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes (16Ng L-J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E.O. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 17Zhao Q. Eberspaecher H. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Two other members of the Sox family, a new long form of Sox5 (L-Sox5) and Sox6, were identified in chondrocytes and shown to be co-expressed with Sox9 during chondrogenesis (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The three Sox proteins cooperated to activate expression of the Col2a1 and aggrecan genesin vitro (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Whereas Sox5- andSox6-null mutants had only mild skeletal abnormalities,Sox5, Sox6 double null mutants showed a very severe chondrodysplasia characterized by an almost complete absence of cartilage (19Smits P., Li, P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 2: 277-27290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (483) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with Sox9 during chondrogenesis, we used a yeast two-hybrid method consisting of a modified son of sevenless (SOS) recruitment system (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) to screen a chondrocyte cDNA library. One of the cDNAs coded for a new long form of c-Maf (Lc-Maf) that interacted specifically with SOX9. c-Maf is a proto-oncoprotein with a basic leucine zipper (bZip) motif (21Kurschner N. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and belongs to a distinct subgroup of the bZip family of transcription factors (22Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). c-Maf and related proteins such as MafB and NF-AT play important roles in several developmental and cell differentiation processes (23Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). c-Maf forms both homodimers and heterodimers with other Maf family members and with AP-1 family proteins (24Hodge M.R. Chun H.J. Rengarajan J. Alt A. Lieberson R. Glimcher L.H. Science. 1996; 274: 1903-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It also interacts with other transcription factors that either enhance (25Kurschner N. Morgan J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or inhibit its transcriptional activity (26Hedge S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a Maf consensus DNA binding sequence was identified by in vitro site selection (28Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), interaction of c-Maf with other proteins usually changes its binding specificity, hence producing a diversity of regulatory elements in different target genes. We show here that Lc-Maf, which has an extra 10 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of c-Maf, interacted directly with SOX9. Lc-Maf andSox9 were co-expressed during mesenchymal condensations, synergistically activated a Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer, and increased expression of the endogenous Col2a1gene. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Lc-Maf and its interaction with SOX9 may play an important role during mesenchymal condensations, a critical step in chondrogenesis. The construction of a primary chondrocyte cDNA library and SOS recruitment system library screening were performed as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). One of the positive clones, which encoded the full-length Lc-Maf cDNA, was cotransformed with either the empty vector or pADNS-cJun-SOS or pADNS-SOS-SOX9 plasmid. The cotransformed cells were plated on glucose or galactose plates to test the specificity of interactions as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Total RNA extraction and Northern hybridization were performed as described previously (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Lc-Maf probe used was a 700-bp fragment cleaved by ApaI andEcoRI from the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of a cDNA clone encoding the full-length Lc-Maf cDNA. Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fifteen micrograms of each RNA sample was eletrophoresed, and Northern hybridization with aCol2a1-specific probe was performed as described previously (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was striped and rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion, Austin, TX) as loading control. Full-length and deleted constructs of SOX9 and Lc-Maf were labeled with [35S]methionine and generated by in vitrotranscription-translation with the single-tube TNT protein system (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids for SOX9 and Lc-Maf containing a FLAG tag sequence at its N terminus. Twenty-five microliters of cell lysates was incubated with 15 μl of affinity-purified SOX9 antibody, SOX9 preimmune serum, or c-Maf antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which also recognizes Lc-Maf, in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 3 h at 4 °C. Then 2.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) resin was added in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 4 °C for another 2 h, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of incubation buffer. The resin was then boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, electrophoresed in an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Western blotting was performed as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) with either mouse FLAG m2 antibody (Sigma) or rabbit SOX9 antibody diluted 1:1000. GST-SOX9 and GST-Lc-Maf were expressed and purified according to the method described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Two microliters of 35S-labeled wild- type SOX9 or SOX9 deletions was incubated with 500 ng of either GST or GST-Lc-Maf in an interaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature; 20 μl of glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma) that had been washed three times in interaction buffer was then added in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 4 °C for another 30 min, the resin was washed three times with 500 μl of the incubation buffer. The resin was then boiled in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and run on an SDS-10 or 15% polyacrylamide gel, which was then dried and autoradiographed. A parallel SDS-polyacrylamide gel loaded directly with 2 μl of each labeled protein sample was run as the loading control and analyzed in the same manner. 35S-Labeled wild type Lc-Maf and Lc-Maf deletions with GST or GST-SOX9 were incubated in the same manner. The R2 18-bpCol2a1 enhancer probe was described previously (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant R1 20-bp probes containing 2-bp mutations were prepared by annealing the upper and lower chains of nucleic acid fragments synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA) with overhanging 5′-endBamHI restriction sites. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP as described previously (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two microliters of Lc-Maf, generated by in vitro transcription-translation, was incubated with these probes in DNA binding buffer as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The samples were then fractionated by electrophoresis through a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 150 V for 3 h, and the gel was autoradiographed. COS-7 cells were cultured as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The cells were then transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing an 89-bp Col2a1promoter without (p89Luc) or with four copies of a 48-bp (4×48-p89Luc) or two copies of a 100-bp (2×100-p89Luc) Col2a1 enhancer element and the plasmid pSV2-β-gal as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The reporter plasmids and pSV2-β-gal were transfected in a ratio of 3:1 as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for SOX9 (100 ng) and different c-Maf plasmids (including c-Maf, Lc-Maf, and the Lc-maf deletion mutant, Lc-Maf⁁TA, each 100 ng) were transfected by using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed in cell lysates prepared as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Reporter activities were reported as the average of triplicate cultures in one of several representative experiments as previously described (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The Lc-Maf probe was the same as that we used for Northern hybridization. The preparation of probes for Lc-Maf, Sox9, and Col2a1was described previously (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of mouse embryo sections at different developmental stages was performed as described previously (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Full-length SOX9 and the deletion N9-304 were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, full-length SOX9 was cloned into GEX4T3 (AmershamBiosciences). All other SOX9 deletions were generated either by one-step PCR (N9-400, C9-304, N9-199, N9-HMG, N9-104) or by a two-step PCR (F9⁁PQA) as described previously (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). All deletions were inserted into pcDNA 3.1 between the BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites. Full-length cDNAs of c-Maf in pBluescript and c-Maf⁁TA in pT7βplink were a gift from Dr. James I. Morgan. c-Maf was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector between theHindIII and XbaI restriction sites, and c-Maf⁁TA released by EcoRI and SpeI digestion was subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 between the EcoRI andXbaI sites. An XhoI fragment from a cDNA encoding the full-length Lc-Maf was inserted into the XhoI restriction site in pcDNA 3.1-c-Maf to generate pcDNA 3.1-Lc-Maf and in pcDNA 3.1-c-Maf⁁TA to generate pcDNA 3.1-Lc-Maf⁁TA. Lc-Maf-N and Lc-Maf-C were generated by PCR amplification and then inserted into pcDNA 3.1 plasmid in the same manner as described for the SOX9 deletions. pcDNA 3.1-FLAG-Lc-Maf and GEX4T3-Lc-Maf were constructed by inserting a PCR fragment that includes the full-length coding region of Lc-Maf between theBamHI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA 3.1-FLAG (14Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GEX4T3 in the same manner as described for SOX9 deletions. All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. Using the full-length human SOX9 as bait, we screened a primary chondrocyte cDNA library by the using SOS recruitment system as described previously (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We obtained two independent cDNA clones encoding c-Maf. One of these contained the entire coding sequence of a new isoform of c-Maf, designated here as Lc-Maf. We used this clone to test specific interaction with Sox9 (Fig. 1 A). Rescue of the growth ofcdc25–2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells on galactose at high temperature only occurred upon cotransformation of both SOS-SOX9 and Lc-Maf plasmids, indicating that there is a specific interaction between Lc-Maf and SOX9. The Lc-Maf cDNA had 5′-untranslated and coding regions identical to the previously identified mouse c-Maf (21Kurschner N. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but had an extra 10 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus and contained a completely different 3′-UTR (Fig. 1 B). Protein alignment of the last 10 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of Lc-Maf with those of a similar long form of chicken c-Maf (GenBankTMD28598) and v-Maf (29De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C) revealed that they were highly conserved. c-Maf and Lc-Maf probably result from differential splicing of a single gene. To investigate the RNA expression pattern of Lc-Maf, we used a 700-bp fragment from the 3′-UTR of Lc-Maf as a probe and performed a Northern hybridization of RNA from various cell lines, including chondrocytes, and various tissues from newborn mice (Fig. 2). The 4.5-kb Lc-Maf RNA was expressed strongly in primary chondrocytes, less in MC615 mouse immortalized chondrocytes, and even less in 10T1/2 fibroblasts, which express low levels of Sox9 and Col2a1. Lc-Maf transcripts were also present in EL4 lymphoma cells. Lc-Maf RNA was highly expressed in brain, skin, intestine, and kidney but at only very low levels or not at all in spleen, heart, testis, and tongue. Therefore, although Lc-Maf was widely expressed, it is not a ubiquitous factor. To confirm the interaction between Lc-Maf and SOX9, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with Sox9 and an Lc-Maf expression plasmid containing an in-frame FLAG tag sequence at its N terminus and performed a co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3, A andB, Lc-Maf and SOX9 were efficiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Lysates of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with a SOX9 antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG m2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 C, only the cell lysates cotransfected with SOX9 and Lc-Maf contained an immunoprecipitated polypeptide the size of FLAG-Lc-Maf. Next, we tested whether c-Maf antibody could also co-immunoprecipitate SOX9 in transfected COS-7 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3 D, SOX9 was co-immunoprecipitated with c-Maf antibody but not with Sox5 antibody. To identify the interacting domains in SOX9 and Lc-Maf, we generated various deletions of SOX9 (Fig. 4 A) and Lc-Maf (Fig. 4 C). All deletions were labeled with [35S]methionine by using an in vitrotranscription-translation reaction. A GST pull-down assay was performed by incubating purified GST or GST-Lc-Maf with full-length SOX9 or with various deletions of SOX9. GST did not pull down either full-length SOX9 (Fig. 4 B, lane 0) or any SOX9 deletions (data not shown). All SOX9 constructions containing the HMG-box DNA binding domain were pulled down by GST-Lc-Maf (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–4 and 6). A deletion construct containing the N terminus of SOX9 (lane 8) and a deletion containing the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of SOX9 (lane 5) could not be pulled down, indicating that the HMG-box DNA binding domain of SOX9 mediated the interaction with Lc-Maf. Likewise, GST-SOX9 pulled down both the full-length Lc-Maf and truncated Lc-Mafs without the N-terminal activation domain or a small segment of Lc-Maf containing the bZip motif (Fig. 4 D, lanes 1,2, and 4). In contrast, a truncated Lc-Maf lacking only the carboxyl-terminal part of the bZip domain was not pulled down by GST-SOX9 (Fig. 4 D, lane 3), indicating that the bZip domain of Lc-Maf is the interacting motif. Previously SOX9 was shown to bind strongly to an HMG-related sequence at the 3′-end of the 48-bpCol2a1 enhancer element (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). However, no binding of Lc-Maf was observed by using an 18-bp segment at the 3′-end of this 48-bp segment (R2) to which SOX9 binds strongly (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, Lc-Maf bound to a 20-bp fragment containing the 5′ region of the 48-bp element (R1) (Fig. 5 B). The sequence GGCTCTG, which is only 1 nucleotide different from the sequence GGCTCAG, which was previously found to be a binding site for c-Maf in the L7 Purkinje neuron-specific promoter (21Kurschner N. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was present in this 20-bp Col2a1 segment. To narrow down the Lc-Maf binding sequence in the 48-bp element, we generated a series of 2-bp mutations shown in Fig. 5 A. These mutated R1 probes (M5, M6, and M7), bound Lc-Maf much more weakly, suggesting that the GGCTCTG sequence is important for Lc-Maf binding. To test the functional relevance of the interaction between Lc-Maf and SOX9, we cotransfected the of Lc-Maf and SOX9 expression plasmids into COS-7 cells to test whether they cooperated in activating reporter plasmids containing four copies of a 48-bp or two copies of a 100-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have observed previously that SOX9 strongly activates the 4 × 48-bp Col2a1 reporter (12Huang W. Zhou X. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In comparison, the effect of Lc-Maf was more moderate (Fig. 6 A). Coexpression of Lc-Maf and SOX9 produced more than an additive activation of the 4 × 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer (Fig. 6 A). This synergism was also observed with the 2 × 100-bp Col2a1 enhancer, which Lc-Maf activated as strongly as SOX9 did, suggesting that Lc-Maf itself is a strong activator of this Col2a1-specific enhancer (Fig. 6 B). Cotransfection of Lc-Maf and SOX9 produced 3 times more activation than did each plasmid alone. This joint activation was not observed with SOX9 and Lc-Maf⁁TA, a truncated Lc-Maf without the transcription activation domain (Fig. 6 A), or with Lc-Maf and L-Sox5 (data not shown). The specificity of Lc-Maf activation of the Col2a1 enhancer was further demonstrated by the lack of response of M7, a mutant 48-bpCol2a1 enhancer containing a 2-bp point mutation in the Lc-Maf binding site (Fig. 6 C). As shown in Fig. 5 B, M7 decreased the binding of Lc-Maf. Moreover, with mutant enhancers containing either a 2-bp mutation located between the Lc-Maf and SOX9 binding sites or a 2-bp mutation in the SOX9 binding site, activation by Lc-Maf was unchanged. These experiments suggested that DNA binding was required for the activation by Lc-Maf of thisCol2a1 enhancer. These results indicated that Lc-Maf was a potent activator of a Col2a1-specific enhancer and that Lc-Maf cooperated with SOX9 to activate this enhancer more strongly. We next tested whether coexpression of Lc-Maf and SOX9 increased transcription of the endogenous Col2a1 gene. Transfection of either SOX9 (Fig. 7, lanes 2) or Lc-Maf (Fig. 7, lanes 3) expression plasmids alone into 10T1/2 cells, which express low levels of Col2a1, produced almost no increase of this transcript. However, cotransfection of Lc-Maf and SOX9 produced significantly more Col2a1 RNA (Fig. 7, lanes 4), suggesting that Lc-Maf and SOX9 cooperate, in accord with the previous transient transfection experiments. Similar results were obtained with MC615 cells (Fig. 7,lanes 5–8), in which expression of the endogenous Col2a1 is low after repeated passages in culture. These results strongly suggest that Lc-Maf and SOX9 cooperatively activate the endogenous Col2a1 gene. To better understand the physiological significance of the interactions between SOX9 and Lc-Maf, we performedin situ hybridizations with sections from mouse embryos at various developmental stages by using probes specific forLc-Maf, Sox9, and Col2a1. As shown in Fig. 8, Lc-Maf,Sox9, and Col2a1 were coexpressed in cartilaginous primordia during mesenchymal condensation between embryonic days 10.5 and 12.5 (E10.5 and E12.5), including the first and second branchial arches (Fig. 8 A), forelimb and hind limb buds (Fig. 8 A), vertebrae (Fig. 8 B), and Meckel's cartilage and nose (Fig. 8 C). In E13.5 embryos, expression of Lc-Maf was strong in the perichondrium, whereas Sox9 was strongly expressed in the center of the condensations, where cells undergo overt chondrocyte differentiation (Fig. 8 D). This suggests that Lc-Maf and the interaction between Lc-Maf and Sox9 may play a role in chondrogenesis, mainly during mesenchymal condensations. Using a modified yeast two-hybrid system to screen for polypeptides interacting with SOX9, we identified a new long form of c-Maf (Lc-Maf). Lc-Maf had 10 extra amino acids at the carboxyl terminus and a completely different 3′-untranslated region. A similar long form of c-Maf was identified in chickens as a differential splicing product (GenBankTMD28598), suggesting that the mouse Lc-Maf may be derived by the same mechanism. The functional difference between the short and long forms of c-Maf is still unknown. Very similar Northern and in situ hybridization patterns were observed by using 3′-UTR probes specific for either the short form of c-Maf or for Lc-Maf (data not shown), suggesting that these isoforms may have redundant functions. In transient transfection experiments, the short form of c-Maf also cooperated with SOX9 to synergistically activate the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer element, although to a lesser degree than did Lc-Maf. Furthermore, that v-Maf also has a similar extra 10 amino acids suggests that v-Maf may be derived from Lc-Maf instead of c-Maf. The interaction between Lc-Maf and SOX9 was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. The GST pull-down assays not only further supported the direct interaction between SOX9 and Lc-Maf but also mapped the interacting segments to the HMG-box DNA binding domain of SOX9 and the bZip motif of Lc-Maf. These domains were also found to be used in the interactions of these proteins with other transcription factors. For example, the HMG DNA binding domain of SOX9 interacts with SF-1 (29De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and the bZip motif of MafB interacts with the DNA binding domain of Ets-1 (30Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The Lc-Maf binding sequence in the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer element is not the typical Maf recognition element, which was determined by in vitro site selection (27Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not yet determined whether interaction of Lc-Maf with Sox9 and perhaps other proteins increases its affinity for the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer. Although Lc-Maf alone efficiently activated a Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer in transient transfection experiments, cotransfection of Lc-Maf with SOX9 resulted in activation that was more than additive, suggesting that there is a synergistic cooperation between these two factors. This was further confirmed in a Northern hybridization experiment showing an increased expression of endogenous Col2a1 when expression vectors for these two factors were cotransfected. However, forced expression of Lc-Maf and SOX9 in other fibroblasts in which theCol2a1 gene was silent failed to induce Col2a1expression. It is possible that in these cells other factors or coactivators may be needed to switch on the Col2a1 gene. To investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction between Lc-Maf and Sox9, we performed a detailed in situhybridization using mouse embryo sections from different developmental stages. During chondrogenesis, Lc-Maf was coexpressed withSox9 and Col2a1 in all areas of mesenchymal condensations, but after E13.5, when overt differentiation of chondrocytes occurs, expression of Lc-Maf was restricted to the perichondrium. We conclude that Lc-Maf and Sox9 may interact during chondrogenic mesenchymal condensation. After condensation, when cells overtly differentiate into chondrocytes, Lc-Maf expression was shut off, whereas the levels of Sox9, L-Sox5, and Sox6 remained high or increased. It should be noted that the studies that showed interactions between Lc-Maf and Sox9 were performed in COS-7 cells, which are not the same cells in mesenchymal condensations, where these interactions are believed to occur. The conclusions of this study have thus to be qualified by this limitation. Sox9 was previously shown to be required for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation (10Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Besides being expressed in chondrogenic tissues, Sox9 is also expressed in the notochord, central nervous system, heart, kidney, pancreas, genital ridges, early undifferentiated gonads, and Sertoli cells (31Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Patients with campomelic dysplasia have other anomalies, including sex reversal and occasionally heart and kidney defects in addition to hypoplasia of endochondral bones. This suggests that Sox9 has additional roles in development other than chondrogenesis. An attractive hypothesis to account for its multiple functions is that Sox9 interacts with different transcription factors during organogenesis of different organs. For example, Sox9 and steroidogenic factor 1 were shown to interact in Sertoli cells and to regulate transcription of the human anti-Mullerian hormone gene (29De Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Sudbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). L-Sox5 and Sox6, the genes for two other Sox proteins that belong to a different subfamily, are coexpressed with Sox9 during chondrogenesis. Although individual L-Sox5 and Sox6 mutants have relatively mild effects, L-Sox5-Sox6 double mutants have very severe chondrodysplasia and are characterized by an almost complete absence of cartilage. In these mice, chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations occur normally, but cells in the condensations are unable to differentiate into chondrocytes and to express the high level of cartilage extracellular matrix genes that are characteristic of chondrocytes (19Smits P., Li, P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 2: 277-27290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition to the Sox9 binding site, the 48-bpCol2a1 enhancer contains three HMG-box binding sites to which L-Sox5 and Sox6 presumably bind. Mutations in two of these sites outside the Sox9 binding site abolished enhancer activity in vivo. The Lc-Maf binding site overlaps with one of these additional HMG binding sites but not with that for Sox9 (18Lefebvre V., Li, P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The levels of L-Sox5 and Sox6 are relatively lower during mesenchymal condensations than at later stages of chondrogenesis. A binding competition assay showed that Lc-Maf competes with L-Sox5 to bind the 48-bp Col2a1 enhancer element (data not shown). Because thein situ hybridization results showed co-expression ofLc-Maf with Sox9 and Col2a1 RNAs during chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations, we propose that Lc-Maf may inhibit binding of L-Sox5 and Sox6 to the Col2a1enhancer and similar enhancers in other chondrocyte genes during this early stage of chondrogenesis. After condensation, Lc-Maf was strongly expressed in the perichondrium but is no longer expressed in chondrocytes, in which L-Sox5, Sox6, and Sox9 are strongly expressed. Thus, Lc-Maf, L-Sox5, and Sox6 may function at different steps of chondrogenesis. We hypothesize that Lc-Maf cooperates with Sox9 to activate Col2a1 and perhaps other genes needed for chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations, whereas L-Sox5 and Sox6 would function together with Sox9, mainly at a subsequent step during overt chondrocyte differentiation when cartilage extracellular matrix genes are strongly expressed.

In plants SCF-dependent proteolysis is also involved in different developmental and hormonal regulations. To further investigate the function of SCF, we characterized at the molecular level the Arabidopsis RING-H2 finger protein AtRbx1. We demonstrated that the plant gene is able to functionally complement a yeast knockout mutant strain and showed that AtRbx1 protein interacts physically with at least two members of theArabidopsis cullin family (AtCul1 and AtCul4). AtRbx1 also associates with AtCul1 and the Arabidopsis SKP1-related proteins in planta, indicating that it is part of plant SCF complexes. AtRbx1 mRNAs accumulate in various tissues of the plant, but at higher levels in tissues containing actively dividing cells. Finally to study the function of the gene in planta, we either overexpressed AtRbx1 or reduced its expression by a dsRNA strategy. Down-regulation of AtRbx1impaired seedling growth and development, indicating that the gene is essential in plants. Furthermore, the AtRbx1-silenced plants showed a reduced level of AtCul1 protein, but accumulated higher level of cyclin D3.

The SCF complex(es) (named after the three original yeast protein subunits: Skp1, Cdc53 (cullin), andF-box proteins) belong to a class of ubiquitin ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3)) 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Dex, dexamethasone; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GUS, β-glucuronidase; PTGS, post-transcriptional gene silencing required for the degradation of key regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle progression, development, and signal transduction (reviewed in Refs.1Patton E.

The F-box proteins are thought to be the adapter subunits that recruit specifically substrates to the core ubiquitylation complex through physical interaction between the F-box domain and the Skp1 subunit (4Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). For instance in budding yeast, the F-box protein Grr1p recruits the G1 cyclins Cln1p and Cln2p via its leucine-rich repeats, whereas the Cdc4p F-box protein interacts with the Sic1p protein by WD40 repeats, leading to SCF-dependent ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the target substrates. In animal cells, SCF-dependent ubiquitylation also regulates the turnover of a number of cell cycle regulators and signaling proteins. The F-box protein SKP2 is involved in the turnover of the transcription factor E2F-1 (5Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (6Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

The Rbx1 protein belongs to the ring finger domain RING-H2 protein family and plays a key function in stimulating the ubiquitylation reaction (reviewed in Ref. 16Tyers M. Jorgensen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The structure of the human quaternary SCFSkp2complex (Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1-F-boxSkp2) has recently been achieved (17Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed in which Cul1 is positioning the substrate via the F-box protein SKP2 in close proximity to the catalytic module consisting of Rbx1 and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Because Rbx1 interacts with both cullin and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, it may thus serve as an allosteric activator of the later. Cullin proteins are also covalently modified by an ubiquitin-related protein called Need8/Rub1 (18Hori T. Osaka F. Chiba T. Miyamoto C. Okabayashi K. Shimbara N. Kato S. Tanaka K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).

Developmental and/or physiological consequences of Rbx1 overexpression or depletion are poorly understood in higher eukaryotes. In plants genetic studies have highlighted the important function of F-box proteins in a number of developmental and physiological processes. Both auxin and jasmonate perception are controlled, at least in part, by SCF-like complexes involving the F-box proteins Tir1 and Coi1, respectively (Refs. 21Ruegger M. Dewey E. Gray W.M. Hobbie L.

Indeed, recently it was demonstrated that auxin stimulates the binding of the SCFTir1 to the AUX/IAA proteins leading to their degradation (26Gray W.M. Kepinski S. Rouse D. Leyser O. Estelle M.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggest that SCF-dependent ubiquitylation reactions are also involved in floral patterning, the regulation of circadian rhythm, phytochrome A-specific light signaling, natural and hormone-induced senescence processes, and defense responses to pathogen, respectively. Arabidopsis genome encodes almost 700 possible F-box proteins (34Gagne J.M. Downes B.P. Shiu S.H. Durski A.M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To further investigate the function of SCF in plants, we characterized at the molecular level AtRbx1 from Arabidopsis. We found that the AtRbx1 gene is able to functionally complement a yeast mutant strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AtRbx1 associates physically with at least two members of theArabidopsis cullin family (AtCul1 and AtCul4) and two SKP1-like proteins (ASK1 and ASK2). RNA gel blots were performed to study the expression of the AtRbx1 genes in various tissues of plants and after different stimuli. Finally, we used both inducible overexpression and dsRNA strategies to investigate the function of the gene in planta. Unless stated otherwise, all procedures for manipulating DNA and RNA were carried out according to Refs. 35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

To construct pTA::Rbx1, we used PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to introduce XhoI andBamH1 restriction sites upstream and downstream of the coding region of AtRbx1;1 using oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGGTACCTCGAGAATGGCGACACTAGACTCCGACGTTACCATGATTCC-3′ and oligonucleotide 5′-GACTAGTGACCATATTTCTGAAACTCCC-3′, respectively. For gene silencing, AtRbx1 antisense and sense coding sequences were separated by a spacer sequence consisting of the GFP coding sequence. Thus to construct pTA::dsRNA-Rbx1, aBamHI-SpeI GFP fragment, obtained by PCR, was first introduced in the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) resulting in plasmid pKS-GFP. AtRbx1 coding region was introduced in antisense orientation upstream from the GFP by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide 5′-ATCTAGCTCGAGTGCGGTGGTAACCAAATGAAC-3′ and oligonucleotide 5′-ACTAGTGAATTCGCGACACTAGACTCCGACGT-3′ and using theXhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. To introduce AtRbx1 coding region in sense orientation downstream the GFP, AtRbx1 sequence was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide 5′-TGATCATCTAGAGCGACACTAGACTCCGACGT-3′ and oligonucleotide 5′-TACGTTGAGCTCACTAGTTGCGGTGGTAACCAAATGAAC-3′, digested by XbaI and SacI, and introduced intoSpeI and SacI restriction sites, resulting in construct pKS::dsRNA-Rbx1. TheXhoI-SpeI DNA fragment, encoding the dsRNA-Rbx1 construct, was subcloned into the Dex-inducible vector pTA7002 (38Aoyama T. Chua N.H.

In vitro plants were grown onto Murashige and Skoog medium M0255 (Dushefa) supplemented with 1% sucrose (conditions used: 16-h day at 20 °C and 8-h night at 17 °C). Dex was directly added at a concentration of 1 μm to the medium or sprayed onto plants in solution at 10 μm (with 0.01% Tween 20).

For the dark to light transition,Arabidopsis plants were grown in vitro in complete darkness for 12 days, and then transferred to standard light condition and collected after 1, 3, and 8 h. For heat shock, 14-day-old Arabidopsis plants grown in vitrounder standard conditions were collected and incubated in sterile water either at 38 °C for the heat shock or at 22 °C for the control. After 90 min of treatment, plants were incubated in sterile water at 22 °C and collected 1 h later for RNA preparation. The leaf-strips experiments used to study AtRbx1 expression during re-initiation of cell division activity inArabidopsis have been described previously (42Genschik P. Jamet E. Philipps G.

Plant materials were fixed and post-fixed at 4 °C in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 0,1% OsO4 and embedded in LR WhiteTM resin (EMS, Fort Washington, PA; catalog no. 14380). 0.5-μm sections were prepared and stained with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue for morphological analysis or Lugol's reagent to check for starch accumulation. To visualize cotyledon epidermal cells, the cotyledon of 22-day post-germination seedlings of dsRNA-2 line were first cleared for chlorophyll by rinsing with ethanol (70–95%), than re-hydrated and finally incubated for 2 h in Hoyer's solution (chloral hydrate/gum arabic/glycerol/water (100:7.5:5:30 g)). Size and shape of cotyledon epidermal cells were analyzed by Nomarski optics on an E800 (Nikon) microscope and the images recorded with Sony DXC950 camera. Cell area measurements were performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain ImageJ program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

The integrity and the amount of RNA applied to each lane were verified by ethidium bromide staining and hybridization with a probe encoding the translation elongation factor 1-α (cDNA clone 232A19T7, gene At1g07920). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA (treated with the DNase A) extracted from different Arabidopsis organs were used for cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus Retro Transcriptase RNase H- (Promega) according to the recommendations of the supplier. To determine the expression of the two AtRbx1genes, PCR were performed using specific primers designed in the 3′-untranslated regions of both genes. For AtRbx1;1, a transcript of 269 nucleotides was amplified using primer 5′-CAGCAGATGGCTAAAGACTCGTCA-3′ and primer 5′-ACGTCACCCAAAGCACAACCATAA-3′, and for AtRbx1;2 a transcript of 135 nucleotides was expected using primer 5′-CAGCAGATGGCTAAAGACTCGTCA-3′ and primer 5′-ATCTGCATCAAAGACATCCCAAGAGAAGA-3′. The PCR reactions were conducted using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). To control the equal amount of matrix used for RT-PCR, a PCR, amplifying the constitutive expressed AtCul1 gene (45Shen W.H.

A transcript of 242 nucleotides was amplified using primer 5′-TGGCCTGACATGCTTCCGTGA-3′ and primer 5′-TCCAGCTTGATGCCTTGCGAGA-3′. All the PCR reactions were performed with an annealing temperature of 58 °C for 40 s. After 24 cycles of PCR, 20 μl of the reaction was run on an 2% agarose gel. The amplified DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and also transferred to a nylon membrane and probed with the corresponding random primed 32P-labeled probes.

The BamHI-EcoRI fragment was cloned into the pGEX-2KT vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysE. In the pGEX-2KT-Rbx1 construct, GST is placed in frame at the N terminus of the fusion protein. Low yield of the fusion protein was obtained after 4 h of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, but the fusion protein remained soluble and was thus purified in the native form under non-denaturing conditions on bulk glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The GST pull-down assays were performed with 4 μg of purified GST or GST-Rbx1 fusion protein fixed to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated during 3 h at 4 °C with 2.5 mg of total protein extracts prepared from 2-week-oldArabidopsis seedlings. After two washing steps with PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3), proteins were eluted with 1 ml of glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The eluted proteins were lyophilized overnight, suspended in PBS, and desalted with PlusOne mini dialysis kit (Amersham Biosciences). The Arabidopsis plants were homogenized using pestle and mortar in extraction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) with PolyClar AT (Serva) and quartz and centrifuged at 20,000 × g. The protein content was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Samples of 15 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A peptide containing the C-terminal sequence (CPLDNSEWEFQKYGH) of AtRbx1;1 was synthesized, linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier proteins, and used to immunize rabbits. The antiserum was diluted 1:1500 for Western blot analysis. To detect the AtCul1 protein, we used the purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul1 antibody (45Shen W.H. Parmentier Y. Hellmann H. Lechner L.

For protein loading control, we used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the PSTAIRE epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) at a dilution of 1: 1000. To detect themyc-tagged ASK1 or ASK2 proteins, we used the mycmonoclonal mouse antibody (9E10) purchased from the Berkeley Antibody Co., at a dilution of 1:1000. To detect ubiquitin-protein conjugates, we used a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody (catalog no. UG9510) purchased from Affinity Research Products Ltd. The antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000. To detect cyclin D3, we used a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the C-terminal peptide of the protein (47Healy J.M. Menges M. Doonan J.H. Murray J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7041-7047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:800. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dianova) and the ECL Western blot analysis system from Amersham Biosciences. Determination of the specificity of the antibodies was performed by competition experiments. In this case, the antibody was incubated for 3 h at room temperature without or with 1 μm antigen peptide before application to the membranes. 1 mg of total protein extracted from wild type plants or plants expressing either the myc-tagged ASK1 or ASK2 was incubated with 100 μl of the anti-myc affinity matrix (Berkeley Antibody Co.) for 6 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed five times with the protein extraction buffer and eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 3.0. Eluted proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE and used for Western blot analysis.

For rescue of the mutant strain, Arabidopsis AtRbx1 gene was fused to the Gal1 promoter into plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen). The MCY557 strain was transformed with either the empty pYES2 or the pYES2-AtRbx1 vectors, and Ura+ transformants were selected. Sporulated diploids were dissected. For the manipulation of these strains, we used the conditions described in Ref. 48Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar. The coding region ofAtRbx1;1 was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGTGACCATATTTCTGAAACT-3′ and oligonucleotide 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGCGACTCTAGACTCCGACGTTA-3′ as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, and subsequently cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector (Clontech), resulting in plasmid pGBKT7-AtRbx1.

The derived plasmids were sequenced to confirm the absence of errors from PCR amplification and the correct in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding and activation domains. All the pGBKT7 vectors (either empty or encoding RH2b or AtRbx1) were introduced into the yeast host haploid strain AH109, whereas all the pGADT7 vectors (either empty or encoding AtCul1 or AtCul4) were introduced into the yeast host haploid strain Y187. Y187 strain has a stronger promoter to drive lacZ expression than AH109. Interactions between the fusion proteins were assayed in the AH109/Y187 diploid strains according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Clontech). A. thaliana data base searches led to the identification of two different genes calledAtRbx1;1 and AtRbx1;2, located on chromosome 5 (At5g20570) and chromosome 3 (At3g42830), respectively. The sequence of the longest EST for AtRbx1;1 was determined, and it encodes an 118-amino acid open reading frame, which is complete at its N-terminal end as indicated by an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiation codon. AtRbx1;1 and the predicted AtRbx1;2 protein sequences exhibit 87% sequence identity. Both proteins are closely related to human Rbx1 protein (86% identity and over 91% similarity between AtRbx1;1 and HsRbx1 sequences). The plant sequences were aligned with yeast and different animal Rbx1 protein sequences (see Fig.1). All the residues proposed to form the zinc binding sites (50Chen A. Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Tan P.

Interestingly, bothArabidopsis proteins belong to the Roc1/Rbx1 subgroup and are more distant from the Roc2/Rbx2 proteins. rbx1 is an essential gene in yeast, and its inactivation arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S transition and results in the stabilization of different SCF substrates, like Sic1p and Cln2p (12Kamura T.

https://openalex.org/W2033945588,"Accumulating evidence suggests that receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, like the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), may be desensitized by serine/threonine kinases. One such kinase, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2), is known to mediate agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of multiple heptahelical receptors. In testing whether GRK2 could phosphorylate and desensitize the PDGFRβ, we first found by phosphoamino acid analysis that cells expressing GRK2 could serine-phosphorylate the PDGFRβ in an agonist-dependent manner. Augmentation or inhibition of GRK2 activity in cells, respectively, reduced or enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ but not the EGFR. Either overexpressed in cells or as a purified protein, GRK2 demonstrated agonist-promoted serine phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ and, unexpectedly, the EGFR as well. Because GRK2 did not phosphorylate a kinase-dead (K634R) PDGFRβ mutant, GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ phosphorylation required receptor tyrosine kinase activity, as does PDGFRβ ubiquitination. Agonist-induced ubiquitination of the PDGFRβ, but not the EGFR, was enhanced in cells overexpressing GRK2. Nevertheless, GRK2 overexpression did not augment PDGFRβ down-regulation. Like the vast majority of GRK2 substrates, the PDGFRβ, but not the EGFR, activated heterotrimeric G proteins allosterically in membranes from cells expressing physiologic protein levels. We conclude that GRK2 can phosphorylate and desensitize the PDGFRβ, perhaps through mechanisms related to receptor ubiquitination. Specificity of GRK2 for receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, expressed at physiologic levels, may be determined by the ability of these receptors to activate heterotrimeric G proteins, among other factors.

Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113Google Scholar). Like most receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, the PDGFRβ is thought to exist as a quiescent monomeric protein that, upon binding agonist, dimerizes and consequently phosphorylates itself and other proteins on Tyr residues (1Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113Google Scholar). The significance of regulating PDGFRβ Tyr kinase activity is highlighted by the receptor's critical role in embryonic development and in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative diseases like atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia subsequent to vascular injury (1Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113Google Scholar, 2Sano H. Sudo T. Yokode M. Murayama T. Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S.I. Kita T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Google Scholar, 5Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G.

Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Google Scholar), and, described most recently, phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ on serine residues (8Bioukar E.B. Marricco N.C. Zuo D. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21457-21463Google Scholar). In cells, the PDGFRβ Tyr kinase activity desensitizes or wanes with persistent exposure to PDGF (9Bernard A. Kazlauskas A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 704-712Google Scholar). Desensitization commonly occurs consequent to serine phosphorylation of heptahelical receptors that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins (10Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). In addition, serine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor (11Takayama S. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3440-3447Google Scholar) and EGFR (12Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Google Scholar) has been associated with receptor desensitization. The serine/threonine kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) phosphorylates and desensitizes a large number of heptahelical receptors (10Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). We found recently that overexpression of GRK2 could attenuate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, [3H]thymidine incorporation, chemotaxis, and cellular proliferation evoked via the PDGFRβ in vascular SMCs (13Peppel K. Zhang L. Huynh T.T.T. Huang X. Jacobson A. Brian L. Exum S.T. Hagen P.-O. Freedman N.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1399-1409Google Scholar, 14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). Importantly, receptor-specific desensitization by GRK2 correlated with a reduction in PDGF-promoted Tyr phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). The plausibility of GRK2-mediated regulation of the PDGFRβ in cells is suggested by the caveolar localization of PDGFRs in cells (15Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.G. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Google Scholar) and the ability of caveolin to bind to GRK2 (16Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Google Scholar). GRK2 also has been demonstrated to associate with phosphoinositide 3-kinase-α (17Naga Prasad S.V. Barak L.S. Rapacciuolo A. Caron M.G. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18953-18959Google Scholar), which translocates to activated PDGFRβs (1Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113Google Scholar) and is required for PDGFRβ internalization (18Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Google Scholar). Moreover, a Tyr kinase that is a principal effector of the PDGFRβ, c-Src, appears to be a critical activator of GRK2 activity in cells (19Sarnago S. Elorza A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34411-34416Google Scholar, 20Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Google Scholar). Thus, by activating c-Src, agonist-activated PDGFRβs could activate GRK2 indirectly. To address whether GRK2 affected PDGFRβ desensitization directly, by phosphorylating the PDGFRβ, or indirectly, by phosphorylating other regulatory proteins, we undertook the current study. All cell culture products were from Invitrogen. Human PDGF-BB was from Upstate Biotechnology, and LPA, human EGF, and nucleotides were from Sigma. All radionuclides were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sources for antibodies are provided below. Plasmids encoding bovine GRK2, dominant-negative (K220R) mutant GRK2, and the GRK2 C-terminal peptide were described previously (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar), as were the empty vector and GRK2-encoding recombinant adenoviruses (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding wild type and kinase-dead K634R mutant constructs of the human PDGFRβ (22Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Google Scholar) and the human EGFR (23Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Google Scholar) were the generous gifts of Andrius Kazlauskas and Axel Ullrich, respectively. Cassette PCR was employed to replace the endogenous signal sequence of each cDNA with an influenza virus hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG™ epitope (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). The 5′ (mutagenic) primer for the EGFR was 5′-cgcggggcggccgcacc(atgaagaccatcatcgcc-ctgagctacatcttctgcctggtgttcgcc)[gactacaaggacgatgacgacaag]ctggaggaaaagaaagtttgc-3′. Italics indicate a NotI site, parentheses surround the signal sequence, brackets surround the epitope sequence, boldface type highlights the initiator methionine, and underlined type denotes nucleotides 259–279 of the native EGFR sequence. The mutagenic primer for the PDGFRβ was similar, except that EcoRI replacedNotI, and nucleotides 452–473 of the PDGFRβ (25Gronwald R.G. Grant F.J. Haldeman B.A. Hart C.E. O'Hara P.J. Hagen F.S. Ross R. Bowen-Pope D.F. Murray M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3435-3439Google Scholar) were used. To create the FLAG-tagged EGFR (F-EGFR) construct, a 770-bpNotI/XmaI-cut PCR fragment was subcloned into the native EGFR cDNA, which had been subcloned previously into pcDNA I (Invitrogen). For the F-PDGFRβ construct, a 108-bpEcoRI/XmaI-cut PCR fragment was subcloned into the native PDGFRβ, subcloned previously into pcDNA I. Sequence fidelity was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. To create the F-PDGFRβ (K634R) mutant, a 1.2-kb FspI/BstEII fragment of the mutant construct was subcloned into the cognate site in the F-PDGFRβ. Throughout the text, the F-PDGFRβ and F-EGFR constructs are referred to as PDGFRβ and EGFR, respectively. HEK 293 cells (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar) (from the American Type Culture Collection) and rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. Transfections of 293 cells with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA per 100-mm dish were performed by calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation, as described (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). Adenoviral infections of SMCs were also performed as described previously (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). All transfected or infected cell populations were pooled before aliquoting for both assays and determinations of plasmid expression. Assays were performed 2 days after transfection of 293 cells or 3 days after infection of SMCs. Target expression levels for GRK2 and GRK2(K220R) were 40-fold higher than endogenous levels in 293 cells or SMCs (∼12 pmol/mg of cell protein (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar)), assessed by immunoblotting of serially diluted cell extracts. Efficiency of plasmid or adenoviral vector expression, respectively, was typically 35–50% in 293 cells (assessed by cell surface immunofluorescence and flow cytometry) (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar) or ≥95% in SMCs, assessed by fluorescence microscopy (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). Transfected 293 cell lines co-transfected with various plasmids typically demonstrated receptor expression levels (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar) within 30% of that measured in empty vector-co-transfected control cells. Cells with receptor expression levels outside this range were not used. To assay agonist-induced guanine nucleotide turnover, SMCs were serum-starved overnight, washed, and then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (25 °C), 2 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors) (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar) and disrupted on ice with a tight-fitting dounce. Membranes were pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C) and resuspended at a protein concentration of 0.6–0.8 mg/ml in TME buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (25 °C), 4.8 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). GTP loading reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in 100 μl volumes of TME containing 30–40 μg of SMC membranes, 1 μm GDP, 30 nm [35S]GTPγS, and the indicated concentration of either agonist or vehicle. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl cold IP buffer I (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 (25 °C), 20 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm GDP, 100 μm GTP, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 30 min to facilitate membrane solubilization. Insoluble debris was pelleted at 18,000 ×g (10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was subjected to IP for either Gαi1–3 or Gαq. The solubilized membranes were first pre-cleared with non-immune rabbit IgG (5 μg) and protein G-agarose (1 h, 4 °C). Pre-cleared supernatants were then combined with protein G-agarose and 5 μg of either non-immune rabbit IgG (nonspecific cpm), rabbit anti-Gαi1–3 IgG (total cpm) (sc-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit antiGq/11α subunit IgG (total CPM) (Calbiochem) and rotated for 1 h (4 °C). Subsequently, immune complex beads were washed three times in IP buffer I, aspirated dry, and resuspended in 100 μl of counting buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl), 50 μl of which was added to scintillation fluid and counted. Specific cpm from [35S]GTPγS (which constituted 75% of total cpm) were calculated as (total cpm) − (nonspecific cpm). To determine the effect of pertussis toxin (PTX) on agonist-stimulated ERK activation, serum-starved SMCs were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml; List Laboratories) or vehicle for 16 h (26Luttrell L.M. Hewlett E.L. Romero G. Rogol A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6134-6141Google Scholar), challenged with the indicated agonist for 10 min, and then lysed in Laemmli buffer (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). Multiple sample aliquots were subjected to replicate SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar), and replicate blots were probed for either phospho-ERK1/2 or total ERK1/2, with antibodies from New England Biolabs. Graded amounts of sample were loaded, so as to create standard curves from which to interpolate relative signal intensity by densitometry. Phospho-ERK signals were normalized to cognate total ERK signals. To assess the effects of GRK2 on PDGFRβ and EGFR total and Tyr phosphorylation, and to determine the association of GRK2 with the PDGFRβ and EGFR, cells were serum-starved overnight, exposed to vehicle- or agonist-containing medium for the indicated times, and subjected to IP as described previously for the FLAG-tagged endothelin B receptor (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar), except that M2-agarose beads (Sigma) were used. For co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 with the PDGFRβ or EGFR, the cell-permeant cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was used as described (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). For the purpose of immune complex kinase assays (see Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), IP was performed similarly, except that we used IP buffer II (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors).Figure 6GRK2 mediates agonist-promoted serine phosphorylation of the EGFR. HEK 293 cells transfected or not (None) with the EGFR plasmid were exposed to medium-containing vehicle or 1.7 nm EGF for 10 min at 37 °C, solubilized, and subjected to EGFR IP. Immunoprecipitated EGFRs were used to perform immune complex kinase assays as in Fig. 5.A, autoradiogram from a single experiment, representative of three performed.

Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). Receptor expression levels and the protein concentration of cell lysates were used to load equivalent amounts of receptor per lane for SDS-PAGE as described (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to either nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, immunoblotted, stripped, and reprobed as described (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar), with the following IgGs: for phospho-Tyr, pY20/HRP (Transduction Laboratories); for the PDGFRβ and EGFR C-terminal domains, respectively, rabbit IgGs sc-432 and sc-03 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); for ubiquitin, monoclonal Ub(P4D1) (Santa Cruz); and for equivalent identification of GRK2 and the GRK2 C-terminal peptide (GRK2ct), monoclonal E23/8 (14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgGs for rabbit and mouse came from Jackson ImmunoResearch. For anti-ubiquitin blots, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG came from Amersham Biosciences. For sequential immunoblotting, anti-phospho-Tyr blotting always followed anti-receptor blotting (because our nitrocellulose stripping procedure could not remove pY20; data not shown). Bovine GRK2 was produced inSf9 cells by recombinant baculovirus-mediated expression and purified as described (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar). Receptors immunoprecipitated from 100-mm dishes of 293 cells (challenged or not with agonist) were washed three times in IP buffer III (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 (25 °C), 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Immune complex beads were aspirated to dryness with a 28-gauge needle and resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer. Reactions were performed (35 °C, 30 min) in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer with 200 nm GRK2 or vehicle and 0.1 mm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (21Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Google Scholar), and samples were heated to 65 °C for 10 min to dissociate immune complexes. Samples of equivalent receptor mass (determined from protein assay of solubilized cells) were loaded onto each lane of 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For each sample, 90% was subjected to SDS-PAGE for subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis, and 10% was subjected to SDS-PAGE for subsequent immunoblotting for receptor and for phospho-Tyr. Receptor phosphorylation was quantitated with a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics). 32P-Labeled receptor bands were excised from PVDF membranes after autoradiography, subjected to acid hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl (110 °C, 70 min), and dried as described (27Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were then dissolved in PAA buffer, pH 3.5 (5% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine containing 1 mg of phosphoamino acid standards (Sigma) per ml), and subjected to one-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis followed by ninhydrin staining as described (28Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Google Scholar). Radioactivity in phosphoamino acids was quantitated by PhosphorImager™ analysis as described (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). SMCs infected with either the empty vector or GRK2-encoding adenovirus were serum-starved overnight and then exposed to serum-free medium containing either 2 nm PDGF-BB or vehicle for the indicated times. To terminate incubations, SMCs were transferred to ice, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for membrane preparation, as described above. Membrane pellets were then resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, with protease inhibitors) and mixed gently for 45 min (4 °C). Insoluble debris was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min (4°), and the supernatant was subjected to protein assay (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Google Scholar). For each sample, 35 μg of membrane protein were loaded in duplicate lanes of a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblotting for PDGFRβ. A paired t test was used to compare GRK2-overexpressing or PTX-treated with cognate control cells, and two-sided p values were calculated with Excel™ software (Microsoft). With Prism™ software (Graphpad, Inc.), repeated measures one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test was used to compare GTP loading values among SMC membrane preparations treated with various agonists. Data in the text are mean ± S.D., whereas means ± S.E. are depicted in figures. We found recently that signaling through the PDGFRβ was desensitized, in a receptor-specific manner, in SMCs overexpressing GRK2 (13Peppel K. Zhang L. Huynh T.T.T. Huang X. Jacobson A. Brian L. Exum S.T. Hagen P.-O. Freedman N.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1399-1409Google Scholar, 14Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Google Scholar). Unlike the PDGFRβ, all other receptors known to be desensitized by GRK2 are heptahelical receptors that activate heterotrimeric G proteins allosterically (10Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the PDGFRβ, like heptahelical receptors, could also activate G proteins allosterically. To answer this question, we tested the ability of the PDGFRβ to promote GTP turnover in Gα subunits. In rabbit SMC membranes (which express only the PDGFRβ) (29Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Google Scholar), we could find no evidence that PDGF stimulated GTPγS binding to Gαq, whereas such binding was stimulated by endothelin-1 (data not shown). However, PDGF stimulated a 1.7-fold increase in GTPγS binding to Gαi1–3 (Fig. 1A). LPA, which is known to activate Gi-coupled, heptahelical endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) receptors (30An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Google Scholar), stimulated a 2.8-fold increase in GTPγS binding to Gαi1–3, whereas EGF failed to promote GTP turnover on Gαi1–3(Fig. 1A). Thus, the PDGFRβ appeared to activate Gαi isoforms in SMC membranes, but the allosteric nature of the PDGFRβ/Gαi interaction remained to be established. PDGFRβs may induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (31Bae Y.S. Sung J.Y. Kim O.S. Kim Y.J. Hur K.C. Kazlauskas A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10527-10531Google Scholar), and ROS may activate Gαi isoforms (32Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Google Scholar). We therefore sought to ascertain whether the PDGFRβ activated Gαi isoforms allosterically, as heptahelical receptors do (33Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar), or only indirectly via the production of ROS. To demonstrate that the PDGFRβ activated Gαi via a mechanism(s) different from ROS, we employed two approaches. First, in SMC membrane preparations (Fig. 1A) we found no activation of Gαi upon stimulation of the EGFR, which, like the PDGFR, is also known to promote production of ROS (34Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Google Scholar). Second, in intact SMCs, we used PTX to inhibit Gi/Go-mediated activation of ERK1/2, because H2O2-induced ERK activation via Gi/Go has been shown to be PTX-insensitive (32Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Google Scholar). We found that PDGF-induced ERK activation in SMCs was"

Like the related granzymes A and B, GzmK can trigger DNA fragmentation and is involved in apoptosis. We expressed the Ser195 → Ala variant of human pro-GzmK in Escherichia coli, crystallized it, and determined its 2.2-Å x-ray crystal structure. Pro-GzmK possesses a surprisingly rigid structure, which is most similar to activated serine proteases, in particular complement factor D, and not their proforms. The N-terminal peptide Met14-Ile17 projects freely into solution and can be readily approached by cathepsin C, the natural convertase of pro-granzymes. The pre-shaped S1 pocket is occupied by the ion paired residues Lys188B-Asp194 and is hence not available for proper substrate binding. The Ser214-Cys220 segment, which normally provides a template for substrate binding, bulges out of the active site and is distorted. With analogy to complement factor D, we suggest that this strand will maintain its non-productive conformation in mature GzmK, mainly due to the unusual residues Gly215, Glu219, and Val94. We hypothesize that GzmK is proteolytically active only toward specific, as yet unidentified substrates, which upon approach transiently induce a functional active-site conformation.

Griffiths G.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Upon recognition of antigenetically altered target cells or transformed or virally infected host cells, granzymes and other granule components are released as high molecular weight complexes and are taken up by the target cell via membrane receptors. Perforin enhances this uptake and appears to contribute to the release of granzymes from endosomal vesicles (2Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev.

Granzyme K (GzmK)1 was discovered in granules of human lymphokine-stimulated killer cells together with granzyme A (GzmA) as a trypsin-like non-glycosylated serine protease (molecular mass, ∼28 kDa) that cleavesN α-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT) bonds (5Hameed A. Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3142-3147PubMed Google Scholar). GzmA is 10-fold more abundant in human lymphokine-stimulated killer cell granules than GzmK (5Hameed A. Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3142-3147PubMed Google Scholar), whereas granules from the RNK-16 rat tumor cell line contain significantly higher amounts of GzmK than GzmA (6Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The rat enzyme (also known as fragmentin-3) was originally identified as the third proteolytic inducer of DNA fragmentation in perforin-treated YAC-1 target cells apart from GzmA and GzmB. DNA fragmentation initiated by GzmK or GzmA in the presence of perforin shows similar time kinetics and was observed after 20 h, whereas GzmB/perforin-mediated apoptosis occurred already within 2 h (6Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In evolutionary terms, GzmK and GzmA are the most closely related granzymes. They both are encoded by single copy genes in human and rodents and map to orthologous chromosomal segments on human chromosome 5q11.2 and mouse chromosome 13, band D2.2, respectively (7Denizot F.

Transcripts of the murineGzmK gene have been detected in certain regions of the mouse brain, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, diencephalon, and the pineal and pituitary glands (10Suemoto T. Taniguchi M. Shiosaka S. Yoshida S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 70: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GzmK and GzmA differ from GzmB by their substrate specificity. Although the latter cleaves after Asp residues, both GzmK and GzmA preferentially cut after basic residues. To date only the thioesters Z-Arg-SBzl and BLT, and a highly basic 13-amino acid oligopeptide (Cys-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val-Gly-Gly) have been reported to be cleaved by GzmK at neutral pH. GzmK cleaves this oligopeptide between basic residues, most rapidly after position 6 and 9 and more slowly after position 7 and 8 (11Babé L.M. Yoast S. Dreyer M. Schmidt B.F. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 27: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The best synthetic inhibitors of GzmK known are 3,3-diphenylpropanoyl-Pro-4-amidinophenylglycyldiphenylphosphonate esters (12Jackson D.S. Fraser S.A., Ni, L.M. Kam C.M. Winkler U. Johnson D.A.

The most efficient natural inhibitor is inter-α-trypsin inhibitor, a heterotrimeric protein complex containing bikunin. Inhibition by this plasma protein complex is mediated by the second Kunitz-type domain of its bikunin subunit, the K i value being 22 nm (13Wilharm E. Parry M.A. Friebel R. Tschesche H. Matschiner G. Sommerhoff C.P. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27331-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GzmK, like GzmA and GzmB, is synthesized as a zymogen precursor, containing a signal and a short pro-peptide preceding the mature polypeptide chain (14Sayers T.J. Lloyd A.R. McVicar D.W. O'Connor M.D. Kelly J.M. Carter C.R. Wiltrout T.A. Wiltrout R.H. Smyth M.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cleavage site of the signal peptidase in the GzmK precursor has not been experimentally determined, and thus the exact length of the propeptide is uncertain. The N-terminal propeptides of GzmA, GzmB, and mast cell chymase precursors, however, have been identified in cultured cells as Glu-Arg, Gly-Glu, and Gly-Glu, respectively (15Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 16Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar, 17Urata H. Karnik S.S. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24318-24322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of these dipeptides is ensured by the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C (dipeptidyl peptidase 1) (18McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is deficient in the Papillon-Lefévre syndrome (19Toomes C. James J. Wood A.J., Wu, C.L. McCormick D. Lench N. Hewitt C.

Genet. 1999; 23: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Conclusive confirmation of the essential role of cathepsin C in the conversion process was obtained from cathepsin C-deficient knockout mice, whose lymphocytes contain only catalytically inactive GzmA and GzmB precursors at normal levels (15Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Our recent studies indicate that an N-terminal Met-Glu dipeptide is also efficiently removed by cathepsin C in vitro from the human granzyme K zymogen (13Wilharm E. Parry M.A. Friebel R. Tschesche H. Matschiner G. Sommerhoff C.P. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27331-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the Met-Glu precursor of GzmK most likely represents the natural proform or at least a functional intermediate during biosynthesis of catalytically active GzmK in vivo. Transport of zymogens through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network before recognition by cathepsin C requires a certain degree of conformational stability, which prevents both premature proteolytic activity and degradation of precursors intracellularly. The natural Met-Glu precursor of human GzmK lacks N-linked carbohydrates and can be produced by recombinant expression inEscherichia coli and refolding from inclusion body proteins at high quantities, which is a prerequisite for further structural analyses (13Wilharm E. Parry M.A. Friebel R. Tschesche H. Matschiner G. Sommerhoff C.P. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27331-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To understand the specific conversion of pro-GzmK by cathepsin C as well as the weak proteolytic activity of mature GzmK on a structural basis, we produced the more stable but otherwise identical Ser195 → Ala variant of human pro-GzmK, crystallized this variant, and determined its crystal structure at 100 and 298 K. Our structural work reveals an unanticipated mechanism of zymogen stabilization and suggests a distorted conformation for activated GzmK, which is incompatible with the binding and processing of protein substrates. The cDNA segment between the NdeI andApaI site of the wild type plasmid pET24c+(Novagen) was removed by NdeI and ApaI cleavage (New England BioLabs) and replaced by a mutated cDNA sequence. This cDNA sequence was generated from the wild type construct (13Wilharm E. Parry M.A. Friebel R. Tschesche H. Matschiner G. Sommerhoff C.P. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27331-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides DJ601 (upper primer, 5′-TGTGTTTCCATATGGAAATTAT-3′) and DJ582 (lower primer, 5′-TCAAGGGGCCCCCTGCGTCAC-3′). Oligonucleotide DJ582 introduces a codon for Ala at position 195 in the wild type cDNA sequence of GzmK. The resulting PCR product was digested withNdeI and ApaI and ligated into the cleaved pET24c+ vector carrying the 3′ coding portion of the cDNA. The recombinant plasmid was amplified in DH5α cells (Invitrogen) and transformed into B834(DE3) cells (Novagen) for protein expression. The expression of the Ser195 → Ala mutant of pro-GzmK in B834(DE3) cells, grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C, was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm as described previously (13Wilharm E.

Bacteria were harvested after 5-h induction and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml DNase I, and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 7.2. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation; washed twice in 50 mmTris-HCl, 60 mm EDTA, 1.5 m NaCl, 6% Triton X-100, pH 7.2, and three times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.2; and dissolved in 6 mguanidinium chloride, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mmEDTA, 15 mm GSH, 150 mm GSSG, pH 8.0, by stirring at room temperature over night. Solubilized proteins were then dialyzed against 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 5.0 at 4 °C. Refolding was initiated by diluting the solubilized proteins (typically 10–15 mg/ml) 1:100 (v/v) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m l-arginine, 20 mmCaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm l-cysteine, pH 8.5 (refolding buffer). Two further aliquots were added to this solution after 8 and 16 h. Diluted proteins were kept at 4 °C in refolding buffer for an additional period of 96 h. The protein solution was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and loaded onto a Mono S-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences). Proteins were recovered from the column using a linear salt gradient (from 0.137 to 2 m NaCl). Crystals suitable for diffraction analysis were grown by the sitting drop vapor-diffusion method. One microliter of the protein solution (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 μl of the reservoir solution (3.2m sodium formate, pH 8.4) and concentrated against 300 μl of the reservoir. After 2 days of incubation, 100 μl of 6m sodium formate solution, pH 8.4, were added to the reservoir. Within 3 months at 20 °C, crystals grew to maximal dimensions of 0.3 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.5 mm. A complete data set to 2.9-Å resolution was recorded at room temperature from a single crystal mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary. A second complete data set to 2.23 Å was collected at 100 K from a flash-cooled crystal that had previously been equilibrated in a cryo-solution (3.9m sodium formate, pH 8.4, 15% (v/v) glycerol). Both data sets were recorded “in house” on a 300-mm MAR Research image plate detector, using monochromatized CuKα radiation from a RIGAKU rotating anode x-ray generator. The crystals of pro-GzmK Ser195 → Ala did not experience appreciable radiation decay over the 2 days that they were exposed to the x-ray beam at room temperature. This feature seems to be related to the relatively low solvent content of the crystals (39%, corresponding to a Matthews coefficient of 2.02). The crystals belong to space group P212121 and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data sets were evaluated with MOSFLM (20Leslie A. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1991: 50-61Google Scholar), reduced, and scaled without applying a sigma cut-off, using programs supported by the Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (21Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (available at www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/amore.html) using 15.0- to 3.5-Å data and a modified GzmB (1FQ3) search model (22Estebanez-Perpina E.

Model building was done on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation using MAIN (23Turk D NATO Sci. Ser. I. 1991; 325: 148-155Google Scholar,24Turk D.

X-PLOR, version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). In the final steps of refinement, highly restrained atomic B-values were also refined. Models were built in agreement with the human GzmK sequence as deposited in the Swiss-Prot data base (accession code P49863). They start with the N-terminal Met14, which was confirmed by sequence analysis of two crystals, and end with Asn248(chymotrypsinogen A numbering). In both cases, there is continuous electron density from Gly19 to Ser92 and from Ser100 to Pro244. For the N-terminal segment Met14-Gly18, segment Arg93-Gln99, and the C-terminal residues from Pro245 to Asn248, lacking interpretable electron density, the occupancy of all atoms was set to zero. The final model comprises 221 defined residues and 131 solvent (water) molecules. 99% of all residues fall into the most favored or additionally favored regions (PROCHECK version 3.5.4 (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)). The final R-factors are 24.07% (R free, 28.45%) and 22.36% (31.67%) for data sets measured at 100 and 298 K, respectively (see Table I for statistics of the data collection, processing, and refinement).Table IStatistics for data collection and refinementPro-GzmK S195ACrystal 11-aData set measured at 100 K.Crystal 21-bData set measured at room temperature.Molecules/asymmetric unit11Space groupP212121P212121Cell constant, a/b/c (Å)31.46/78.16/83.6231.75/78.86/85.28Resolution (Å)2.232.90Reflections measured65,66939,313R merge(%)1-cR merge = Σhkl‖〈I〉 −I‖/Σhkl‖I‖.12.514.7Unique reflections23,80810,537Completeness (%), overall97.194.5Completeness (%), outermost shell95.192.5Reflections used for refinement22,6179,771Resolution range (Å)22–2.2322–2.90R factor (%) final1-dR factor = Σhkl∥F obs‖ − ‖F calc∥/Σhkl‖F obs‖.24.0722.36R free (%) final1-eR free is theR value calculated with 500 reflections that were not used for the refinement.28.4531.67r.m.s standard deviations: Bond length (Å)0.00740.0067 Bond angles (°)1.4351.28 Average Bvalue/S.D.

Technische Universität, München, Germany1992Google Scholar). The S1 pocket and surrounding loops were modeled following bovine trypsin in complex with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) (2PTC and 1TPA) (29Huber R. Kukla D. Bode W. Schwager P. Bartels K. Deisenhofer J. Steigemann W. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 73-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and human leukocyte elastase in complex with the third domain of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor (1PPF) (30Bode W. Wei A.Z. Huber R. Meyer E. Travis J. Neumann S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Residues Gly89 to Phe94 comprising the reactive-site loop of the second bikunin domain were taken from the reported crystal structure (1BIK) (31Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and adjusted to the model of active GzmK according to the main-chain trace in the above-mentioned complexes. The side chains of Lys192 of GzmK and Phe94 of bikunin D2 were rotated to avoid clashes between the two moieties (inter atom distances below 3 Å). The structure of the complex was finally minimized with CNS, and the quality of the model was controlled with PROCHECK version 3.5.4 (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Additional atomic coordinates for serine proteases used in this work were obtained from the Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession codes 2PTC, 1TPA, 1PPF, 1BIK, 1FDP, 1DIC, 1HFD, 1BIO, 1DFP,1DSU, 1DST, 1PJP, 1KLT, 1CGH, 1FQ3, 2PKA, 2CGA, 1FDP, 1FAX, and1TGB. In this report we describe and discuss the first three-dimensional structure of one of the zymogens that are converted by cathepsin C to an active serine protease in lymphocytes, mast cells, and granulocytes during granule biosynthesis. We have chosen human pro-GzmK, because the natural zymogen starts with a Met residue, lacks glycosylation sites, and can be expressed at high levels in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies. The catalytic Ser195 was replaced by an Ala residue to avoid any autocatalytic cleavages in highly concentrated solutions during crystallization. Complete data sets were collected independently for two crystals at room temperature and at 100 K after flash cooling in liquid nitrogen, respectively. Both Fourier maps were essentially equivalent and allowed continuous tracing of the polypeptide chain from Gly19 to Ser92, and from Ser100 to Pro244, whereas the first N-terminal residues between Met14 and Gly18, seven residues of the 99 loop between Arg93 and Gln99, and the four residues of the C terminus (Pro245-Asn248) were found disordered. The temperature independence of this flexibility indicates that these segments are statically rather than thermally disordered (32Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). By analogy with trypsinogen and pro-complement factor D (pro-DF) and because of the weak proteolytic activity of activated GzmK, the pro-GzmK structure was expected to be quite flexible as in trypsinogen (33Singh T.P. Bode W. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1980; 36: 621-627Crossref Google Scholar) and DF (34Jing H. Macon K.J. Moore D. DeLucas L.J. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To our surprise, the crystal structure analysis, however, revealed a rigid zymogen with a preformed active-site cleft (see below). Especially the activation domain and the S1 specificity pocket are well-ordered. The pro-GzmK molecule has the shape of an oblate ellipsoid with principal axes of about 35 and 50 Å (Fig. 1). As in other chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, the single GzmK polypeptide chain folds into two β-barrels each comprising six antiparallel strands labeled β1 to β6, and β7 to β12 (Fig. 2), which are strapped together by the domain-linking segments Val22-Pro28, Leu121-Ser129, and Thr229-Lys232A (Fig. 2). The residues of the catalytic triad, His57, Asp102, and Ser195 → Ala, are located at the junction of the two β-barrels. The preformed active-site cleft (see below) runs perpendicular to this junction along the surfaces of both barrels. Three helical elements are found on the surface of the molecule, a single 310 turn (Ala55 to Gln59, α1), an “intermediate” α-helix (Ser164 to Asn169, α2), and a long C-terminal α-helix extending from Lys232A to Leu243 (α3). The optimal alignment to bovine chymotrypsinogen A required insertions of one tetrapeptide (60A to 60D), three dipeptides (170A and 170B; 173A and 173B; 188A and 188B), and two single amino acid residues (223A and 232A), and deletions of three single residues (36McGrath M.E. Mirzadegan T. Schmidt B.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14318-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 127, 218) and of the tetrapeptide segment between 203 and 206 (see Fig. 2).Figure 2Topological sequence alignment of GzmK and related proteases. Initial multiple sequence alignment was done using “pileup” (Genetics Computer Group, GCG, Madison, WI). Final alignments were adjusted according to the structural alignment of each serine protease with bovine chymotrypsinogen A (btCtrA). Homologous regions were highlighted using “prettybox” (GCG program package). The vote weights for mmGzmk and rnGzmK were reduced to 0.6; no vote weight was specified for all other sequences. Helices and β-strands of pro-GzmK are represented by cylinders andarrows. The residues of the active site triad are emphasized in boldface numbers and the unique residues 188B, 215, and 219 are shown by italic numbers. Residues, which are identical in more than two of the aligned sequences, are emphasized byblack shading. The species designations Hs(Homo sapiens), Rn (Rattus norvegicus), Mm (Mus musculus),Bt (Bos taurus) are used as prefixes in combination with accepted gene symbols (Ctra, chymotrypsinogen A; DF, complement factor D; Gzm, granzyme). The numbering of pro-GzmK residues is based on topological similarity to chymotrypsinogen A. Inserted residues are identified with the number of the last topologically equivalent chymotrypsinogen residue, and capital letters as a suffix in alphabetical order.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A direct topological comparison between pro-GzmK and the available enzyme-zymogen pairs deposited with the Protein Data Bank (35Berman H.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27925) Google Scholar) revealed a better superposition with the active enzymes than with their respective zymogens. The best fit was obtained with the six PDB entries for active human complement factor D (DF), 1DIC, 1HFD, 1BIO, 1DFP,1DSU, and 1DST. Considering only α carbon atom pairs having Cα-Cα distances of 1.5 Å or less, 181 residues turned out to be topologically equivalent between pro-GzmK and DF, showing an average root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.72 Å (Fig. 1 B). This topological similarity extends into many structural details (see below). By contrast, pro-GzmK and the four independent pro-DF molecules in the asymmetric unit of 1FDP possess only 157 topologically equivalent residues, with a slightly higher r.m.s. deviation of 0.81 Å. Second and third on the score ranking list are two groups of active serine proteases, comprising human mast cell chymase (1PJP and 1KLT) (36McGrath M.E. Mirzadegan T. Schmidt B.F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), followed by GzmB (1FQ3) (22Estebanez-Perpina E. Fuentes-Prior P. Belorgey D. Braun M. Kiefersauer R. Maskos K. Huber R.

Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). From the two latter pairs 162 and 161 α-carbon atoms, respectively, can be superimposed on pro-GzmK with r.m.s. deviations of 0.74 and 0.76 Å. The topological fit with chymotrypsin and trypsin was worse, but still better than for their zymogens, chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen. Mast cell chymase, cathepsin G, and GzmB are slightly more distant in agreement with their evolution and chromosomal clustering. These three proteases and GzmH lack the disulfide bond Cys191-Cys220 and are clustered together on chromosome 14q11.2 within 130 kb (4Trapani J.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3014.1-3014.7Crossref Google Scholar), whereas granzyme-related members with four disulfide bonds are distributed over two separate loci on chromosome 5q11.2 (GzmA and GzmK) and chromosome 19p13.3 (GzmM, azurocidin 1, proteinase 3, neutrophil elastase, and complement factor D). Compared with other serine proteases, the percentage of polar residues in GzmK is not particularly high. The 6 glutamate and 11 aspartate residues, however, do not compensate for the positive charges of the 8 arginine and 23 lysine residues, rendering pro-GzmK very basic in accordance with a calculated isoelectric point of 10.2. The basic amino acid residues are unevenly distributed on the surface and form"
https://openalex.org/W1997014262,"Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) is a transmembrane protein present on the surface of merozoites that is thought to be involved in the process of parasite invasion of host erythrocytes. Although it is the target of a natural immune response that can inhibit invasion, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which AMA1 facilitates the invasion process. In an attempt to identify peptides that specifically interact with and block the function of AMA1, a random peptide library displayed on the surface of filamentous phage was panned on recombinant AMA1 fromPlasmodium falciparum. Three peptides with affinity for AMA1 were isolated, and characterization of their fine binding specificities indicated that they bind to a similar region on the surface of AMA1. One of these peptides was found to be a potent inhibitor of the invasion of P. falciparum merozoites into human erythrocytes. We propose that this peptide blocks interaction between AMA1 and a ligand on the erythrocyte surface that is involved in a critical step in malarial invasion. The identification and characterization of these peptide inhibitors now permit an evaluation of the essential requirements that are necessary for efficient neutralization of merozoite invasion by blocking AMA1 function.

Currently, significant efforts are directed toward the development of a vaccine based on recombinant apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1),1 a surface-exposed integral membrane protein that is thought to play a crucial role in invasion of erythrocytes by malarial parasites (1Peterson M.G. Marshall V.M. Smythe J.A. Crewther P.E. Lew A. Silva A. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3151-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Vaccine strategies that target molecules on the surface of the invasive merozoite such as AMA1 are a high priority in the search for an effective malaria vaccine. Our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the invasion process may hinder the achievement of this goal. A comprehensive ultrastructural description has emerged of a highly organized series of steps of attachment, reorientation, and junction formation leading to the complete encapsulation of the parasite within the erythrocyte (2Dvorak J.A. Miller L.H. Whitehouse W.C. Shiroishi T. Science. 1975; 187: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3Mitchell G.H. Bannister L.H. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1988; 8: 225-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Constituents of organelles at the apical end of the merozoite have been implicated in the cascade of events leading to invasion and post-invasion events (4Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Johnson J. Rabbege J. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 5Hadley T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For example, rhoptries and micronemes, flask-shaped organelles at the apical end of the merozoite, have been implicated in invasion, whereas dense granules, also part of the apical complex, appear to be involved in events immediately following invasion (6Etzion Z. Murray M.C. Perkins M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M.

Molecules that mediate the invasion process have been found to be located within apical organelles and also on the merozoite surface. Indeed, some molecules such as AMA1 may be initially localized in micronemes and later migrate to the rhoptries (reviewed in Ref. 8Blackman M.J. Bannister L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are then relocated to the merozoite surface around the time of invasion. It was the timing of this redistribution that first suggested a potential role for AMA1 in the invasion process (9Peterson M.G. Nguyen-Dinh P. Marshall V.M. Elliot J.F. Collins W.E. Anders R.F.

Evidence that AMA1 plays an important role in invasion comes from vaccine studies in monkey and mouse models, which showed that immunization with either purified or recombinant AMA1 could induce a protective immune response when immunized animals were challenged with the corresponding species of Plasmodium (12Deans J.A.

Other important vaccine candidates that have been shown to induce antibodies that inhibit or block merozoite invasion in vitroinclude the rhoptry-associated proteins RAP1 and RAP2 (20Schofield L.

Immun. 1998; 66: 380-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, targeted gene disruption studies of the RAP1 gene performed by Baldi and co-workers (23Baldi D. Andrews K.T. Waller R.F. Roos D.S. Howard R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) revealed normal parasite growth and invasion of human erythrocytes in vitro, suggesting that RAP1 does not play a crucial role in merozoite invasion. It has been suggested that the inhibitory activity of anti-RAP1 antibodies is a result of steric hindrance of the invasion process rather than direct inhibition of the function of this protein. In contrast, attempts to “knockout” the Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) gene have not been successful (24Triglia T. Healer J. Caruana S.R. Hodder A.N. Anders R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), suggesting that unlike other apically located proteins, AMA1 is essential for erythrocyte invasion. Although the precise steps involved in merozoite invasion are not well understood, Chitnis and Blackman (25Chitnis C.E. Blackman M.J. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 411-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have put forward some suggestions for the possible roles of various merozoite surface antigens in the overall invasion process. A possible scenario is that merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) mediates the initial attachment of merozoites to the surface of the erythrocyte, a process that may be mediated by relatively low affinity interactions between MSP-1 and components of the erythrocyte membranes. The role of AMA1 may be to facilitate the reorientation of the merozoite after initial attachment so that the apical complex, consisting of rhoptries and micronemes, is closely apposed to the erythrocyte surface (25Chitnis C.E. Blackman M.J. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 411-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is feasible that AMA1, which gradually redistributes from the apical organelles to the merozoite plasma membrane, might form a concentration gradient on the merozoite surface that could mediate this reorientation of the parasite. Although there is circumstantial evidence for these suppositions, a clearer understanding of the structure and function of AMA1 relies on further detailed molecular studies. We chose to apply the powerful phage display technology to identify novel peptides with affinity for AMA1. Random peptide libraries displayed on phage have been used to isolate mimotopes against clinically important antibodies (26McConnell S.J. Kendall M.L. Reilly T.M. Hoess R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), peptides that recognize DNA sequences (27Isalan M. Patel S.D. Balasubramanian S. Choo Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), peptides that mimic carbohydrate structures (28Lesinski G.B. Smithson S.L. Srivastava N. Chen D. Widera G. Westerink M.A. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and peptides that target organ-specific molecules (29Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By panning peptide libraries on the receptors for erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, peptides have been isolated that are able to act as both agonists and antagonists (31Wrighton N.C. Farrell F.X. Chang R. Kashyap A.K. Barbone F.P. Mulcahy L.S. Johnson D.L. Barrett R.W. Jolliffe L.K. Dower W.J. Science. 1996; 273: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 32Cwirla S.E.

Science. 1997; 276: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). After modification by mutagenesis, these peptides were found to perform most of the functions of the native hormones such as receptor binding, dimerization, and downstream signaling leading to biological activity. These peptides exhibit high potency, in some cases as potent as the natural cytokine (32Cwirla S.E. Balasubramanian P. Duffin D.J. Wagstrom C.R. Gates C.M. Singer S.C. Davis A.M. Tansik R.L. Mattheakis L.C. Boytos C.M. Schatz P.J. Baccanari D.P. Wrighton N.C. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 1696-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of peptides selected on natural ligands has provided insights into the natural binding partners of these ligands (33Rodi D.J. Janes R.W. Sanganee H.J. Holton R.A. Wallace B.A. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Rodi D.J. Makowski L. Curr. Opin.

Science. 1999; 285: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In view of the broad success of this approach, we panned a 15-residue random peptide library expressed on gene product (GP) III of filamentous phage against the recombinant AMA1 ectodomain. One of the peptides that we have isolated specifically binds to recombinant AMA1 and recognizes the native protein in malarial parasites. Binding of this peptide to AMA1 was found to inhibit the merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes, and alanine scanning has defined a small set of amino acid side chains that are essential for AMA1 binding. These peptides represent defined reagents that will help explore the structure of AMA1 and illuminate its function within the parasite life cycle and may provide lead compounds for future therapies based on inhibition of AMA1 function. The P. falciparum cloned lines 3D7, D10, FAC-8, K1, and HB3 were continuously cultured essentially using the method of Trager and Jensen (36Trager W. Jensen J. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar), except that the human serum supplement to the culture medium was substituted with 0.5% Albumax, and the gas conditions were 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Late stage parasites were purified from synchronized cultures on a Percoll cushion (37Dluzewski A.R. Ling I.T. Rangachari K. Bates P.A. Wilson R.J.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1984; 78: 622-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 15-mer phage peptide library was kindly provided by George Smith (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) (38Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Phage were amplified by infecting a log-phase culture ofEscherichia coli K91 and shaking overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml tetracycline (39Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The supernatant was twice clarified by pelleting the cells at 8000 × g for 15 min, and a 20% volume of a solution of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 2.5 m NaCl was added to precipitate the phage. The sample was incubated on ice at 4 °C for at least 2 h before being centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 50 min. The phage pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.5) and stored at −20 °C in 0.02% NaN3. The panning technique adopted by Parmley and Smith (40Parmley S. Smith G. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) was modified and used to screen the phage peptide library on PfAMA1. Four rounds of panning were performed onE. coli cell-expressed and refolded AMA1 from the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum (41Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The wells of a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate (Maxisorp, Nunc International) were coated with AMA1 (1 μg) in 100 μl of coating buffer (0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.5), sealed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked for at least 2 h at room temperature with 300 μl of blocking solution (0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5). Following blocking, the wells were washed three times with PBS. Phage (∼1011 particles) were added to the wells in 100 μl of probing solution (0.5% BSA in PBS) and left for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After incubation, the wells were washed twice in the first round, four times in the second round, and eight times in subsequent rounds of panning with PBS-T (0.5% Tween 20 in PBS) to remove non-binding phage. Phage that bound to PfAMA1 were eluted with 100 μl of elution solution (0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.2) for 15 min at room temperature and neutralized with 7 μl of 2 m Tris. The titer of eluted phage was estimated, and an aliquot of the eluted fraction was used to infect E. coliK91 cells for amplification. The amplified phage was titered, and 1011 particles were used in the next round of panning. Phage were subjected to serial 10-fold dilutions with 90 μl of LB medium and 10 μl of phage suspension in a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc International). To each of the phage dilutions was added 90 μl of log-phase E. coli K91 cells, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow the phage to infect the E. coli cells. A 50-μl aliquot of each dilution was spread onto LB agar plates containing 25 μg/ml tetracycline and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage infection of bacteria confers resistance to tetracycline, and such colonies were counted and expressed as colony-forming units/ml. The harvested parasites were diluted in sample buffer (10% glycerol, 63 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue), and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. The parasite extracts were then centrifuged for 10 min at high speed to remove insoluble material. 3 μg of recombinant PfAMA1 orPlasmodium chabaudi AMA1 (PcAMA1) was diluted in sample buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Parasite-derived and recombinant material was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8% acrylamide) under nonreducing conditions. Separated proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PVDF-Plus, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA); and the membrane was blocked overnight in 5% Blotto (5% skim milk powder in PBS), rinsed for 5 min in PBS, and probed with phage (1010 particles/ml) or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to PfAMA1 (1:1000 dilution in 5% Blotto) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The membrane was washed every 10 min for 4 h with PBS-T. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (AmershamBiosciences Pty. Ltd.) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies, and binding was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Binding assays were carried out using a process similar to that described by Harlow and Lane (42Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (eds) (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Briefly, 96-well Maxisorp microwell plates were coated with PfAMA1, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18/2, BSA, or PcAMA1 (all at 1 μg in 100 μl of 0.1 m Na2HCO3, pH 8.5, per well) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked for at least 2 h at room temperature with 300 μl of 0.5% BSA in PBS and then washed three times with PBS. Phage (diluted in 0.5% BSA in PBS) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed five times with PBS-T, and bound phage were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (1:3000 dilution in PBS) usingo-phenylenediamine as a color reagent. For competition experiments, 1010 phage particles were added to the PfAMA1-coated wells (1 μg/well) in the presence of increasing amounts of synthetic peptide or mAb 4G2, and the phage were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. In binding assays involving the detection of synthetic peptides, 96-well plates were coated with 10 μg of synthetic peptide in 100 ml of coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3 and 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6). AMA1 (1 μg in 100 μl of probing solution) was added to the wells, and bound AMA1 was detected with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against AMA1 followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody as described above. The region of the phage genome encoding the displayed peptide sequence was amplified using the following primers: 5′-primer (GAT AAA CCG ATA CAA TTA AAG) and 3′-primer (CAC AGA CAA CCC TCA TAG). In a 50-μl reaction volume, 2 units ofTaq polymerase (Promega) was used to amplify 2 μl of template phage DNA solution (released from E. coli K91 cells by boiling) using 250 nm primers, 200 μmdNTPs, and 2 mm MgSO4. After an initial 1-min denaturation, the reaction was cycled at 95 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. A final elongation step was carried out at 72 °C for 7 min. The resultant PCR product was purified using the QIAquick 8 PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Pty. Ltd.). DNA was sequenced by automated dye terminator cycle sequencing (SUPAMAC, Centre for Proteome Research and Gene Product Mapping, Eveleigh, New South Wales, Australia). Sequences were analyzed with DNASIS Version 2.1 computer software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). Peptides were synthesized by AUSPEP Pty. Ltd. (Parkville, Victoria, Australia) and Jerini Bio Tools GmbH (Berlin, Germany). 15 derivatives of the F1 peptide (GWRLLGFGPASSFSM) in which each residue was replaced with l-alanine (alanine was replaced withl-glycine) were synthesized as cleavable pepspots. These 15 mutated peptides were solubilized in Me2SO followed by PBS to a final concentration of 4% Me2SO and analyzed for binding to PfAMA1 using the competition assay with F1 phage as described above. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed essentially as described previously by Bianco et al. (43Bianco A.E. Crewther P.E. Coppel R.L. Stahl H.D. Kemp D.J. Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 38: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with phage displaying the F1 or F2 peptide as the primary reagents followed by rabbit anti-M13 antibody. After incubation and washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used in the final detection step. The P. falciparum cloned lines 3D7 and HB3 were grown to a parasitemia of ∼10% late stage (schizont). Following Percoll purification (37Dluzewski A.R. Ling I.T. Rangachari K. Bates P.A. Wilson R.J.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1984; 78: 622-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), schizonts were mixed with uninfected erythrocytes and aliquoted into microwells containing the test/control solutions. A reference smear was examined and retained (∼3–4% initial parasitemia). After ∼20 h in culture, smears were made to determine the number of invaded erythrocytes (cells containing ring stage parasites). Parasitemias were determined by counting 1000 cells from methanol-fixed, Giemsa-stained thin blood films. To identify peptides that have affinity for AMA1, a phage library displaying random 15-residue peptides was panned against immobilized AMA1. A dramatic enrichment of phage with affinity for the antigen was observed after the third round of panning (Fig. 1 A). These pools of phage showed no binding to the irrelevant proteins BSA and the ring infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) (Fig. 1 B), but did bind to PcAMA1, which shares 52% amino acid sequence identity with PfAMA1. Individual phage clones were examined for their ability to bind either PfAMA1 or PcAMA1. It is clear that some clones were able to bind only to PfAMA1 (Fig. 2 A,clones 2, 4–6, 8, and 9), whereas other clones bound to both PfAMA1 and PcAMA1 (clones 1, 3, and 7). The binding activity was conferred by the displayed peptides because phage lacking a peptide (control (C)) and two phage clones picked at random from the unpanned peptide library (lib1 and lib2) were unable to bind to either PfAMA1 or PcAMA1 (Fig. 2 A). None of the clones examined displayed any binding to the irrelevant RESA protein. Sequencing the DNA inserts of over 30 phage clones that bound PfAMA1 and translation of the corresponding peptide sequences allowed us to classify all of binding clones into one of three groups (Fig. 2 B). The majority of binding clones consisted of the sequence GWRLLGFGPASSFSM (F1 peptide), whereas the remainder consisted of either TRLFRVPVLPSGVTS (F2 peptide) or PFARAPVEHHDVVGL (F3 peptide). Realignment of the latter two sequences revealed a common motif;φφRXPVXXXXV, where φ represents a hydrophobic residue and X represents any residue. Representative clones from each group were selected, and their binding properties were examined further. Phage displaying a peptide of the F1 class (Fig. 2 A, clones 2, 4–6,8, and 9) recognized only PfAMA1 and had no reactivity with PcAMA1. Phage expressing peptides from the F2 and F3 groups (Fig. 2 A, clones 1,3, and 7) bound to recombinant PfAMA1 and PcAMA1. Phage clones displaying each of the three peptides bound to PfAMA1 in a dose-dependent manner, although the F1 and F3 peptides appeared to have an ∼10-fold higher relative affinity compared with the F2 peptide (Fig. 2 C). Absolute affinities were difficult to estimate from these data because the presence of up to five copies of peptide on each phage particle may impart avidity effects that are difficult to predict. Phage containing a peptide picked at random from the unpanned library and consisting of the sequence GDVWLFKTSTSHFAR (F5 peptide) were unable to bind to PfAMA1 even at phage concentrations of 1011 colony-forming units/ml (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether the isolated peptides can recognize native as well as recombinant AMA1, we used the peptide-displaying phage as reagents in fluorescence microscopy and Western blot assays. The presence of the phage particle attached to the peptide enabled us to use an anti-phage antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or HRP to assess the binding of peptides to AMA1, as shown schematically in Fig. 3 A. When phage displaying the F1 peptide were incubated on thin blood films of the P. falciparum 3D7 strain, a distinct merozoite apical fluorescence was observed in trophozoite and schizont stage parasites and was indistinguishable from that obtained with rabbit antiserum raised against PfAMA1 (data not shown) and similar to that found previously by other workers (1Peterson M.G. Marshall V.M. Smythe J.A. Crewther P.E. Lew A. Silva A. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3151-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 44Narum D.L. Thomas A.W. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2000; 109: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the reported apical location of AMA1 in mature parasites, followed by a reorganization of AMA1 to the merozoite surface. As expected, when this assay was carried out using phage displaying an irrelevant 15-residue peptide, no fluorescence was seen (data not shown). Further evidence that the F1 peptide binds specifically to AMA1 was obtained by Western analysis of parasite extracts using F1 peptide-displaying phage as the primary reagents. Two polypeptides of ∼80 and 60 kDa were strongly recognized by the F1 phage probe (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Polypeptides of identical sizes were recognized by rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant AMA1 (Fig. 3 B, left panel). The molecular masses of the two polypeptides are in agreement with the previously reported masses of the full-length AMA1 gene product (80–83 kDa) and the 62–63-kDa processed form (1Peterson M.G.

Parasitol. 1990; 70: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). F1 phage and rabbit anti-AMA1 antiserum also recognized a polypeptide of ∼40 kDa from parasite material, which is likely to result from a secondary processing event within the parasite (47Howell S.A.

Both rabbit anti-AMA1 antiserum and F1 phage recognized the E. coli cell-expressed AMA1 ectodomain (Fig. 3 B).

https://openalex.org/W2056913254,"Ilv5p is a bifunctional mitochondrial protein inSaccharomyces cerevisiae required for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and for the stability of wild-type (ρ+) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mutant forms of Ilv5p defective in mtDNA stability (a+D−) are present as 5–10 punctate structures in mitochondria, whereas mutants lacking enzymatic function (a−D+) show a reticular distribution, as does wild-type Ilv5p. a+D− ilv5mutations are recessive, and the mutant protein is redistributed to a reticular form when co-expressed with wild-type Ilv5p. Ilv5p proteins that are punctate in vivo are also less soluble in detergent extracts of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that the punctate foci in a+D− Ilv5p mutants are aggregates of the protein. a+D− Ilv5p proteins are selectively degraded in cells lacking a functional mitochondrial genome, but only in cells grown under derepressing conditions. The targeted degradation of a+D− Ilv5p, which occurs even when co-expressed with wild-type Ilv5p, is mediated by the glucose-repressible chaperone, Hsp78, and by the ATP-dependent Pim1p protease, whose activity may be modulated by ρ+ mtDNA.

The stability and inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TTC, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride inSaccharomyces cerevisiae depends on a surprisingly large number of proteins, some of which would not have been anticipated to be involved in mtDNA transactions (1Contamine V. Picard M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 281-315Google Scholar). One example is Ilv5p, a mitochondrial NADPH-requiring acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase that catalyzes parallel steps in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (2Kakar S.N. Wagner R.P. Genetics. 1964; 49: 213-222Google Scholar, 3Petersen J.G.L. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9631-9651Google Scholar). Cells that lack Ilv5p are blocked in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and therefore require isoleucine, leucine, and valine for growth. An unanticipated function for Ilv5p in mtDNA transactions was revealed in studies of suppression of a mtDNA instability phenotype in cells with a deletion of the ABF2 gene (4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar). Abf2p is an abundant high mobility group-box protein that binds non-specifically to mtDNA (5Diffley J.F. Stillman B. Proc. Natl.

Newman S.M. Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1763-1776Google Scholar). Overexpression of Ilv5p by as little as 2- to 3-fold is sufficient to suppress the mtDNA instability phenotype of abf2Δ cells (4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar). Moreover, wild-type (ρ+) mtDNA is unstable in ilv5Δ cells, leading to the production of ρ− petites (which contain amplified fragments of the ρ+ genome). Finally, Ilv5p has also been shown to be involved in the redistribution of mtDNA nucleoids, which occurs in response to amino acid starvation (9MacAlpine D.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 767-775Google Scholar). These effects do not depend on the operation of the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway, because deletion of another essential gene in that pathway, ILV2, has no effect on mtDNA stability (4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar). These studies led to the conclusion that Ilv5p is a bifunctional protein required for the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids and for mtDNA transactions. Further evidence for the bifunctional nature of Ilv5p has come from a detailed mutational analysis of the protein (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar). Recessive point mutants of Ilv5p were identified that resulted in either the loss in Ilv5p of branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic function (a−D+) or its mtDNA stability function (a+ D−). Like ilv5Δ cells, ρ+ mtDNA was unstable in a+ D−mutants and gave rise to ρ− petites. In some of the a+ D− mutants, ρ− petites were produced at rates comparable to that of ilv5Δ cells, whereas other mutants of this class displayed either a weaker or a stronger (hypermorphic) mtDNA instability phenotype. The affected residues of the two classes of point mutants of Ilv5p cluster to distinct and different regions of the 3-dimensional structure of the spinach ortholog of Ilv5p. That protein has 31% sequence identity with yeast Ilv5p and is the only structure currently available for an acetohydroxyacid reductoisomerase (11Biou V. Dumas R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Job D. Pebay-Peyroula E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3405-3415Google Scholar). Mutations of the a−D+ class map to a region buried within the core of the protein at or close to residues known to bind the substrate and cofactors, NADPH and Mg2+. By contrast, the majority of mutations of the a+ D− class map within or adjacent to two α-helices, also present in Ilv5p of yeast, that are on the surface of the spinach protein. These data suggested that the a+ D− mutations could affect intermolecular interactions of the yeast Ilv5p. The mtDNA redistribution function of Ilv5p (9MacAlpine D.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 767-775Google Scholar) was also found to be defective in a+D− mutants (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar), suggesting that the stability and organizational state of mtDNA nucleoids are functionally linked. Finally, none of these mtDNA transaction defects is observed in the a−D+ mutants, further confirming that branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis per se is not connected to these mtDNA activities. We show here that the a+D− mutant proteins are present as a small number of aggregated, punctate structures within mitochondria and that the extent of aggregation is related to the severity of the mtDNA instability phenotype. In contrast, wild-type Ilv5p and the a−D+ mutants have a distinctly reticular distribution within mitochondria. Surprisingly, we find that the a+D− mutant proteins are unstable in petite cells, but not in ρ+ cells, and that the instability is glucose-repressible. This instability is independent of the organizational state of the a+D− mutant protein and can be attributed to the Pim1p protease, whose activity we have found to be regulated by the glucose-repressible chaperone Hsp78. All strains described were derivatives of either 14CWW (MATa ade2-1 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-3,112 ρ+(10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar); 14CWWΔilv5 (MATa ade2-1 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-3,112 ilv5::URA3ρ+ (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar); or 14CWWΔilv5u−(MATa ade2-1 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-3,112 ilv5:: ura3 ρ+). Strains I267F and W327R (containing at the ILV5 locus integrated copies of weak and strong a+D−mutant alleles, respectively), or D255E (containing an integrated a−D+ allele at the ILV5 locus), were created by transplacing each mutant allele into strain 14CWWΔilv5. ILV5his and W327Rhis strains were created by transplacing the respective His6-tagged alleles into strain 14CWWΔilv5. The ρ− petite genome HS40 was introduced into strains by cytoduction as described (9MacAlpine D.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 767-775Google Scholar). ρ° strains were produced by passage of cells through liquid YPD medium containing 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Diploid strains 303V5/14V5G, 303W327R/14V5G, and 303W327R/14W327RG were created by transplacing the a+D− mutant allele W327R into a W303 (MATα leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 can1-100 ade2-1 ura3-1) strain carrying theilv5::ura3 null allele (4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar) at the ILV5locus, then mating this strain (303W327R) or wild-type W303 with 14CWW strains carrying wild-type ILV5-GFP or a+D− mutant W327R-GFP alleles. Diploid strains 14V5/14V5G and 14W327R/14V5G were created by transplacing the wild-typeILV5-GFP allele into strain 14CWWΔilv5 at theILV5 locus, then mating-type switching this strain using pGAL-HO (12Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 132-146Google Scholar), to create strain αILV5-GFP, which was mated with strain 14CWW or W327R, respectively. Deletion of HSP78 and PIM1 was performed by PCR amplification of the respective KanMX4 deletion module from the commercially available strains (Research Genetics, Invitrogen, CA). These PCR products were then used to replace the wild-type genes in ρ° isolates of 14CWW or W327R. All transplaced mutant alleles and deleted genes were confirmed by PCR, Southern analysis, or DNA sequencing. Cells were grown at 30 °C in YP medium (1% yeast extract and 2% Bacto-Peptone) containing either 2% dextrose (YPD), 3% glycerol (YPGly), or 2% raffinose (YPRaff), or YNB medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) containing 1% casamino acids and either 2% dextrose (YNBD+cas) or 3% glycerol (YNBGly+cas), or 2% raffinose (YNBRaff+cas). Additional amino acids were supplemented as required. Construction of plasmids containing a+D− mutants I267F and W327R and a−D+ mutant D255E was described previously (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged fusion of wild-type ILV5 was constructed as follows. Using the primers 5′-ACCTCTAGTGGATCCGTAGATGTAATC-3′ and 5′-TTATTTTCCTCGAGATTGGTTTTCTGGTC-3′, a 2379-bp fragment containing the ILV5 promoter and coding sequence was amplified from pRS-ILV5 (4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar) and digested withBamHI and XhoI. The coding sequence of bGFP was then excised from pGEM7zf(+)bGFP, containing bGFP (13Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Google Scholar), cloned into theXhoI/KpnI sites in pGEM7zf(+) (Promega), usingXhoI and HindIII. The ILV5 fragment was fused to bGFP by excising the BamHI/HindIII fragment from pBS-ILVc+3′ (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar) and ligating theBamHI/XhoI ILV5 fragment, along with the XhoI/HindIII bGFP fragment, into the remaining vector to produce pBS-ILV5GFP. TheBamHI/BlpI fragment from this vector was then used to replace the same fragment in pRS-ILV5 to produce pRS-ILV5GFP. The mutant ILV5 proteins were GFP-tagged in a similar fashion. Wild-type ILV5 and the W327R ilv5 mutant were tagged with His6 by mutagenizing both pRS-ILV5(4Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Google Scholar) and pRSW327R (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar), using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In VitroMutagenesis kit (version 2, Bio-Rad), so as to incorporate the His6 sequence before the stop codon. p416TEFHSP78 was created by amplifying HSP78, lacking its own promoter, from genomic DNA using primers 5′-GAAAATCTTACTAGTTTAAATATGTTAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTCGACTTACTTTTCAG-3′, then digesting withSpeI and SalI and ligating this fragment into p416TEF (14Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar) at the same sites. Mitochondria were purified as described previously (15Kaufman B.A. Newman S.M. Hallberg R.L. Slaughter C.A. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Google Scholar), except that the sucrose gradient floatation step was omitted. Mitochondria were divided into 0.5 mg or 1 mg aliquots, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mmimidizole (Sigma)/HCl, 5 mm ε-amino-n-caproic acid (Sigma), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin (U. S. Biological), 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma)), incubated on ice for 5 min, and lysed by adding 2 g ofn-dodecylmaltoside (Roche) per g of mitochondria and incubating on ice for 10 min. Insoluble material was then isolated by centrifugation of the lysed mitochondria for 20 min at 20,817 ×g. The pellet was then resuspended in an equal volume of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.125 m Tris/HCl, 1% SDS, 4% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). For Ni2+ chromatographic purification of His6-tagged Ilv5p, purified mitochondria were resuspended to between 1 and 2 mg/ml in column buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm imidizole, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1× Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Resuspended mitochondria were then broken by sonication on ice for four periods of 15 s at 7% output, using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Danbury, CT). Broken mitochondria were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,400 ×g. The pellet was then resupended in an equal volume of column buffer, and the supernatant was added to 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) which had been washed in column buffer and gently mixed in a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was then washed with 15 ml of wash buffer (the same as column buffer with the imidizole concentration increased to 20 mm), and the bound protein was eluted with three sequential additions of 0.5 ml of elution buffer (the same as column buffer with the imidizole concentration increased to 250 mm and the addition of 20% glycerol). Trichloroacetic acid precipitates of total yeast cell proteins were prepared from OD600 0.6–1.0 cultures as described previously (16Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29476-29482Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, equal volumes of extract were solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (see above); samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and separated using the Ready Gel system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Hoefer SemiPhor semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection of proteins was carried out using primary rabbit anti-Ilv5p (15Kaufman B.A. Newman S.M. Hallberg R.L. Slaughter C.A. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Google Scholar) and mouse anti-Porin (Molecular Probes). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies and were visualized using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). Log-phase cells were observed live using a Leica microscope (model DMRXE) equipped with an HBO 100 W/2 mercury arc lamp, and a 100× Plan-Apochromat objective lens. Differential interference contrast and green fluorescent protein were visualized using filter sets described previously (13Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Google Scholar). Mitotracker was visualized using 515–560 nm excitation and >590 nm long pass emission filters. Images were captured with a color-chilled three charge-coupled device camera system (model C5810; Hamamatsu Photonics) and processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Cells were stained with Mitotracker Red CM-H2XRos (Molecular Probes), by adding Mitotracker to log-phase growing cells to a final concentration of 0.5 μm and incubating for 20 min at 30 °C, and pelleting the cells and washing three times in distilled water, before microscopy. To measure petite formation in the various strains, mid-log-phase cultures of strains grown in YNBGly+cas medium were transferred to YNBD+cas medium and grown for at least thirty generations. At various time points, cells were plated onto YNBD+cas plates and grown for 3 days at 30 °C. ρ+ and petite colonies were distinguished by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) overlay (17Ogur M. St. John R. Nagai S. Science. 1957; 125: 928-929Google Scholar), using 0.2% TTC (Sigma) with 0.8% agarose. Between fifty and three hundred colonies were counted for each time point. To obtain additional insight into the bifunctional nature of Ilv5p, we analyzed three Ilv5p mutants: two a+D− mutants, I267F and W327R, defective in ρ+ mtDNA stability, and one a−D+mutant, D255E, which has no effect on mtDNA stability but is defective in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. Centromeric vectors containing these mutant alleles, wild-type ILV5, or no insert were transformed into ilv5Δ cells. These transformants were pre-grown on glycerol medium (YNBGly+cas) to maintain ρ+ mtDNA and then transferred to glucose medium (YNBD+cas) and grown for at least thirty generations. At various time points, samples of each culture were plated onto YNBD+cas medium to determine the percentage of ρ+ cells in the population. In accordance with our previous results (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar), ρ+ mtDNA was unstable in ilv5Δ cells containing the empty vector, whereas it was completely stable in cells containing wild-typeILV5, or the a−D+ mutant D255E allele (Fig. 1). Although ρ+ mtDNA was unstable in both of the a+D− mutants, the degree of mtDNA instability was significantly different between them and ilv5Δ cells containing the control plasmid. Specifically, a+D− mutant I267F has a weaker mtDNA-instability phenotype than ilv5Δ cells, whereas a+D− mutant W327R has a much stronger mtDNA-instability phenotype than ilv5Δ cells (Fig. 1). We refer to these a+D− mutant alleles as weak and strong, respectively. To determine how these mutant forms of Ilv5p are distributed in mitochondria, we constructed C-terminal GFP fusion genes of wild-type Ilv5p and each of the mutant proteins and expressed these under control of the ILV5 promoter from centromeric plasmids transformed into ρ+ cells of strain 14CWWΔilv5u−. The wild-type yeast GFP fusion protein complemented all of the phenotypes of ilv5Δ cells, whereas the mutant derivatives reproduced the phenotypes of their respective untagged forms (data not shown). Although all of the Ilv5p-GFP fusions localized to mitochondria when visualized by fluorescence microscopy, there was a dramatic difference in the distribution of these proteins, which correlated with their effects on mtDNA stability: both the wild-type and the a−D+ mutant fusion protein, D255E, had a largely reticular morphology typical of a mitochondrial matrix protein (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, both the strong (W327R) and the weak (I267F) a+D−GFP-tagged alleles were mainly localized to just a few foci in mitochondria (on average between 5 and 10 when all sections throughout the cells were examined). Closer inspection of the distribution of these GFP-tagged proteins in mitochondria also indicated that some of the I267F a+D− Ilv5p-GFP was also reticular. The punctate distribution of the a+D−Ilv5p-GFP mutant proteins is not due to an alteration in mitochondrial morphology, because strains expressing these proteins exhibit normal mitochondrial structures as revealed by staining with MitoTracker (Fig.2 B). This reticular structure persists in wild-type and a+D− mutant ρ− and ρo petite cells (data not shown). The above findings raise the possibility that the mtDNA instability phenotype of the ilv5 a+D− mutants is related to their propensity to form punctate structures in mitochondria. Previous genetic studies established that all of theilv5 a+D− mutants are recessive (10Bateman J.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 1043-1052Google Scholar). This includes not only the mtDNA instability phenotype, but also the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of ilv5a+D− cells grown in medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source. Thus it was of interest to determine whether the punctate morphology of the a+D−mutant Ilv5p-GFP persists when co-expressed with wild-type Ilv5p. To address this, we introduced a centromeric plasmid containing the a+D− mutant, W327R Ilv5p-GFP, intoILV5 14CWW wild-type cells expressing untagged Ilv5p and compared the mutant Ilv5p-GFP morphology to that in strain 14CWWΔilv5u− transformed with the same plasmid. The results of this experiment (Fig. 2 C) show that there was a dramatic redistribution of W327R Ilv5p-GFP from tight, punctate structures when expressed alone to a largely reticular distribution when co-expressed with untagged, wild-type Ilv5p. This redistribution of a+D− mutant Ilv5p-GFP was also seen when a strain containing an integrated copy of W327R Ilv5p-GFP was transformed with pRS-ILV5 encoding wild-type Ilv5p (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the unusual punctate distribution of mutant a+D−Ilv5p is related to the defects in mtDNA transactions. Although wild-type Ilv5p shows a largely reticular distribution within mitochondria, Ilv5p has been recovered as a component of the mtDNA nucleoid (15Kaufman B.A. Newman S.M. Hallberg R.L. Slaughter C.A. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Google Scholar), suggesting some functional partitioning of the protein. Because there are fewer a+D− Ilv5p-GFP punctate structures than ρ+ mtDNA nucleoids, it has been difficult to assess with certainty whether these punctate structures co-localize with ρ+ mtDNA. However, we can ask whether the punctate morphology of a+D− Ilv5p-GFP depends on the presence of mtDNA. To this end, we transformed the centromeric plasmid containing W327R Ilv5p-GFP into a ρ° derivative of strain 14CWWΔilv5u− and examined the distribution of the protein in cells. The same plasmid was also transformed into the strain 14WWΔilv5u−HS40 containing the ρ− mtDNA HS40 (which consists of a 760-bp tandemly repeated fragment of the ρ+ genome). The same punctate foci of the a+D− mutant Ilv5p-GFP were seen in these ρ° and ρ− cells as in the ρ+ parent strain (Fig. 2 D), indicating that the punctate distribution of a+D− protein occurs independently of mtDNA. To gain additional insight to the intriguing differences between the a+D− mutant proteins and the a−D+ mutant and wild-type proteins, we determined the relative efficiency of solubilization of these proteins by extracting mitochondria isolated from cells expressing each of these proteins with the non-ionic detergent n-dodecylmaltoside (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mitochondrial extracts were separated into supernatant and pellet fractions, which were then analyzed by Western blotting to determine the distribution of Ilv5p and the outer membrane marker protein, porin (Fig.3 A). Whereas porin, wild-type Ilv5p, and a−D+ Ilv5p were nearly completely solubilized by n-dodecylmaltoside, only about 40% of the strong (W327R) and 70% of the weak (I267F) a+D− Ilv5p mutants were solubilized by this treatment. These data correlate with the respective morphological distribution of the wild-type and mutant Ilv5p-GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A) and suggest that the punctate structures formed by Ilv5p in the a+D− mutants are aggregated species with reduced detergent solubility compared with wild-type and a−D+ mutant Ilv5p. Because a+D− mutant Ilv5p is redistributed in mitochondria from a punctate to a largely reticular morphology when co-expressed with wild-type Ilv5p, we could ask whether the reduced detergent solubility of a+D− mutant Ilv5p was a consequence of its organizational state within mitochondria, or some intrinsic property of the mutant protein, independent of how it is organized. When mitochondria from glycerol-grown diploid cells co-expressing wild-type Ilv5p-GFP and untagged a+D− W327R mutant protein were extracted withn-dodecylmaltoside, much more of the mutant protein was solubilized by the detergent than when both untagged and GFP-tagged mutant proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 3 B). As expected, both the GFP-tagged and untagged wild-type Ilv5p were nearly completely solublized by n-dodecylmaltoside. These data suggest that the solubility of the mutant protein in n-dodecylmaltoside is related to its organizational state in mitochondria. One explanation for the redistribution of a+D− mutant Ilv5p when co-expressed with wild-type Ilv5p is that the wild-type protein interacts with the a+D− mutant protein, preventing its aggregation. To test for an interaction between these proteins, we constructed C-terminal His6-tagged derivatives of wild-typeILV5 and W327R a+D− mutantilv5 and integrated these at the ILV5 locus to produce strains ILV5his and W327Rhis, respectively. StrainILV5his was then transformed with a plasmid expressing wild-type Ilv5p-GFP, whereas strain W327Rhis was transformed with plasmids expressing either wild-type Ilv5p-GFP or a+D− mutant W327R Ilv5p-GFP. As a control, the wild-type strain 14CWW was transformed with the plasmid expressing wild-type Ilv5p-GFP. Mitochondria from these strains were isolated and broken by sonication, and the soluble extracts were chromatographed on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bound and unbound material was then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Ilv5p antiserum, which detects both the His6- and GFP-tagged forms. The results of these experiments (Fig. 4,A–C) show that, in all of the combinations of wild-type and mutant Ilv5p examined, affinity purification of either wild-type or mutant His6 derivatives resulted in co-elution of the corresponding wild-type or mutant GFP-tagged form, whereas no material was found in the bound fraction in the control lacking a His6-tagged derivative (Fig. 4 D). These data show that different forms of Ilv5p can interact and suggest that the association between a+D− mutant and wild-type Ilv5p prevents aggregation of the mutant Ilv5p. Although microscopy experiments indicated that the punctate morphology of the strong a+D− mutant protein is independent of mtDNA (Fig. 2 D), we noticed that there was a significant decrease in the abundance of a+D− mutant W327R Ilv5p in ρ° petite cells grown in raffinose medium. To investigate this further, we compared the abundance of Ilv5p in wild-type, the a−D+ mutant, and both the strong and weak a+D− Ilv5p mutants in ρ+, ρ−, and ρ° petite cells grown in media containing different carbon sources. Because ρ+ mtDNA is unstable in a+D− cells grown on fermentable carbon sources, we carried out our initial analysis of the stability of the various forms of Ilv5p in ρ+ cells grown in glycerol medium. Under these conditions, wild-type and mutant forms of Ilv5p were present at comparable abundance (Fig.5 A). However, in either a ρ− or a ρ° petite strain grown on raffinose, a non-repressing, fermentable carbon source, both of the a+D− mutant proteins were unstable, whereas neither wild-type Ilv5p nor the a−D+ mutant Ilv5p were affected (Fig. 5, B and D). By contrast, when these petite strains were grown in glucose medium, the a+D− mutant proteins were as stable as the wild-type or a−D+ mutant protein (Fig. 5,C and E). These data suggest that one or more factors accounting for the instability of the a+D− mutant proteins in petites is glucose-repressible. The extent of the instability of Ilv5p in the strong and weak a+D− mutants (Fig. 5,B and D) also correlated with the severity of the mtDNA instability phenotype associated with these mutations (Fig. 1). Fig. 5 (B and D) show that the level of Ilv5p in the strong mutant, W327R, was severalfold lower than that of the weak mutant, I267F. Northern blot analysis revealed that there was no difference in the mRNA abundance of wild-type and mutantilv5 transcripts in cells grown in the different media noted above (data not shown), indicating that the cause of the instability of the a+D− mutant proteins is post-transcriptional. We wanted to compare the stability of the wild-type and mutant forms of Ilv5p in ρ+ and petite cells grown on identical carbon sources and to determine whether the organizational state of a+D− mutant Ilv5p proteins is an underlying factor in the instability of these mutant proteins. To do this we used a ρ+ diploid strain (W327R/ILV5-GFP), in which the W327R a+D− mutant allele was complemented by a wild-type copy of ILV5-GFP. Given that a+D− ilv5 mutations are recessive, ρ+ mtDNA would be stable in those cells grown in raffinose or glucose medium. As a control, we used the diploid strainILV5/ILV5-GFP containing untagged and GFP-tagged wild-typeILV5 alleles. In W327R/ILV5-GFP ρ° cells, the mutant Ilv5p was unstable when those cells were grown on raffinose medium, exactly as we had observed in cells expressing only the mutant Ilv5p (Fig. 6 A). As expected, the mutant Ilv5p was stable in W327R/ILV5-GF"
https://openalex.org/W2164163172,"Germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), an orphan nuclear receptor, is essential for mouse embryogenesis. GCNF specifically binds to a DR0 response element via its DNA binding domain (DBD) in vitro and functions as a repressor of gene transcription. To further study the role of GCNF during embryogenesis, we have employed a Cre/loxP strategy and generated a line ofGCNF mutant mice (GCNF lox/lox) in which the 243-base pair DBD-encoding exon has been deleted in the germline. However, the ligand binding domain (LBD) of GCNF is still expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in theGCNF lox/lox mice.GCNF lox/lox mice die at 9.5–10.5 days postcoitum. The tailbuds of these mutant embryos protrude outside the yolk sac. Expression of Oct-4 in the somatic cells ofGCNF lox/lox embryos at 8.25 days postcoitum was not silenced as in the GCNF +/+ embryos. Therefore, GCNF lox/lox mice phenocopy theGCNF −/− mice. Our results indicate that the DBD is essential for the function of GCNF during early mouse embryogenesis, and that the LBD does not mediate any function independent of the DBD at this stage of embryonic development. Our results also suggest that GCNF is indeed a transcriptional factor that represses gene transcription mediated via its DBD. Germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), an orphan nuclear receptor, is essential for mouse embryogenesis. GCNF specifically binds to a DR0 response element via its DNA binding domain (DBD) in vitro and functions as a repressor of gene transcription. To further study the role of GCNF during embryogenesis, we have employed a Cre/loxP strategy and generated a line ofGCNF mutant mice (GCNF lox/lox) in which the 243-base pair DBD-encoding exon has been deleted in the germline. However, the ligand binding domain (LBD) of GCNF is still expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in theGCNF lox/lox mice.GCNF lox/lox mice die at 9.5–10.5 days postcoitum. The tailbuds of these mutant embryos protrude outside the yolk sac. Expression of Oct-4 in the somatic cells ofGCNF lox/lox embryos at 8.25 days postcoitum was not silenced as in the GCNF +/+ embryos. Therefore, GCNF lox/lox mice phenocopy theGCNF −/− mice. Our results indicate that the DBD is essential for the function of GCNF during early mouse embryogenesis, and that the LBD does not mediate any function independent of the DBD at this stage of embryonic development. Our results also suggest that GCNF is indeed a transcriptional factor that represses gene transcription mediated via its DBD. germ cell nuclear factor DNA binding domain ligand-binding domain days postcoitum embryonic stem reverse transcription phosphoglycerate kinase cytomegalovirus Germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF,1 NR6A1) is a novel orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily as it is more distantly related to other members and forms a sixth and separate subbranch of the family (1Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 2Cooney A.J.

GCNF was initially cloned by our laboratory using low stringency screening with a DNA binding domain (DBD) probe (3Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

To date, homologs ofGCNF have been cloned from several other species including human, Xenopus, and zebrafish (2Cooney A.J. Katz D. Hummelke G. Jackson K. Amer.

Sequence analysis has shown that GCNF homologs have high homology in the DBD and the ligand binding domain (LBD) among different species (2Cooney A.J. Katz D. Hummelke G. Jackson K. Amer.

This high amino acid identity within the DBD and LBD across species indicates the functional conservation of GCNF protein in binding to its DNA-response element and its putative ligand during evolution. Indeed, the DNA binding specificity of GCNF is conserved among mouse, human and Xenopus (3Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

Hublitz P. Kohler F. Moras D. Schule R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 690-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Characterization of the DNA binding motif of GCNF led to the identification of several potential target genes for GCNF including the protamine 1 and 2 genes in the testis (12Yan Z.H. Medvedev A.

In the absence of a ligand, GCNF functions to repress the transcription of these target genes in vitro and in vivo (7Lan Z.J. Cooney A.J. Recent Res. Devel.

This expression pattern indicates that GCNF may play a role in gametogenesis and normal embryonic development during gastrulation. Recently, we have generated a GCNF knockout mouse model (GCNF −/−) using a conventional embryonic stem cell strategy to address the functions of GCNF during mammalian embryogenesis (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Insertion of PGK-neomycin (PGK-neo) into the GCNF locus causes embryonic lethality at 9.5–10.5 dpc. The most remarkable phenotype of theseGCNF mutant embryos is that the posterior tailbud develops outside of the yolk sac (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These mutant embryos have serious defects in posterior and trunk development and somitogenesis (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the POU domain transcription factor,Oct4, is not repressed in the somatic cells of theseGCNF mutant embryos at 8.25–8.75 dpc when it is silenced in normal embryos (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It appears that GCNF is required for normal anteroposterior development, somitogenesis, and Oct4expression in mouse embryos. However, recent studies in several other laboratories have shown that the introduction of the PGK-neointo the mouse genome by conventional ES cell targeting can cause unexpected phenotypes in the resulting animal models (28Holzenberger M.

Collins F.S. Genesis. 2001; 30: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, generation and phenotypic analysis of a line ofGCNF mutant mice, in which the PGK-neo cassette is removed, will definitely clarify whether the phenotypes observed in the conventional GCNF knockout mice are due to the ablation of the GCNF gene or to the insertion of the PGK-neo cassette in the GCNF allele, causing misexpression of neighboring genes such as the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) gene, which is located 3′ to the GCNFgene. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the DBD of GCNF is required to bind to its response elements and regulate gene transcription. Deletion of the 55 amino acid residues containing the DBD zinc finger region in the N terminus of Xenopus GCNF abolishes its DNA binding activity, and overexpression of this truncated GCNF protein in Xenopus embryos causes abnormal head development (14David R. Joos T.O. Dreyer C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). How much of the function of GCNF is mediated by the DBD in mouse embryonic development remains to be determined. GCNF may have DNA binding-independent activities, similar to other nuclear receptors such as glucocorticoid receptor (33Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and TR3 (34Li H. Kolluri S.K., Gu, J. Dawson M.I. Cao X.

In this study, we have generated a line of GCNF mutant mice lacking the 243-bp DBD-encoding exon 4 of the GCNF gene (9Susens U. Borgmeyer U. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (, research 0006): 1-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Cre/loxP system (35Rossant J. McMahon A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found that these mutant mice have the same phenotypes as the conventional GCNF knockout mice (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike the conventional GCNF knockout mice, the LBD of GCNF was still expressed in these mutant embryos at both the mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, the DBD of GCNF is essential for mediating the function of GCNF during mouse embryonic development. Genomic clones of the murine GCNF gene have been isolated from a 129Sv strain mouse genomic library (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was constructed from a genomic clone containing exon 4 encoding the GCNF DBD. First, oligonucleotides containing an XhoI restriction site and a loxP site were synthesized and then inserted into a neo/tkselection cassette (pNeoTKLOX, generously provided by Dr. Allan Bradley) flanked by two loxP sites to generate the plasmid ZJ-1. A second plasmid, ZJ-2, was constructed when the 3.6-kbBglI/ApaI fragment, downstream of the DBD exon from the genomic clone, was ligated into the BstXI site of the plasmid ZJ-1 in the presence of linkers. Then, the 1.3-kbBsiEI/BglI fragment flanking exon 4 from the genomic clone was inserted into the SalI site of the plasmid ZJ-2 to generate the plasmid ZJ-4. Finally the targeting vector, ZJ-5, was constructed when the 5.1-kb EcoRV/BsiEI fragment from the genomic clone 5′ of the DBD exon was inserted into the KpnI site of the ZJ-4 plasmid in the presence of linkers. This targeting vector (ZJ-5) contains 6.4 kb of homologous DNA on the 5′-long arm and 3.6 kb of homologous sequence on the 3′-short arm flanking the neo/tk cassette (Fig. 1 A). GCNF lox mice were generated by homologous recombination in the AB1.2 ES cell line (provided by Dr. Allan Bradley) using the Cre/loxP system. TheKpnI-linearized targeting vector ZL-5 (20 μg) was electroporated into 107 ES cells, and stably transfected clones were isolated after selection with 400 μg/ml G418 for 10 days. Homologously recombined clones were identified by mini-Southern blot analysis using 5′-GCNF and neo probes (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequently, correctly recombined clones were amplified and then transiently transfected with a Cre expression vector (pOG231, 1 μg) (36O'Gorman S. Dagenais N.A. Qian M. Marchuk Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). After negative selection in FIAU (1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodo)uracil), surviving clones were picked and analyzed for recombination of the two loxP sites using mini-Southern blot analysis with the 5′-GCNF and neo probes. Correctly recombined clones were expanded and microinjected into mouse C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric animals. Male chimeric mice (greater than 90% agouti coat color) were bred with C57BL/6 female mice to generate heterozygous GCNF lox mice. Two clones produced chimeric males that demonstrated germ line transmission of theGCNF lox allele. HeterozygousGCNF lox mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous GCNF lox/lox embryos. Genomic DNA was extracted from either mouse tails or embryos. Genotypes of weaned mice or embryos were determined by Southern blot analysis using a 5′-GCNF probe or by PCR using two separate sets of primers. The primer set (Primer 1, 5′-CAGTGCTGACTTATCCATG-3′; Primer 2, 5′-TTCCTGTTCATGCCCATCT-3′, a 264-bp DNA product) and its PCR reactions for determining the wild typeGCNF allele were described previously (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The primer set (Primer 3, 5′-CCAATTCCCCCCAAAGTGTC-3′; Primer 4, 5′-CAGGTCGAGGGACCTATAAC-3′, a 400-bp DNA product) was used to determine the GCNF lox allele. PCR reactions for determining the GCNF lox allele were carried out for 35 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 54 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 2 min) in a buffer containing 2.5 mm MgCl2. Total RNA from embryos was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR analysis, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 60 min using 1 μg of total RNA as template and hexanucleotides as primers using the SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). To determine the presence of the DBD and LBD regions of the GCNF mRNA and β-actin mRNA in the embryos, PCR reactions with 1/10 of the cDNA were carried out for 40 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 52 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min) in a buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 with the following primer sets: GCNF DBD primers (Primer 5, 5′-CTGAACAACGAACCTGTCTC-3′; Primer 6, 5′-ACATGACACAGTTCTTGTCAC-3′; a 150-bp DNA product); LBD primers (Primer 7, 5′-CAGCAAGCAGATCTTTGGG-3′; Primer 8, 5′-TGACAAATGTACCAATACCGC-3′, a 260-bp DNA product); actin primers (ACTIN-F, 5′-TTGAGACCTTCAACACCCC-3′; ACTIN-R, 5′-AGCCAGAGCAGTAATCTCC-3′, a 593-bp DNA product). RNase protection analysis was performed using an Ambion RPA-III system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The [α-32P]UTP-labeled cRNA probe for the LBD of theGCNF mRNA was synthesized from a plasmid containing 260 bp GCNF cDNA sequence (nucleotides 1256–1516). Proteins from mouse embryos at 8 and 9 dpc were extracted in an extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton 100, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1× proteinase inhibitor). CMVGCNF protein and Cos-1 proteins were prepared from transiently transfected Cos-1 cells as described previously (18Hummelke G.C. Meistrich M.L. Cooney A.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed using a specific polyclonal antibody (LBD pAb) raised against a C-terminal polypeptide (amino acid residues from 477 to 495) of the GCNF protein (37Lan, Z. J., Gu, P., Xu, X. P., and Cooney, A. J. (2003) Biol. Reprod. in pressGoogle Scholar). Wild type and GCNF lox/lox embryos at the same somite stage were obtained on 7.5–8.5 dpc of pregnancies. The embryo yolk sacs were removed for genotyping. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cRNA probe used for Oct4 was as described by Scholeret al. (38Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Rohdewohld H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Histological analysis of embryonic sections was performed as previously described (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A Cre/loxP targeting strategy was used to delete the 243 bp DBD-encoding exon of the GCNF gene. As shown in Fig. 1 A, three loxP sites were introduced into a GCNF allele of ES cells by homologous recombination with the targeting vector. Mini-Southern blot analysis was performed to identify the ES clones that had gone under correct homologous recombination using 5′-GCNF and neoprobes (Fig. 1 B). Nineteen ES cell clones carrying three loxP sites were obtained from the screening of 160 ES cell clones. Subsequently, two independent ES cell clones carrying three loxP sites were amplified and then transiently transfected with a CMV-Cre expression plasmid to delete the GCNF DBD-encoding exon and theneo/tk cassette. ES cell clones carrying the recombinedGCNF lox allele were identified by the Southern blot analysis using the 5′-GCNF and neo probes (Fig. 1 C). Sixty-seven (of 80) ES cell clones carrying theGCNF lox allele were obtained, two of which were used to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric mice from each clone transmitted the recombined GCNF lox allele to their offspring. Heterozygous (GCNF +/lox) and homozygous (GCNF lox/lox) embryos were identified by Southern blot analysis and PCR (Fig. 1 D). At weaning, no homozygous GCNF lox/lox mice were obtained from the intercross of heterozygous mice (TableI), indicating that deletion of the DBD-encoding exon caused embryonic lethality, similar to theGCNF null mutant mice reported previously (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine when homozygous GCNF lox/lox mutants die, heterozygous females were sacrificed at various days postcoitum after mating with heterozygous males, and the embryos were collected and then genotyped by either PCR or Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 D). At 8.5–9.5 dpc, embryos obtained from theGCNF +/lox X GCNF +/loxmating showed the expected 1:2:1 Medelian ratio ofGCNF +/+, GCNF +/lox, andGCNF lox/lox genotypes (Table I). By 10.5–11 dpc, the litter size was reduced compared with that at 8.5–9.5 dpc, and no viable GCNF lox/lox embryos, except resorbing embryos, were obtained. These results confirm thatGCNF lox/lox embryos die at 9.5–10.5 dpc, similar to the GCNF null mutant embryos reported previously (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Table IGenotypes of weaned mice and dissected embryosAgeNumbers of mice/embryos (% of totals)GCNF+/+GCNF+/loxGCNFlox/loxDay 21 (weaned pups)34 (33.7%)67 (66.3%)0 (0%)10.5–11 dpc7 (29.2%)15 (62.5%)2 (8.3%)1-aResorbing embryos.8.5–9.5 dpc28 (26.7%)51 (48.6%)26 (24.8%)1-a Resorbing embryos. Open table in a new tab Since the size of the DBD-encoding exon of the GCNF gene is 243 bp and the loxP sites were inserted into the intron surrounding the DBD exon, we postulated that deletion of the 243-bp DBD-encoding exon should not cause a reading frameshift in the GCNF downstream LBD inGCNF lox/lox mutants (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the DBD of GCNF is deleted and the LBD of GCNF is still expressed in the GCNF lox/lox embryos, we performed RT-PCR analysis and RNase protection analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the DBD of the GCNF transcript was completely deleted in the GCNF lox/lox mutant embryos. However, the LBD of the GCNF transcript was still expressed in the mutant embryos (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the LBD protein is present in theGCNF lox/lox embryos, we performed Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against the LBD of GCNF. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a 58-kDa GCNF protein band was detected inGCNF +/+ and GCNF +/loxembryos but not in GCNF −/− embryos. A truncated GCNF protein band (50 kDa) was also detected in the heterozygous and homozygous GCNF lox embryos, indicating that the LBD is present inGCNF lox/lox embryos. Similar to GCNF −/− embryos, there was no gross morphological difference betweenGCNF +/+ and GCNF lox/loxembryos before 8.0 dpc. From 8.75 dpc, a protrusion of tissue started to appear at the base of the allantois ofGCNF lox/lox embryos (data not down). At 9.25–9.5 dpc, the tail bud continued to develop outside the yolk sac (Fig. 3 A). This phenotype was also observed in the GCNF −/− embryos. In addition, other phenotypes of these mutant embryos resembled those in GCNF −/− embryos (Fig. 3 A). TheGCNF lox/lox embryos did not undergo turning and remained in a lordotic position. Although the anterior neural tissue continued to grow, the anterior neural tube inGCNF lox/lox embryos remained open. Similar to GCNF −/− embryos, theGCNF lox/lox embryos also had a significant reduction of the trunk and posterior structures, with the somite number not greater than thirteen. Hindgut was never observed in these mutant embryos, and the pericardium was often dilated. The allantois inGCNF lox/lox embryos was often enlarged and was not always attached to the chorion, resulting in a lack of chorioallantoic development that probably contributed to the embryonic lethality. Another dramatic phenotype ofGCNF −/− embryos was the presence of a large invagination of neural epithelium within the primitive streak 8.5 dpc (Fig. 3 B). This large invagination was also observed inGCNF lox/lox embryos but not inGCNF +/+ embryos (Fig. 3 B). Oct4, a member of the POU homeodomain family of transcription factors, plays an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell potency and the establishment of the germ cell lineage (39Pesce M. Scholer H.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 55: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Oct4gene is expressed in the epiblast of mouse embryo at 6.5–7.5 dpc and then down-regulated from the anterior to the posterior during gastrulation (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A previous report has shown that GCNF can bind to the DR0 elements in the promoter of the Oct4 gene and repress the transcription of this gene and that the expression ofOct4 gene in large parts of theGCNF −/− embryos at 8.25-8.5 dpc is not silenced (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DBD of GCNF is essential for mediating GCNF-dependent repression of Oct4 gene transcription in vivo, we analyzed the expression ofOct4 in GCNF lox/lox embryos usingin situ hybridization assay. As shown in Fig. 4, Oct4 was expressed in theGCNF lox/lox embryos at 7.5 dpc, similar to theGCNF +/+ and GCNF −/−. By 8.25 dpc, Oct4 expression was restricted to primordial germ cells in the GCNF +/+ embryos. However,Oct4 derepressed expression domains were detected in the anterior and posterior of GCNF lox/lox andGCNF −/− embryos at 8.25 dpc (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the DBD of GCNF is required for GCNF to silence the expression of the Oct4 gene in somatic cells of mouse embryos. Nuclear receptors such as ER, PR, AR, TR, and RAR are well known transcription factors that bind their cognate DNA-responsive elements through their DNA binding domains and then regulate the expression of their target genes via their transactivation domains, which ultimately elicits their distinct physiological functions in response to their cognate hormones (40Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrilich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 836-839Google Scholar, 41Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Recently, DNA binding-independent functions of nuclear receptors such as GR (33Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J.

Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) have been described. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, GCNF has been shown to bind to DR0 elements and repress gene transcription. Similar to other orphan nuclear receptors, such as SF-1 (41Achermann J.C. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and TR3 (34Li H. Kolluri S.K., Gu, J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G., Lu, J.

Joos T.O. Dreyer C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or of 163 amino acid residues at the N terminus of mouse GCNF 3P. Gu and A. J. Cooney, unpublished data.abolishes its DNA binding activity. Replacement of the GCNFDBD-encoding exon by a PGK-neo cassette in the mouse germline using a conventional knockout strategy causes embryonic lethality at 9.5–10.5 dpc (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These mouse embryos have defects in the correct formation of somites and anteroposterior axis postgastrulation. In addition, unsilenced expression of theOct4 gene in somatic cells is observed in these mutant embryos at 8.25 dpc. Even though the DBD region of the GCNFmRNA is completely deleted in these mutant mice (24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether the phenotypes observed previously are due to the loss of GCNF or to the insertion of the PGK-neo cassette in theGCNF allele. Several studies in other laboratories have suggested that the introduction of PGK-neo cassettes can interfere with RNA processing of targeted transcripts (even when inserted in an intron) (28Holzenberger M. Leneuve P. Hamard G. Ducos B. Perin L. Binoux M. Le Bouc Y. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and cause position effects on neighboring genes, particularly when inserted within gene clusters and locus control regions (29Olson E.N. Arnold H.H. Rigby P.W. Wold B.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 30Seidl K.J. Manis J.P. Bottaro A. Zhang J. Davidson L. Kisselgof A.

A. 1996; 93: 13090-13095Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) leading to unexpected phenotypes in the resulting animal models. Additionally, bi-directional transcriptional activities of PGK-neo, normal sense PGK promoter activity, and aberrant antisense promoter activity in neomycin and PGK promoter regions, which drive the production of aberrant transcripts, have been reported in cultured cells (42Johnson P. Friedmann T. Gene. 1990; 88: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in vivo in mice (32Scacheri P.C. Crabtree J.S. Novotny E.A. Garrett-Beal L. Chen A. Edgemon K.A. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Collins F.S. Genesis. 2001; 30: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Considering that the SF-1 gene, encoding another nuclear receptor, is immediately adjacent to the GCNF gene in the mouse genome and is known to be involved in adrenal and gonadal development (43Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar), it is possible that insertion of the PGK-neo in the GCNF locus affects SF-1expression, complicating the interpretation of phenotypes observed in our conventional knockout embryos. Therefore, generation of a mouse line without the PGK-neo cassette in the GCNFlocus is necessary to determine the role of GCNF during embryonic development by comparison of the phenotypes of the conventional knockout embryos to those mice without the PGK-neoinsertion. In this study, we have successfully generatedGCNF lox/lox mice that do not contain the DBD-encoding exon of the GCNF gene nor the selection marker gene, PGK-neo, using Cre/loxP technology. Similarly to the conventional GCNF knockout mice,GCNF lox/lox mice died in utero at 9.5–10.5 dpc with defects in posterior embryonic development and the formation of somites and the anteroposterior axis. Expression of theOct4 gene in GCNF lox/lox embryos was not silenced in somatic cells at 8.25 dpc. Therefore,GCNF lox/lox mice phenocopy the conventionalGCNF knockout mice (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Chung A.C. Katz D. Pereira F.A. Jackson K.J. DeMayo F.J. Cooney A.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), indicating that the phenotypes observed in the conventional knockout embryos result from the ablation of GCNF, not from the insertion of the PGK-neo cassette into the GCNF locus, confirming that GCNF is essential for normal embryonic development. As no RNA splicing acceptor consensus sequences, which are located upstream of the DBD-encoding exon of the GCNF gene, were deleted in our knockout strategy and no consensus RNA splicing acceptor elements or transcription termination signals were included in the loxP site and its surrounding DNA sequences, it was possible that transcription of the GCNF gene inGCNF lox/lox mice could be initiated and that normal RNA splicing can occur between exon 3 and exon 5 forming a truncated GCNF message, which encodes a protein that does not contain the DBD but does have an intact LBD. Indeed, we found that the LBD region, but not the DBD region, of the GCNF mRNA was expressed in the GCNF lox/lox mice detected either by RT-PCR or by RNase protection assay (Fig. 2). Since the size of the DBD exon of the GCNF gene is 243 bp (9Susens U. Borgmeyer U. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (, research 0006): 1-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of this exon should not cause a reading frameshift in the downstream LBD. Using a specific GCNF polyclonal antibody raised against a 19-amino acid peptide at the C terminus, we found that a 58-kDa GCNF protein band was detected in the GCNF +/+ andGCNF +/lox mice but not in the conventionalGCNF knockout mice (Fig. 2) andGCNF lox/lox mice (Fig. 2). Instead, a 50- kDa-truncated protein band was detected in theGCNF lox (GCNF +/lox andGCNF lox/lox) embryos (Fig. 2). These studies suggest that the truncated GCNF transcript in theGCNF lox mice is translated into a 50-kDa protein that contains an intact LBD but not a DBD. These results clearly indicate that we have successfully deleted the DBD of GCNF in vivo. Although the truncated GCNF protein lacking only the DBD was observed in the GCNF lox mice (Fig. 2), phenotypes of these GCNF lox mice (Figs. 3 and 4) were the same as those of conventional GCNF knockout mice (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev.

Biol. 2001; 21: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which did not express GCNF protein (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the DBD of GCNF is essential for mediating the function of GCNF during early embryonic development. The results also suggest that at this stage of embryonic development the LBD of GCNF does not mediate any functions independent of the DBD. It should be emphasized that GCNF can bind to the DR0 element in the promoter of the Oct4 gene and repress the transcription of the Oct4 gene in vitro (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Loss of GCNF in the conventional GCNFknockout mice causes loss of repression of Oct4 expression in somatic cells (19Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in theGCNF lox/lox mice. Considering that the LBD of GCNF does not bind to DR0 element,3 we can conclude that GCNF is indeed a transcription factor that represses gene transcription in mouse embryos. In addition, the expressed GCNF LBD does not have a dominant negative effect as the GCNF +/lox mice are normal. The lack of a dominant negative effect is probably due to an inability of the wild type GCNF and the GCNF LBD to heterodimerize. In summary, we have generated a line of mice that expresses a truncated GCNF protein lacking only the DBD. These mice phenocopy the conventional GCNF knockout mice. This study clarifies that the phenotypes observed in the conventional GCNF knockout mice are due to the loss of GCNF, not to the insertion of the PGK-neo cassette into the GCNF locus, and that GCNF is essential for normal mouse embryonic development. More importantly, our results suggest that the DBD of GCNF is essential for the function of GCNF during embryonic development, that GCNF does not have DNA-binding independent activity as reported for other nuclear receptors such as GR and TR3 (33Reichardt H.M.

They are composed of catalytic and noncatalytic subunits, the role of these latter proteins often being difficult to assign. One of these complexes, the bc1 complex, is composed of three catalytic subunits including cytochrome b and seven or eight noncatalytic subunits. Recently, several mutations in the human cytochrome b gene have been linked to various diseases. We have studied in detail the effects of a cardiomyopathy generating mutation G252D in yeast. This mutation disturbs the biogenesis of the bc1 complex at 36 °C and decreases the steady-state level of the noncatalytic subunit Qcr9p. In addition, theG252D mutation and the deletion of QCR9 show synergetic defects that can be partially bypassed by suppressor mutations at position 252 and by a new cytochrome bmutation, P174T. Altogether, our results suggest that the supernumerary subunit Qcr9p enhances or stabilizes the interactions between the catalytic subunits, this role being essential at high temperature.

Numerous cellular functions are performed by oligomeric complexes composed of catalytic and noncatalytic subunits and the role of these latter proteins is often difficult to assign. Energy transduction in mitochondria involves five oligomeric complexes that are embedded within the inner membrane. One of these complexes, the bc1complex is composed of three catalytic and seven or eight noncatalytic subunits (for review, see Ref. 1Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The three catalytic subunits, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (Rieske) are conserved in the bacterial equivalents of this complex. However, several noncatalytic subunits are present in the mitochondrial bc1 complexes and are often referred to as supernumerary subunits although some are required for the enzymatic activity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the bc1complex contains seven supernumerary subunits that are conserved in the mammalian enzyme. The mammalian bc1 complex presents an additional subunit that has no equivalent in yeast. The mitochondrialbc1 complexes from bovine, chicken, and yeast have been crystallized (2Zhang Z. Huang L.

The bc1 complex transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and translocates protons into the intermembrane space, the resulting electrochemical gradient is utilized by the ATP synthase to produce ATP in the mitochondrial matrix. The bc1 complex exhibits two sites of ubiquinol binding, the Qo site in the intermembrane side and Qi site in the matrix side. The oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo site releases two electrons; one is transferred to Rieske, then to cytochromec1, and finally to cytochrome c. The second electron is transferred to the low potential hemeb L, then to the high potential hemeb H and to ubiquinone at the Qi site. Genetic analyses in yeast have shown that the absence of a catalytic subunit always leads to a complete block of electron transfer, whereas the absence of noncatalytic subunits causes various defects inbc1 complex activity (for review, Ref. 6Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For example, the absence of the supernumerary subunits Qcr7p or Qcr8p (7Schoppink P. Berden J. Grivell L. Eur. J.

The precise role of these supernumerary subunits and the nature of the functional interactions existing between them and the catalytic subunits still remain to be elucidated.Cytochrome b plays a crucial role in the activity of thebc1 complex because it harbors the two b hemes and participates in determining the shape of the two ubiquinone fixation sites. This integral membrane protein containing eight transmembrane segments is the only bc1 subunit encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The sequence alignment between yeast and bovine cytochrome b shows 51% identity and presents also a striking structural conservation between the cytochrome b of the two organisms (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H.

In particular, one mutation that substitutes a glycine by an aspartate residue at position 251 of cytochrome b (G251D) is associated with a histiocytoid cardiomyopathy (16Papadimitriou A.

Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This mutation is located in the intermembrane space loop connecting the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments. Analyses on mitochondria purified from patient heart have established a defect in the succinate cytochrome coxidoreductase activity and in cytochrome b assembly, showing the importance of residue 251 for bc1 function.The fact that S. cerevisiae is a facultative aerobe, considerably facilitates the study of respiratory deficient mutants. Moreover, the rapid segregation of mitochondrial chromosomes in yeast permits the generation of homoplasmic cells containing only the mutated mitochondrial DNA. On the contrary, wild type and mutated mitochondrial DNAs often coexist within the cells of patients carrying a mitochondrial pathology. Thus, yeast mitochondrial mutants can provide invaluable help to fully understand the consequences of a mitochondrial mutation observed in a patient.In this paper, we have studied in detail the effects of the histiocytoid cardiomyopathy corresponding mutation in yeast (G252D). This mutation strongly disturbs the respiratory functions of cells grown at high temperature (36 °C). We have found that the presence of the aspartate residue at position 252 renders the noncatalytic subunit Qcr9p essential for the activity of thebc1 complex at 28 °C, and that this defect can be bypassed by a second mutation in the cytochrome b gene (P174T) located in a region close to Rieske. We propose that the supernumerary subunit Qcr9p enhances or stabilizes the interactions between cytochromes b, c1, and Rieske, particularly at high temperature.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that the intron-less mitochondrial chromosome from the yeast S. cerevisiae carries a mutation leading to the substitution of a glycine residue by an aspartate at position 252 of cytochrome b. The same mutation has been recently described in a patient with a cardiomyopathy (17Andreu A. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) associated with a defect in succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (16Papadimitriou A. Neustein H.B. Dimauro S. Stanton R. Bresolin N. Pediatr. Res. 1984; 18: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This G252D mutation has no major effect on respiratory function of yeast cells grown at 28 °C, the appropriate growth temperature of yeast but leads to a 50% decrease of thebc1 complex activity at 36 °C, which is close to the temperature of the human body.A growing number of mutations in the human mitochondrial DNA were shown to be responsible for numerous pathologies (for review, see Ref. 30DiMauro S. Andreu A.L. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Among a dozen mutations mapped to the human cytochrome bgene, only two have been investigated in the yeast system (11Fisher N. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TheG34S mutation has been observed in a patient suffering from exercise intolerance (31Andreu A.L. Hanna M.G. Reichmann H. Bruno C. Penn A.S. Tanji K. Pallotti F. Iwata S. Bonilla E. Lach B. Morgan-Hughes J. DiMauro S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and the substitution of the corresponding glycine by aspartate in yeast leads to a total defect of thebc1 complex activity at 28 °C (32Coppee J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G339Emutation is responsible for a human myopathy and the same mutation totally abolishes the bc1 complex assembly in yeast at 28 °C (33Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Andreu A.L. Bruno C. Shanske S. Shtilbans A. Hirano M. Krishna S. Hayward L. Systrom D.S. Brown Jr., R.H. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, G252D is the first cytochromeb mutation corresponding to a human pathology that leads to a thermosensitive bc1 activity. This stresses the interest of testing different growth temperatures when using yeast as a model to study mutations implicated in human pathology.The glycine 252 of yeast cytochrome b is not only conserved in mammals and plants but is also present in several bacteria such asR. capsulatus. The G252D mutation leads to the substitution of a small amino acid by a large and negatively charged one. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that the respiratory defect is because of steric and/or electrostatic conflicts within cytochromeb or between cytochrome b and another subunit. The glycine 252 is located in the E-ef loop at the positive side of the membrane, close to the ubiquinol oxidation site, Qo, according to the crystal structure (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It was previously proposed (17Andreu A. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that the presence of Asp instead of Gly in human cytochrome b should cause charge repulsion with glutamate 271 of the Qo site (Glu-272 in yeast) and would impair hydroquinone binding. The fact that both the mutations D252N and D252Y, in an otherwise wild type background, totally restore the respiratory function at 36 °C suggests that the defect observed in the G252D mutant is rather because of the negative charge brought by the aspartate residue rather than the increased size. If this charge inhibits the Qo site function, cytochrome b can be only reduced at the Qi site. However, the cytochrome spectra of the Δqcr9 G252D double mutant, recorded with antimycin that blocks the Qi site, revealed the presence of reduced cytochrome b (data not shown). This suggests that the cytochrome b hemes can be reduced by ubiquinol at the Qo site in the G252D mutant.Our results suggest the existence of an interaction between cytochrome b residue 252 and Qcr9p, the mutation G252D leading to a decrease in the steady-state level of Qcr9p. However, according to Ref. 5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, residue 252 is far from Qcr9p and cannot directly interact with Qcr9p although cytochrome c1 is close to residue 252 (Fig. 6). Thus, it is tempting to propose that the interaction between residue 252 and Qcr9p would be a long range interaction via cytochrome c1.Because, the closest amino acid in cytochrome c1 is lysine 182, the G252D mutation could create an illegitimate electrostatic interaction with this positively charged amino acid. This illegitimate interaction would affect cytochrome c1conformation and partially destabilize Qcr9p or affect the insertion of Qcr9p within the membrane. This would lead to a decrease of thebc1 complex activity at high temperature, as in theΔqcr9 mutant. Previous studies have shown that Qcr9p interacts with Rieske and cytochrome c1 (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gonzalez-Halphen D. Lindorfer M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), therefore we propose that Qcr9p could enhance or stabilize the interactions between these two catalytic subunits. It was previously shown that in the total absence of Qcr9p, the conformation of Rieske and its iron-sulfur cluster insertion is altered (9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in theΔqcr9 G252D double mutant, the conformation of both cytochrome c1 and Rieske would be affected and this would completely prevent the electron transfer between Rieske and cytochrome c1 even at 28 °C. This hypothesis is consistent with our results showing a block in electron transfer between cytochrome b and cytochrome c1. However, direct evidence of this hypothetical illegitimate interaction could be provided by introducing a compensatory mutation in the partner residue,e.g. the proposed candidate lysine 182 of cytochromec1.The suppressor mutations able to restore the respiratory growth of theΔqcr9 G252D double mutant were mapped either at codon 252 or codon 174 of the cytochrome b gene. All partially compensate for the respiratory defect at 28 °C but not at 36 °C, suggesting that they restore the electron transfer between cytochromeb and cytochrome c1 but do not compensate for the absence of Qcr9p. This suggests that the cytochrome bsubstitutions, that we have isolated, cannot strengthen the interactions between Rieske and cytochrome c1 at high temperatures and thus cannot functionally substitute for Qcr9p. Whereas suppressor mutations at residue 252 could lower the illegitimate interactions occurring at this position in the original mutant, the suppression mechanism by proline 174 ought to be different. Both glycine 252 and proline 174 are located in the intermembrane space but are quite distant (Fig. 6), the proline 174 is at the vicinity of the tether domain of Rieske, which is necessary for the Rieske movement and the electron transfer between the iron-sulfur cluster and the heme of cytochrome c1 (2Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y. Kim K.K. Hung L. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 36Ghosh M. Wang Y. Ebert C.E. Vadlamuri S. Beattie D.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Darrouzet E. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3471-3476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Substituting a proline by a threonine in this domain could improve the interaction between Rieske and cytochrome c1 that is deficient in the Δqcr9 G252D double mutant, and allow partial electron transfer at 28 °C.Altogether, these results show that residue 252 plays an important role in the biogenesis of the bc1 complex at 36 °C and is probably involved in long range interactions within the bc1complex and between the supernumerary subunit Qcr9p and the two other catalytic subunits, cytochrome c1 and Rieske. It has recently been shown that protein-phospholipid interactions also play a role in the structure of the bc1 complex (38Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and it is well known that phospholipids are highly sensitive to temperature. Thus, elucidating the relative roles of noncatalytic subunits and phospholipids constitutes the next challenge to fully understand respiratory complex assembly at high temperatures. Numerous cellular functions are performed by oligomeric complexes composed of catalytic and noncatalytic subunits and the role of these latter proteins is often difficult to assign. Energy transduction in mitochondria involves five oligomeric complexes that are embedded within the inner membrane. One of these complexes, the bc1complex is composed of three catalytic and seven or eight noncatalytic subunits (for review, see Ref. 1Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The three catalytic subunits, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (Rieske) are conserved in the bacterial equivalents of this complex. However, several noncatalytic subunits are present in the mitochondrial bc1 complexes and are often referred to as supernumerary subunits although some are required for the enzymatic activity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the bc1complex contains seven supernumerary subunits that are conserved in the mammalian enzyme. The mammalian bc1 complex presents an additional subunit that has no equivalent in yeast. The mitochondrialbc1 complexes from bovine, chicken, and yeast have been crystallized (2Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y. Kim K.K. Hung L. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 3Xia D. Yu C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L.

Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and an analysis of these structures reveals that the general shape, size, and topology of the complexes are similar in the three organisms. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is required for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. The bc1 complex transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and translocates protons into the intermembrane space, the resulting electrochemical gradient is utilized by the ATP synthase to produce ATP in the mitochondrial matrix. The bc1 complex exhibits two sites of ubiquinol binding, the Qo site in the intermembrane side and Qi site in the matrix side. The oxidation of ubiquinol at the Qo site releases two electrons; one is transferred to Rieske, then to cytochromec1, and finally to cytochrome c. The second electron is transferred to the low potential hemeb L, then to the high potential hemeb H and to ubiquinone at the Qi site. Genetic analyses in yeast have shown that the absence of a catalytic subunit always leads to a complete block of electron transfer, whereas the absence of noncatalytic subunits causes various defects inbc1 complex activity (for review, Ref. 6Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For example, the absence of the supernumerary subunits Qcr7p or Qcr8p (7Schoppink P. Berden J. Grivell L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Maarse A. De Haan M. Schoppink P. Berden J. Grivell L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) leads to a complete respiratory deficiency at any temperature, whereas Qcr6p or Qcr9p appears to be essential only at 36 °C (9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yang M. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1270-1275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role of these supernumerary subunits and the nature of the functional interactions existing between them and the catalytic subunits still remain to be elucidated. Cytochrome b plays a crucial role in the activity of thebc1 complex because it harbors the two b hemes and participates in determining the shape of the two ubiquinone fixation sites. This integral membrane protein containing eight transmembrane segments is the only bc1 subunit encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The sequence alignment between yeast and bovine cytochrome b shows 51% identity and presents also a striking structural conservation between the cytochrome b of the two organisms (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Recently several mutations in the human cytochrome b gene have been linked to diseases such as cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (for review, see Ref. 11Fisher N. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and references therein; Refs. 12Legros F. Chatzoglou E. Frachon P. Ogier De Baulny H. Laforet P. Jardel C.

Neurol. 2002; 51: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, one mutation that substitutes a glycine by an aspartate residue at position 251 of cytochrome b (G251D) is associated with a histiocytoid cardiomyopathy (16Papadimitriou A. Neustein H.B. Dimauro S. Stanton R. Bresolin N. Pediatr. Res. 1984; 18: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Andreu A. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This mutation is located in the intermembrane space loop connecting the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments. Analyses on mitochondria purified from patient heart have established a defect in the succinate cytochrome coxidoreductase activity and in cytochrome b assembly, showing the importance of residue 251 for bc1 function. The fact that S. cerevisiae is a facultative aerobe, considerably facilitates the study of respiratory deficient mutants. Moreover, the rapid segregation of mitochondrial chromosomes in yeast permits the generation of homoplasmic cells containing only the mutated mitochondrial DNA. On the contrary, wild type and mutated mitochondrial DNAs often coexist within the cells of patients carrying a mitochondrial pathology. Thus, yeast mitochondrial mutants can provide invaluable help to fully understand the consequences of a mitochondrial mutation observed in a patient. In this paper, we have studied in detail the effects of the histiocytoid cardiomyopathy corresponding mutation in yeast (G252D). This mutation strongly disturbs the respiratory functions of cells grown at high temperature (36 °C). We have found that the presence of the aspartate residue at position 252 renders the noncatalytic subunit Qcr9p essential for the activity of thebc1 complex at 28 °C, and that this defect can be bypassed by a second mutation in the cytochrome b gene (P174T) located in a region close to Rieske. We propose that the supernumerary subunit Qcr9p enhances or stabilizes the interactions between cytochromes b, c1, and Rieske, particularly at high temperature. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that the intron-less mitochondrial chromosome from the yeast S. cerevisiae carries a mutation leading to the substitution of a glycine residue by an aspartate at position 252 of cytochrome b. The same mutation has been recently described in a patient with a cardiomyopathy (17Andreu A. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) associated with a defect in succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (16Papadimitriou A. Neustein H.B. Dimauro S. Stanton R. Bresolin N. Pediatr. Res. 1984; 18: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This G252D mutation has no major effect on respiratory function of yeast cells grown at 28 °C, the appropriate growth temperature of yeast but leads to a 50% decrease of thebc1 complex activity at 36 °C, which is close to the temperature of the human body.A growing number of mutations in the human mitochondrial DNA were shown to be responsible for numerous pathologies (for review, see Ref. 30DiMauro S.

Among a dozen mutations mapped to the human cytochrome bgene, only two have been investigated in the yeast system (11Fisher N. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TheG34S mutation has been observed in a patient suffering from exercise intolerance (31Andreu A.L. Hanna M.G. Reichmann H. Bruno C. Penn A.S. Tanji K. Pallotti F. Iwata S. Bonilla E. Lach B. Morgan-Hughes J. DiMauro S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and the substitution of the corresponding glycine by aspartate in yeast leads to a total defect of thebc1 complex activity at 28 °C (32Coppee J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G339Emutation is responsible for a human myopathy and the same mutation totally abolishes the bc1 complex assembly in yeast at 28 °C (33Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P.

The glycine 252 is located in the E-ef loop at the positive side of the membrane, close to the ubiquinol oxidation site, Qo, according to the crystal structure (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C.

DiMauro S. Pediatr.

The fact that both the mutations D252N and D252Y, in an otherwise wild type background, totally restore the respiratory function at 36 °C suggests that the defect observed in the G252D mutant is rather because of the negative charge brought by the aspartate residue rather than the increased size. If this charge inhibits the Qo site function, cytochrome b can be only reduced at the Qi site. However, the cytochrome spectra of the Δqcr9 G252D double mutant, recorded with antimycin that blocks the Qi site, revealed the presence of reduced cytochrome b (data not shown). This suggests that the cytochrome b hemes can be reduced by ubiquinol at the Qo site in the G252D mutant.Our results suggest the existence of an interaction between cytochrome b residue 252 and Qcr9p, the mutation G252D leading to a decrease in the steady-state level of Qcr9p. However, according to Ref. 5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, residue 252 is far from Qcr9p and cannot directly interact with Qcr9p although cytochrome c1 is close to residue 252 (Fig. 6).

This illegitimate interaction would affect cytochrome c1conformation and partially destabilize Qcr9p or affect the insertion of Qcr9p within the membrane. This would lead to a decrease of thebc1 complex activity at high temperature, as in theΔqcr9 mutant. Previous studies have shown that Qcr9p interacts with Rieske and cytochrome c1 (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), therefore we propose that Qcr9p could enhance or stabilize the interactions between these two catalytic subunits. It was previously shown that in the total absence of Qcr9p, the conformation of Rieske and its iron-sulfur cluster insertion is altered (9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in theΔqcr9 G252D double mutant, the conformation of both cytochrome c1 and Rieske would be affected and this would completely prevent the electron transfer between Rieske and cytochrome c1 even at 28 °C.

This suggests that the cytochrome bsubstitutions, that we have isolated, cannot strengthen the interactions between Rieske and cytochrome c1 at high temperatures and thus cannot functionally substitute for Qcr9p. Whereas suppressor mutations at residue 252 could lower the illegitimate interactions occurring at this position in the original mutant, the suppression mechanism by proline 174 ought to be different. Both glycine 252 and proline 174 are located in the intermembrane space but are quite distant (Fig. 6), the proline 174 is at the vicinity of the tether domain of Rieske, which is necessary for the Rieske movement and the electron transfer between the iron-sulfur cluster and the heme of cytochrome c1 (2Zhang Z.

Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TheG34S mutation has been observed in a patient suffering from exercise intolerance (31Andreu A.L. Hanna M.G. Reichmann H. Bruno C. Penn A.S. Tanji K. Pallotti F. Iwata S. Bonilla E. Lach B. Morgan-Hughes J. DiMauro S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and the substitution of the corresponding glycine by aspartate in yeast leads to a total defect of thebc1 complex activity at 28 °C (32Coppee J.Y. Brasseur G. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Colson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4221-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G339Emutation is responsible for a human myopathy and the same mutation totally abolishes the bc1 complex assembly in yeast at 28 °C (33Lemesle-Meunier D. Brivet-Chevillotte P. di Rago J.P. Slonimski P.P. Bruel C. Tron T. Forget N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15626-15632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Andreu A.L. Bruno C. Shanske S. Shtilbans A. Hirano M. Krishna S. Hayward L. Systrom D.S. Brown Jr., R.H. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, G252D is the first cytochromeb mutation corresponding to a human pathology that leads to a thermosensitive bc1 activity. This stresses the interest of testing different growth temperatures when using yeast as a model to study mutations implicated in human pathology. The glycine 252 of yeast cytochrome b is not only conserved in mammals and plants but is also present in several bacteria such asR. capsulatus. The G252D mutation leads to the substitution of a small amino acid by a large and negatively charged one. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that the respiratory defect is because of steric and/or electrostatic conflicts within cytochromeb or between cytochrome b and another subunit. The glycine 252 is located in the E-ef loop at the positive side of the membrane, close to the ubiquinol oxidation site, Qo, according to the crystal structure (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It was previously proposed (17Andreu A. Checcarelli N. Iwata S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that the presence of Asp instead of Gly in human cytochrome b should cause charge repulsion with glutamate 271 of the Qo site (Glu-272 in yeast) and would impair hydroquinone binding. The fact that both the mutations D252N and D252Y, in an otherwise wild type background, totally restore the respiratory function at 36 °C suggests that the defect observed in the G252D mutant is rather because of the negative charge brought by the aspartate residue rather than the increased size. If this charge inhibits the Qo site function, cytochrome b can be only reduced at the Qi site. However, the cytochrome spectra of the Δqcr9 G252D double mutant, recorded with antimycin that blocks the Qi site, revealed the presence of reduced cytochrome b (data not shown). This suggests that the cytochrome b hemes can be reduced by ubiquinol at the Qo site in the G252D mutant. Our results suggest the existence of an interaction between cytochrome b residue 252 and Qcr9p, the mutation G252D leading to a decrease in the steady-state level of Qcr9p. However, according to Ref. 5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, residue 252 is far from Qcr9p and cannot directly interact with Qcr9p although cytochrome c1 is close to residue 252 (Fig. 6). Thus, it is tempting to propose that the interaction between residue 252 and Qcr9p would be a long range interaction via cytochrome c1.Because, the closest amino acid in cytochrome c1 is lysine 182, the G252D mutation could create an illegitimate electrostatic interaction with this positively charged amino acid. This illegitimate interaction would affect cytochrome c1conformation and partially destabilize Qcr9p or affect the insertion of Qcr9p within the membrane. This would lead to a decrease of thebc1 complex activity at high temperature, as in theΔqcr9 mutant. Previous studies have shown that Qcr9p interacts with Rieske and cytochrome c1 (5Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gonzalez-Halphen D. Lindorfer M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), therefore we propose that Qcr9p could enhance or stabilize the interactions between these two catalytic subunits. It was previously shown that in the total absence of Qcr9p, the conformation of Rieske and its iron-sulfur cluster insertion is altered (9Phillips J. Graham L. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in theΔqcr9 G252D double mutant, the conformation of both cytochrome c1 and Rieske would be affected and this would completely prevent the electron transfer between Rieske and cytochrome c1 even at 28 °C. This hypothesis is consistent with our results showing a block in electron transfer between cytochrome b and cytochrome c1. However, direct evidence of this hypothetical illegitimate interaction could be provided by introducing a compensatory mutation in the partner residue,e.g. the proposed candidate lysine 182 of cytochromec1. The suppressor mutations able to restore the respiratory growth of theΔqcr9 G252D double mutant were mapped either at codon 252 or codon 174 of the cytochrome b gene. All partially compensate for the respiratory defect at 28 °C but not at 36 °C, suggesting that they restore the electron transfer between cytochromeb and cytochrome c1 but do not compensate for the absence of Qcr9p. This suggests that the cytochrome bsubstitutions, that we have isolated, cannot strengthen the interactions between Rieske and cytochrome c1 at high temperatures and thus cannot functionally substitute for Qcr9p. Whereas suppressor mutations at residue 252 could lower the illegitimate interactions occurring at this position in the original mutant, the suppression mechanism by proline 174 ought to be different. Both glycine 252 and proline 174 are located in the intermembrane space but are quite distant (Fig. 6), the proline 174 is at the vicinity of the tether domain of Rieske, which is necessary for the Rieske movement and the electron transfer between the iron-sulfur cluster and the heme of cytochrome c1 (2Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y. Kim K.K. Hung L. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 36Ghosh M. Wang Y. Ebert C.E. Vadlamuri S. Beattie D.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Darrouzet E. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3471-3476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Substituting a proline by a threonine in this domain could improve the interaction between Rieske and cytochrome c1 that is deficient in the Δqcr9 G252D double mutant, and allow partial electron transfer at 28 °C. Altogether, these results show that residue 252 plays an important role in the biogenesis of the bc1 complex at 36 °C and is probably involved in long range interactions within the bc1complex and between the supernumerary subunit Qcr9p and the two other catalytic subunits, cytochrome c1 and Rieske. It has recently been shown that protein-phospholipid interactions also play a role in the structure of the bc1 complex (38Lange C. Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. Hunte C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6591-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and it is well known that phospholipids are highly sensitive to temperature. Thus, elucidating the relative roles of noncatalytic subunits and phospholipids constitutes the next challenge to fully understand respiratory complex assembly at high temperatures.

The box B/C motif has also been shown to be essential for the association of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein-specific protein hU3-55K. We therefore set out to determine how 15.5K and hU3-55K recognize the box B/C motif. By using an in vitro assembly assay, we show that hU3-55K effectively binds a sub-fragment of the U3 snoRNA surrounding the B/C motif that we have named the U3BC RNA. The association of hU3-55K with the U3BC RNA is dependent on the binding of 15.5K to the box B/C motif. The association of hU3-55K with the U3BC RNA was found to be also dependent on a conserved RNA structure that flanks the box B/C motif. Furthermore, we show that hU3-55K, a WD 40 repeat containing protein, directly cross-links to the U3BC RNA. Our data support a new structural model of the box B/C region of the U3 snoRNA in which the box B/C motif is base-paired to form a structure highly similar to that of both the U4 5′ stem-loop and the box C/D motif.

The U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; snoRNP, small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. is essential for the processing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in both vertebrates and fungi (1Hughes J.M.

Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 805-812Google Scholar). This box C/D-type snoRNA functions by base pairing with the 5′-external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the pre-rRNA and the 5′-terminal region of the 18 S rRNA sequence. The latter interaction blocks the formation of a universally conserved central pseudoknot; a long range interaction essential for the formation and function of the small subunit rRNA (1Hughes J.M. J.

Based on these observations, the U3 snoRNP has been proposed to function as an RNA chaperone in the assembly of the small subunit of the ribosome. The U3 snoRNP contains the core proteins common to all box C/D snoRNPs, namely fibrillarin (Nop1p in yeast), NOP56, NOP58 (Nop5p), and 15.5K (Snu13p in yeast) (5Lafontaine D.L. Tollervey D.

These proteins are essential for the biogenesis, stability, and nucleolar localization of the box C/D snoRNPs. In addition the U3 snoRNA has been shown to be associated with several U3-specific proteins in yeast, namely Rrp9p (hU3-55K in human), Imp3p, Imp4p, Mpp10p, Dhr1p, Rcl1p, Sof1p, and Lcp5p (13Billy E.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5441-5452Google Scholar). The 3′ domain of the U3 snoRNA can be folded into a stem-rich structure that contains four conserved RNA sequence elements, namely boxes C′, B, C, and D. Boxes C′ and D are found opposite each other at the base of the 3′ domain and form the common core box C/D motif (previously termed the box C′/D motif but referred to here as the box C/D motif for clarity) (23Jeppesen C. Stebbins-Boaz B. Gerbi S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2127-2148Google Scholar, 24Méreau A. Fournier R. Gregoire A. Mougin A. Fabrizio P. Luhrmann R. Branlant C. J. Mol.

The box C/D motif is required for the biogenesis of the box C/D snoRNAs and has been shown to be essential for nucleolar localization, cap hypermethylation, and accumulation/stability of the transcript (reviewed in Ref. 26Terns M.P. Terns R.M. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 17-39Google Scholar). This motif is also responsible for the association of the core box C/D proteins (8Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 861-879Google Scholar, 11Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8342-8352Google Scholar). The U3 snoRNA also contains a U3-specific RNA element, termed the box B/C motif. This RNA element is a protein-binding site that is essential for the association of Rrp9p in yeast and U3-55K in vertebrates (19Venema J. Vos H.R. Faber A.W. van Venrooij W.J. Raue H.A. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1660-1671Google Scholar, 31Lukowiak A.A. Granneman S. Mattox S.A. Speckmann W.A. Jones K. Pluk H. Venrooij W.J. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3462-3471Google Scholar). However, unlike the box C/D motif, the box B/C motif is not essential for biogenesis of the U3 snoRNA (32Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3431-3444Google Scholar, 33Speckmann W. Narayanan A. Terns R. Terns M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8412-8421Google Scholar). The 15.5K protein was initially identified as a U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP component that directly binds to the 5′ stem-loop structure of the U4 snRNA (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). We have shown recently (11Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Google Scholar) that the 15.5K protein is associated with the box C/D snoRNAs in vivo and that it directly binds to both the box C/D motif and the U3 snoRNA-specific box B/C motif in vitro. Both the box C/D and the box B/C motifs are capable of forming stem-internal loop-stem structures that are strikingly similar to the U4 5′ stem-loop. The discovery that 15.5K can bind three similar RNA motifs raises the interesting question of how 15.5K functions in the assembly of these distinct RNP complexes. In this study we have analyzed the binding of 15.5K and hU3-55K to the box B/C motif. These two proteins have been shown to require the B/C motif in the U3 snoRNA for their association (11Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Google Scholar, 19Venema J. Vos H.R. Faber A.W. van Venrooij W.J. Raue H.A. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1660-1671Google Scholar, 31Lukowiak A.A.

To determine how these two proteins associate with the U3 snoRNA, we made use of a HeLa nuclear extract assembly system. Our results show that the interaction between hU3-55K and the U3 snoRNA is dependent on 15.5K binding to the box B/C motif. Moreover, we show that hU3-55K requires not only the box B/C motif but also sequences flanking this RNA element for its association with the U3 snoRNA. Our data suggest that hU3-55K recognizes structural, rather than sequence-specific, RNA elements within the 15.5K-bound U3 box B/C snoRNA complex. The U3 construct pSP6U3 (28Watkins N.J. Leverette R.D. Xia L. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 1996; 2: 118-133Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Stuart Maxwell. Constructs encoding human U3 snoRNA mutants were generated by PCR using pSP6U3 as a substrate, with the oligonucleotides listed in TableI. The PCR products, which contain a T7 promoter upstream of the U3 sequence, were cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC19. Primer sets for each mutant were as follows: U3BC, oligonucleotides 2 and 3; U3BCΔstem V, 2 and 6; U3BCΔstem IV+V, 7 and 8; U3BCΔstem VI, 2 and 9; U3BCΔstem I+VI, 10 and 11; U3BCmutB, 3 and 4; U3BCmutC, 2 and 5; U3BCstemC, 24 and 3; U3BCstemG, 2 and 25; U3BCstemCG, 24 and 25; U3BCstemCCG, 26 and 3; U3BCstemCGG, 2 and 27; U3BCstemCCGCGG, 26 and 27; U3BCmutUU-GC, 22 and 23; U3BCmutloopA-GG, 2 and 28. The U3 snoRNA mutants U3BCmutstem III and U3BCmutAU-AA were generated using the pUC19-U3BCΔstem VI construct as template with oligonucleotides 14 and 15, and 1 and 12, respectively. U3BCmutGG-AA and U3BCmutloop-stem were generated via a two-step PCR method using pUC19-U3BCΔstem VI as template. In the first round of PCR, oligonucleotides 16 and 19 and 13 and 19 were used for U3BCmutGG-AA and U3BCmutloop-stem, respectively. PCR products were gel-purified and used as primers for a second PCR amplification in combination with oligonucleotide 1. To generate the U3BCmutpyrloop and U3BCmutstem IV constructs, oligonucleotides 17 and 19 were used as a templates, respectively, and amplified using primers 1 and 19 in a PCR. RNA encoded by U3CD PCR product, generated using oligonucleotides 21 and 22, contains a tetraloop (UUCG) in order to join the two sides of the U3 snoRNA. This PCR product was cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pUC19.

All transcriptions were performed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (17Pluk H. Soffner J. Lührmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Google Scholar). For cross-linking experiments 4-thio-UTP-labeled RNAs were generated via in vitro transcription in the presence of [32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a final concentration of 1 mm UTP and 1 mm 4-thio-UTP. The 4-thio-UTP was a generous gift from Heiko Manninga. The m7G-capped U3BC and mutB transcripts were generated as described previously (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). The hU3-55KΔ1–136 deletion mutation was generated by PCR using pCI-neo VSVhU3-55K as a substrate (17Pluk H. Soffner J. Lührmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides 55Kdelta1–136For and 55Krev (Table I). The remaining pCI-neo VSVhU3-55K deletion mutants were described previously (17Pluk H. Soffner J. Lührmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Google Scholar, 31Lukowiak A.A. Granneman S. Mattox S.A. Speckmann W.A. Jones K. Pluk H. Venrooij W.J. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3462-3471Google Scholar).35S-Labeled proteins were generated using the TnT reticulate lysate-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. The hU3-55K antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide derived from the hU3-55K sequence (EEELEETAQEKKLRLAK). The resulting antiserum specifically recognizes hU3-55K in Western blots and co-immunoprecipitates only the U3 snoRNA from HeLa total cell extract (data not shown). HeLa nuclear extract was prepared essentially as described (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). For each 20-μl reconstitution experiment, 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extract, 10 μg of tRNA, and 50 fmol of32P-labeled RNA were incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol for 30 min at 30 °C. In order to control for the stability of the RNA in nuclear extract, RNA was extracted from 5% of the assembly reaction. The reconstituted complex was then immunoprecipitated using anti-hU3-55K antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose in 300 μl of IPP150 (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100). The bound material was washed four times in IPP150, and the co-immunoprecipitated and control RNAs were isolated via phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The recovered RNAs were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. Competition experiments using U4 SL1 and U4 SL17 RNA oligonucleotides (30Watkins N.J. Dickmanns A. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8342-8352Google Scholar, 34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar) were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with either 100, 200, 400, or 800 pmol of the competitor for 30 min at 30 °C. U3BC RNA was added (100 fmol), and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min at 30 °C. For the add-back experiment shown in Fig. 6C, the U3BCwt RNA was first preincubated with recombinant 15.5K protein (2.5–40 pmol) for 1 h on ice in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The in vitro reconstitution experiment shown in Fig. 2D was performed as described previously (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). Basically, 6 pmol of m7G-capped U3BC or m7G-capped mutB RNA was incubated with 35S-hU3-55K in vitrotranslate and increasing concentrations of recombinant 15.5K protein (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 pmol) in Buffer A in a final volume of 20 μl. After 1 h of incubation on ice, 240 μl of Buffer A was added to the reaction, and the reconstituted complex was immunoprecipitated using the H20 monoclonal antibody (specific for m2,2,7G and m7G cap structures (35Bochnig P. Reuter R. Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 461-467Google Scholar)). The bound material then separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant GST15.5K was expressed and purified as described previously (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). Binding studies with mutant U3BC RNAs were performed using 1 μg of GST15.5K with 50 fmol of32P-labeled RNA and 1 μg of yeast total RNA in Buffer A in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. After 1 h of incubation on ice, 240 μl of Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl) and 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with Buffer B. Co-precipitated RNAs were isolated by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNAs were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. In order to analyze the binding of mutant hU3-55K in vitrotranslates, 10 ng of GST15.5K was incubated with 0.6 pmol of U3BC transcript and the radiolabeled protein in a final reaction volume of 20 μl of Buffer A. After 1 h of incubation on ice, reconstituted complexes were bound to GST beads, washed four times in Buffer B, and the proteins separated on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel. For UV cross-linking experiments, 500 fmol of modified RNA was used in a standard reconstitution reaction with a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were then subjected to UV light (365 nm) for 15 min on ice. For direct analysis of proteins cross-linked to the RNA (Fig. 6A), 15 μg of RNase T1 was added to the samples followed by a 1-h incubation at 50 °C, and the resultant cross-links were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, reconstitution reactions were first dissociated by the addition of SDS to 1% (w/v) and incubated at 75 °C for 15 min. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) and the reaction diluted to 350 μl with IPP150. Immunoprecipitations were then performed as described earlier. Precipitated complexes were subsequently treated with proteinase K and the extracted RNAs were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. The 15.5K and hU3-55K proteins have both been proposed to bind to the conserved box B/C region of the U3 snoRNA (11Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Google Scholar, 31Lukowiak A.A. Granneman S. Mattox S.A. Speckmann W.A. Jones K. Pluk H. Venrooij W.J. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3462-3471Google Scholar). We therefore used an in vitro reconstitution assay, using HeLa nuclear extract, in order to analyze the binding of these two proteins to the U3 snoRNA. This system has been used previously to study the assembly of the box C/D and H/ACA snoRNPs (8Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Shanab G.M. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 861-879Google Scholar, 29Watkins N.J. Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Maxwell E.S. RNA (New York). 1998; 4: 582-593Google Scholar, 30Watkins N.J. Dickmanns A. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell.

In order to analyze assembly, 32P-labeled U3 snoRNA transcripts were incubated in nuclear extract, and the association of hU3-55K was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-hU3-55K antibodies. The co-precipitated RNA was then analyzed by PAGE. In order to show that each of the RNAs used in this investigation was not degraded during our experiments, after incubation in nuclear extract 5% of the material was isolated and also analyzed (Fig. 1B, 5% I). The U3 snoRNA was co-precipitated with anti-hU3-55K antibodies (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3) but not with the normal rabbit serum (lane 2). Under the same conditions no U14 snoRNA was co-precipitated with anti-hU3-55K antibodies demonstrating the specificity of our assay (Fig. 1B, lane 6) as hU3-55K is a U3-specific protein (17Pluk H. Soffner J. Lührmann R. van Venrooij W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 488-498Google Scholar, 31Lukowiak A.A. Granneman S. Mattox S.A. Speckmann W.A. Jones K. Pluk H. Venrooij W.J. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3462-3471Google Scholar). Previous studies (31Lukowiak A.A. Granneman S. Mattox S.A. Speckmann W.A. Jones K. Pluk H. Venrooij W.J. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3462-3471Google Scholar) have mapped the sequences required for hU3-55K association to a region of the U3 snoRNA that consists of the box B/C motif and its flanking stems. We could also show that an RNA comprising just the B/C motif region of the U3 snoRNA (Fig. 1A, U3BC RNA) was effectively co-precipitated by anti-hU3-55K antibodies after incubation in nuclear extract (Fig. 1B, lane 9). In contrast, the U3CD region of the U3 snoRNA (Fig. 1A) was not precipitated by the anti-hU3-U55K antibodies. This confirmed that all of the essential sequences necessary for hU3-55K binding are contained within the box B/C region of the U3 snoRNA. The U3BC RNA was therefore used as the substrate RNA in our investigations as the analysis of protein binding to this fragment most likely reflects what is observed with the full-length snoRNA. In addition, the physical separation of the two 15.5K-binding sites facilitates the direct analysis of 15.5K binding to the box BC motif in the absence of the box C/D motif. We have shown previously that the GA dinucleotides present in the U4 5′ stem-loop, box C/D motif, and the box B/C motif are essential for the binding of 15.5K in vitro (11Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Lührmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Google Scholar, 34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). Therefore, we next addressed the role these highly conserved nucleotides play in hU3-55K binding. Constructs were generated with point mutations in either box B or box C of the U3BC RNA (Fig. 1A; nucleotides marked by anasterisk). Mutation of either A113 (mutB) or G162 (mutC) (numbers refer to the position in the intact U3 snoRNA) in the U3BC RNA abolished the binding of hU3-55K in HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1C, lanes 6, and 8). However, neither mutation affected the stability of the RNA in nuclear extract (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 7). We next wanted to address whether the 15.5K protein specifically binds to the U3BC RNA in HeLa nuclear extract. However, anti-15.5K antibodies co-precipitated only very low amounts of the U3BC RNA in this assay (data not shown). The analysis of the interaction of 15.5K with the RNA by immunoprecipitation was therefore not possible. The 15.5K antibodies also fail to immunoprecipitate the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP suggesting that in certain complexes this protein is not accessible for antibody binding (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). As the anti-15.5K antibodies could not be readily used to study the binding of 15.5K to the U3BC RNA, an alternative means of analyzing 15.5K binding to the box B/C motif was required. We therefore analyzed the ability of recombinant GST-tagged 15.5K protein to bind the mutant and wild-type RNAs. The RNA bound to GST15.5K was co-precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The results show that GST15.5K efficiently bound to the U3BC RNA but not to either of the mutant transcripts (Fig. 1D, lanes 2–4). When the GST tag alone was used, no wild-type RNA was co-precipitated (Fig. 1D, lane 1). These results show that mutations that inhibit 15.5K binding to the box B/C motif also block the association of hU3-55K. However, a more direct analysis of the role 15.5K plays in hU3-55K binding was required before any further conclusions could be made about the assembly pathway of this RNP complex. The fact that the 15.5K protein can bind the B/C motif in the absence of hU3-55K suggests that this protein may indeed be the primary RNA-binding protein. Therefore, we next addressed whether binding of the 15.5K protein to the box B/C motif was an essential prerequisite for the association of hU3-55K. In order to investigate this, competition experiments were performed with a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ stem-loop of the U4 snRNA (Fig. 2A, U4 SL1) that specifically binds 15.5K (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6119-6133Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was preincubated with U4 SL1 oligonucleotide, in order to sequester 15.5K binding, prior to the addition of U3BC RNA, and then assayed for hU3-55K binding. As seen in Fig. 2B, the addition of 400 pmol of U4SL1 oligonucleotide inhibited the co-precipitation of the U3BC RNA with anti-hU3-55K antibodies (Fig. 2B, lane 7). As a control, oligonucleotide U4 SL17 (Fig. 2A), containing a point mutation that abolishes 15.5K binding (34Nottrott S. Hartmuth K. Fabrizio P. Urlaub H. Vidovic I. Ficner R. Lührmann"

P-450 reductase shows very high selectivity for NADPH and uses NADH only poorly. Substitution of tryptophan 677 with alanine has been shown to yield a 3-fold increase in turnover with NADH, but profound inhibition by NADP+ makes the enzyme unsuitable for in vivo applications. In the present study site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the 2′-phosphate-binding site of the NADPH domain, coupled with the W677A substitution, was used to generate a reductase that was able to use NADH efficiently without inhibition by NADP+. Of 11 single, double, and triple mutant proteins, two (R597M/W677A and R597M/K602W/W677A) showed up to a 500-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with NADH. Inhibition by NADP+ was reduced by up to 4 orders of magnitude relative to the W677A protein and was equal to or less than that of the wild-type reductase. Both proteins were 2–3-fold more active than wild-type reductase with NADH in reconstitution assays with cytochrome P-450 1A2 and with squalene monooxygenase. In a recombinant cytochrome P-450 2E1 Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, the R597M/W677A protein increased the sensitivity to dimethylnitrosamine by ∼2-fold, suggesting that the ability to use NADH afforded a significant advantage in this in vivo assay.

NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) is the electron-donating partner for the cytochromes P-450, squalene monooxygenase, and heme oxygenase and is a component of the nitric-oxide synthases and methionine-synthase reductase. P-450 reductase is essential to cholesterol and steroid synthesis, and its importance is underscored by the developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality observed in P-450 reductase-null mice (1Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6536-6541Google Scholar). P-450 reductase contains 1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme and 1 mol of FMN/mol of enzyme. Reduced NADPH transfers two electrons as a hydride ion to the FAD of the enzyme, and FMN then accepts single electrons from the FAD and acts as the exit point to the protein acceptor such as the cytochromes P-450. P-450 reductase is a multi-domain protein, with the FAD and NADP(H) domains homologous with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and the FMN domain homologous with flavodoxin, suggesting that P-450 reductase was formed from an ancestral gene fusion event (2Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Google Scholar, 3Porter T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Google Scholar). A fourth domain acts as a hinge to orient the two flavin-containing domains for electron transfer, and an NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain anchors the protein to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. The NADP(H) domain adopts the typical dinucleotide fold structure consisting of alternating α-helices and β-strands, with the nicotinamide cofactor binding in a cleft between the FAD and NADP(H) domains (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Google Scholar).Although expression of mammalian P-450/reductase systems in bacteria has been shown to be a valuable research tool and has promise as a tool for biodegradation (5Guengerich F.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1995; 103 (Suppl. 5): 25-28Google Scholar), enzyme activity in recombinant bacterial systems appears to be limited by glucose availability (6Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 218-225Google Scholar). One explanation for this might be that the generation of NADPH is largely dependent on the glucose shunt pathway, which is operative primarily in high glucose environments. Supporting this hypothesis are data from Bochner and Ames (7Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Google Scholar) that indicate that bacterial NAD(H) levels exceed NADP(H) levels by ∼4:1. To address the hypothesis that heterologously expressed P-450 systems in bacterial cells are limited by the availability of NADPH, we have constructed a series of reductase proteins designed to use NADH more efficiently. Specific mutations in the nicotinamide cofactor 2′-phosphate-binding site were generated based on the crystal structure of the reductase from rat (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M.

This amino acid is suggested to contribute to cofactor specificity by blocking the nucleotide binding site from both NADPH and NADH; NADPH, with higher binding affinity caused by a 2′-phosphate-binding pocket, is evidently able to displace the tryptophan and form a productive electron transfer complex, whereas NADH cannot bind tightly enough to displace the tryptophan. Consistent with this hypothesis, removal or substitution of Trp677 greatly increases turnover with NADH but leads to inhibition by NADP+ at a level that would restrict in vivo applications of this enzyme. We hypothesized that mutations in the 2′-phosphate-binding site might reduce the affinity of the enzyme for NADP(H) and reduce or prevent the inhibition by NADP+. Several highly conserved residues make up the 2′-phosphate-binding motif, including serine 596, arginine 597, and lysine 602; the positions of these amino acids in the NADP(H)-binding domain are shown in Fig. 1. The present study reveals that the combination of 2′-phosphate-binding site mutations with the W677A substitution yields a cytochrome P-450 reductase that uses NADH more effectively than the native enzyme without inhibition by NADP+.RESULTSWe have generated mutants of cytochrome P-450 reductase that have decreased specificity for the physiological cofactor NADPH. These mutants fall into three categories: those containing mutations in the 2′-phosphate-binding region of NADPH; a single mutant in which tryptophan 677, which is positioned directly opposite of the FAD isoalloxazine ring, is replaced with alanine; and double and triple combinations of these two. As expected, single and double substitutions in the 2′-phosphate-binding region yielded proteins with greatly reduced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with NADPH (TableI). The R597M, S596D, K602W, and R597M/K602W proteins showed a 40–13,000-fold increase in theKm for NADPH as compared with wild-type with cytochrome c as the electron acceptor, with the K602W substitution having the least effect on Km and the S596D mutation producing the highest Km. Of these mutants, the S596D showed the most profound decrease in thekcat with both NADPH and NADH, indicating an overall detrimental effect on electron transfer; all of the mutants containing S596D had little or no activity with either cofactor. Proteins with the R597M substitution (R597M and R597M/K602W) maintained turnover numbers with NADPH and NADH that were comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the K602W mutation decreased turnover with both cofactors in the absence of the R597M substitution. As an alternative to individual substitutions, the segment from Ser596 to Val603 (8 amino acids) was replaced with the corresponding segment from NADH-cytochromeb5 reductase, a closely related NADH-dependent flavoprotein (12Yubisui T. Naitoh Y. Zenno S. Tamura M. Takeshita M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3609-3613Google Scholar). However, the resulting mutant protein bound flavin but had no observable cytochromec reductase activity.Table ICatalytic activity of P-450 reductase mutants with cytochrome cMutantNADPHNADHNADPH/NADH (kcat/Km/kcat/Km)kcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms−1μms−1μm−1s−1μms−1μm−1Wild type3,280 ± 501.6 ± 0.12,0001,210 ± 14027,600 ± 4,6000.04445,000S596D140 ± 920,600 ± 2,0000.007101 ± 610,100 ± 1,3000.0100.7R597M2,980 ± 70156 ± 10191,350 ± 11014,100 ± 2,2000.10200K602W1,110 ± 2064.0 ± 3.217101 ± 45,330 ± 6300.019930W677A38 ± 31.4 ± 0.4273,220 ± 70103 ± 831.20.9S596D/R597M———199 ± 4012,300 ± 5,0000.02—S596D/K602W———————R597M/K602W2,830 ± 1403,900 ± 4400.73819 ± 12918,500 ± 4,9000.04416S596D/W677A———————R597M/W677A468 ± 133.8 ± 0.41202,040 ± 8099 ± 14215.7K602W/W677A77 ± 32.5 ± 0.631370 ± 16168 ± 222.214R597M/K602W/W677A920 ± 2287 ± 9111,190 ± 30162 ± 127.31.58-Amino acid substitution——————— Open table in a new tab As demonstrated by Döhr et al. (13Dohr O. Paine M.J. Friedberg T. Roberts G.C. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 81-86Google Scholar), substitution of the penultimate amino acid in P-450 reductase with alanine (W677A) produces a reductase with 1000-fold higher specificity for NADH than NADPH. We found that the W677A mutant retained only 1.2% of wild-type activity (kcat) with NADPH, whereas theKm for NADPH remained similar to wild type when assayed with cytochrome c (Table I). In contrast, the W677A mutant had a kcat with NADH that was ∼3-fold higher than that of wild type with NADH, whereas theKm of NADH decreased by ∼250-fold. Despite this 700-fold increase in catalytic efficiency with NADH, the most striking feature of the W677A mutant is that it is highly inhibited by NADP+ (13 and Fig. 3).Figure 3Inhibition of cytochrome creduction by NADP+.

Each pointrepresents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The mutations in the phosphate-binding region noted above were combined with the W677A substitution to overcome the profound inhibition by NADP+. We combined the S596D, R597M, and K602W mutants, as well as the R597M/K602W double mutant, with W677A. Consistent with the other S596D mutants, S596D/W677A produced a reductase with little or no activity with either cofactor. However, the R597M/W677A, K602W/W677A, and R597M/K602W/W677A proteins were active and displayed reduced catalytic efficiency with NADPH as compared with wild type and increased catalytic efficiency with NADH (Table I). Of these three proteins, the triple mutant (R597M/K602W/W677A) showed a 30,000-fold change in cofactor specificity. Inhibition of cytochrome creduction by NADP+ was determined with these proteins and compared with that of wild-type reductase (Fig. 3). With the W677A protein, inhibition by NADP+ increased ∼125-fold, from an IC50 of 17.4 μm (wild type) to an IC50 of 138.3 nm. Addition of the R597M mutation to the W677A protein returned inhibition by NADP+to a level comparable with wild-type reductase. Inhibition by NADP+ was greatly decreased in the R597M/K602W/W677A protein to an IC50 of 870 μm, 50-fold higher than the IC50 for wild-type reductase.We determined the ability of these three mutant proteins to support squalene monooxygenase activity, a physiological redox partner for P-450 reductase, with both NADPH and NADH (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results obtained with cytochrome c, the W677A protein showed limited activity with NADPH, having only ∼13% of the activity of wild-type reductase. The addition of the R597M substitution to the W677A protein restored full activity with NADPH, whereas the further addition of the K602W substitution (R597M/K602W/W677A) reduced activity with NADPH to ∼28% of wild-type activity. With NADH, the wild-type reductase supported squalene monooxygenase poorly, and the W677A protein was only slightly more active. However, the double and triple mutants were 4.4- and 3.7-fold more active with NADH than wild-type reductase.Figure 4Support of squalene monooxygenase activity by reductase mutants. The incubations were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” with either 1 mm NADH or NADPH in addition to the indicated reductase protein. 2,3-Oxidosqualene formation was quantified by autoradiography (18Laden B.P.

The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5. All of the mutants showed significantly lower deethylase activity with NADPH than wild type. With NADH all of the mutants showed similar activity, roughly twice the activity of wild type with NADH. To explore how these mutants might fare in a mixed cofactor environment, we determined ethoxyresorufin deethylase activity with equal concentrations of NADPH and NADH. The W677A reductase exhibited only 3.5% of wild-type activity, despite the presence of ample NADH, indicating a marked inhibition by NADP+. In contrast, the R597M/W677A and R597M/K602W/W677A proteins showed activity levels approaching those seen with NADPH or NADH alone, indicating that inhibition by NADP+ was not a factor.Figure 5EthoxyresorufinO-deethylation by cytochrome P-450 1A2 and reductase mutants.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the reductase mutants in vivo, each was coexpressed with cytochrome P-450 2E1 in S. typhimuriummutagenicity tester strains as described (20Cooper M.T. Porter T.D. Mutat. Res. 2000; 454: 45-52Google Scholar). The number of revertants generated with dimethylnitrosamine, a mutagenic substrate for P-450 2E1, was determined with each reductase mutant (Fig. 6). Expression of the W677A protein yielded few revertants, as expected if NADP+ was inhibitoryin vivo. Surprisingly, the R597M/K602W/W677A protein was equally ineffective, indicating that activity in vitro does not necessarily predict performance in vivo. However, the R597M/W677A reductase yielded nearly twice as many revertants as wild type, suggesting that the improved ability to use NADH increased turnover and mutagen activation.Figure 6Dimethylnitrosamine-induced mutagenicity with wild-type reductase and mutants.

The three-dimensional structure of P-450 reductase (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Google Scholar) revealed three amino acids that interact with this phosphate group: serine 596, arginine 597, and lysine 602, and it is assumed that these amino acids dictate the specificity for NADPH. Consistent with this prediction, Sem and Kasper (21Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11548-11558Google Scholar) showed that substitution of a methionine for the positively charged arginine at position 597 produces a reductase with impaired ability to differentiate between the two cofactors. The studies presented here support this role for arginine 597 and demonstrate that substitution of lysine 602 leads to a further loss in specificity for NADPH. Of the four amino acids examined in this study, these two have the greatest influence on NADPH specificity; when combined these substitutions increase the Km for NADPH by 2,400-fold. The effect of these two substitutions on theKm for NADH was less predictable; although both decreased the Km individually (R597M 2-fold and K602W 5-fold), when combined the decrease was only about 1.5-fold. Moreover, the K602W mutation greatly decreased turnover with NADH. It is unclear why the substitution of tryptophan at this position should have such a detrimental effect on NADH-dependent activity, because sequence alignments suggest that a tryptophan is found at this position in NADH-specific enzymes (Fig. 7). Given the ambiguity in the alignments of the NADH-specific proteins in this region, it is possible that substitutions other than tryptophan at this position might more readily accommodate NADH binding and turnover.Figure 7Sequence alignment of the 2′-phosphate-binding region of P-450 reductase. The amino acid sequence of the NADPH 2′-phosphate-binding region of P-450 reductase (CPR) is aligned over the corresponding segment from the NADP(H)-dependent enzymes spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) and N. crassa nitrate reductase (NR), and the NADH-specific enzymes corn nitrate reductase and human cytochromeb5 reductase (b5 R). Amino acids that were mutated in P-450 reductase in this study are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Work by Scrutton, Perham, and co-workers (22Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2737-2740Google Scholar) on the conversion of glutathione reductase to an NADH-specific enzyme suggested that an acidic residue opposite the adenine-ribose hydroxyls should enhance the binding of NADH. This position is occupied by serine 596 in P-450 reductase (Fig. 7). Consistent with this hypothesis, several NADH-specific reductases, including cytochromeb5 reductase, contain an aspartate at this position. We generated the corresponding mutant in P-450 reductase (S596D), but the resulting protein exhibited poor turnover with both NADH and NADPH. Although it was anticipated that a negatively charged amino acid at this position would strongly oppose NADPH binding by repelling the 2′-phosphate (and in fact, the Km for NADPH increased by over 20,000-fold), the marked decrease inkcat with NADH was not expected. Although theKm for NADH decreased by greater than half, it was not enough to overcome the 90% decrease in catalytic activity. The incorporation of additional mutations in the 2′-phosphate-binding site (R597M and K602W) or the W677A mutation did not restore activity with either cofactor, suggesting that the S596D substitution disrupted the structure of the cofactor-binding pocket. Thus, like the K602W mutation, the substitution of an “NADH-specific” amino acid at this position had the expected effect on activity with NADPH but did not enhance activity with NADH.In contrast to native P-450 reductase, a stable enzyme-NADP+ complex can be formed with a reductase in which histidine (25Gutierrez A. Doehr O. Paine M. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15990-15999Google Scholar) or glycine (14Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Google Scholar) is substituted for tryptophan 677. This tryptophan lies directly opposite the FAD isoalloxazine ring and is suggested to serve as a gating mechanism for cofactor binding (14Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Google Scholar). In support of this idea, movement of the tryptophan is seen during NADP(H) binding and release (26Gutierrez A. Paine M. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4626-4637Google Scholar). Loss or substitution of this tryptophan should enhance the binding of both NADH and NADPH, and indeed a remarkable increase in turnover with NADH is seen in Trp677 mutants (13Dohr O. Paine M.J. Friedberg T. Roberts G.C. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 81-86Google Scholar). However, turnover with NADPH is greatly decreased, apparently because of formation of this stable enzyme-NADP+ complex. Second site mutations that decrease the affinity of the enzyme for NADP(H) would be expected to decrease the stability of the enzyme-NADP+ complex and decrease the inhibition by NADP+. As expected and in contrast to the W677A protein, the R597M/W677A and R597M/K602W/W677A proteins were inhibited only at high NADP+ concentrations (Fig. 3) and retained good activity in the presence of both cofactors in an in vitro P-450 assay (Fig. 5).Although we identified mutations that enhanced the ability of P-450 reductase to use NADH in the presence of NADPH, we did not create a reductase that is more efficient with NADH than NADPH. Even with the best mutants (R597M/W677A and R597M/K602W/W677A), the catalytic efficiency values (kcat/Km) for NADPH and NADH were at best equivalent. Thus, it remains unclear how to engineer a P-450 reductase to preferentially use NADH. Notably, a number of NADH-utilizing enzymes exhibit a preference for NADH over NADPH; for example, turnover with NADPH in NADH-dependentE. coli dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is undetectable (24Bocanegra J.A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2737-2740Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the cofactor-binding region of this protein to P-450 reductase do not reveal obvious differences that might explain the greater selectivity of the dehydrogenase for NADH. Further biochemical and perhaps biophysical studies on P-450 reductase will be needed to identify the additional changes needed to enhance selectivity for NADH.The studies reported here do indicate that it is possible to engineer P-450 reductase for use in vivo by rational design and subsequent evaluation of enzymes in vitro. The R597M/W677A protein, which showed strong NADH-dependent activityin vitro, produced a more sensitive Ames test, presumably because of a greater ability to utilize NADH for cytochrome P-450 2E1-mediated activation of dimethylnitrosamine. The reductases generated in this study are especially suited for biotechnological uses in growth conditions that deplete NADPH versus NADH, such asin situ bacterial bioremediation schemes. Moreover, the initial Ames tests presented here suggest that NADPH might be limiting under standard laboratory growth conditions, as suggested previously (6Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 218-225Google Scholar). In addition to providing a valuable tool for understanding the determinants of nucleotide-cofactor specificity, these mutants might also lend themselves to creation of bioremediation schemes less influenced by nutrient levels, as well as cost-effective reconstitution of enzyme systems that do not require the use of expensive reducing equivalents from NADPH. NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) is the electron-donating partner for the cytochromes P-450, squalene monooxygenase, and heme oxygenase and is a component of the nitric-oxide synthases and methionine-synthase reductase. P-450 reductase is essential to cholesterol and steroid synthesis, and its importance is underscored by the developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality observed in P-450 reductase-null mice (1Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6536-6541Google Scholar). P-450 reductase contains 1 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme and 1 mol of FMN/mol of enzyme. Reduced NADPH transfers two electrons as a hydride ion to the FAD of the enzyme, and FMN then accepts single electrons from the FAD and acts as the exit point to the protein acceptor such as the cytochromes P-450. P-450 reductase is a multi-domain protein, with the FAD and NADP(H) domains homologous with ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and the FMN domain homologous with flavodoxin, suggesting that P-450 reductase was formed from an ancestral gene fusion event (2Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Google Scholar, 3Porter T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Google Scholar). A fourth domain acts as a hinge to orient the two flavin-containing domains for electron transfer, and an NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain anchors the protein to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. The NADP(H) domain adopts the typical dinucleotide fold structure consisting of alternating α-helices and β-strands, with the nicotinamide cofactor binding in a cleft between the FAD and NADP(H) domains (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Google Scholar). Although expression of mammalian P-450/reductase systems in bacteria has been shown to be a valuable research tool and has promise as a tool for biodegradation (5Guengerich F.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1995; 103 (Suppl. 5): 25-28Google Scholar), enzyme activity in recombinant bacterial systems appears to be limited by glucose availability (6Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 218-225Google Scholar). One explanation for this might be that the generation of NADPH is largely dependent on the glucose shunt pathway, which is operative primarily in high glucose environments. Supporting this hypothesis are data from Bochner and Ames (7Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Google Scholar) that indicate that bacterial NAD(H) levels exceed NADP(H) levels by ∼4:1. To address the hypothesis that heterologously expressed P-450 systems in bacterial cells are limited by the availability of NADPH, we have constructed a series of reductase proteins designed to use NADH more efficiently. Specific mutations in the nicotinamide cofactor 2′-phosphate-binding site were generated based on the crystal structure of the reductase from rat (4Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M.

Intestinal epithelial cells have coevolved over millions of years of close contact with normal gut flora and have developed mechanisms to discriminate between pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. It is this ability of the epithelium to discriminate between nonpathogenic intestinal flora and pathogenic bacteria that is central to the host mounting an effective immune response. During colonization of the gut by enteropathogenic bacteria like Salmonella typhimurium, the intestinal epithelium is the first line of defense against the invading microorganisms and reacts to the colonization with a rapid innate immune response. This highly localized response involves the polar secretion of cytokines, predominantly interleukin-8 (IL-8),1 that sets up a subepithelial chemotactic gradient directing polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) to the site of infection (1McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P.

Physical contact between S. typhimurium and the apical epithelial surface, in addition to poorly understood biochemical signals, induce the activation of a specialized protein-secretion system, known as a type III secretory system (7Zierler M.K. Galan J.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Galan J.E. Zhou D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8754-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is by way of this highly complex secretory system, comprised of multiple protein components, thatSalmonella delivers bacterial effector proteins into the eukaryotic host cell cytoplasm (for review see Ref. 9Galan J.E. Zhou D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8754-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lately, much attention has been directed at understanding the functions of theS. typhimurium type III secretory proteins on host cell cytoskeletal remodeling and nuclear signaling events. Microinjection and overexpression of recombinant type III proteins have been shown to cause the rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane ruffling (10Zhou D. Mooseker M.S. Galan J.E. Science. 1999; 283: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) that are similar to that seen during S. typhimurium invasion of the host cell. Some type III secretory proteins, like SipB, SipC, and SipD, are required for translocation other type III proteins into the cell (12Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and others, like SipA, have been shown to have actin bundling abilities (10Zhou D. Mooseker M.S. Galan J.E. Science. 1999; 283: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), whereas yet others, like SopE, SopB, and SptP, may act in concert to disrupt the cytoskeleton and regulate GDP-GTP exchange on the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 13Fu Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In nonpolarized cells these latter type III proteins seem to also regulate nuclear signal transduction pathways within the host cell in a Cdc42/Rac1-dependent manner (11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these same pathways are required forSalmonella-induced events in fully polarized epithelial monolayers where the underlying actin cytoskeleton and signaling machinery are quite different. Evidence from recent studies in polarized cells suggests that Salmonella-induced nuclear signaling events as well as basolateral IL-8 secretion requires the translocation of flagellin across the epithelium where it interacts with the basolateral surface receptor (14Gewirtz A.T. Simon P.O., Jr. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 15Eaves-Pyles T. Murthy K.

The Rho subfamily of small GTPases are known to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including actin cytoskeletal changes, the modulation of signaling pathways, and vesicle transport (see reviews in Refs. 18Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 19Der C.J. Balch W.E. Nature. 2000; 405: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consisting of at least 14 known members, the Rho subfamily is regulated by an ever increasing number of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and GDP dissociation inhibitors, all of which not only regulate activity but also actively participate in signal transduction (20Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These complex connections produce a signaling system full of promiscuity and redundancy that is both cell type-specific and dependent on the nature of the original stimulus. The role of Rho GTPases inSalmonella-induced cytoskeletal changes and invasion of nonpolarized cells has been well documented (9Galan J.E. Zhou D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8754-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Chen L.M. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); however, recent findings in polarized cells (22Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar) raise concern about the physiological relevance of studies done in nonpolarized or cell-free systems. To examine the involvement of Rho GTPases in S. typhimurium-induced basolateral IL-8 secretion from polarized epithelial cells, we have adapted a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell system with inducible expression of Rac1 and Cdc42 dominant-negative mutants. MDCK cell lines with doxycycline-repressible expression of the dominant-negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 have previously been established to examine the role of these small GTPases in the early events leading to epithelial development of polarity and tight junction formation (23Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These same cell lines provide a unique tool to examine the role of Rho GTPases in the signal transduction pathways activated during Salmonellacolonization of polarized epithelial monolayers. Using this inducible MDCK cell system has several advantages over the nonpolarized cell systems that have been previously used to investigate S. typhimurium-induced cell signaling events. MDCK cell monolayers have long been used in the study of S. typhimurium-epithelial cell interactions such as adherence and invasion (25Finlay B.B. Heffron F. Falkow S. Science. 1989; 243: 940-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Reed K.A. Booth T.A. Hirst B.H. Jepson M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 233-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cytoskeletal rearrangements (27Finlay B.B. Ruschkowski S. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bacterial translocation across the monolayer (28Finlay B.B. Starnbach M.N. Francis C.L. Stocker B.A. Chatfield S. Dougan G. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Finlay B.B. Gumbiner B. Falkow S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Finlay B.B.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and polymorphonuclear transmigration in response to bacterial invasion. MDCK cell monolayers also mirror the responses of the T84 human intestinal epithelial monolayers and more closely represent the in vivo conditions during infection of intestinal enterocytes than do nonpolarized epithelial cells. Using this more physiologically relevant system, we demonstrated a significant difference between the signaling mechanisms employed by nonpolarized cells and those used in polarized epithelial monolayers in response to S. typhimurium colonization. Overexpression of dominant-negative Rac1 and Cdc42 in nonpolarized cells has been previously shown to regulate early events in S. typhimurium-induced signaling (11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 21Chen L.M. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); however, we find that this is not the case in polarized epithelia expressing these dominant-negative GTPases. In polarized epithelial monolayers expressing dominant-negative Rac1 or Cdc42, S. typhimurium-induced activation of MAPK, p38-MAPK, JNK, IκBα kinase, translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, and production of IL-8 message all proceed normally; however, basolateral IL-8 secretion is inhibited, suggesting that the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 may regulate exocytosis and thus control the basolateral secretion of IL-8. This also suggests that both Rac1 and Cdc42 play a much different role during S. typhimurium infection depending on the polarity of the cell line being used in the experiments. MDCK epithelial cells (T23 clone) expressing dominant-negative Myc-tagged Rac1N17 or Cdc42N17 under the control of a tetracycline-repressible transactivator were grown as previously described (23Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. MDCK cells were seeded on 0.45 μm pore Transwell Clear inserts (Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum medium containing doxycycline and refed 24 h later and every 2 days thereafter. Monolayers were induced to express mutant GTPases 4–6 days after seeding by incubating monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum medium lacking doxycycline and containing 2.5 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h. The parental cell line transfected with an empty plasmid and treated in an identical manner served as the control; additionally, noninduced mutant cells were also used and produced similar results. All of the antibiotics were washed out prior to incubation with bacteria and had no effect on Salmonella viability. Human T84 intestinal epithelial cells (passages 70–95) were maintained as confluent monolayers on collagen-coated permeable supports (32Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 354-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Madara J.L. Parkos C. Colgan S. MacLeod R.J. Nash S. Matthews J. Delp C. Lencer W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). S. typhimurium χ3306 is a naladixic acid-resistant (gyrA1816) strain derived from S. typhimurium strain SR-11 (34Gulig P.A. Curtiss 3rd., R. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2891-2901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LB was made as previously described (35Revel M. Gros F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 25: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). L agar is LB containing 7 g of Bacto Agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI)/liter. Bacterial growth conditions were as follows: nonagitated microaerophilic bacterial cultures were prepared by inoculating 10 ml of LB with 0.01 ml of a stationary phase culture followed by overnight incubation (∼18 h) at 37 °C, as previously detailed (1McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 36Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The following reagents were used: mouse anti-Rac1, mouse anti-Cdc42, mouse anti-NFκB p65, (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); rabbit anti-c-Myc, rabbit anti-Iκ-B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-rabbit IL-8 and rabbit anti-canine IL-8 antibodies (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA); goat anti-Salmonella, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD); peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences); rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH); FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA); and rhodamine phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich). Confluent monolayers of T84 cells and MDCK cells, grown on 6.5-mm-diameter collagen-coated Transwell inserts, were washed three times with HBSS and placed into 300 μl of HBSS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were placed in dry wells, and 25 μl ofSalmonella-containing HBSS (1.6 × 1010bacteria/ml) was placed on the apical surface of each monolayer. This inoculum has been previously shown to correspond to 30 associated bacteria/cell (1McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). 1 h later, the monolayers were returned to the wells containing 300 μl of HBSS. 5 h after adding the bacteria, basolateral cell supernatants were removed and assayed for IL-8. Human IL-8 from T84 cells were measured by ELISA as previously described (1McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P. Delp-Archer C. Miller S.I. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Canine IL-8 from MDCK cells was measured by ELISA in 96-well plates (Linbro/Titertek; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) coated overnight with 1 μg/ml anti-rabbit IL-8 monoclonal antibody and detected with rabbit anti-canine IL-8 polyclonal antibody from Dr. Randal Mrsny (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Canine fibronectin from MDCK cells was measured by ELISA in 96-well plates (Linbro/Titertek; ICN Biochemicals) coated overnight with basolateral supernatants and detected with a monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Filter-grown cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold HBSS, lysed in protein loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Branson, Danbury, CT). Equal amounts of total cell protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose according to standard procedure (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar), and processed for immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were visualized with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescent signals were collected and scanned from ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) or a UMAX Astra 1200S flatbed scanner (UMAX Technologies, Inc., Fremont, CA). For figures, the contrast of images was adjusted, arranged, and labeled in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA). The digital images are representative of the original data. GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 were isolated from MDCK cell lysates using a Rac/Cdc42 activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Filter-grown MDCK cell monolayers were washed in HBSS+ at 4 °C and lysed at 4 °C in cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and a fraction (1/100) of the total cell lysate was saved to be probed for total Rac1 or Cdc42. The remaining supernatant was incubated with gentle mixing for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione S-transferase-PAK1 beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The beads were washed extensively, and proteins bound to the beads were separated on 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated with either an anti-Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibody, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were visualized by ECL as described above. MDCK cell monolayers were induced to express the mutant GTPases and treated as indicated. Two hours after treatment, the cells were lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature and then extracted with chloroform. RNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended in distilled H2O treated with 0.01% diethylpyrocarbonate. 30 μg of total RNA was denatured, fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to BrightStar-Plus membrane (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) using NorthernMax-Gly Northern blotting kit procedures (Ambion, Inc.). Canine IL-8 cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were labeled with BrightStar psoralen-biotin nonisotopic labeling kit (Ambion, Inc.). The blots were prehybridized for 60 min at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion, Inc.). The blots were hybridized with 1.0 pmpsoralen-biotin-labeled, heat-denatured cDNA probe in the same solution for 24 h at 42 °C. The blots were washed one time in low stringency wash at room temperature and two times in high stringency wash at 42 °C followed by detection using a BioDetect kit (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to film. The blots were stripped for10 min in 1% SDS-SSC at 100 °C and reprobed as above with a biotinylated DECAtemplate™-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mouse (905 bp) probe (Ambion Inc.). Monolayers of MDCK cells were rinsed three times in PBS, fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and then rinsed three times in PBS. The cells were then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 and rinsed three times with PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin. Permeabilized cells were then incubated with either goat anti-Salmonellaantibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for 20 min at room temperature or mouse anti-NFκB p65 (Transduction Laboratories) or rabbit anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After staining with primary antibodies, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with the appropriate FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 20 min to 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 45 min at 37 °C and rinsed three times in PBS. Monolayers attached to membranes were excised from the inserts and mounted cell side up on a glass slide. The membrane was covered with 10 μl of SlowFade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by a coverslip, and the edges were sealed to prevent drying. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss LSM410 scanning laser confocal microscope using the 488/568 nm wavelength lines of an argon-krypton laser. The cell monolayer was optically section every 0.5 μm. Image resolution using a Zeiss 100× Neofluor objective. Zeiss LSM software was 512 × 512 pixels. Recent studies have relied on nonpolarized cells and in vitro assays to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Salmonella stimulates IL-8 secretion from host cells. Here, we have instead chosen the well characterized MDCK polarized epithelial cell model system to investigate the interactions between host and pathogen. We began by comparing the Salmonella-induced IL-8 secretion in both human T84 and canine MDCK polarized monolayers using human- and canine-specific ELISAs. Both T84 and MDCK cells form polarized monolayers with physically and biochemically distinct apical and basolateral membranes when grown on porous Transwell cell culture inserts (39Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Madara J.L. Stafford J. Barenberg D. Carlson S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G416-G423PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nelson W.J. Hammerton R.W. Wang A.Z. Shore E.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 359-371PubMed Google Scholar). When filter-grown monolayers were infected with wild-type S. typhimurium (χ3306) added to the apical surface, significant IL-8 secretion was detected in the basolateral supernatant at levels comparable with that stimulated by the addition of basolateral TNFα (Fig. 1). Untreated monolayers did not secrete IL-8 during the same time period (Fig. 1). These results confirm that, despite differences in origin, MDCK cell monolayers respond to Salmonella colonization in a manner identical to T84 cells and thus provide an excellent model system for the study of pathogen-epithelial cell interactions. Recent studies in nonpolarized cells have indicated that Cdc42 and to a lesser extent Rac1 were directly involved in the Salmonella-induced membrane ruffling, signaling cascades leading to nuclear responses and ultimately IL-8 secretion (11Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). As a result, our first objective was to determine whether expression of the dominant-negative Cdc42 or Rac1 molecules were capable of inhibiting Salmonella-induced membrane ruffling and IL-8 secretion in our polarized epithelial cell system. We began by examining the expression of the dominant-negative Cdc42 or Rac1 in polarized monolayers both by immunoblot and confocal laser scanning microscopy. When monolayers were incubated in the presence of doxycycline, only the lower molecular weight endogenous GTPases were observed in immunoblots of total cellular protein (Fig. 2 A, MDCK). Filter-grown monolayers expressing the dominant-negative Cdc42 or Rac1 had higher molecular weight bands corresponding to the Myc-tagged mutant proteins, with expression levels equal to or slightly greater than that of the endogenous GTPase (Fig. 2 A,arrow). We also examined the expression in filter-grown monolayers stained with an anti-Myc antibody that recognizes only the mutant GTPases, followed by a secondary FITC-conjugated antibody. Once again we found that monolayers incubated in the presence of doxycycline expressed only the endogenous GTPases and lacked expression of the Myc-tagged dominant-negative mutants (Fig. 2 B,MDCK). Monolayers expressing the dominant-negative Cdc42N17 or Rac1N17 exhibited cytoplasmic staining that was consistent with observations made previously by others (Fig. 2 B) (22Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). The functional ability of the dominant-negative Cdc42 and Rac1 to inhibit endogenous GTPase activity and affectSalmonella-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization was examined in MDCK monolayers. Previous reports in nonpolarized cells indicate that predominantly Cdc42 and to a lesser extent Rac1 regulate the rapid actin cytoskeletal rearrangements needed for bacterial invasion (11Hardt W.D.

https://openalex.org/W1596892137,"Mirk/Dyrk1B protein kinase was shown in an earlier study to function as a transcriptional activator of HNF1α, which Mirk phosphorylates at Ser249 within its CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) binding domain (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The MAPK kinase MKK3 was also shown to activate Mirk as a protein kinase, implicating Mirk in the biological response to certain stress agents. Another MKK3 substrate, p38MAPK, is now shown to inhibit the function of Mirk as a transcriptional activator in a kinase-independent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that kinase-inactive p38AF, as well as wild-type p38, sequestered Mirk and prevented its association with MKK3. Only the p38α and p38β isoforms, but not the γ or δ isoforms, complexed with Mirk. p38αMAPK blocked Mirk activation of HNF1α in a dose-dependent manner, with high levels of kinase-inactive p38αAF completely suppressing the activity of Mirk. Size fractionation by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 200 demonstrated that Mirk is not found as a monomer in vivo, but is found within 150–700 kDa subnuclear complexes, which co-migrate with the nuclear body scaffolding protein PML. Endogenous Mirk, p38, and MKK3 co-migrate within 500–700-kDa protein complexes, which accumulate when nuclear export is blocked by leptomycin B. Stable overexpression of Mirk increases the fraction of Mirk protein and p38 protein within these 500–700 kDa complexes, suggesting that the complexes act as nuclear depots for Mirk and p38. Sequestration of Mirk by p38 may occur within these subnuclear complexes. Synchronization experiments demonstrated that Mirk levels fluctuate about 10-fold within the cell cycle, while p38 levels do not, leading to the speculation that endogenous p38 could only block Mirk function when Mirk levels were low in S phase and not when Mirk levels were elevated in G0/G1. These data suggest a novel cell cycle-dependent function for p38, suppression of the function of Mirk as a transcriptional activator only when cells are proliferating, and thus limiting Mirk function to growth-arrested cells. Mirk/Dyrk1B protein kinase was shown in an earlier study to function as a transcriptional activator of HNF1α, which Mirk phosphorylates at Ser249 within its CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) binding domain (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The MAPK kinase MKK3 was also shown to activate Mirk as a protein kinase, implicating Mirk in the biological response to certain stress agents.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that kinase-inactive p38AF, as well as wild-type p38, sequestered Mirk and prevented its association with MKK3. Only the p38α and p38β isoforms, but not the γ or δ isoforms, complexed with Mirk. p38αMAPK blocked Mirk activation of HNF1α in a dose-dependent manner, with high levels of kinase-inactive p38αAF completely suppressing the activity of Mirk. Size fractionation by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 200 demonstrated that Mirk is not found as a monomer in vivo, but is found within 150–700 kDa subnuclear complexes, which co-migrate with the nuclear body scaffolding protein PML. Endogenous Mirk, p38, and MKK3 co-migrate within 500–700-kDa protein complexes, which accumulate when nuclear export is blocked by leptomycin B. Stable overexpression of Mirk increases the fraction of Mirk protein and p38 protein within these 500–700 kDa complexes, suggesting that the complexes act as nuclear depots for Mirk and p38. Sequestration of Mirk by p38 may occur within these subnuclear complexes. Synchronization experiments demonstrated that Mirk levels fluctuate about 10-fold within the cell cycle, while p38 levels do not, leading to the speculation that endogenous p38 could only block Mirk function when Mirk levels were low in S phase and not when Mirk levels were elevated in G0/G1. These data suggest a novel cell cycle-dependent function for p38, suppression of the function of Mirk as a transcriptional activator only when cells are proliferating, and thus limiting Mirk function to growth-arrested cells.

Joost H.-G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mirk is a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is expressed at elevated levels in normal skeletal muscle and certain carcinoma cell lines and is expressed at low levels in many normal tissues (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant minibrain/dyrk1A flies are characterized by a marked reduction in size of the optic lobes and central brain hemispheres (7Tejedor F. Zhu X. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), so it is reasonable to hypothesize that minibrain/dyrk1A plays a role in neuronal survival and/or proliferation. In cell culture systems dyrk1A mediates neuronal differentiation by phosphorylating CREB in vivo, leading to the stimulation of subsequent CRE-mediated transcription during neuronal differentiation in hippocampal progenitor cells (8Yang E. Ahn Y.S. Chung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39819-39824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mirk/dyrk1B functions as a transactivator of a different transcription factor, HNF1α, to which it binds through the dimerization co-factor DcoH of HNF1α (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of mirk is essential for its biological function. Mirk has constitutive protein kinase activity on the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylates HNF1α at Ser249 within its CBP binding domain (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, mirk activation of HNF1α is enhanced by co-expressed MKK3 (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a MAP kinase kinase that also can activate p38 MAP kinase (9Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Therefore, the basal kinase activity of mirk is enhanced by a MAP kinase kinase, which mediates certain stress signals in vivo. Possibly mirk can transactivate other transcription factors in addition to HNF1α. Mirk bound to a novel protein in yeast two-hybrid analysis, which had several characteristics common to the PAX6 group of transcription factors. 2S. Lim, unpublished data.2S. Lim, unpublished data. However, the identity of genes up-regulated by mirk is unknown. Such genes must have some role in cell cycle regulation or cell survival as stable overexpression of mirk allows cells to remain cycling in the absence of serum growth factors (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we demonstrate that the activation pathway that controls the HNF1α transcriptional transactivator activities of mirk includes the MAP kinase p38 (9Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 10Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Mirk activation is shown to be inhibited by p38 MAP kinase in a novel cell cycle-regulated, kinase-independent manner. Antibodies to MKK3, p38, HNF1α, and residues 37–51 of human PML (PG-M3) were from Santa Cruz, and to the FLAG epitope from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of mirk was raised as described (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobolin-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen, all radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham. All other reagents were from Sigma. NIH3T3 cells, HD3 colon carcinoma cells, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, modified, and supplemented as described (12Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). pHX9F (mirk) and pHX9F (kinase-inactive YF mirk) had been previously generated (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), as were the mirk deletion mutants. 3X. Deng, S. Lim, Z. Yan, S. Mercer, and E. Friedman, submitted for publication. The (β-28)3-luciferase plasmid encoding three tandem repeats of the β-fibrinogen HNF1α binding domain in front of a TATA box promoter and a luciferase reporter gene, the expression plasmid pBJ5-DCoH, and the expression plasmid pBJ5-HNF1α were the kind gifts of Dr. G. Crabtree, Stanford. MKK3b, MKK3b(E), p38, and p38AF, each in pcDNA3-FLAG, were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Han, Scripps Institute. ΔC-HNF1 (1–283 amino acids) had been constructed in an earlier study (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase reactions were performed with glutathioneS-transferase-mirk as described in Ref. 1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. 293T cells were transiently transfected by adding a complex of LipofectAMINE (2–4 μg/μg of DNA) in serum-free medium for 24 h. For reporter gene assays, NIH3T3 cells were seeded the day before transfection at 0.9 × 105/well and allowed to grow overnight in 7% serum containing media. Cells were transfected by incubating with complex of PLUS reagent (3 μl/μg DNA) and LipofectAMINE (2 μl/μg DNA) in serum-free medium for 18–24 h in a CO2 incubator. The amount of total DNA used was kept constant by addition of empty vector DNA, and luciferase activities were calibrated by co-transfected β-galactosidase activity to normalize the transfection efficiency. These assays were carried out in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of three independent experiments. 293T cells in multiple 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of DNA of either MKK3, MKK3E, p38 wild-type, or p38AF, together with either expression plasmids for mirk, kinase-inactive YF-mirk, or pHisA vector (1 μg/well), allowed to express for 24 h, then each dish was lysed in 0.25 ml of EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and a tablet of protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An aliquot of total lysate of 300 μg was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-C2 mirk anti-peptide rabbit polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C, then the complexes were collected by addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, then washed three times with EBC buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in EBC or RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending upon the experiment 10–50 μg of cell lysate were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mmTris-HCL, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer, 3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. All mirk blots used affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to the mirk unique C terminus. Band density in autoradiograms was measured using a Lacie Silverscanner and silverscanner III software and analyzed by the IP LabGel program. HD3 colon carcinoma cells were synchronized by maintainence at confluent density for 2 days (14Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar), serum-starved for 2 days, then re-seeded into multiple 150-mm dishes in complete medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum. Leptomycin B (10 nm final concentration) was added at the time of release. Cells in mid-G1 (6-h-released) and cells in mid-S phase (18-h-released) were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a tablet of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The total lysate was adjusted to 4 mg/ml and 0.2 ml loaded onto a Superdex 200 separation column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted in elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Tween 20) at 0.4 ml/min with fractions of 0.4 ml dropped into tubes containing 10 μg of BSA per tube. Proteins were precipitated with acetone, 1 ml per tube, at −20 °C overnight, then pelleted and dried before resuspension in SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Samples, which were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MKK3 or anti-p38, were dialyzed against lysis buffer overnight, then incubated with either 2 μg of antibody or 2 μg of normal rabbit serum for 24 h at 4 °C, then 20 μl of a slurry of protein A-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added and incubated for an additional 6 h. The agarose beads were extensively washed four times, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Recently mirk protein kinase has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator of HNF1α and to be stimulated as an activator by co-expression with the MAP kinase kinase MKK3 (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since MKK3 is an activator of p38 (9Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 10Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4156-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barret T.T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R. Davis R. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar), MKK3 can activate either p38 or mirk. The choice of kinase substrate could depend on the identity of the upstream kinase activating MKK3 or the presence or absence of scaffold proteins such as IB2/JIP2 (15Buchsbaum R. Connolly B. Feig L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mirk had also been shown to be a substrate of p38 in vitro (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), so in vivo p38 might directly activate or inactivate mirk by phosphorylation. We tested whether co-transfection of p38 would alter mirk transcriptional activation of HNF1 using the β-fibrinogen promoter reporter construct (β-28)3-Luc in transient transfection experiments. Mirk increased the activity of HNF1 about 2.5-fold (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 1and 2), while co-transfection of p38 blocked the stimulation of HNF1 by Mirk. Inhibition of HNF1 activation was not due to the kinase activity of p38 as dominant negative p38AF, doubly mutated at its activation domain, also inhibited HNF1 activation by mirk. Co-expression of either p38AF or wild-type p38 with HNF1 in the absence of mirk decreased HNF1 transcriptional activity by 30–50%, which could be caused by either inhibition of endogenous mirk activity or direct inhibition of HNF1. Since either effect was mediated by kinase-inactive p38, this eliminated direct phosphorylation of HNF1 by p38 as a mechanism of action. Transcriptional activation by mirk was dependent on full-length HNF1. C-terminal-deleted HNF1 (ΔHNF1) containing only amino acids 1–283 could not substitute for full-length HNF1 in this assay. Only background level activation of the reporter gene could be detected when ΔHNF1 was co-transfected with or without mirk (Fig. 1 B), although mirk binds to ΔHNF1-(1–283) and phosphorylates it (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Neither kinase-inactive p38 (AF) or wild-type p38 affected ΔHNF1-(1–283). We then tested whether mirk and p38 directly interact in vivo by determining whether they could co-immunoprecipitate. FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type p38 or dominant negative p38AF were co-transfected into 293T cells with either wild-type mirk or mirk plus MKK3E (Fig. 2 A). Mirk, p38 wild-type and p38AF were synthesized at comparable levels in each experimental mixture, as shown by Western blotting of the cell lysates (Fig. 2 A, lower two lanes). In vivointeraction between p38 and mirk was demonstrated by their co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A). Kinase-inactive p38AF bound mirk about twice as avidly as wild-type p38. Each of the four isoforms of p38, α, β, γ, and δ, were expressed in vivo alone or in the presence of mirk, and the ability of each isoform to interact with mirk in vivo was tested by immunoprecipitation of mirk. Only α and β were capable of complexing and co-immunoprecipitating with mirk (Fig.2 B). The complexing of p38 to mirk blocked the kinase activity of mirk. Increasing amounts of purified recombinant non-activated p38 (0.1–3 μg) were mixed together with 1 μg of purified glutathioneS-transferase-mirk, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed on myelin basic protein (MBP). Without activation p38 had little kinase activity on MBP, while mirk exhibited MBP kinase activity (Fig. 2 C). Mirk kinase activity was inhibited by roughly equimolar concentrations of inactive p38, consistent with the model that p38 sequesters mirk. Since p38AF is a potent inhibitor of mirk activation of HNF1 (Fig. 1), it is likely that p38α and p38β sequester mirk and prevent its activation by MKK3E. If endogenous p38 sequesters endogenous mirk in vivo, the stoichiometry of the two kinases would be critical. We next investigated whether there were any cellular conditions in which sequestering of mirk might be favored or unfavored. Mirk protein levels had been shown to vary severalfold when cells were placed in serum-free conditions (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Mirk protein levels had also been shown to be highest in G0/G1 and fall when cells entered S phase.3 We compared mirk levels and p38 levels in NIH3T3 cells that had been synchronized in G0/G1 by growth to high density, then released by culture at lower density. The level of mirk in G0/G1 at the release time was about 7-fold higher than the mirk level when NIH3T3 cells had entered S phase 18 h post-release, while in contrast the level of p38 varied no more than 8% (Fig. 3 A). A similar imbalance between mirk and p38 levels was seen when HD3 colon carcinoma cells were placed in serum-free medium (Fig. 3 B). Mirk levels increased 11-fold, while p38 levels remained constant in HD3 cells placed in serum-free medium for 22 h. Therefore, p38 might only be effective in sequestering mirk in proliferating cells when mirk levels were lowest. The ability of p38 to sequester mirk was tested by co-expressing mirk with MKK3E in the presence of increasing levels of FLAG-p38AF and then analyzing the molecules bound to either immunoprecipitated mirk (Fig.4 A) or immunoprecipitated MKK3E by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of p38AF, mirk bound well to MKK3E. When the concentration of p38AF increased 10-fold, more FLAG-p38AF and less MKK3E was found associated with mirk in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A,lower panels). At the highest concentration of p38AF, all of the MKK3E in the mirk immunoprecipitates had been replaced with FLAG-p38AF (Fig. 4 A, last lanes). Similarly when MKK3E immunocomplexes were analyzed, increasing amounts of p38AF led to the displacement of mirk (Fig. 4 B, lower panels). This competition experiment was repeated using increasing levels of wild-type p38α. In the absence of wild-type p38, MKK3E bound effectively to immunoprecipitated mirk, but when wild-type p38 was co-expressed, the amount of MKK3E bound to mirk decreased in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that p38 blocked the association of MKK3E and mirk in a kinase-independent manner. In earlier studies we had shown that the constitutively active form of MKK3, MKK3E, enhanced the kinase activity of mirk on myelin basic protein (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), mirk and MKK3E each activated HNF1α's transcriptional activity 3–5-fold, while mirk and MKK3E functioned synergistically to increase the activity of HNF1α 15-fold (1Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The synergistic activation of HNF1 by mirk and MKK3E was strongly inhibited by p38 in a dose-dependent manner in promoter reporter assays (Fig.5, lanes 1–7). Substitution of p38AF for wild-type p38 also strongly inhibited HNF1 activation by mirk and MKK3E. The dominant negative p38AF, which complexed more strongly to mirk than wild-type p38 (Fig. 2 A and data not shown), appeared to be a more effective inhibitor of mirk activation of HNF1. The same range of concentrations of p38 and p38AF were co-transfected with mirk, yet the lowest concentration of p38AF was still inhibitory, while the lowest concentration of wild-type p38 was ineffective (Fig. 5). Both wild-type p38 and p38AF inhibited HNF1 activation mediated by ΔCmirk, as well (Fig. 5, last three lanes). Thus, when p38 or p38AF is co-transfected, they bind to mirk, sequester it, and prevent the activation of mirk as a kinase by MKK3E and the subsequent transactivation of HNF1 by mirk. Mirk does not inhibit p38 activation in vivo. Mirk was expressed at two concentrations, 1× and 4×, together with wild-type p38α and the constitutively active p38 activator MKK3E. Neither wild-type mirk nor the deletion mutant ΔN-mirk prevented activation of p38 by MKK3E, as shown by immunoblotting with antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated activation domain of p38 (Fig.6, top panel). Similar amounts of p38 were expressed in the absence of mirk or in its presence, as shown by Western blotting. Therefore, p38 binds to mirk and prevents the activation of mirk as a kinase by MKK3E, while mirk bound to p38 does not block the activation of p38 by MKK3E. Biological and physical interaction between exogenous, overexpressed mirk and p38 had been readily detected, but no association between endogenous Mirk and endogenous p38 could be detected by similar immunoprecipitation studies. However, mirk-enhanced green fluorescent protein localized within discrete bodies, some intranuclear, within NIH3T3 cells2 so we speculated that such bodies might have to be dissociated to detect interactions between endogenous mirk and p38. Accordingly, we tested this hypothesis by determining whether endogenous mirk migrated as a 70-kDa monomer, or appeared in larger complexes, during gel filtration chromatography. Since Mirk levels were found to be greatest in G1 (Fig. 3), lysates from HD3 cells synchronized in G1 were subjected to size fractionation by FPLC on Superdex 200 HR 10/30. While p38 migrated at its monomer size of ∼40 kDa, the majority of mirk molecules migrated not at its monomer size of 70 kDa, but over a broad size range, 150–700 kDa. Mirk was seen to migrate in a broad size range during gel filtration chromatography in each of six experiments with synchronized cells and in each of five experiments with non-synchronized cells. The relative abundance of the different mirk-containing complexes on gel filtration varied somewhat from experiment to experiment suggesting that our extraction procedure disrupted mirk-containing intranuclear structures, possibly ND10/PML nuclear bodies, which have been postulated to act as depots for proteins released upon cellular stress (16Negorev D. Maul G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7234-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). There is some precedent for this interpretation. The serine/threonine kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is a member of the dyrk/mirk family, co-localizes and interacts with p53 and CBP within PML nuclear bodies (17D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann T. Molle A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the FPLC fractions were examined for the presence of PML protein by Western blotting. PML protein was detected at its presumed monomer size of about 70 kDa and in two overlapping peaks at 660 kDa and at 150 kDa (Fig. 7 A). These data indicate that mirk and PML co-migrate through Superdex 200 and may represent portions of disrupted nuclear bodies. We next tested whether any cellular conditions could cause co-migration of p38 and mirk through Superdex 200. Leptomycin B is a specific inhibitor of nuclear export, which interferes with the binding of nuclear export signals to the export receptor CRM1. Treatment of cells with leptomycin B caused the accumulation of 500–700-kDa mirk-containing complexes in both G1 and S phase cells (Fig. 7, B and D, and data not shown) and also caused the accumulation of p38 and MKK3, the upstream activator of p38 and of mirk, within complexes of similar molecular weight (Fig. 7,B and D). Approximately 17–20% of the total mirk, MKK3, and p38 accumulated within these diffusely migrating subnuclear complexes (Fig. 7 B). We next tested whether increasing the concentration of mirk by stable transfection would increase the fraction of mirk in the high molecular mass 500–700-kDa complexes and whether some p38 would co-localize in these complexes. Lysates from a stable mirk transfectant of HD3 cells, T10, and a vector control transfectant, RV1 (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), were subjected to size fractionation on Superdex 200. In the transfectant cells, more mirk proteins were found in the 500–700-kDa complexes compared with control cells (compare Fig. 7, C andA). In mirk transfectant T10 cells, a small peak of p38 protein, 5% of the total, migrated at 500–700 kDa, the same position as mirk and PML (compare Fig. 7, C and A), and the monomer peak of p38 developed a shoulder, indicating intermediate formation of larger complexes.

We previously demonstrated direct binding of TNP-ATP (2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclo-hexadienylidene)-ATP) to the COOH-terminal cytosolic domains of the pore-forming subunits of Kir1.1 and Kir6.x channels. In addition, PIP2 competed for TNP-ATP binding on the COOH termini of Kir1.1 and Kir6.x channels, providing a mechanism that can account for PIP2 antagonism of ATP inhibition of these channels. To localize the ATP-binding site within the COOH terminus of Kir1.1, we produced and purified maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins containing truncated and/or mutated Kir1.1 COOH termini and examined the binding of TNP-ATP and competition by PIP2. A truncated COOH-terminal fusion protein construct, MBP_1.1CΔC170, containing the first 39 amino acid residues distal to the second transmembrane domain was sufficient to bind TNP-ATP with high affinity. A construct containing the remaining COOH-terminal segment distal to the first 39 amino acid residues did not bind TNP-ATP. Deletion of 5 or more amino acid residues from the NH2-terminal side of the COOH terminus abolished nucleotide binding to the entire COOH terminus or to the first 49 amino acid residues of the COOH terminus. PIP2 competed TNP-ATP binding to MBP_1.1CΔC170 with an EC50 of 10.9 μm. Mutation of any one of three arginine residues (R188A/E, R203A, and R217A), which are conserved in Kir1.1 and KATP channels and are involved in ATP and/or PIP2 effects on channel activity, dramatically reduced TNP-ATP binding to MBP_1.1ΔC170. In contrast, mutation of a fourth conserved residue (R212A) exhibited slightly enhanced TNP-ATP binding and increased affinity for PIP2 competition of TNP-ATP (EC50 = 5.7 μm).

Mice with deletion of the ROMK (Kir1.1) gene exhibit a phenotype consistent with Bartter's syndrome with polyuria, increased urinary Na+ loss, and extracellular fluid volume depletion (23Lu M.

The ROMK-deficient mice have no small conductance channel activity on apical membranes of thick ascending limb or principal cells, consistent with ROMK encoding the small conductance K+ recycling/secretory channel in kidney.In the present study, we further localized the ATP binding within the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. We assessed TNP-ATP binding and its antagonism by PIP2 to purified maltose-binding fusion proteins with deletions of the cytosolic COOH terminus of Kir1.1. The ATP-PIP2 binding domain was localized to the first 39 amino acids of the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. We also defined specific arginine residues within this 39-amino acid domain that are critical for TNP-ATP binding. Because these arginine residues are conserved in the Kir6.x channels, similar domains in these channels are likely to also form ATP-binding pockets.DISCUSSIONOur previous study provided direct evidence that TNP-ATP can bind to the COOH termini of Kir1.1 and the ATP-sensitive K+channels, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (19Vanoye C.G. MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tang L. Buschmann A.E. Hall A.E. Lu M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 23260-23270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because TNP-ATP did not bind to the NH2 termini of Kir1.1 or Kir6.1, the COOH terminus of ATP-regulated K+ channels was both necessary and sufficient to bind nucleotides. The present observations support the suggestion that ATP inhibition of KATP channel activity is mediated by interaction of ATP with the COOH terminus of the Kir subunit. Here we have further localized the nucleotide binding segment of Kir1.1 to the initial 39 amino acid residues of the COOH terminus. In addition, we show that specific residues within this segment are critical to nucleotide binding. Finally, we demonstrate that this 39-residue segment also retains the critical sequences necessary for PIP2 competition of TNP-ATP binding.Several lines of evidence indicate that the initial 39 amino acid residues of the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 is the minimal segment necessary for the high affinity binding of TNP-ATP and for PIP2 competition and that this segment is the only significant adenine nucleotide-binding region along the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. First, MBP_1.1CΔC170 bound TNP-ATP with higher affinity than the entire COOH terminus (Figs. 1 and 2, MBP_1.1C-WT) or any of the other truncation constructs (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In addition, TNP-ATP binding to the construct with a 10-residue greater truncation (MBP_1.1CΔC180) was dramatically reduced compared with MBP_1.1CΔC170 (Fig. 1). Moreover, MBP_1.1ΔC170 exhibited a significantly higher γ (Fig. 2 C) than for MBP_1.1C-WT, consistent with an improved protein environment for TNP-ATP binding. Second, the 170-amino acid segment of the COOH terminus beyond the initial 39 amino acid residues (MBP_1.1CΔN39) did not exhibit significant TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 3 D), demonstrating that nucleotide binding is limited to the first 39 amino acids of the COOH terminus. Third, truncations of as few as 5 amino acids from the NH2-terminal end of the COOH terminus (Fig. 3 C) virtually abolished TNP-ATP binding. Fourth, mutation of any one of three individual residues (Fig. 6, Arg188,Arg203, or Arg217) within the 39-amino acid MBP_1.1CΔC170 construct abolished TNP-ATP binding, indicating that they are directly involved in the formation of the TNP-ATP binding structure of Kir1.1. The observation that R212A did not alter TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 6 C) indicates that the effects of R188A (Fig. 6 A), R203A (Fig. 6 B), and R217A (Fig. 6 D) on TNP-ATP binding are unlikely to be nonspecific.All three arginine residues that affect TNP-ATP binding in Kir1.1 (Arg188, Arg203, andArg217) are conserved in Kir6.x channels (Fig.5) as well as most Kir channels, the only exception being that Arg203 is a histidine residue in Kir4.1. Mutation of any of these three residues in Kir6.2 (Arg177,Arg192, or Arg206; Fig.5) has been shown to alter channel gating by ATP and/or PIP2 (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because ATP and PIP2 are competitive regulators of KATP channel gating and we have shown that TNP-ATP and PIP2 interactions occur within the same 39-amino acid segment (Fig. 7), this mutational study in Kir6.2 is fully consistent with our observations of the critical roles of Arg188 and Arg217 in nucleotide binding (Fig.6). Interestingly, the R201A mutation in Kir6.2 (Fig. 5 A), corresponding to R212A in Kir1.1, reduces Kir6.2 channel gating by ATP and PIP2, whereas this mutation in Kir1.1 has no effect on TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 6 C) and enhances competition of TNP-ATP binding by PIP2 (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that Arg201 in Kir6.2 functions differently than Arg212 in Kir1.1 for ATP binding or that Arg201in Kir6.2 affects channel gating by a mechanism other than modification of direct binding of ATP. Finally, a number of other residues in the first 39 amino acids of Kir6.2 have also been shown to affect ATP and/or PIP2 gating of channel activity (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G.

MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tang L. Buschmann A.E. Hall A.E. Lu M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 23260-23270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The TNP-ATP/protein stoichiometry of 0.78 for the entire Kir1.1 COOH terminus (MBP_1.1C-WT) confirms our previous observations of a single adenine nucleotide binding site for each of the four Kir subunits forming the kidney ATP-regulated K+ channel. The present results provide additional support for this model by demonstrating that TNP-ATP binding is confined to a single short segment in the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. Although the No for MBP_1.1CΔC170 (Fig. 2 B) was reduced compared with WT, the stoichiometry of 0.5 is still consistent with one binding site per protein molecule. The reduced stoichiometry was also observed in MBP_1.1CΔC84 and MBP_1.1CΔC160, suggesting that amino acids in the distal COOH terminus may be involved in the stabilization of the proximal 39-residue adenine nucleotide binding pocket.One of the major regulatory mechanisms of Kir1.1 and KATPchannels, as well as other Kir K+ channels, is channel gating (opening) by phosphatidylinositol phospholipids like PIP2. PIP2 competition of the inhibitory action of ATP provides a mechanism for opening KATP channels in intact cells in the presence of millimolar concentrations of cytosolic ATP. We have recently reported that PIP2 competed with TNP-ATP binding to the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 and Kir6.x channels. Our present results show that the 39-amino acid nucleotide binding domain in the COOH termini of Kir1.1 retains the ability of PIP2to compete off TNP-ATP. Thus, the initial 39-amino acid residue segment in the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 represents both the ATP binding domain and a PIP2 binding segment. The enhancement, rather than diminution, of PIP2 competition of TNP-ATP binding in the R212A mutant suggests that the effect of mutation of the similar residue in Kir6.2 (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) on PIP2-ATP interactions may involve a mechanism other than ATP-PIP2 competition for binding. It should be noted, however, that although the initial COOH-terminal sequences of Kir1.1 and Kir6.2 are similar, they are not identical. Thus, it is possible that certain distinct amino acid residues in Kir6.2 may change the role of this arginine residue in PIP2binding compared with Kir1.1.In summary, we have defined a 39-amino acid segment in the Kir1.1 (ROMK) COOH terminus that forms an ATP-PIP2 binding domain and have identified three arginine residues that significantly alter TNP-ATP binding. Because this region is similar and the three critical arginine residues are conserved in Kir6.x channels (Fig.5 B), it seems likely that the initial COOH-terminal segment in KATP channels also forms an ATP-PIP2 binding domain. ATP-sensitive K+(KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to K+ channel activity (3Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 4Ashcroft S.J.

Mice with deletion of the ROMK (Kir1.1) gene exhibit a phenotype consistent with Bartter's syndrome with polyuria, increased urinary Na+ loss, and extracellular fluid volume depletion (23Lu M.

The ROMK-deficient mice have no small conductance channel activity on apical membranes of thick ascending limb or principal cells, consistent with ROMK encoding the small conductance K+ recycling/secretory channel in kidney. In the present study, we further localized the ATP binding within the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. We assessed TNP-ATP binding and its antagonism by PIP2 to purified maltose-binding fusion proteins with deletions of the cytosolic COOH terminus of Kir1.1. The ATP-PIP2 binding domain was localized to the first 39 amino acids of the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. We also defined specific arginine residues within this 39-amino acid domain that are critical for TNP-ATP binding. Because these arginine residues are conserved in the Kir6.x channels, similar domains in these channels are likely to also form ATP-binding pockets. DISCUSSIONOur previous study provided direct evidence that TNP-ATP can bind to the COOH termini of Kir1.1 and the ATP-sensitive K+channels, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (19Vanoye C.G. MacGregor G.G. Dong K.

Because TNP-ATP did not bind to the NH2 termini of Kir1.1 or Kir6.1, the COOH terminus of ATP-regulated K+ channels was both necessary and sufficient to bind nucleotides. The present observations support the suggestion that ATP inhibition of KATP channel activity is mediated by interaction of ATP with the COOH terminus of the Kir subunit. Here we have further localized the nucleotide binding segment of Kir1.1 to the initial 39 amino acid residues of the COOH terminus. In addition, we show that specific residues within this segment are critical to nucleotide binding. Finally, we demonstrate that this 39-residue segment also retains the critical sequences necessary for PIP2 competition of TNP-ATP binding.Several lines of evidence indicate that the initial 39 amino acid residues of the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 is the minimal segment necessary for the high affinity binding of TNP-ATP and for PIP2 competition and that this segment is the only significant adenine nucleotide-binding region along the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. First, MBP_1.1CΔC170 bound TNP-ATP with higher affinity than the entire COOH terminus (Figs. 1 and 2, MBP_1.1C-WT) or any of the other truncation constructs (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In addition, TNP-ATP binding to the construct with a 10-residue greater truncation (MBP_1.1CΔC180) was dramatically reduced compared with MBP_1.1CΔC170 (Fig. 1). Moreover, MBP_1.1ΔC170 exhibited a significantly higher γ (Fig. 2 C) than for MBP_1.1C-WT, consistent with an improved protein environment for TNP-ATP binding. Second, the 170-amino acid segment of the COOH terminus beyond the initial 39 amino acid residues (MBP_1.1CΔN39) did not exhibit significant TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 3 D), demonstrating that nucleotide binding is limited to the first 39 amino acids of the COOH terminus. Third, truncations of as few as 5 amino acids from the NH2-terminal end of the COOH terminus (Fig. 3 C) virtually abolished TNP-ATP binding. Fourth, mutation of any one of three individual residues (Fig. 6, Arg188,Arg203, or Arg217) within the 39-amino acid MBP_1.1CΔC170 construct abolished TNP-ATP binding, indicating that they are directly involved in the formation of the TNP-ATP binding structure of Kir1.1. The observation that R212A did not alter TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 6 C) indicates that the effects of R188A (Fig. 6 A), R203A (Fig. 6 B), and R217A (Fig. 6 D) on TNP-ATP binding are unlikely to be nonspecific.All three arginine residues that affect TNP-ATP binding in Kir1.1 (Arg188, Arg203, andArg217) are conserved in Kir6.x channels (Fig.5) as well as most Kir channels, the only exception being that Arg203 is a histidine residue in Kir4.1. Mutation of any of these three residues in Kir6.2 (Arg177,Arg192, or Arg206; Fig.5) has been shown to alter channel gating by ATP and/or PIP2 (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because ATP and PIP2 are competitive regulators of KATP channel gating and we have shown that TNP-ATP and PIP2 interactions occur within the same 39-amino acid segment (Fig. 7), this mutational study in Kir6.2 is fully consistent with our observations of the critical roles of Arg188 and Arg217 in nucleotide binding (Fig.6). Interestingly, the R201A mutation in Kir6.2 (Fig. 5 A), corresponding to R212A in Kir1.1, reduces Kir6.2 channel gating by ATP and PIP2, whereas this mutation in Kir1.1 has no effect on TNP-ATP binding (Fig. 6 C) and enhances competition of TNP-ATP binding by PIP2 (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that Arg201 in Kir6.2 functions differently than Arg212 in Kir1.1 for ATP binding or that Arg201in Kir6.2 affects channel gating by a mechanism other than modification of direct binding of ATP. Finally, a number of other residues in the first 39 amino acids of Kir6.2 have also been shown to affect ATP and/or PIP2 gating of channel activity (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G.

MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tang L. Buschmann A.E. Hall A.E. Lu M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 23260-23270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The TNP-ATP/protein stoichiometry of 0.78 for the entire Kir1.1 COOH terminus (MBP_1.1C-WT) confirms our previous observations of a single adenine nucleotide binding site for each of the four Kir subunits forming the kidney ATP-regulated K+ channel. The present results provide additional support for this model by demonstrating that TNP-ATP binding is confined to a single short segment in the COOH terminus of Kir1.1. Although the No for MBP_1.1CΔC170 (Fig. 2 B) was reduced compared with WT, the stoichiometry of 0.5 is still consistent with one binding site per protein molecule. The reduced stoichiometry was also observed in MBP_1.1CΔC84 and MBP_1.1CΔC160, suggesting that amino acids in the distal COOH terminus may be involved in the stabilization of the proximal 39-residue adenine nucleotide binding pocket.One of the major regulatory mechanisms of Kir1.1 and KATPchannels, as well as other Kir K+ channels, is channel gating (opening) by phosphatidylinositol phospholipids like PIP2. PIP2 competition of the inhibitory action of ATP provides a mechanism for opening KATP channels in intact cells in the presence of millimolar concentrations of cytosolic ATP. We have recently reported that PIP2 competed with TNP-ATP binding to the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 and Kir6.x channels. Our present results show that the 39-amino acid nucleotide binding domain in the COOH termini of Kir1.1 retains the ability of PIP2to compete off TNP-ATP. Thus, the initial 39-amino acid residue segment in the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 represents both the ATP binding domain and a PIP2 binding segment. The enhancement, rather than diminution, of PIP2 competition of TNP-ATP binding in the R212A mutant suggests that the effect of mutation of the similar residue in Kir6.2 (14Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) on PIP2-ATP interactions may involve a mechanism other than ATP-PIP2 competition for binding. It should be noted, however, that although the initial COOH-terminal sequences of Kir1.1 and Kir6.2 are similar, they are not identical. Thus, it is possible that certain distinct amino acid residues in Kir6.2 may change the role of this arginine residue in PIP2binding compared with Kir1.1.In summary, we have defined a 39-amino acid segment in the Kir1.1 (ROMK) COOH terminus that forms an ATP-PIP2 binding domain and have identified three arginine residues that significantly alter TNP-ATP binding. Because this region is similar and the three critical arginine residues are conserved in Kir6.x channels (Fig.5 B), it seems likely that the initial COOH-terminal segment in KATP channels also forms an ATP-PIP2 binding domain. Our previous study provided direct evidence that TNP-ATP can bind to the COOH termini of Kir1.1 and the ATP-sensitive K+channels, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (19Vanoye C.G. MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tang L.

https://openalex.org/W1976729668,"We have made deletions of the porcine plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene to obtain recombinant truncated PAI-1 proteins to examine functions of the PAI-1 isoforms. We previously reported that one recombinant truncated protein, rPAI-123, induces the formation of angiostatin by cleaving plasmin. The rPAI-123 protein is also able to bind urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen and then reduce the amount of plasmin that is formed. We have now prepared three different truncated rPAI-1 proteins and demonstrate that PAI-1 conformations control the release of heparin-binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms. The rPAI-123 isoform can regulate the functional activity of heparan sulfate-binding VEGF-A isoforms by blocking the activation of VEGF from heparan sulfate. The rPAI-123 conformation induced extensive apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells and thus reduced the number of proliferating cells. The rPAI-123 isoform inhibited migration of VEGF-stimulated sprouting from chick aortic rings by 65%, thus displaying a role in anti-angiogenic mechanisms. This insight into anti-angiogenic functions related to PAI-1 conformational changes could provide potential intervention points in angiogenesis associated with atherosclerotic plaques and cancer.

Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillary blood vessels as outgrowths of pre-existing vessels. This tightly regulated process normally occurs during development (1D'Amore P.A. Thompson R.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 453-464Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Google Scholar), tissue repair and remodeling (1D'Amore P.A. Thompson R.W. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Google Scholar). At the onset of angiogenesis, the quiescent endothelium is destabilized into migratory, proliferative endothelial cells. The angiogenic (activated) endothelium is maintained primarily by positive regulatory molecules. In the absence of such molecules, the endothelium remains in a differentiated, quiescent state that is maintained by negative regulatory molecules, which act as angiogenesis inhibitors (4Bouck N. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 179-185Google Scholar, 5Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Google Scholar). Normally, the negative and positive activities are balanced to maintain the vascular endothelium in quiescence (5Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Google Scholar, 6Folkman J. Klagsbrum M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Google Scholar). A shift in the balance of the positive and negative regulatory molecules can alter the differentiated state of the endothelium from the non-angiogenic, quiescent to the angiogenic state (5Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Google Scholar). In the switch to pro-angiogenesis, the quiescent endothelial cells are stimulated to migrate toward a chemotactic stimulus, lining up in a tube (sprout) formation (6Folkman J. Klagsbrum M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Google Scholar). They also secrete proteolytic enzymes that degrade the endothelial basement membrane, thus allowing the migrating endothelial cells to extend into the perivascular stroma to begin a new capillary sprout. The angiogenic process is characterized by increased proliferation of endothelial cells to form the extending capillary (6Folkman J. Klagsbrum M.

VEGF-A189 and VEGF-A205 isoforms have a greater affinity for heparin (16Park J.E. Keller G.-A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Google Scholar,17Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V.

Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Google Scholar). Pro-VEGF affinity for heparin/heparan sulfate appears to be important in the regulation of the availability of VEGF at the cell surface (18Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Google Scholar), where it can interact with its tyrosine kinase receptors to exert its activity (19Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Google Scholar). VEGF-A165 can be released from heparan sulfate in an inactive or active form (20Keck R.G. Berleau L. Harris R. Keyt B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 103-113Google Scholar, 21Plouet J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldebouef N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Google Scholar). Plasmin and uPA cleave pro-VEGF into an active form of varied sizes depending upon the isoform and the activator molecule (21Plouet J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldebouef N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Google Scholar). Soluble pro-VEGF-A165 can be cleaved by plasmin to produce a smaller active molecule that can directly bind VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 independent of heparan sulfate binding (17Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Google Scholar). There are naturally occurring molecules that serve as negative regulators of angiogenesis. Angiostatin, one of those negative regulators, is a 38- to 45-kDa cleavage product of plasminogen, containing kringle domains 1–4 (K1–4) (22O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

Plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin, is activated when it is cleaved at the carboxyl terminus by plasminogen activators. The amino terminus contains five consecutive kringle domains, each of ∼9 kDa. The greatest inhibitory activity of angiostatin is contained within kringles 1–3 (24Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Google Scholar) and kringles 1–5 (25Cao R. Wu H.-L. Veitonmaki N. Linden P. Farnebo J. Shi G.-Y. Cao Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 6: 5728-5733Google Scholar). The mechanism for angiostatin inhibition of endothelial cell growth in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo is unclear. PAI-1, a serpin family, serine protease inhibitor, is a multifunctional regulatory protein in the plasminogen activator proteolytic (26Chapman H.A. Vavrin Z. Hibbs J.B. Cell. 1982; 28: 653-662Google Scholar, 27Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Google Scholar) and fibrinolytic pathways (28Loskutoff D.J. Curriden S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 598: 238-247Google Scholar, 29Collen D. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 258-270Google Scholar). Active PAI-1 (vitronectin-bound) inhibits proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix by inhibiting uPA/tPA, which in turn inhibits cell migration and invasion (30Blasi F. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 298-304Google Scholar). PAI-1 can exist in an active, inactive/latent, or substrate cleaved conformation (31Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Google Scholar, 32Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 597-601Google Scholar). The PAI-1-strained reactive center loop (RCL), located at amino acids 320–351 (33Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar, 34Laskowski M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), initially interacts with uPA at Arg-346 (35Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Google Scholar, 36Tucker H.M. Gerard R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 180-187Google Scholar) to form a stable PAI-1·uPA complex to inactivate uPA (37York J.D. Li P. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8495-8500Google Scholar). In the inactive/latent configuration of PAI-1 (not bound to vitronectin) the RCL spontaneously inserts into the β-sheet of strand 4a to stabilize the PAI-1 structure (38Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Google Scholar, 39Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). It has been shown that, when PAI-1 is cleaved between residues P and P′ in the RCL, PAI-1 is converted to a substrate (31Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Google Scholar, 32Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 597-601Google Scholar). In the cleaved conformation, the RCL is partially inserted into the β-sheet of strand A, thus making the structure of cleaved and inactive PAI-1 more similar to each other than to active PAI-1. However, it has been demonstrated that there are distinct conformational differences between latent and cleaved PAI-1 (40Egelund R. Schousboe S.L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 775-785Google Scholar). Biochemical and in vitro studies demonstrate that PAI-1 can be cleaved into smaller fragments by thrombin (41Ehrlich H.J. Gebbick R.K. Preissner K.T.

Van Hoef B. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37645-37650Google Scholar). The PAI-1 cleavage products, ranging from 22 to 44 kDa, render PAI-1 inactive. The PAI-1 region distant from the RCL contains many binding domains for regulatory molecules involved in the proteolytic and fibrinolytic pathways. This region of PAI-1 has interactive sites for vitronectin (45Kjoller L. Martensen P.M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Justesen J. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Google Scholar) have demonstrated that, through its interactions with some of the same regulatory molecules in the proteolytic and fibrinolytic pathways, PAI-1 (active and inactive) is also able to play a role in anti-angiogenic mechanisms. We have recently reported that, when a truncated porcine PAI-1 protein, rPAI-123, is incubated with plasminogen and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), it induces formation of an angiostatin-like protein that has proteolytic activity (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). In this reaction, angiostatin is formed from cleaved plasmin. uPA enhances the formation of the angiostatin-like protein by increasing the amount of available plasmin. The proteolytic activity of the 36-kDa angiostatin is ultimately inhibited by increasing amounts of rPAI-123that are available for binding uPA and/or plasminogen. In this second mechanism, rPAI-123 reduces the numbers of uPA/plasminogen interactions, thus reducing the amount of plasmin produced. Cultured endothelial cells exposed to rPAI-123 exhibit a decrease in proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration in the presence of VEGF. This truncated PAI-1 appears to expose sites that participate in a functional role for PAI-1 in generating angiostatin fragments from plasmin. We have previously shown by zymography the importance of rPAI-123 interactions with uPA, plasminogen, and plasmin that result in angiostatin formation. We also demonstrated that rPAI-123 blocks migration of VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). Because pro-VEGF is able to form complexes with heparan sulfate at the endothelial cell surface where it can be cleaved by uPA or plasmin to produce active VEGF, we considered the potential importance of PAI-1 binding domains for heparin, heparan sulfate, uPA at amino acids 128–145, and plasmin that may affect VEGF activation. We further engineered the porcine PAI-1 gene to obtain three additional truncated PAI-1 proteins, rPAI-1, for functional studies. There are no known functional differences between human and porcine PAI-1 (61Bijnens A.P. Knockaert I. Cousin E. Kruithof E. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 350-356Google Scholar, 62Bosma P.J. van de Berg E.A. Kooistra T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9129-9141Google Scholar). Two of the rPAI-1 proteins, rPAI-1Hep23 and rPAI-1Δ23, are encoded by DNA sequences identical to therPAI-123 (55) except thatrPAI-1Hep23 contains the codons for the entire heparin binding domain, which have been completely deleted inrPAI-1Δ23. The rPAI-124 protein is the only rPAI-1 isoform that contains the reactive center loop (RCL) on the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 320–351). Amino acid residues 262–379 in mature poPAI-1 were deleted from the carboxyl termini of rPAI-123, rPAI-1Hep23, and rPAI-1Δ23. The RCL was within the deleted region and, therefore, enabled examination of the importance of the uPA site at residues 128–145, in the absence of the primary uPA site at Arg-346. We demonstrate here that the rPAI-123 conformation is able to block the availability of heparan sulfate-binding VEGF-A, thus inhibiting the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells in vitro and sprouting in an organ culture. The DNA encoding each truncated PAI-1 protein was obtained by deleting the porcine PAI-1 gene (poPAI-1) (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar, 61Bijnens A.P. Knockaert I. Cousin E. Kruithof E. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 350-356Google Scholar). The selection of gene fragments was based on the poPAI-1sequences that correspond to the human PAI-1 gene (huPAI-1) (62Bosma P.J. van de Berg E.A. Kooistra T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9129-9141Google Scholar) sequences reported to code for functional domains in human PAI-1 (Fig. 1) (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). Each DNA fragment was isolated from porcine aortic endothelial cells by reverse-transcribing RNA into cDNA. The cDNA was made double-stranded in a PCR reaction containing porcine PAI-1-specific primers. The primers for rPAI-123 were previously described (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). The following primers were used to PCR-amplify the cDNA into double-stranded DNA coding forrPAI-1Δ23,rPAI-1Hep23, and rPAI-124(underlining denotes restriction enzyme sequences): rPAI-1Δ23 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCATGGATGAGATCAGCACGG-3′ and rPAI-1Δ23 3′ primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTCCACTGGCTGATG-3′ (amplifiespoPAI-1 nucleotides 471–999 corresponding tohuPAI-1 nucleotides 265–793); rPAI-1Hep23 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCATGCAGTTCAAGATTGAGGAGAAGGGC-3′ and rPAI-1Hep23 3′ primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTCCACTGGCTGATG-3′ (amplifies poPAI-1 nucleotides 390–999 corresponding tohuPAI-1 nucleotides 184–793); rPAI-124 5′ primer, 5′-GGAATTCAAGGAGCTCATGG-3′ and rPAI-1243′ primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATCAAGGCTCCATCAC-3′ (amplifies poPAI-1nucleotides 444–1346 corresponding to huPAI-1nucleotides 238–1162). The PCR conditions for all three genes were as described previously (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified rPAI-1 DNA fragments were double-digested withEcoRI and XbaI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) to activate the incorporated restriction enzyme sites. The restricted DNA was ligated into a Pichia pastorisyeast shuttle vector, pGAPZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The TOP 10 strain of Escherichia coli was transformed by electroporation as described (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, colonies were selected and grown in low salt LB broth for 5–7 h at 37 °C. The DNA from each colony growth was isolated (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) to identify a clone containing each gene insert. Positive isolates from restriction enzyme digests were verified by sequencing. Each recombinant protein was expressed in P. pastoris as described (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography. The deletions of poPAI-1 are shown diagramatically in Fig. 1. The sequences of the rPAI-123, rPAI-1Δ23, rPAI-1Hep23, and rPAI-124 DNA matched the known sequence of the corresponding segment of porcine PAI-1 DNA. Each rPAI-1 protein corresponded to its expected molecular weight (data not shown). The functionality of the rPAI-1 proteins was first tested by incubating each truncated protein with uPA and plasminogen to assess the proteolytic activity of the products of the reaction, as described (55Mulligan-Kehoe M.J. Wagner R. Wieland C. Powell R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8588-8596Google Scholar). The functionality of each rPAI-1 isoform was then tested in a reaction with heparin bound to Sepharose beads. First, the rPAI-123, rPAI-1 Δ23, rPAI-1Hep23, and rPAI-124 proteins (20 μg) were each incubated with 50 μl of heparin-bound Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 h at 37 °C. The unbound protein was separated from the heparin-Sepharose-bound protein complex by microcentrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were washed in TBS/Tween 20 followed by TBS washes. Bound samples were reacted with uPA (0.5 IU/1 μg of rPAI-1 protein) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by a second 1-h, 37 °C incubation with plasminogen (1 IU/1 μg of rPAI-1 protein). The reaction samples were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1.3% casein (zymogram) (63Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Au Y.P. Reidy M.A. Belin D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 61-67Google Scholar, 64Allaire E. Hasenstab D. Kenagy R.D. Starcher B. Clowes M.M. Clowes A.W. Circulation. 1998; 98: 249-255Google Scholar). The electrophoresed samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2to enable plasmin degradation of casein. Protein products from the reaction of rPAI-1, uPA, and plasminogen were electrophoresed on a 4–20%, SDS, non-reducing polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with an antibody (1 μg/ml) specific for plasminogen kringles 1–3 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Following a 1-h, room temperature incubation with the primary antibody, a secondary rabbit anti-goat IgG HC + LC (Pierce, Rockford, IL) polyclonal antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml was incubated with the anti-kringle probed membrane for 1 h at room temperature. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) diluted 1:5000 amplified the binding reaction, which was ultimately detected by addition of a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Bovine aortic endothelial cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/T-75 culture flask containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml), and l-glutamine (0.292 mg/ml) (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 before adding 3 nm of either exogenous rPAI-123, rPAI-1Δ23, rPAI-124, or rPAI-1Hep23, or supernatant fromP. pastoris culture medium. The cells were incubated an additional 48 h at 37 °C. Adherent cells were trypsinized, resuspended in dmem containing 10% FBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, then pelleted. The pelleted cells were washed twice with cold HBSS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated ApopNexin and propidium iodide (PI) were added to the cells following the manufacturer's protocol (Integren, Purchase, NY) (65Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Google Scholar). Each cell fraction was analyzed separately on a Fax Scan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The data represent five separate experiments, each performed in duplicate. Bovine endothelial cells, treated with exogenous rPAI-1 protein, were plated into six-well culture plates at a density of 1.0 × 104/ml to assess their proliferative properties in the presence of rPAI-1 proteins. The cells were trypsinized and counted on a hemacytometer plate at 48 and 96 h after adding exogenous rPAI-1. To further ascertain the proliferative properties of the rPAI-1-treated cells, a BrdUrd labeling assay was performed using a FITC-labeled BrdUrd-specific antibody. The addition of propidium iodide (PI) enabled a microscopic count of the proliferating cells relative to total number of cells. BrdUrd was added to the culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 10 μm. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd was diluted 2.5-fold in 0.5% Tween 20/PBS and added directly to the cell culture medium for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS and incubated with PI for 1 min. Incorporation of BrdUrd was calculated by counting the number of cells containing FITC stain (green) or PI stain (red) in five fields per sample in triplicate experiments. Aortic arches were removed (R. Auerbach, University of Wisconsin, personal communication) from fertilized chicken eggs (Oliver Merrill & Sons, Londonderry, NH) at day 14 of embryonic development. The eggs were cracked into a sterile 100-mm culture dish. The embryo was removed from its surroundings by cutting away the associated membranes and yolk sac. The chick embryo was placed ventral side up to surgically expose the heart and aortic arches. The heart and aortic arch were removed and placed into a sterile culture dish containing PBS to which 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was added. Arches, from which the surrounding adventitia had been removed, were cut into 0.8-mm sections. Each arch was placed onto 1–5 μl of Matrigel (66Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6188-6193Google Scholar) that was deposited on the bottom of a six-well culture plate just prior to adding the ring. An additional 300 μl of ice-cold Matrigel was spread in a circle surrounding each aortic arch. The Matrigel was allowed to solidify before adding 2 ml of human endothelial-SFM basal growth medium (Invitrogen). An rPAI-1 protein and bovine brain extract (BBE) (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), at 30 nm and 10%, respectively, were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To assess the characteristics of the new sprouts that could be ascribed to VEGF and the characteristics that were inhibited by rPAI-123, VEGF-A (100 ng/ml), and rPAI-123 (30 nm) were added to the culture medium containing the aortic rings. At 48 h, additional medium containing BBE or VEGF and rPAI-1 protein was added to the aortic rings. Growth at 37 °C was continued for an additional 48 h. Quantitative evaluation of tubule formation was performed by a blinded observer on a scale of 1–5 (least to maximum sprouting). VEGF was isolated from bovine aortic endothelial cells by first incubating the cells overnight in serum-freedmem. The medium was changed before adding 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h at 37 °C. The serum-freedmem containing the heparin-VEGF complex was precipitated in 80% ethanol. The serum-free medium from which the VEGF-heparin complex was isolated, was probed for VEGF-A121 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to ensure that this non-heparin binding VEGF isoform did not precipitate with the VEGF-heparin complex. VEGF-A121 was not detected. The heparin-VEGF complex was incubated with rPAI-123, rPAI-1Δ23, rPAI-124, or rPAI-1Hep23 protein (3, 15, and 30 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C. Either uPA (0.25 IU) or plasmin (made from 1.0 IU plasminogen and 0.25 IU uPA) was added to the VEGF-heparin-rPAI-1 reaction. After an additional 2-h incubation at 37 °C with uPA or plasmin, DTT at a final concentration of 0.1m was added to one half of the reaction mixture for 3.5 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of each reaction mixture was denatured at 95 °C, then electrophoresed on a 4–20%, SDS-polyacrylamide gel.
