https://openalex.org/W1990516841,"Solution structures of two Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-ligand complexes have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. Each complex consists of the SH3 domain and a nine-residue proline-rich peptide selected from a large library of ligands prepared by combinatorial synthesis. The bound ligands adopt a left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix, although the amino to carboxyl directionalities of their helices are opposite. The peptide orientation is determined by a salt bridge formed by the terminal arginine residues of the ligands and the conserved aspartate-99 of the SH3 domain. Residues at positions 3, 4, 6, and 7 of both peptides also intercalate into the ligand-binding site; however, the respective proline and nonproline residues show exchanged binding positions in the two complexes. These structural results led to a model for the interactions of SH3 domains with proline-rich peptides that can be used to predict critical residues in complexes of unknown structure. The model was used to identify correctly both the binding orientation and the contact and noncontact residues of a peptide derived from the nucleotide exchange factor Sos in association with the amino-terminal SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2."
https://openalex.org/W1747994692,"Cellular constituents of heart muscle contain both constitutive and inducible nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathways that modulate the contractile properties of cardiac myocytes. The identities of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) isoform(s) expressed in cardiac muscle, and of the specific cell types expressing iNOS activity, remain poorly characterized. We amplified a 217-base pair cDNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from primary cultures of inflammatory cytokine-pretreated adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM) that was nearly identical to other iNOS cDNA sequences. Using this 217-base pair cDNA as a probe in Northern blots, we found no evidence of iNOS mRNA in control myocytes, but both interleukin-1 beta and interferon-gamma individually increased iNOS mRNA abundance in primary cultures of ARVM, with maximal expression at 12 h. The half-life of iNOS mRNA in actinomycin C1-treated cells was 4 h. Both dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-beta attenuated the induction of iNOS mRNA abundance and enzyme activity by IL-1 beta and INF gamma. Pretreatment with dexamethasone also abolished the induction of iNOS mRNA, but not the increase in GTP cyclohydrolase mRNA in purified cardiac myocytes from lipopolysaccharide-injected rats. In order to further characterize the specific cell type producing NO, we used a NO-specific porphyrinic/Nafion-coated microsensor to record NO release from a single, isolated ARVM pretreated with IL-1 beta and IFN gamma in L-arginine-depleted medium. NO release could be detected following microinjection of L-arginine in the vicinity of the cell juxtaposed to the NO microsensor, but not following microinjection of D-arginine, and not from ARVM pretreated with L-N-monomethylarginine. Cytokine-pretreated ARVM that had been maintained in L-arginine-depleted medium also exhibited a depressed contractile response to isoproterenol after addition of L-arginine, but not D-arginine. These results indicate that altered contractile function of cardiac myocytes following exposure to specific inflammatory cytokines is due to induction of myocyte iNOS."
https://openalex.org/W2060019534,"Although several ion channels have been reported to be directly modulated by calcium-calmodulin, they have not been conclusively shown to bind calmodulin, nor are the modulatory mechanisms understood. Study of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-activated cation channel, which is modulated by calcium-calmodulin, indicates that calcium-calmodulin directly binds to a specific domain on the amino terminus of the channel. This binding reduces the effective affinity of the channel for cyclic nucleotides, apparently by acting on channel gating, which is tightly coupled to ligand binding. The data reveal a control mechanism that resembles those underlying the regulation of enzymes by calmodulin. The results also point to the amino-terminal part of the olfactory channel as an element for gating, which may have general significance in the operation of ion channels with similar overall structures."

https://openalex.org/W2045630066,"The alpha IIb beta 3 integrin binds Arg-Gly-Asp-containing (RGD-containing) ligands in a cation-dependent interaction. A fourteen amino acid sequence, beta 3 (118-131), and an antibody to it, inhibited ligand binding functions of alpha IIb beta 3, and a 1:1 stoichiometric beta 3 (118-131)-RGD complex was detected by mass spectroscopy. Cation binding to beta 3 (118-131) was demonstrated by terbium luminescence and mass spectroscopy. Notably, ligand displaced cation from the beta 3(118-131) peptide and also from purified alpha IIb beta 3. Thus, beta 3 (118-131), a highly conserved region in integrin beta subunits, binds both ligand and cation. Formation of a ternary complex between cation, ligand, and receptor, with subsequent displacement of cation from beta 3 (118-131) and a second site within the receptor, may be central to the mechanism of ligand recognition by integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1570313229,"Many antidepressants inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) transport resulting in increased 5HT levels in the synapse. However, physiological regulation of neurotransmitter uptake has not been demonstrated. We have examined the effect of receptor-activated second messengers on the 5HT transporter in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL 2H3). Here, we show that activation of an A3 adenosine receptor results in an increase of 5HT uptake in RBL cells, due to an increase in maximum velocity (Vmax). The A3 adenosine receptor-stimulated increase in transport is blocked by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and by a cGMP-dependent kinase inhibitor. In fact, compounds that generate nitric oxide (NO) and the cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP mimicked the effect of A3 receptor stimulation, suggesting that the elevation in transport occurs through the generation of the gaseous second messenger NO and a subsequent elevation in cGMP. Additionally, the 5HT transporter is differentially regulated by second messengers since direct activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters decreases 5HT uptake by decreasing Vmax. Our results suggest that the changes in transport are due to a direct modification of the 5HT transporter, possibly by phosphorylation, which appears to alter the rate at which transport occurs. As the 5HT transporter in RBL cells is identical to that in neurons, our results suggest that analogous mechanisms may operate in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2117291465,"Abstract Thrombin stimulates G protein-coupled signaling pathways in target cells by proteolytic cleavage of its seven transmembrane domain receptor. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is also stimulated by the protease via poorly defined mechanisms. In human platelets, thrombin has been shown to activate the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src. To elucidate the signal transduction pathways involved in transmission of thrombin's cellular effects, we have examined the ability of thrombin to activate Src family tyrosine kinases in a growth-responsive line of lung fibroblasts (CCL39 cells). We report here that thrombin induces a rapid (< or = 30 s) and transient increase in the kinase activity of Src and Fyn as determined by autophosphorylation in immune complex kinase assays. Activation is mediated by the G protein-coupled thrombin receptor since a synthetic peptide agonist of the receptor mimics thrombin action. The involvement of one or more G proteins in this response was confirmed by the observation that thrombin's effect is partially sensitive to pertussis toxin. Furthermore, both alpha 2-adrenergic and muscarinic m1 receptors are able to increase Src kinase activity via pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins, respectively. These findings suggest that nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family may represent a novel effector system linking G protein-coupled receptors to downstream activation of Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1511309258,"We have previously identified a glycoprotein of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family of proteins as a serum factor responsible for the stabilization of the expanding cumulus mass. In this study, the mechanism of interaction of this cumulus extracellular matrix stabilizing factor (cESF) with hyaluronic acid (HA) has been explored. It was found that the pH optimum for binding of cESF and HA is 7 and that binding is sensitive to ionic strength. The dissociation constant is about 1.9 x 10(-8) M in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Circular dichroism studies show that cESF contains about 24% alpha-helical and 42% beta-sheet structure. Gross conformational changes in cESF, however, are not detected in the presence of HA. We also found that modification of lysine residues of cESF with citraconic anhydride greatly reduced its binding with HA and completely abolished its cumulus stabilizing activity, and deblocking lysine residues restored its capacity to bind with HA and its cumulus matrix stabilizing activity. This evidence supports the hypotheses that cESF stabilizes the expanding cumulus extracellular matrix by directly binding with HA and that cESF may serve as a structural protein to organize the formation of the cumulus extracellular matrix. Our evidence also supports the view that binding of cESF and HA is through a stereo-specific charge interaction. Putative binding sites of cESF that interact with HA are postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2121655252,"Signals mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR) are required for thymocyte maturation and selection. To examine the role of TCR zeta chain signals in development, TCR expression was restored in zeta-deficient mice with transgenic zeta chains that partially or completely lacked sequences required for signal transduction. The zeta chain played a role in thymic development by promoting TCR surface expression, but zeta-mediated signals were not essential because TCRs that contained signaling-deficient zeta chains promoted T cell maturation and transduced signals associated with thymic selection."
https://openalex.org/W1500165569,"Insulin signaling is initiated at least in part by activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of cellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). Previous studies have focused on the role of IRS-1 in the mitogenic actions of insulin. We have now investigated the possible role of IRS-1 in mediating the effect of insulin to stimulate glucose transport in a physiologically relevant insulin target tissue. In this study, we transfected rat adipose cells in primary culture with an antisense ribozyme directed against rat IRS-1. Expression of the ribozyme in these cells caused a 4.4-fold increase in the concentration of insulin required to achieve half-maximal stimulation of the translocation of cotransfected epitope-tagged GLUT4 without changing the maximal insulin response. Overexpression of human IRS-1 increased the basal cell surface GLUT4 to nearly the maximal level in the absence of insulin. When the ribozyme (specific to rat IRS-1) was cotransfected along with human IRS-1, the insulin dose-response curve was shifted to the left when compared with cells transfected with the ribozyme alone. These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that IRS-1 plays a role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in insulin-responsive cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583032072,"The interaction between the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) of Bordetella pertussis and lipid was studied using the lipid bilayer assay. The addition of CyaA to the aqueous phase bathing lipid bilayer membranes composed of different lipids resulted in the increase of the membrane conductance. This increase was rather small for membranes formed of pure lipids as compared with lipid mixtures such as asolectin. The toxin formed in asolectin membranes small transient ion-permeable channels with a single-channel conductance of 27 pS in 1 M KCl, which is considerably smaller than that of the alpha-hemolysin (HlyA) of Escherichia coli (1500 pS). Experiments with different salts suggested that the CyaA-induced channels were exclusively cation-selective because of negative charges localized at the channel mouth. The single-channel conductance of channels initiated by CyaA was independent of whether the toxin was purified from B. pertussis or from recombinant E. coli. However, the channel-forming activity of the CyaA expressed in B. pertussis was substantially higher than that of the recombinant toxin. Experiments with mutant forms of CyaA suggested that both the activation of CyaA by CyaC and the hemeolytic part of the toxin, but not the repeats and the cyclase activity, are required for channel formation in lipid bilayer membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1523413432,"The integrin receptor alpha 4 beta 1 (also known as VLA-4) binds two different ligands, the endothelial cell surface protein vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the extracellular matrix component fibronectin. Three distinct sites in fibronectin are recognized by alpha 4 beta 1. Two of these (represented by peptides CS1 and CS5) are present in the alternatively spliced IIICS region and lie in separate, independently spliced segments of this region. A third site resides in the adjacent constitutively expressed HepII domain. Recombinant proteins containing the HepII domain and different splice variants of the IIICS have been generated and compared for their ability to mediate cell attachment, spreading and migration. The activity of these proteins has also been compared with that of a recombinant soluble form of VCAM-1 (rsVCAM-1). All the recombinant proteins supported A375-SM human melanoma cell attachment and spreading in an alpha 4 beta 1-dependent manner, but had varied adhesive activities with rsVCAM-1 > fibronectin variants containing the CS1 sequence >> other fibronectin variants. Low concentrations of rsVCAM-1 and CS1-containing fibronectin variants effectively supported cell migration in a trans-filter assay; however, cell motility was retarded at high concentrations of the same proteins. Fibronectin variants lacking CS1 supported little or no migration. To obtain further insight into the molecular basis of this varied adhesive activity, apparent dissociation constants for each of the recombinant proteins were measured using a solid phase receptor-ligand binding assay. The results revealed a hierarchy of ligand affinities that mirrored their adhesive activity (rsVCAM-1 > fibronectin variants containing CS1 >> other fibronectin variants)."
https://openalex.org/W1559679159,"The integrin beta 8 subunit was identified by cloning and sequencing of the cDNA and has been shown to associate with the alpha v subunit (Moyle, M., Napier, M. A., and McLean, J. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19650-19658). We now present initial data on its functional properties. We produced a recombinant secreted form of alpha v beta 8 and used it to raise monoclonal antibodies that recognize the alpha v beta 8 complex or the beta 8 subunit alone on the surface of melanoma cells and on beta 8-transfected human embryonic kidney (293) cells. Affinity chromatography experiments showed that secreted alpha v beta 8 bound to vitronectin but not to fibronectin, collagen, or fibrinogen. Supporting evidence that intact full-length alpha v beta 8 could also bind to vitronectin-Sepharose was provided by performing affinity chromatography with the melanoma cell line MeWo, which normally expresses the intact beta 8 subunit. By studying the adhesive properties of melanoma cells and beta 8-transfected 293 cells, we found that alpha v beta 8 by itself does not promote cell adhesion on a vitronectin-coated substrate. To test the respective functional activities of the beta 8 extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, we analyzed chimeric beta 8/beta 3 subunit constructs. The beta 3 subunit was chosen because full-length beta 3, when transfected into 293 cells, strongly supports cell adhesion. We found that a chimeric integrin containing the beta 3 extracellular domain combined with the beta 8 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains did not promote 293 cell adhesion. Conversely, a chimeric integrin construct combining the beta 8 extracellular domain with the beta 3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains did promote adhesion of transfected 293 cells. This suggests that the beta 8 cytoplasmic domain does not interact with the cytoskeleton and with cytoplasmic signaling pathways in an adhesion-promoting fashion. We conclude that the beta 8 cytoplasmic domain, which is structurally unrelated to the conserved cytoplasmic domains of other beta subunits, is functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2032761794,"Transcription terminators recognized by several RNA polymerases include a DNA segment encoding uridine-rich RNA and, for bacterial RNA polymerase, a hairpin loop located immediately upstream. Here, mutationally altered Escherichia coli RNA polymerase enzymes that have different termination efficiencies were used to show that the extent of transcription through the uridine-rich encoding segment is controlled by the substrate concentration of nucleoside triphosphate. This result implies that the rate of elongation determines the probability of transcript release. Moreover, the position of release sites suggests an important spatial relation between the RNA hairpin and the boundary of the terminator."
https://openalex.org/W1620204708,"Desmoplakins (DPs) are the most abundant proteins in the innermost portion of the desmosomal plaque and have been proposed to play a role in the attachment of intermediate filaments (IF) to cell-cell contact sites. Our previous results suggest that the globular end domains of DP perform dual functions: first, to target DP to the desmosome via the NH2 terminus and second, to attach IF to the desmosomal plaque via the COOH terminus. When ectopically expressed in most cultured cells, the COOH terminus plus the rod domain (DP. delta N.SerC23) exhibits striking coalignment with keratin IF networks. However, in certain cell types (e.g. PtK2) or in cells treated with forskolin to activate protein kinase A, DP. delta N.SerC23 exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. A variant molecule (DP. delta N.GlyC23) in which a serine located 23 amino acids from the COOH terminus is altered to a glycine, thereby disrupting a protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation site, co-localizes with keratin IF networks regardless of cell type or forskolin treatment. Analysis of the phosphopeptide maps of these DP variants and endogenous DP is consistent with the phosphorylation of the serine 23 residues from the COOH terminus. These results suggest that phosphorylation of a specific residue in the DP COOH terminus may negatively regulate its interaction with keratin IF networks."

https://openalex.org/W1808638478,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a strong inducer of angiogenesis and thus may play an important role in the growth of solid tumors. However, bFGF is usually found immobilized on the extracellular matrix, and it is only partly understood how it is solubilized to reach and activate its extracellular receptors. We studied the potential contribution to this process by a secreted binding protein (BP) with high affinity for FGFs. An expression vector for BP was transfected into a human cell line (SW-13) that contains constitutively high levels of bFGF. The BP-expressing cells began to grow colonies in soft agar due to their autocrine stimulation by bFGF and released biologically active bFGF into their media. Furthermore, they grew into well vascularized tumors in athymic nude mice. In addition, we found the BP mRNA expressed at high levels in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissues from patients and in SCC cell lines of different origin as well as in immortalized keratinocytes. However, we failed to detect BP mRNA in normal adult tissues or in a number of non-SCC tumor cell lines. Expression of the secreted BP appears to be a mechanism through which immobilized FGF can be activated to support tumor growth and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1598363597,"Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with sphingosine, a potential breakdown product of all sphingolipids, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates including bands of M(r) 110,000-130,000 and M(r) 70,000-80,000. Tyrosine phosphorylation in response to sphingosine occurred in a concentration dependent manner (EC50 = 10 microM) and developed gradually reaching half maximum and maximum effects at 20 and 60 min, respectively. The dihydroenantiomere of sphingosine, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine, neither induced tyrosine phosphorylation nor interfered with sphingosine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin were identified as prominent substrates for sphingosine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell permeable ceramides also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the M(r) 110,000-130,000 band as well as p125FAK, but the effect was less pronounced than that of sphingosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation by sphingosine could be dissociated from both protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. Sphingosine stimulated striking actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 cells. The kinetics of actin stress fiber formation and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to sphingosine closely paralleled. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts the network of actin microfilaments, completely inhibited sphingosine induced tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin in response to sphingosine was completely prevented when cells were stimulated in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor at a concentration (30 ng/ml) that caused disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that sphingosine induces p125FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571044863,"The cGMP-gated cation channel of rod photoreceptor cells plays a central role in the phototransduction process by controlling the influx of cations into the rod outer segment in response to changes in cGMP levels. Previous studies have shown that the cGMP-gated channel in native rod outer segment membrane vesicles is modulated by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. In this study we report that the immunoaffinity-purified channel consisting of the 63-kDa alpha-subunit and a 240-kDa protein is also modulated by calmodulin when reconstituted into lipid vesicles. In the absence of calmodulin, the purified channel had an apparent Km of 33 microM and a Hill coefficient of 3.3 for cGMP-dependent efflux of Ca2+ from reconstituted lipid vesicles. In the presence of calmodulin, the Km increased to 44 microM without affecting the Hill coefficient or maximum velocity of ion efflux. Calmodulin modulation of the channel is inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist, mastoparan. In the absence of mastoparan, the half-maximum inhibition of channel activity (IC50) occurred at 1.85 +/- 0.25 nM calmodulin at a cGMP concentration of 12.5 microM; in the presence of mastoparan, the IC50 value increased to 20.3 +/- 3.8 nM calmodulin. Based on the strong, selective interaction of calmodulin with the channel, an efficient, general method has been developed to isolate functionally active cGMP-gated channels from mammalian and amphibian photoreceptor membranes. Calmodulin extraction studies, Western blotting, and channel activity measurements indicate that endogenous rod outer segment calmodulin modulates the activity of the channel through its binding to the 240-kDa protein. From these studies we conclude that the 240-kDa protein of the cGMP-gated channel is a major calmodulin target protein of rod outer segment membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1480760118,"Mutational analysis of the NK-1 receptor indicates that residues involved in non-peptide antagonist binding cluster around the outer portion of transmembrane segments (TM) V and VI. In contrast mutations affecting the binding of the natural peptide agonist, substance P, are scattered in the exterior part of the receptor. Recently it was reported that a number of mutations in TM-II also seriously impair substance P binding. Here we confirm that Ala substitutions for these residues located on a hydrophilic helical face of TM-II basically eliminate substance P binding to the NK-1 receptor, provided that a radiolabeled non-peptide antagonist is used as radioligand. Surprisingly, radiolabeled substance P bound well to all these mutant receptors and was displaced with only slightly reduced affinity by the unlabeled peptide and by the non-peptide antagonists. The wild-type homologous NK-2 receptor displayed properties similar to those observed in the mutated NK-1 receptors, i.e. concomitant high affinity binding of radiolabeled agonist peptide (in this case neurokinin A), yet low affinity, G-protein independent competition of unlabeled peptide with radiolabeled non-peptide antagonist. It is concluded that substitutions in TM-II of the NK-1 receptor do not affect the high affinity binding of substance P but instead block the ability of the peptides to compete for non-peptide antagonist binding. It is suggested that certain mutations can impair interchange between receptor conformations that each bind different ligands with high affinity."

https://openalex.org/W1574505931,"Abstract An interaction of mitochondrial creatine kinase with purified outer mitochondrial porin (voltage-dependent anion channel) was shown by co-sedimentation assays as well as by gel permeation chromatography. Porin formed high M(r) complexes with wild-type mitochondrial creatine kinase as well as with an N-terminal deletion mutant, lacking the first five N-terminal amino acids. The complexes were identified by creatine kinase activity in parallel with immunoblotting using specific antibodies against the two proteins. In addition, porin induced octamerization of the N-terminal creatine kinase mutant, which under the same conditions without porin, did not polymerize but remained more than 90% dimeric. Furthermore, binding of mitochondrial creatine kinase to porin affected the conductance of porin when reconstituted in black membranes. At 10 mV the pore in the complex adopted a low conductance (1.5-2 nanosiemens) state, compared to the high conductance state (3-4 nanosiemens) of the free incorporated pores. The former state of the pore is known to be cationically selective. Thus, besides a specific structural interaction, a defined physiological function is assumed of the mitochondrial creatine kinase-porin complexes that are discussed here."
https://openalex.org/W1487121574,"P-selectin (CD62P), a Ca(2+)-dependent lectin expressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells, functions as a receptor for myeloid and monocytoid cells. Previous reports have described a homodimeric sialoglycoprotein from human leukocytes and HL-60 cells specifically recognized by P-selectin. We describe here a panel of monoclonal antibodies prepared against high molecular weight fractions of HL-60 cell membranes. These antibodies are of IgM isotype, bind to a approximately 240-kDa protein from human leukocyte membranes which is also reactive with P-selectin. They recognize a Ca(2+)-dependent, sialidase-sensitive determinant on myeloid and monocytoid cell lines. Each antibody specifically inhibits adhesion of neutrophils or HL-60 cells to: 1) purified P-selectin, 2) thrombin-stimulated platelets, and 3) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated endothelial cells. These results suggest that the sialoglycoprotein recognized by this panel of monoclonal antibodies may function as a cell surface ligand for P-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1492329260,"The insulin receptor is known to interact with the SH2 domain proteins p85 (the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), Syp (a tyrosine phosphatase), and GAP (GTPase-activating protein). In this study, we mapped the insulin receptor binding sites for each of these proteins by examining the ability of phosphopeptides, corresponding to insulin receptor phosphorylation sites, and mutant insulin receptors to inhibit an insulin receptor-SH2 domain interaction. Precipitation of partially purified insulin receptors by glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the N-terminal SH2 domains of p85 and GAP and both SH2 domains of Syp was demonstrated. The effect of the addition of each phosphopeptide on insulin receptor precipitation was tested. pY1322, the C-terminal insulin receptor peptide, inhibited insulin receptor precipitation by both p85- and Syp-GST. The NPXY internalization domain peptide inhibited insulin receptor precipitation by GAP-GST. These data were confirmed by mutant insulin receptor experiments. The insulin receptor C-terminal mutants, delta CT and Y/F2, were not precipitated by p85- or Syp-GST and the NPXY mutant insulin receptors, delta Ex16 and HI delta NPEY, were not precipitated by GAP-GST. Therefore, we conclude that p85 and Syp bind to the insulin receptor C terminus at tyrosine 1322 and GAP binds to the insulin receptor NPXY domain at tyrosine 960."
https://openalex.org/W1579386532,"To investigate the molecular basis of nuclear-mitochondrial communication, we have been studying the effect of mitochondrial stress (stimulated by inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis) on the homeostasis of transcripts encoding nuclear and mitochondrial gene products. We report that in cells treated with the inhibitor thiamphenicol, nuclear-encoded respiratory gene transcripts were dramatically stabilized. A concomitant up-regulation in the activity of the only known respiratory transcript binding protein, cytochrome c oxidase L-form transcript binding protein (COLBP), was also noted in thiamphenicol-treated cells, demonstrating a potential mechanism for the increased transcript protection. In contradistinction, stability of all mitochondrial RNAs was unaffected by the inhibitor, as were the nuclear-encoded beta-actin, alpha-tubulin mRNAs and total cytosolic RNA. Steady state levels of all nuclear-encoded transcripts tested remained constant after inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, whereas a generalized increase in the levels of processed mitochondrial mRNA was noted. We conclude that thiamphenicol induces (i) an increase in steady state levels of mitochondrial mRNA, (ii) a selective protection of nuclear respiratory gene transcripts against degradation, and (iii) an up-regulation in activity of the respiratory transcript binding protein COLBP, consistent with this protein mediating increased transcript stability. Our results demonstrate a coordinated series of intracellular responses to thiamphenicol-induced mitochondrial stress, regulated at both the pre- and post-transcriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W1521709292,"Cytokines induce the expression of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We show that expression of these surface proteins is differently affected by cAMP. Increased cAMP levels decrease E-selectin and VCAM-1 but increase ICAM-1 expression. We demonstrate by mRNA half-life analysis and nuclear run-on assays that the cAMP repression of E-selectin occurs at the transcription level. This effect is abolished by protein kinase A inhibition, suggesting that repression is mediated by protein kinase A-driven phosphorylation. We found that a minimal E-selectin promoter sequence necessary to confer cytokine inducibility is also sufficient to mimic the cAMP effect in transfected HUVECs. Previously we characterized two regions (NF-kappa B and NF-ELAM1) of the minimal promoter that bind transcription factors necessary for E-selectin induction, Increased cAMP did not alter the binding of the complexes formed on either the NF-kappa B or NF-ELAM1 site. In contrast, in interleukin-1-treated HUVECs transactivity due to an NF-kappa B site is reduced by elevated cAMP. Increased cAMP in HUVECs appears to induce a protein kinase activity that reduces the cytokine signal for E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression. The reduction in signal may occur through an inhibitory phosphorylation of one or more of the factors responsible for regulating E-selectin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1481796756,"The carboxyl-terminal cell binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1) contains two cell attachment peptides, 4N1s (RFYVVMWK) and 7N3 (FIRVVMY-EGKK), which share the sequence VVM. These peptides, and more soluble derivatives have been radiolabeled with 125I and used in conjunction with a variety of membrane impermeant cross-linking reagents to identify and characterize receptor candidates on several cell types. All of the VVM containing peptides tested with five different cross-linking reagents specifically labeled a 52-kDa protein, which was also affinity labeled by the recombinant TS1 CBD. After cross-linking peptide to K562 cells to block the 52-kDa protein, both cell adhesion to and affinity labeling by VVM peptides were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. Peptide labeling, like cell adhesion, was partially inhibited by heparin and stimulated by EDTA. The 52-kDa protein did not appear to contain sulfated glycan chains and was trypsin sensitive. It was recovered in a membrane fraction and was readily solubilized with Triton X-100 and X-114. Upon phase separation of the Triton X-114, the 52-kDa protein partitioned into the hydrophobic detergent phase. The detergent-solubilized receptor candidate bound selectively to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and after cell surface labeling with a membrane impermeant biotinylating reagent, bound to streptavidin-Sepharose. Furthermore, fluorescent beads covalently derivatized with peptide specifically decorated intact K562 cells. Thus the properties of the 52-kDa protein are consistent with those of a receptor for the CBD of TS1 and other TS isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1503320832,"Human p68 RNA helicase is a nuclear RNA-dependent ATPase that belongs to a family of putative helicases known as the DEAD box proteins. These proteins have been implicated in aspects of RNA function including translation initiation, splicing, and ribosome assembly in a variety of organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to humans. While members of this family are believed to function in the manipulation of RNA secondary structure, little is known about the regulation of these enzymes. By immunological methods and sequence comparison, we have found that p68 possesses a region of sequence similarity to the conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and calmodulin binding domain (also known as the IQ domain) of the neural-specific proteins neuromodulin (GAP-43) and neurogranin (RC3). We report that p68 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro and binds calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Both phosphorylation and calmodulin binding inhibited p68 ATPase activity, suggesting that the RNA unwinding activity of p68 may be regulated by dual Ca2+ signal transduction pathways through its IQ domain."
https://openalex.org/W1521132722,"Using a panel of src mutants partially defective for malignant transformation, our laboratory has previously identified the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptor as a protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with transformation by src in embryonic chick cells (Kozma et al., 1990; Kozma and Weber, 1990). It has not been clear, however, whether src-induced phosphorylation altered the enzymatic or signaling properties of the IGF-I receptor and thus whether the IGF-I receptor could be a functionally significant target for pp60v-src. To examine the effect of src expression on the activity of the IGF-I receptor, the human IGF-I receptor was expressed in Rat-1 fibroblasts co-expressing the temperature-sensitive v-src mutant, tsLA29. The IGF-I receptor exhibited an elevated level of tyrosine phosphorylation in src transformed cells even in the absence of IGF-I treatment. Increased receptor phosphorylation occurred rapidly when cells expressing a temperature-conditional src mutant were shifted from the restrictive to the permissive temperature. Src-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was correlated with an increase in the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, both toward itself and exogenous substrates. The src-induced increase in receptor activity was shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, as treatment with a tyrosine-specific phosphatase lowered receptor activity. A kinase-defective mutant of the IGF-I receptor also became constitutively phosphorylated in src-transformed cells, ruling out a possible autocrine mechanism for this phosphorylation. Collectively these data indicate that pp60v-src induces ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-I receptor by an intracellular mechanism, consistent with the possibility that receptor phosphorylation could contribute to the genesis of the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1585555176,"Both the growth hormone (GH) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) receptors are members of the cytokine receptor family that activate tyrosine phosphorylation despite the lack of a tyrosine kinase domain. Recently, the Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases have been shown to play an integral role in intracellular signaling by the cytokine receptors. We demonstrate that, in the human IM-9 lymphocyte, both JAK1 and JAK2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFN gamma, whereas only JAK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to GH. Furthermore, dimerization of the GH receptor appears to be necessary for GH stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. We provide two lines of evidence that the JAK2 kinases can be regulated independently by GH and IFN gamma in IM-9 cells: 1) desensitization of JAK2 to GH stimulation does not affect the IFN gamma stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2; and 2) JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by GH and IFN gamma is additive to that seen with either hormone alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although IFN gamma activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p91 signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) in IM-9 cells, GH does not. GH does activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 93-kDa protein that appears to be distinct from STAT1."
https://openalex.org/W1602442471,"Signaling through the B cell antigen receptor requires a complex set of interactions involving transmembrane components of the IgM receptor complex and cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases. We have focused on the nature of these protein-protein interactions, the requirements for their occurrence, as well as the temporal sequence of events during the activation process. We found that cross-linking B cell antigen receptors at 0 degree C resulted in the rapid association of the Src-family protein-tyrosine kinase, Lyn, with the antigen receptor complex as judged by the presence of Lyn in anti-IgM and anti-phosphotyrosine immune complexes and the presence of MB-1 in anti-Lyn immune complexes. Receptor engagement also resulted in the rapid association of Lyn with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase, CD45. This association of Lyn with receptor components was stable in the detergent Brij 96, but was readily disrupted by Nonidet P-40, suggesting the involvement of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing formation of the Lyn-receptor complex. The protein-tyrosine kinase, Syk, was also found associated with activated receptor complexes. This association of Syk with components of the antigen receptor complex was stable to Nonidet P-40. Antibodies directed against the carboxyl teminus of Syk, but not against the amino-terminal SH2 domain, co-immunoprecipitated MB-1 from activated cells, consistent with the binding of Syk through an SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1546749776,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a myelin-specific cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin supergene family and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the developing brain. To define the role of MAG in signal transduction, the tyrosine phosphorylation sites were analyzed. The major tyrosine phosphorylation residue was identified as Tyr-620, which was found to interact specifically with the SH2 domains of phospholipase C (PLC gamma). This domain may represent a novel protein binding motif that can be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. MAG also specifically bound the Fyn tyrosine kinase, suggesting that MAG serves as a docking protein that allows the interaction between different signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1588777732,"We have shown previously that a 300-base pair (bp) 5' upstream sequence of rabbit keratin K3 gene (RK3) can function as a keratinocyte-specific promoter in transient transfection assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using various overlapping and mutated oligonucleotides established that corneal keratinocyte nuclear proteins bound in vitro to two sites (B and E). Immunosupershift and UV cross-linking established that the keratinocyte nuclear binding protein of site B (5'-GGGGCTTTCC-3', -262 to -253 bp) was NFkB consisting of the p65 and p50 subunits. The E site contained an unusual GC-rich motif (5'-CCGCCCCCTG-3', -203 to -194 bp) whose sequence deviated from the Sp1 consensus in 4 out of 10 positions; this site bound an Sp 1-related keratinocyte nuclear protein. Mutagenesis of the NFkB, GC motif, and both sites abolished 20, 50, and 75%, respectively, of the promoter activity in transfected keratinocytes. The NFkB-like keratinocyte nuclear protein was barely detectable in kidney epithelial cells, HeLa, and fibroblasts. The Sp1-related nuclear protein was abundant in keratinocytes and simple epithelial cells, but was much less abundant in fibroblasts. These results indicate that NFkB is present in significant quantities in keratinocyte nuclei and that the tissue restriction of the NFkB- and Sp1-related proteins, in combination with other factors, may contribute to the keratinocyte specificity of RK3 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1596585795,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) contains 4 domains: a disulfide forming amino terminus, a collagen-like region, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition region. The protein binds the lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and galactosylceramide and induces aggregation of phospholipid vesicles. SP-A also inhibits lipid secretion and enhances the uptake of phospholipid by alveolar type II cells. Previously described monoclonal antibody 1D6 blocks the inhibitory effect of SP-A on lipid secretion by type II cells, but antibody 6E3 has no effect. In the present study we mapped the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies 1D6 and 6E3 by enzyme-linked immunoassay of recombinant proteins expressed using the baculovirus system, and investigated the domain that is responsible for the SP-A interactions with lipid. Monoclonal antibody 1D6 bound to mutant SP-As in which the neck portion of the molecule was deleted or substituted with that of mannose-binding protein A, but 6E3 failed to bind to these mutants. In contrast, 1D6 did not bind to a chimera in which the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) was substituted with that of surfactant protein D (SP-D). In addition, 1D6 failed to recognize antigen in cells infected with the recombinant virus directing the synthesis of a Cys204-Cys218 (small disulfide loop) deletion within the CRD. Antibody 1D6 completely blocked the binding of SP-A to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and galactosylceramide and liposome aggregation. By comparison, 6E3 failed to completely attenuate the interactions of SP-A with lipids. However, both 6E3 and 1D6 blocked the uptake of lipid by type II cells that is caused by SP-A. From these data, we conclude that: 1) the epitope for antibody 6E3 is located at the neck domain of SP-A and that for antibody 1D6 is at the small loop region in the CRD; 2) the CRD is essential for the SP-A functions of lipid binding, liposome aggregation, the inhibitory effect on lipid secretion, and the augmentation of lipid uptake by type II cells, and these activities are largely attributable to amino acid residues within the steric inhibitory footprint of 1D6 bound to the small disulfide loop region; and 3) the neck domain of SP-A may also be involved in the process of SP-A-mediated uptake of phospholipids by alveolar type II cells."
https://openalex.org/W1601518037,"The chloroplast triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (cTPT) was isolated from envelope membranes or from transformed yeast cells and reconstituted into artificial membranes. Ionic currents mediated by the cTPT across these membranes were investigated by flux measurements and by the patch-clamp technique. The results of the flux measurements indicate that inorganic phosphate (Pi) at saturating concentrations on both sides of the membrane and chloride (Cl-) at all applied concentrations are transported by the cTPT at rates about 20-fold higher than those measured in intact chloroplasts. After reconstitution of the protein into giant liposomes, single channel currents mediated by the cTPT were resolved with the patch-clamp technique. The protein was shown to be a voltage-dependent anion channel with complex gating revealing sublevels with conductances of 12, 54, 96, and 138 pS for Cl- and 6 pS and 18 pS for Pi, respectively. Recordings from patches compromising multiple channels show a synchronously appearing non-linear current voltage (I/V) relationship in symmetrical buffers, and a different gating at positive and negative membrane potentials. This suggests that the cTPT is incorporated into the membrane in a unidirectional orientation. 3-Phosphoglycerate, a high affinity substrate of the transporter protein, induced a reversible flickering of open channel, and the channel open probability was decreased 60%. It is concluded that, besides its normal counter-exchange mode, the cTPT can also work as a voltage-dependent anion selective channel."
https://openalex.org/W1512483303,"Human mitochondrial 16 S rRNA 3'-end formation requires a tridecamer template sequence and a trans-acting protein of approximately 34 kDa. This protein binds tightly to its target sequence and further analysis of the protein-DNA complex revealed that the DNA is bent. Either T3, T7, Escherichia coli, or yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase produced transcripts mapping at this termination site. With these heterologous RNA polymerase, RNA 3'-end formation was detected only in the transcription polarity opposite that of mitochondrial rRNA synthesis; the efficiency of termination in the homologous human RNA polymerase system is approximately 2-fold greater in this same opposite polarity. These results suggested the possible importance of biased bipolar transcription termination in vivo. For wild-type mtDNA, the apparent relative efficiency of termination in vivo reflected the values determined in vitro. Examination of a pathogenic human mtDNA mutation known to result in impaired termination in vitro showed no significant differences in relative transcript abundances in vivo, despite a loss of in vitro termination efficiency in both directions. Recently, six additional mitochondrial disease-associated point mutations have been reported that cluster at the human mitochondrial transcription termination site. None of these resulted in significantly impaired transcription termination in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1516874365,"Phagocytic cells can kill microorganisms by synthesizing superoxide. Activation of the NADPH oxidase that generates superoxide is accompanied by a large intracellular burst of metabolic acid production. Despite the excess acid generation, cytosolic pH (pHi) remains near neutrality due to the concomitant stimulation of several homeostatic H+ extrusion mechanisms including a recently described H(+)-conductive pathway. Activation of the conductance by phorbol esters is defective in neutrophils of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients lacking the transmembrane cytochrome b subunits of the NADPH oxidase. This finding suggests that the oxidase itself undertakes H+ translocation or that, alternatively, assembly of the oxidase is required to activate a separate H+ conducting entity. To distinguish between these possibilities, the presence of the conductive pathway was assessed in unstimulated normal and CGD cells by manipulating pHi and the transmembrane potential. Using fluorimetric determinations of pHi, a conductive, Zn(2+)-sensitive alkalinization was observed in neutrophils from both normal and cytochrome b-deficient CGD donors. The electrophysiological properties of the conductance were defined in purified blood monocytes using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp. Depolarizing pulses induced slowly activating outward currents in cells from both normal and cytochrome b-deficient individuals. The elicited currents were potentiated by cytosolic acidification and did not inactivate within the times tested. As in control leukocytes, the reversal potential of tail currents in the CGD cells closely approximated the H+ equilibrium potential and was unaffected by substitution of the major ionic components of the external bathing medium. At all voltages tested, the magnitude of the evoked currents was comparable in normal and CGD cells. The results indicate that, like macrophages and granulocytes, human monocytes display a voltage-gated highly H(+)-selective conductance. More importantly, our findings imply that the conductive pathway is present in cells devoid of cytochrome b. Therefore, the defective activation of the conductive pathway by protein kinase C agonists in CGD cells is not due to the physical absence of the transporter. Instead we propose that the oxidase functions in a regulatory capacity, facilitating the opening of a distinct H+ conductance during cellular stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1656800176,"A novel gene transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III has been recently identified that produces an RNA component of a large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex (Kickhoefer, V. A., Searles, R. P., Kedersha, N. L., Garber, M. E., Johnson, D. L., and Rome, L. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7868-7873). Since sequence analysis revealed that this gene contains promoter elements from two different classes of RNA pol III gene promoters, we examined the function of the 5'-flanking type-3 and internal type-2 sequences on transcription activity and the production of stable transcription complexes. We find that the vRNA gene contains a novel RNA pol III promoter, where both the external and internal sequences are essential for template activity and for the productive interaction of TFIIIC with the internal elements. Thus, the vRNA gene represents the first example of a template that requires both type-2 and type-3 promoter elements that appear to function synergistically in the formation of productive transcription complexes. We have further examined the function of the unique arrangement of an internal A box and two B box elements. We find that at least one B element is required for template activity. In the absence of the 5'-flanking sequence the presence of both B elements inhibits transcription and the binding of TFIIIC. The formation of active complexes is restored when either the B2 element is inactivated or the distance separating the two B elements is increased. Therefore, the B2 element appears to negatively regulate template activity in the absence of the upstream sequences. This unique RNA pol III promoter arrangement may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of vRNA gene activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534084062,"In an effort to integrate an understanding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) structure with its function, the action of HIV-1 RT was examined in vitro on DNA templates modified with a model bulky DNA adduct. Styrene oxide was site-specifically and stereospecifically coupled to the N6 position of adenine to form six different adducted templates. Primer extension assays were conducted under conditions defining both single and multiple encounters between the polymerase and the damaged template-primer. The extent of polymerization observed for each adduct was found to depend on both the chirality of the damage and the lesion sequence context. When HIV-1 RT polymerization was limited by single encounters with damaged DNA, the SO lesions were readily bypassed as evidenced by minimal pausing at the adducted base. However, RT replication of all SO-modified templates was significantly terminated 3-5 nucleotides after translesion synthesis but before reaching the end of the template. These truncated products could be readily extended when additional encounters between enzyme and template-primer were permitted. A model is presented to explain these results in the context of HIV-1 RT structure during DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1529703236,"The topology of the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of the rat (Na,K)-ATPase has been studied by insertion of epitope(s): at the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus and between Glu-117 and Glu-118, Lys-828 and Arg-829, Gln-900 and Trp-901, and Val-939 and Phe-940 of the alpha subunit; and at the NH2 terminus and COOH terminus and between Glu-228 and Tyr-229 of the beta subunit. The epitope-tagged alpha 1 constructs were expressed in HeLa cells to select for stable cell lines expressing a functional (Na,K)-ATPase. The epitope-tagged beta constructs were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells. The membrane arrangement of the epitopes was revealed by indirect immunofluorescence with cells expressing the (Na,K)-ATPase chains. The results indicate that the alpha subunit has 4 transmembrane segments in the COOH-terminal membrane-bound domain between residues 760 and 938, and that both the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus are in the cytosol; it was not determined whether there are more transmembrane segments between residue 938 and the COOH terminus. The beta subunit has only one transmembrane-spanning region with the NH2 terminus in the cytosol and the COOH terminus on the extracytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1505954618,"We recently discovered an opposing initiator promoter (Inr) downstream of the sense promoter region of the eIF-2 alpha gene (Silverman, T., Noguchi, M., and Safer, B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9738-9742). By reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analysis of G0 and activated (G1) T-lymphocyte RNAs, overlapping sense and antisense transcripts are now identified. Sense transcription of the eIF-2 alpha gene proceeds from left to right to generate alpha-mRNA; antisense transcription proceeds from right to left to generate RNA, having a sequence complementary to eIF-2 alpha mRNA. Upstream indicates a position 5' relative to the transcription start site. Using DNase I footprint analysis and EMSA, we have found a potential cis-regulatory sequence immediately upstream of the Inr which binds a 43-kDa protein. In addition to conferring protection against DNase I (+457 to +474), the factor also generates hypersensitive sites directly over the Inr (+447 to +457). Insertion of the Inr footprint region into a luciferase reporter gene construct increases expression 150-fold. While mutation of the Inr conserved sequence decreases luciferase activity by 50%, mutation of the 43-kDa factor binding site inhibits luciferase activity by 20%. Sense orientation of the Inr footprint region decreases activity by 80%. The 43-kDa Inr-associated binding protein may be involved in allowing access of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes ot the initiation site of this TATA-less gene. A model for the regulation of eIF-2 alpha expression involving the rapid degradation of dsRNA generated by the relative activities of the two overlapping and opposing promoters is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1556463348,"Outer membranes isolated from yeast mitochondria were capable mediating the in vitro insertion of porin. As with the outer membrane of intact mitochondria, the insertion was ATP-dependent, and the inserted porin was resistant to trypsin treatment after detergent solubilization. However, the extent of porin insertion into isolated outer membranes was much less per mg of outer membrane protein than with intact mitochondria. The greater efficiency of intact mitochondria was not due to contact site-mediated translocation as isolated contact sites were less able to insert porin than isolated outer membranes, and blockade of the contact site channel in intact mitochondria did not affect porin insertion. However, mitochondria that had been subjected to osmotic shock sufficient to rupture the outer membrane and deplete the contents of the intermembrane space (i.e. mitoplasts) lost most of their ability to insert porin. Since outer membranes are isolated from mitoplasts, the low insertion activity of mitoplasts explains the low efficiency of insertion into isolated outer membranes. These results also indicate that, unlike proteins that are imported to the inner membrane and matrix of the mitochondria, porin's assembly is severely reduced by breaching the outer membrane and depletion of the intermembrane space contents."
https://openalex.org/W1599748855,"Beta 1,4-Galactosyltransferase is traditionally viewed as a biosynthetic component of the Golgi complex, but a portion of galactosyltransferase is also expressed on the cell surface, where it has been suggested to function as a receptor for extracellular oligosaccharide ligands. Although results from a variety of studies are consistent with a cell adhesion function for galactosyltransferase, the most rigorous test of surface galactosyltransferase function is to produce a surface galactosyltransferase-dependent phenotype in cells that normally express negligible levels of surface galactosyltransferase. In agreement with previous reports, human HeLa cells were found to express low levels of galactosyltransferase on their surface and, therefore, were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding murine galactosyltransferase. Murine galactosyltransferase was expressed both within the presumed Golgi complex and on the cell surface, as assayed by enzyme activity and with antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed murine enzyme. HeLa cell transfectants adhered more strongly to their extracellular substrates than did control transfectants, as evidenced by a flatter morphology in culture and a more rapid spreading upon plating. In contrast, cell spreading was low and similar among all cell types when plated on extracellular substrates that did not contain binding sites for galactosyltransferase. Antibodies and Fab fragments against recombinant murine galactosyltransferase inhibited the increased cell spreading characteristic of galactosyltransferase transfectants, as did soluble recombinant galactosyltransferase and a variety of galactosyltransferase perturbants. Thus, expression of heterologous galactosyltransferase produces a surface galactosyltransferase-dependent phenotype, confirming its function as a cell adhesion molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1518470656,"A monoclonal antibody to a 60-kDa substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is utilized in the present studies to examine this molecule in 3T3 cells expressing either the transforming chicken c-Src (mutant Phe-527), the wild type molecule, or the parental cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of this 60-kDa protein was greatly increased in cells expressing transforming Src and partially increased in cells expressing wild type enzyme. This tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with an increased association with the GTPase-activating protein of p21ras (GAP). However, this 60-kDa protein did not react with antibodies to another 62-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein previously isolated from Src-transformed cells (Wong, G., Muller, O., Clark, R., Conroy, L., Moran, M. F., Polakis, P., and McCormick, F. (1992) Cell 69, 551-558), although this latter antibody did react with a 62-kDa protein in anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates from cells expressing transforming c-Src but not the parental cells. These two proteins could also be distinguished by their subcellular location, the ability of the latter but not the former protein to bind RNA, and their migration in SDS gels. Moreover, the 62-kDa RNA-binding phosphoprotein could be almost completely depleted from cell lysates with poly(U)-Sepharose without affecting the amount of either the GAP-associated 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein or the protein precipitated with the monoclonal antibody. When the two proteins were phosphorylated in vitro with purified c-Src, they were both found to bind directly to the amino-terminal SH2 domain of GAP, although the RNA-binding protein was found to have a weaker affinity. These results indicate that two distinct 60-kDa proteins are substrates for the Src tyrosine kinase, one which binds RNA and the other which constitutes the major GAP-associated 60-kDa phosphoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1550596455,"Binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor (IR) leads to autophosphorylation of the beta subunit. The reaction proceeds as intramolecular transphosphorylation between alpha beta half-receptors of the heterotetrameric receptor dimer (alpha 2 beta 2). Since IRs are mobile in the plane of the plasma membrane, it is also possible that transphosphorylation may occur between adjacent holoreceptors (alpha 2 beta 2) by an intermolecular reaction. To address this question, we cotransfected NIH-3T3 cells with two IR cDNA constructs: a truncated but functionally normal IR lacking the C-terminal 43 amino acids (delta 43) and a full-length Leu323 mutant receptor that is expressed on the cell surface but that does not bind insulin. A clonal cell line was selected from cells cotransfected with a 1/5 ratio of delta 43 cDNA/Leu323 cDNA. The two homodimers (Leu323 and delta 43) were expressed without detectable formation of hybrid receptors. By using specific antibodies, we demonstrate that in cells coexpressing both homodimers, the Leu323 mutant receptor was phosphorylated in vivo by the delta 43 IR in an insulin-dependent manner. However, when the Leu323 mutant receptor was expressed alone, no phosphorylation was detected. In addition, we demonstrate the association of the phosphorylated Leu323 mutant receptor with insulin receptor substrate-1 and with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These findings indicate that insulin binding is not required for phosphorylation of the Leu323 mutant receptor, that the phosphorylation of the Leu323 mutant receptor occurs by an intermolecular transphosphorylation mechanism, and, finally, that the Leu323 mutant receptor, once phosphorylated, can associate with insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."
