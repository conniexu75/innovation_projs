https://openalex.org/W1493283928,"Isolated rat hepatocytes responded to a variety of Ca2+-mobilizing agents (vasopressin, angiotensin II, epinephrine, epidermal growth factor, ATP, and ADP) with a rapid increase in phosphatidate mass, as measured by a sensitive new method. When hepatocytes were incubated with vasopressin (10(-8) M), phosphatidate levels increased 2-3-fold in 2 min, but there was no significant increase in diacylglycerol at this time. Changes in the fatty acid composition of phosphatidate also preceded those in diacylglycerol. De novo synthesis of phosphatidate from [3H]glycerol was unaffected by vasopressin in short-term incubation. Incubation of washed rat liver plasma membranes with GTP gamma S caused a time-dependent increase in phosphatidate. When membranes were incubated with GTP gamma S and [gamma-32P]ATP, no incorporation of 32P into phosphatidate was observed. This excludes the phospholipase C-diacylglycerol kinase pathway and suggests that a phospholipase D activity produced the phosphatidate. At submaximal concentrations of GTP gamma S, ATP and ADP stimulated membrane phosphatidate formation, presumably by acting through P2-purinergic receptors. Only phosphatidylcholine, among the major phospholipids, decreased in the membranes in response to GTP gamma S. The fatty acid composition of the phosphatidate produced in response to vasopressin in hepatocytes also suggests that phosphatidylcholine may be the source of hormonally elicited phosphatidate. We conclude that Ca2+-mobilizing hormones mainly increase phosphatidate levels in hepatocytes by a mechanism that does not involve phosphorylation of diacylglycerol or de novo synthesis but involves a guanine nucleotide-binding protein coupled to phospholipase D."
https://openalex.org/W2060148643,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces cytolytic activity and proliferation of human blood lymphocytes. Yet, prior to activation, these cells do not express IL-2 receptors recognized by monoclonal antibodies to the Tac antigen. A novel glycoprotein (IL-2R beta), identified on several lymphocytoid cell lines, has the ability to bind IL-2 alone and to associate with Tac antigen (IL-2R alpha) to form high-affinity IL-2 receptors. It is now reported that IL-2R beta is expressed on both circulating T lymphocytes and large granular lymphocytes in quantities approximately proportional to their responsiveness to IL-2. Studies of the responses of these cells to IL-2 suggest that IL-2R beta mediates the initial phase of induction of lymphokine activated killer (LAK), natural killer (NK), and proliferative activities. Subsequently, IL-2R alpha is induced and functional high-affinity IL-2 receptors are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2129844699,"Replicating chicken embryo myoblasts were treated with a monoclonal antibody, CSAT, which recognizes and blocks the function of the beta subunit of integrin. In the presence of this antibody, myoblasts continued to replicate and did not fuse or produce muscle-specific meromyosin. This block to normal differentiation was readily reversed by the removal of the antibody. The reversed cells exhibited increases in desmin and meromyosin, and fused to produce contracting myotubes. The data indicate that the interaction of integrin, present on the membrane of replicating myoblasts, with extracellular matrix on the substrate is essential to initiate the terminal stages of myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1499460529,"Antisera AS/6 and 7, raised against a synthetic peptide KENLKDCGLF corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of transducin-alpha, react on immunoblots with purified transducin-alpha and with proteins of 40-41 kDa in all tissues tested. The latter represent one or more forms of Gi alpha but not Go alpha, since a synthetic peptide, KNNLKDCGLF, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of two forms of Gi alpha blocks AS/6 and 7 reactivity with transducin-alpha and Gi alpha on immunoblots, whereas the corresponding Go-related peptide, ANNLRGCGLY, does not. Antisera LE/2 and 3, raised against the synthetic peptide LERIAQSDYI, corresponding to an internal sequence predicted by one form of Gi alpha cDNA (Gi alpha-2) and differing by 3 residues from the sequence of another form, Gi alpha-1, react strongly with a 40-kDa protein abundant in neutrophil membranes and with the major pertussis toxin substrate purified from bovine neutrophils. LE/2 and 3 reveal a relatively faint 40-kDa band on immunoblots of crude brain membranes or of purified brain Gi/Go. LE/2 and 3 do not react with transducin-alpha or Go alpha nor with the 41-kDa form of pertussis toxin substrate in brain, Gi alpha-1. These antisera distinguish between the major pertussis toxin substrates of brain and neutrophil and tentatively identify the latter as Gi alpha-2."

https://openalex.org/W2085205986,"Thyroid hormone is important in the regulation of synthesis and secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the anterior pituitary, but its role in the control of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is controversial. To determine whether thyroid hormone regulates the function of TRH in the hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular system, a study was made of the effect of hypothyroidism on thyrotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA (proTRH mRNA) and TRH prohormone in the rat paraventricular nucleus. Extracts of rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus were examined by quantitative Northern blot analysis, and coronal sections of rat brain were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. A nearly twofold increase in proTRH mRNA was observed in hypothyroid animals; this increase could be obliterated by levothyroxine treatment, suggesting an inverse relation between circulating thyroid hormone and proTRH mRNA. In situ hybridization showed that this response occurred exclusively in medial parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus. A simultaneous increase in proTRH mRNA and immunoreactive TRH prohormone in this region suggests that hypothyroidism induces both transcription and translation of the TRH prohormone in the paraventricular nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2025224752,"The properties of a charge-coupled device (CCD) and its application to the high-resolution analysis of biological structures by optical microscopy are described. The CCD, with its high resolution, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, photometric accuracy, and geometric stability, can provide data of such high quality that quantitative analysis on two- and three-dimensional microscopic images is possible. For example, the three-dimensional imaging properties of an epifluorescence microscope have been quantitatively determined with the CCD. This description of the imaging properties of the microscope, and the high-quality image data provided by the CCD, allow sophisticated computational image processing methods to be used that greatly improve the effective resolution obtainable for biological structures. Image processing techniques revealed fine substructures in Drosophila embryonic diploid chromosomes in two and three dimensions. The same approach can be extended to structures as small as yeast chromosomes or to other problems in structural cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W1984453334,"The Drosophila gene sevenless encodes a putative trans-membrane receptor required for the formation of one particular cell, the R7 photoreceptor, in each ommatidium of the compound eye. Mutations in this gene result in the cell normally destined to form the R7 cell forming a non-neuronal cell type instead. These observations have led to the proposal that the sevenless protein receives at least part of the positional information required for the R7 developmental pathway. We have generated antibodies specific for sevenless and have examined expression of the protein by light and electron microscopy. sevenless protein is present transiently at high levels in at least 9 cells in each developing ommatidium and is detectable several hours before any overt differentiation of R7. The protein is mostly localized at the apices of the cells, in microvilli, but is also found deeper in the tissue where certain cells contact the R8 cell. This finding suggests that R8 expresses a ligand for the sevenless protein."
https://openalex.org/W1967134931,"The identities of two types of sensory organs in the body wall of Drosophila, namely the external sensory organs and the chordotonal organs, are under genetic control. Embryonic lethal mutations in the cut gene complex transform the external sensory organs into chordotonal organs. The neurons, as well as the support cells forming the external sensory structures, change their morphological and antigenic characteristics to those of chordotonal organs, providing genetic evidence that these two types of sensory organs are homologous. Similar transformations of external sensory organs are observed in adult mosaic flies. Analysis of mosaic larvae and flies suggests that the cut gene function is required either in or near external sensory organs in order for them to acquire their correct identity."

https://openalex.org/W1981232584,"The purification and characterization of acetylcholinesterase from heads of the fruit fly Drosophila are described. Sequential extraction procedures indicated that approximately 40% of the activity was soluble and 60% membrane-bound and that virtually none (less than 4%) corresponded to collagen-tailed forms. The membrane-bound enzyme was extracted with Triton X-100 and purified over 4000-fold by affinity chromatography on acridinium resin. Hydrodynamic analysis by both sucrose gradient centrifugation and chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B revealed an Mr of 165,000 similar to that observed for dimeric (G2) forms of the enzyme in mammalian tissues. In contrast, the purified enzyme gave predominant bands of about 100 kDa prior to disulfied reduction and 55 kDa after reduction on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, values that are significantly lower than those reported for purified G2 enzymes from other species. However, the presence of a faint band at 70 kDa which could be labeled by [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate prior to denaturation suggested that the 55-kDa band as well as a 16-kDa species arose from proteolysis. This was confirmed by reductive radiomethylation and amine analysis of the 70-, 55-, and 16-kDa bands. All three contained ethanolamine and glucosamine residues that are characteristic of a C-terminal glycolipid anchor in other G2 acetylcholinesterases. The catalytic properties of the enzyme were examined by titration with a fluorogenic reagent which revealed a turnover number for acetylthiocholine that was 6-fold lower than eel and 3-fold lower than human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. Furthermore, the Drosophila enzyme hydrolyzed butyrylthiocholine much more efficiently than these eel or human enzymes, an indication that the fly head enzyme has a substrate specificity intermediate between mammalian acetylcholinesterases and butyrylcholinesterases."

https://openalex.org/W1483870817,"In an effort to identify the region of venom phospholipases A2, we have systematically compared the amino acid sequences of strong, weak and non-anticoagulant phospholipases. The comparison disclosed several significant substitutions in the region between residues 54 and 77 (homology numbers). This proposed region is positively charged in strong, but negatively charged in weak and non-anticoagulant phospholipases. The microenvironment of a tryptophan residue falls within the proposed region, accounting for the differential characteristics of intrinsic fluorescence changes observed at 335 nm after the binding of phospholipid vesicles to strong and weak anticoagulants. Four lysine residues are located in specific positions in the anticoagulant region of strong anticoagulants, and should form a cationic surface, based on analogy with the available crystallographic structures. The chemical modification of lysine, arginine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues and carboxylate groups, performed by other investigators, not only provides added support for the predicted site, but also confirms the essentiality of the positive charges in the site. This region may participate in the formation of a specific preferential hydrolytic complex leading to the strong effect. The region is distinct and separate from the predicted neurotoxic and myotoxic sites, and is located on the opposite surface of the phospholipase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1555606052,"Sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding and protein kinase C activity in vitro and in human platelets (Hannun, Y., Loomis, C., Merrill, A., and Bell, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12604-12609). Preincubation of platelets with sphingosine resulted in the inhibition of platelet secretion and second phase aggregation in response to ADP, gamma-thrombin, collagen, arachidonic acid, and platelet activating factor. Sphingosine did not affect the initial shape change of platelets or the first phase of aggregation in response to these agonists. Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was not affected by sphingosine. Sphingosine inhibition of secondary aggregation (secretion and second phase aggregation) was overcome by phorbol dibutyrate and by the cell-permeable protein kinase C activator, dioctanoylglycerol. Furthermore, platelet secretion and irreversible aggregation were induced by protein kinase C activators in platelets that had been primed to undergo initial shape change and first phase aggregation by low concentrations of agonists. These results suggest that protein kinase C activation is a necessary component in the signal transducing pathways that lead to platelet activation. Higher concentrations of agonists, however, induced irreversible aggregation and partial secretion in the presence of sphingosine, suggesting the existence of protein kinase C-independent pathways for platelet activation. These results demonstrate the utility of sphingosine as a pharmacologic tool in probing the role of protein kinase C in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1540599657,"Previously we reported that the novel protein-saccharide linkage, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), is found in abundance on proteins associated with the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the nuclear pore complex. Here we demonstrate that O-GlcNAc moieties are also added to human erythrocyte cytoplasmic proteins. Intact or permeabilized erythrocytes, as well as subcellular fractions, were labeled with bovine milk galactosyltransferase and UDP-[3H] galactose. The proportion of the incorporated label found on O-GlcNAc was determined by a variety of chemical and enzymatic techniques. The bulk of the O-GlcNAc residues are found in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes, the majority of which are on an as yet unidentified 65-kDa protein. In addition, we have determined that Band 4.1, a protein which serves as a bridge joining the cytoskeleton to the inner surface of the plasma membrane in erythrocytes, also contains O-GlcNAc moieties. One of the sites of O-GlcNAc addition has been localized to the last 117 amino acids of the carboxy terminus of Band 4.1."

https://openalex.org/W1986410420,"The tko (technical knockout) mutation is one of a family of behavioral mutations that cause “bang sensitivity” in D. melanogaster. Using P-element-mediated transformation, we show that a 3.1 kb piece of genomic DNA complements tko. This fragment contains only one complete transcript, 0.68 kb in length. This transcript is abundantly expressed through all stages of the life cycle, and we have isolated cDNAs corresponding to this transcript. Their sequence implies a protein product composed of 140 amino acids, which exhibits considerable sequence similarity to ribosomal protein S12 from both Euglena gracilis chloroplasts and E. coli. We suggest that tko codes for a mitochondrial ribosomal protein and that the tko phenotype results from defective mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2148736507,"In the sevenless (sev) mutants of Drosophila, a single cell type, photoreceptor R7, does not develop. We made monoclonal antibody against a sev+-beta-galactosidase fusion protein, and used it to determine the ultrastructural localization of the sev+ protein in the larval eye disc. The protein is expressed on the apical surface of the developing retina. It is not restricted to cell R7; it is expressed in all the presumptive photoreceptor cells, cone cells, and possibly others. The protein localizes to the cell membranes of the apical tips and their microvilli, away from the bulk of the cell-cell contacts. Possible mechanisms for generating the specificity of the sev phenotype are discussed in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1553730591,"The interconversion of L-lysine and L-3,6-diamino-hexanoate (L-beta-lysine) catalyzed by lysine 2,3-aminomutase is known to be stimulated by added S-adenosylmethionine (Chirpich, T. P., Zappia, V., Costilow, R. N., and Barker, H. A. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1778-1789). In this paper we show that enzyme activated by S-[2,8,5'-3H]adenosylmethionine catalyzes the conversion of L-lysine to the equilibrium mixture of L-lysine and L-beta-lysine with incorporation of high levels of tritium into both isomers. The tritium levels in the isomers reflect the equilibrium constant for their interconversion, 84% in the L-beta-lysine and 16% in L-lysine compared with Keq = 5.3 +/- 0.3 in the direction of the formation of L-beta-lysine at pH 7.7 and 30 degrees C. No significant tritium is incorporated into lysine from S-[2,8-3H]adenosylmethionine or S-adenosyl[methyl-3H] methionine under comparable conditions. Therefore, the tritium incorporated into lysine in the former reaction arises from the 5'-position of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group in S-adenosylmethionine. These experiments implicate the 5'-deoxyadenosyl portion of S-adenosylmethionine in the hydrogen transfer mechanism of this reaction, perhaps in a role analogous to that played by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety of deoxyadenosyl cobalamin in coenzyme B12-dependent rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W1978594436,"Murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes contain, in addition to the cytotoxic pore-forming protein perforin, another cytolytic factor localized in both cytoplasm and granules. Like perforin, this CTL cytotoxin lyses a variety of tumor cells; unlike perforin, it is stable in the presence of calcium, requires several hours to induce maximal lytic activity, and is antigenically related to the previously described tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT). However, it differs from TNF and LT in a number of biochemical and functional properties. TNF- and LT-specific cDNA probes did not hybridize with any CTL-specific message, indicating that the CTL cytotoxin is distinct from those two factors. It has an apparent Mr of 50 and 70 kd under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively, is secreted by secretagogue-stimulated CTLs, and causes DNA fragmentation in several targets, a phenomenon previously attributed to target cell damage by CTLs. These results suggest that killing by lymphocytes may encompass multiple mechanisms and polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1534428859,"Membrane assembly of the C5b-9 proteins on gel-filtered human platelets has been shown to initiate the nonlytic release of alpha-granule contents and expression of membrane prothrombinase sites, suggesting cellular activation by these ostensibly cytolytic plasma proteins (Wiedmer, T., Esmon, C. T., and Sims, P. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14587-14592). We now examine the mechanism of the C5b-9-induced release reaction. The release of alpha-granule contents upon C5b-9 assembly is accompanied by expression of alpha-granule membrane glycoprotein 140 on the platelet surface, confirming that the complement-mediated release reaction occurs by secretory fusion of the alpha-granule with the plasma membrane. C5b-9 binding initiates the phosphorylation of both 40- and 20-kDa platelet proteins, indicative of activation of protein kinase C and myosin light chain kinase, respectively. Activation of cellular protein kinases under these conditions was not accompanied by the formation of inositol phosphates and was found to strictly depend upon extracellular Ca2+, suggesting that the platelet's secretory response to the C5b-9 proteins is triggered directly by the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. measurement of intracellular Ca2+ confirmed that elevation of this ion in the cytosol was strictly dependent upon increased plasma membrane permeability due to C5b-9 assembly and was not accompanied by mobilization of this ion from internal storage pools. The C5b-9-mediated secretory response was blocked by sphingosine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, but was unaffected by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, suggesting that feedback (receptor-linked) by thromboxane is not required for platelet activation after C5b-9 insertion."

https://openalex.org/W1518218790,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates expression of the c-myc, c-fos, JE, and KC genes in BALB/c/3T3 cells. Here we show that these genes respond differentially to at least two distinct intracellular second messengers generated by PDGF. A broad body of data support the view that response of the c-myc and c-fos genes to PDGF is channeled, at least in part, through activation of protein kinase C. Both PDGF and protein kinase C agonists stimulate transcription of c-myc and c-fos. Down regulation of protein kinase C inhibits the transcriptional induction of c-fos and c-myc by PDGF. In contrast, protein kinase C agonists do not stimulate transcription of JE and KC. Down regulation of protein kinase C does not inhibit the ability of PDGF to stimulate transcription of JE and KC. The differential response of these four genes to PDGF and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate correlates with differential phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins. PDGF treatment stimulates phosphorylation of intracellular proteins at 31, 32, and 80 kilodaltons. Down regulation of protein kinase C prevents phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein in response to PDGF, but phosphorylation of the smaller proteins is not affected. Finally, PDGF which induces all four genes (and stimulates phosphorylation of three proteins) is a much more potent mitogen than protein kinase C agonists which regulate only some of these events."

Chem. 260, 12410-12415) in the brain of 2- and 8-week-old rats was biochemically indistinguishable as judged by Mr (26,000), pI values (4.35-4.75), Km for prostaglandin H2 (approximately 20 microM), and requirement of sulfhydryl compounds. Furthermore, the enzyme was immunologically the same at both ages, as judged by immunotitration, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, and immunoblotting analyses using a polyclonal and two monoclonal antibodies specific for the enzyme. However, the cellular localization of the enzyme was markedly different between the two ages, as examined by immunoperoxidase staining with the specific antibodies. The immunoreactivity was found in many neurons in 2-week-old rats but was not detected in most neurons in 8-week-old rats except for multipolar neurons in layers I-II of the neocortex and several clusters of dendrites in the pyriform cortex. In the adult rat, the immunoreactivity was mainly localized in oligodendrocytes. By immunoelectron microscopy, the immunoreactive deposits were seen in rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and outer nuclear membrane of the glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598660200,"A monospecific rabbit antiserum to pepsin-extracted chick gizzard type VI collagen was used to characterize the intact forms of type VI collagen in tissues and cultured cells. Immunoblotting of gizzard extracts revealed polypeptides of Mr ranging from 260,000 to 140,000. Components of about Mr = 260,000, 150,000, and 140,000, each with a different peptide profile, were immunoprecipitated from labeled matrix-free chick embryo cells. Cleavage of the immunoprecipitated polypeptides with pepsin generated pepsin-resistant fragments of about Mr = 70,000, 55,000, and 45,000 that represent the alpha 1(VI), alpha 2(VI), and alpha 3 (VI) fragments. Immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies indicated that the Mr = 150,000 is the intact parent polypeptide of the alpha 1(VI) pepsin; the Mr = 140,000 of the alpha 2(VI) pepsin, and the Mr = 260,000 of the alpha 3(VI) pepsin. Association of the three parent chains was studied by pulse-chase experiments and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis under nonreduced conditions. A complex of Mr = 500,000 is already present intracellularly at the end of a 7-min pulse and increases considerably with time while the three unassembled chains show a comparable decrease. After 5-15 min of chase larger forms appeared along with small amounts of aggregated material that did not enter the gel. Analysis of the immunoprecipitate by diagonal electrophoresis indicated that the component of Mr = 500,000 and the larger forms dissociated into the Mr = 260,000, 150,000, and 140,000 polypeptides. Sedimentation profile of a labeled cell extract on a 5-20% sucrose gradient under nondenaturing conditions confirmed the presence of three different peptides in the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1527076667,"The putative protein synthesis initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4D (eIF-4D) is post-translationally modified by the polyamine spermidine, forming the rare amino acid hypusine from a lysine residue. The hypusine precursor, deoxyhypusine, was formed in crude cell lysates at pH 9.5 and converted to hypusine at pH 7.1. The modification occurred in eIF-4D, since the isoelectric points and molecular weights of the proteins modified in intact cells and lysates were indistinguishable. Only lysates from cells treated with alpha-difluoromethylornithine, to deplete endogenous polyamine pools, supported the formation of deoxyhypusine, suggesting that unmodified eIF-4D accumulated in spermidine deficient cells. Guazatine, an inhibitor of enzymes which form delta 1-pyrroline from spermidine, blocked deoxyhypusine formation in lysates by nearly 70% at 100 microM and completely at 1 mM. Other mammalian amine oxidase inhibitors had little or no effect on this reaction. Thus, deoxyhypusine formation in eIF-4D is catalyzed by a guazatine-sensitive enzyme with a basic pH optimum."
https://openalex.org/W124618066,"GRB-PAP1 is a continuous line of epithelial cells derived from a rabbit renal inner medulla. Elevation of the NaCl concentration in the medium bathing these cells strongly induced the expression of a soluble protein with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa.

Goat antiserum against this purified aldose reductase selected the 39-kDa band from immunoblots of cells grown in a medium containing high NaCl. When the osmolality of the medium was increased by adding NaCl, the amount of aldose reductase protein and the aldose reductase activity increased together from very low to sustained high levels over several days. The aldose reductase protein was more than 10% of the soluble cell protein when cells were propagated in medium made hyperosmotic by adding NaCl to increase medium osmolality to 600 mosm.kg-1."
https://openalex.org/W1498016650,"In primary culture of anterior pituitary cells, dopamine inhibited the angiotensin (AII)-stimulated inositol phosphate production by 28 +/- 2.5% (n = 14), with an EC50 of 660 +/- 228 nM (n = 8). This effect was blocked by (+)-butaclamol, a specific dopamine receptor antagonist. RU 24926, a D2 specific agonist, but not SKF 38393, a specific D1 agonist, inhibited AII-stimulated inositol phosphate production, suggesting that this dopamine effect is mediated through a dopamine receptor of the D2 subtype. Dopamine also partially inhibited (25%) inositol phosphate production stimulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Our results suggest that the dopamine-mediated inhibition of hormonally stimulated inositol phosphate production is probably not mediated through the known inhibitory effects of dopamine on cAMP and Ca2+ intracellular concentrations. Although unknown, the mechanism by which dopamine inhibited the AII and TRH-stimulated inositol phosphate production implicates a GTP binding protein sensitive to the islet activating protein (IAP) since dopamine effects were blocked by this toxin. The alpha subunit of the GTP binding protein involved could be one of the three ADP-ribosylated proteins found in anterior pituitary cells in primary cultures, the alpha o (39 kDa), the alpha i (41 kDa), and an alpha subunit of 40 kDa. Indeed, we show here that this 40-kDa IAP substrate, already described in a few tissues, is present in anterior pituitary cells. The negative coupling between dopamine receptors and the AII or TRH inositol phosphate production systems, could be implicated in the dopamine inhibition of the AII- and TRH-stimulated prolactin release since such an inhibition is blocked by IAP. Our results suggest that the negative regulation of inositol phosphate production is one of the mechanisms by which dopamine controls hormonally stimulated prolactin release."
https://openalex.org/W1528942693,"A procedure for the purification of RNA polymerase from vegetative cells of the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena 7120 is described. Polyethyleneimine precipitation followed by gel filtration and affinity chromatography steps results in greater than 99% purification with 46% yield.

The sigma subunit has been identified by reconstitution of specific transcriptional activity from core enzyme and gel-purified sigma. In transcription assays, this RNA polymerase initiates at a number of Anabaena vegetative cell promoters, as well as from a bacteriophage T4 early promoter, but does not initiate at nitrogen fixation (nif) promoters used in heterocysts. The promoter specificity of Anabaena RNA polymerase is compared with that of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1582214791,"The pathways for degradation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) were investigated in sonicated suspensions prepared from confluent cultures of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The time courses of formation of 3H-labeled and 14C-labeled metabolites of phosphatidyl-[3H]inositol ([3H]Ins-PI) and 1-stearoyl-2-[14C] arachidonoyl-PI were determined at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5 in the presence of 2 mM EDTA with or without a 2 mM excess of Ca2+. The rates of formation of lysophosphatidyl-[3H]inositol ([3H]Ins-lyso-PI) and 1-lyso-2-[14C] arachidonoyl-PI were similar in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and the absolute amounts of the two radiolabeled lyso-PI products formed were nearly identical. This indicated that lyso-PI was formed by phospholipase A1, and phospholipase A2 was not measurable. In the presence of EDTA, [14C]arachidonic acid release from 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-PI paralleled release of glycerophospho-[3H]inositol ([3H]GPI) from [3H]Ins-PI. Formation of [3H]GPI was inhibited by treatment with the specific sulfhydryl reagent, 2,2'-dithiodipyridine, and this was accompanied by an increase in [3H]Ins-lyso-PI. In the presence of Ca2+, [14C] arachidonic acid release from 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-PI was increased 2-fold and was associated with Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C activity. Under these conditions, [3H]inositol monophosphate production exceeded formation of [14C]arachidonic acid-labeled phospholipase C products, diacylglycerol plus monoacylglycerol, by an amount that was equal to the amount of [14C]arachidonic acid formed in excess of [3H]GPI. Low concentrations of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (15-125 microM) inhibited Ca2+-dependent [14C]arachidonic acid release, and the decrease in [14C] arachidonic acid formed was matched by an equivalent increase in 14C label in diacylglycerol plus monoacyclglycerol. These data supported the existence of two pathways for arachidonic acid release from PI in endothelial cells; a phospholipase A1-lysophospholipase pathway that was Ca2+-independent and a phospholipase C-diacylglycerol lipase pathway that was Ca2+-dependent. The mean percentage of arachidonic acid released from PI via the phospholipase C-diacylglycerol lipase pathway in the presence of Ca2+ was 65 +/- 8%. The mean percentage of nonpolar phospholipase C products of PI metabolized via the diacylglycerol lipase pathway to free arachidonic acid was 28 +/- 3%."
https://openalex.org/W1590394298,"Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography was employed to separate the major products resulting from the hydroperoxide-dependent cooxidation of 13-cis-retinoic acid by microsomal and purified prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase. Several major oxygenated metabolites including 4-hydroxy-, 5,6-epoxy-, and 5,8-oxy-13-cis-retinoic acid were unambiguously identified on the basis of cochromatography with authentic standards, uv spectra, and mass spectral analysis. Identical product profiles were generated regardless of the type of oxidizing substrate employed, and heat-denatured microsomes or enzyme did not support oxidation. In addition, several geometric isomers including all trans-retinoic acid were identified. Isomerization to all trans-retinoic acid in microsomes occurred in the absence of exogenous hydroperoxide, was insensitive to inhibition by antioxidant, and was eliminated when heat-denatured preparations were substituted for intact microsomes. Conversely, isomerization to at least one other isomer required the addition of hydroperoxide and was sensitive to antioxidant inhibition. Addition of antioxidant to microsomal incubation mixtures inhibited the hydroperoxide-dependent generation of 5,6-epoxy- and 5,8-oxy-13-cis-retinoic acid and other oxygenated metabolites but stimulated the formation of 4-hydroxy-13-cis-retinoic acid. Under standard conditions, 77% of the original retinoid was metabolized resulting in products containing 1.25 oxygen atoms/oxygenated metabolite, and two dioxygen molecules were consumed per hydroperoxide reduced. Purified PGH synthase also supported O2 uptake during cooxidation of 13-cis-retinoic acid by H2O2 or 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide, and the initial velocities of O2 uptake were directly proportional to enzyme concentration. 13-cis-Retinoic acid effectively inhibited peroxidase-dependent cooxidation of guaiacol indicating a direct interaction of retinoid with peroxidase iron-oxo intermediates, and EPR spin trapping studies demonstrated the formation of retinoid-derived free radical intermediates. Incubating H2O2 with microsomal PGH synthase resulted in the initiation of lipid peroxidation, detected via measurement of malondialdehyde generation, that was inhibited by retinoid and suggests some limited involvement of lipid peroxidation in retinoid oxidation. Incubation of 13-cis-retinoic acid with hematin and 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid in the presence of detergent, a system that generates high yields of peroxyl radicals, resulted in high yields of 5,6-epoxide; 4-hydroxy-13-cis-retinoic acid was not detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1556599431,"Abstract Phorbol esters have been shown to stimulate phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. The present study compares the effects of phorbol esters and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on phosphatidylcholine metabolism in GH3 pituitary cells. In a previous study (Kolesnick, R.N., and Paley, A.E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9204-9210), the potent phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced time- and concentration-dependent incorporation of 32Pi and [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine in short-term labeling experiments. In this study, TPA is shown to activate choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15), the regulatory enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway, by stimulating redistribution of the inactive cytosolic form of the enzyme to the membrane. Redistribution was quantitative. TPA reduced cytosolic activity from 3.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.5 +/- 0.3 nmol . min-1 x 10(7) cells-1 and enhanced particulate activity from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 4.9 +/- 0.6 nmol . min-1 x 10(7) cells-1. TRH also stimulated time- and concentration-dependent 32Pi and [3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. An increase was detectable after 5 min; and after 30 min, the levels were 164 +/- 9 and 150 +/- 11% of control, respectively; EC50 congruent to 2 X 10(-10) M TRH. These events correlated directly with TRH-induced 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. TRH also stimulated redistribution of cytidylyl-transferase specific activity. TRH reduced cytosolic activity 45% and enhanced particulate activity 51%. Neither TRH nor TPA stimulated phosphatidylcholine degradation. In cells down-modulated for protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase), the effects of TPA and TRH on 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylcholine were abolished. However, TRH-induced incorporation into phosphatidylinositol still occurred. These studies provide evidence that hormones may regulate phosphatidylcholine metabolism via the protein kinase C pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2157526156,"Activation of neutrophils by most soluble stimuli is associated with a marked increase in intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). However, under physiological conditions (Na+-rich media), the potent activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) causes no change or a decrease in [Ca2+]i. We report here that the [Ca2+]i response to phorbol esters varies depending on the ionic composition of the medium. A marked increase in [Ca2+]i was detected in Na+-free solutions. Maximal effects were observed when N-methyl-D-glucammonium+ or choline+ were substituted for Na+, whereas an intermediate response was recorded in K+ medium. The increase in [Ca2+]i was substantially (approximately 65%) inhibited by removal of external Ca2+. A [Ca2+]i increase was also elicited by other beta-phorbol diesters and by diacylglycerol, but not by unesterified phorbol or by alpha-phorbol diesters, indicating involvement of protein kinase C. The increase in [Ca2+]i observed in Na+-free media is not due to inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, since no change in [Ca2+]i in response to TPA was observed in: 1) cells suspended in Li+, which is not countertransported for Ca2+; 2) cells preloaded with Na+ to eliminate the driving force for Na+/Ca2+ exchange; and 3) cells treated with 3',4'-dichlorobenzamyl, an inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Similarly, the [Ca2+]i increase in Na+-free media is not linked to the absence of Na+/H+ exchange and the associated cytoplasmic acidification since: 1) it was not observed in Na+ media in the presence of inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiport and 2) it was not mimicked by inducing acidification with nigericin. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin largely inhibited the phorbol ester-induced change in [Ca2+]i, while activation of protein kinase C under these conditions was unaffected. It is concluded that in the absence of extracellular Na+ (or Li+), activation of protein kinase C leads to a net Ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm through a process mediated by a GTP-binding or G protein. Opening of a Na+-sensitive Ca2+ channel could partially explain these observations. Alternatively, the nature of the monovalent cation could conceivably affect the conformation of a G protein or of an associated receptor, inducing the appearance of a site susceptible to an activating phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1597141928,"Starting with 100 g (wet weight) of a mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 forced to grow on L-threonine as sole carbon source, we developed a 6-step procedure that provides 30-40 mg of homogeneous 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase (also called aminoacetone synthetase or synthase). This ligase, which catalyzes the cleavage/condensation reaction between 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate (the presumed product of the L-threonine dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction) and glycine + acetyl-CoA, has an apparent molecular weight approximately equal to 85,000 and consists of two identical (or nearly identical) subunits with Mr = 42,000. Computer analysis of amino acid composition data, which gives the best fit nearest integer ratio for each residue, indicates a total of 387 amino acids/subunit with a calculated Mr = 42,093. Stepwise Edman degradation provided the N-terminal sequence of the first 21 amino acids. It is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme since (a) several carbonyl reagents caused greater than 90% loss of activity, (b) dialysis against buffer containing hydroxylamine resulted in 89% loss of activity coincident with an 86% decrease in absorptivity at 428 nm, (c) incubation of the apoenzyme with 20 microM pyridoxal phosphate showed a parallel recovery (greater than 90%) of activity and 428-nm absorptivity, and (d) reduction of the holoenzyme with NaBH4 resulted in complete inactivation, disappearance of a new absorption maximum at 333 nm. Strict specificity for glycine is shown but acetyl-CoA (100%), n-propionyl-CoA (127%), or n-butyryl-CoA (16%) is utilized in the condensation reaction. Apparent Km values for acetyl-CoA, n-propionyl-CoA, and glycine are 59 microM, 80 microM, and 12 mM, respectively; the pH optimum = 7.5. Added divalent metal ions or sulfhydryl compounds inhibited catalysis of the condensation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1482169651,"A cytochrome P-450 (P-450SG1) was purified from a lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (P-450(14DM)) defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain SG1, by a method similar to that used in the purification of the wild type enzyme (Yoshida, Y., and Aoyama, Y. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1655-1660). P-450SG1 had the same apparent Mr as and was immunochemically identical to P-450(14DM). Peptide maps of P-450SG1 made by limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, chymotrypsin, or papain followed by gel electrophoresis were identical to corresponding peptide maps of P-450(14DM). However, P-450SG1 showed no lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase activity and its mode of interaction with diniconazole [(E)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-(1,2,4-triazol-1-y1)-1- penten-3- o1], a specific inhibitor of P-450(14DM), was fundamentally different from that of P-450(14DM). The absorption spectrum of ferric P-450SG1 was unusual for a native low-spin cytochrome P-450 and was superimposable on that of 1-methylimidazole complex of P-450(14DM), indicating that P-450SG1 has a histidine 6th ligand trans to the thiolate 5th ligand, while the 6th ligand of other ferric low-spin cytochrome P-450s is a water molecule or a hydroxyl group of an oxyamino acid. It is concluded that P-450SG1 is an altered P-450(14DM). Difference in the primary structure between P-450SG1 and P-450(14DM) may be slight and was not detected by peptide mapping. However, the alteration caused significant change in the substrate site and heme environments of the cytochrome. P-450SG1 is the first example of a cytochrome P-450 having a histidine axial ligand trans to thiolate and of a genetically altered cytochrome P-450 isolated in a homogeneous state."
https://openalex.org/W1494860669,"Neutral amino acid transport has been characterized in the mouse peritoneal macrophages elicited by thioglycolate broth. Serine, alanine, cysteine, and leucine were transported mainly in a Na+-independent manner and, within the concentration ranges tested, the transport of each amino acid was mediated by a single, saturable system. The transport of these amino acids was strongly inhibited by a wide variety of neutral amino acids, 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a putative System L substrate, but not by glycine, proline, or 2-methylaminoisobutyrate. In this study the transport of serine has been characterized in detail. Inhibition of the transport of serine by 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid or by leucine was competitive. The transport of serine which exhibited trans-stimulation was slightly stimulated by lowering the pH and was little affected by N-ethylmaleimide. It was also shown that most of the neutral amino acids were concentrated only slightly (less than 2-fold) in the macrophages, unlike in the lymphocytes and granulocytes. From these results we have concluded that in the macrophages serine, cysteine, alanine, leucine, and presumably many other neutral amino acids are transported almost exclusively through a common transport system analogous to System L."
https://openalex.org/W1575393533,"Resting rat thymocytes were stimulated to cell cycle entry and proliferation by the addition of concanavalin A and interleukin 2 to the culture medium. Maximal rats of DNA and RNA synthesis and of glycolysis with a 20-fold increase in glucose uptake were observed 48 h after stimulation. Glycolytic enzyme levels increased 3-8-fold, also reaching their maxima 48 h after mitogenic stimulation. Actinomycin D (1.3-1.5 ng/ml) completely inhibited DNA and RNA synthesis in 24- and 48-h cultured cells but showed no inhibitory effect on glycolytic enzyme induction or on enhanced glycolysis. These results suggest the presence of sufficient mRNAs for the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes even though transcription is abolished by actinomycin D. Ornithine decarboxylase activity increased rapidly up to 41-fold within 6 h after stimulation with concanavalin A and interleukin 2. This rapid increase could not be prevented by actinomycin D; however, ornithine decarboxylase activity of thymocytes was affected after 24- and 48-h culture periods. Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by 5 mM difluoromethylornithine completely abolished glycolytic enzyme induction. This inhibitory effect could be reversed by exogeneous putrescine. The results obtained indicate the importance of early ornithine decarboxylase activation and polyamine biosynthesis for the induction of glycolytic enzymes in proliferating thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1569111687,"Abstract The G protein family of transmembrane signaling molecules includes Gs and Gi, the stimulatory and inhibitory regulators of adenylate cyclase. These and other characterized G proteins are comprised of beta, gamma, and alpha chains, the latter being the most variable among the proteins and thus serving to distinguish them. Previous results (Begin-Heick, N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6187-6193) suggested that the autosomal recessive mouse mutation obese (ob), which results in an abnormal response of adipose tissue to lipolytic hormones, is due to a defect in the gene coding for the alpha chain of Gi. In order to test this hypothesis we used a cloned cDNA probe representing murine Gi alpha mRNA in conjunction with a panel of Chinese hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids segregating mouse chromosomes to map the Gi alpha gene in the mouse. In addition, we used a cDNA probe representing the murine Gs alpha gene to a specific mouse chromosome. Our results indicate that the Gi alpha locus maps to mouse chromosome 9, while Gs alpha is localized to region 2E1-2H3 of mouse chromosome 2. Localization of the Gi alpha gene to chromosome 9 excludes this gene as a site of the ob mutation, since the ob locus maps to chromosome 6. Furthermore, our findings indicate that certain members of the murine G protein alpha gene family have dispersed to different chromosomes since diverging from a common ancestral gene."

These studies demonstrated that outbred rat strains consist of two subpopulations that differ approximately 1.5- to twofold in serum and liver βG activity. Evidence is presented indicating that owing to its compartmentalization the lysosomal βG, unlike the corresponding microsomal enzyme, is neither inhibited by glucarolactone nor accessible for hydrolysis of newly synthesized glucuronides. The ratio of glucuronidated to unconjugated BR 15 min after injection of albumin-bound BR into the tail vein appears to correlate negatively with the liver microsomal βG activity. The results may be relevant to the relative risk to toxins, including carcinogens, and to their reduction by dietary intervention.—Dwivedi, C.; Downie, A. A.; Webb, T. E.

https://openalex.org/W1653735352,"For construction of bifunctionally active membrane-bound fusion proteins, we designed plasmids encoding fusion proteins in which the carboxyl terminus of Escherichia coli proline carrier was joined to the amino terminus of E. coli beta-galactosidase directly or with a collagen linker inserted between the two. The expressions of these fusion proteins complemented deficiencies in both proline transport and beta-galactosidase activity in E. coli cells. The fusion proteins were stable and mostly localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. The proline transport activities of the fusion proteins were kinetically similar to that of the wild type proline carrier. The beta-galactosidase moiety of the collagen-linked fusion protein was liberated from membrane vesicles by collagenase treatment. The Km value of released beta-galactosidase for o-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysis was similar to that of membrane-bound beta-galactosidase in the fusion protein. These results indicated that the fusion proteins are bifunctionally active and exhibit normal proline transport and beta-galactosidase activities. The crypticity of the beta-galactosidase activity associated with the fusion proteins indicated that the carboxyl terminus of the proline carrier was located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1500540561,"Exposure of macrophages to phorbol esters or the calcium ionophore A23187 increases the number of several surface receptors due to recruitment of receptors from internal pools (Buys, S. S., Keogh, E. A., and Kaplan, J. (1984) Cell 38, 569-576). We have examined the mechanism by which these agents increase surface receptor number. Cells which were preloaded with either fluid phase or receptor-mediated ligands did not lose ligand following exposure to ionophore or phorbol ester. The rate of movement of ligands to the lysosome was also unaffected. These results suggest that A23187 does not induce the fusion of ligand-containing compartments with the cell surface. Ionophore treatment did, however, produce a severalfold increase in the rate at which unoccupied receptors reappear on the cell surface. These results suggest that the compartment of receptors affected by the ionophore formed subsequent to the dissociation of ligand from receptor. The altered rate of receptor reappearance was transitory (90 s), and the increase in receptor number was subsequently maintained by a decrease in the rate of internalization. Changes in the rate of receptor internalization did not correlate with changes in the rate of fluid phase pinocytosis, suggesting that the effect on receptor internalization was selective."
https://openalex.org/W1575815474,"This is the first report of nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of the variable region light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains of mouse monoclonal hybridoma anti-blood group A and B substances, the combining sites of which have been mapped. Monoclonal hybridoma anti-A and anti-B produced in BALB/c mice by immunization with A or B blood group substances, with A1 erythrocytes, and water-soluble blood group A substance or with synthetic B determinants coupled to bovine serum albumin or to O erythrocytes have been characterized immunochemically. To relate the immunochemical properties of the monoclonals to their primary structures, we have cloned and sequenced cDNAs of variable regions of light and heavy chains of two anti-A and two anti-B. The anti-A hybridomas have very similar combining site specificities and have almost identical VH sequences belonging to the J558 germ-line family, but their VL are from different germ-line VK gene families. The two anti-B hybridomas have different combining site specificities and use the same VL which differs completely from the anti-A VL; their VH are derived from different VH germ-line genes belonging to the J606 family. The results suggest that the heavy chains play a major role in determining the specificities of the antibody combining sites, with only minor contribution of VL. Additional sequence data on monoclonal antibodies of defined specificity for blood group substances are needed for further insights into the genetic and structural basis for their specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1540564743,"Methimazole, an irreversible, mechanism-based (suicide substrate) inhibitor of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase, also inhibits the oxidation of xenobiotics by prostaglandin hydroperoxidase. The mechanism(s) by which methimazole inhibits prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed oxidations is not conclusively known. In studies reported here, methimazole inhibited the prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed oxidation of benzidine, phenylbutazone, and aminopyrine in a concentration-dependent manner. Methimazole poorly supported the prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide to the corresponding alcohol (5-phenyl-4-pentenyl alcohol), suggesting that methimazole is not serving as a competing reducing cosubstrate for the peroxidase. Methimazole is not a mechanism-based inhibitor of prostaglandin hydroperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase since methimazole did not inhibit the peroxidase-catalyzed, benzidine-supported reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide. In contrast, methimazole inhibited the reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide to 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl alcohol catalyzed by lactoperoxidase, confirming that methimazole is a mechanism-based inhibitor of that enzyme and that such inhibition can be detected by our assay. Glutathione reduces the aminopyrine cation free radical, the formation of which is catalyzed by the hydroperoxidase, back to the parent compound. Methimazole produced the same effect at concentrations equimolar to those required for glutathione. These data indicate that methimazole does not inhibit xenobiotic oxidations catalyzed by prostaglandin H synthase and horseradish peroxidase through direct interaction with the enzyme, but rather inhibits accumulation of oxidation products via reduction of a free radical-derived metabolite(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1592222398,"DNA ligase has been purified to homogeneity from 6-12 h Drosophila melanogaster embryos (Rabin, B. A., Hawley, R. S., and Chase, J. W. (1986) J. Biol.

Of a variety of nucleotides tested, only adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate could substitute for ATP in the joining reaction. The enzyme was competitively inhibited by dATP, with an apparent Ki of 2.3 microM. The apparent Km for DNA using p(dT)20 annealed with poly(dA) as substrate was 1.0 microM. Studies utilizing synthetic homopolymers showed that in addition to joining DNA to DNA, this enzyme could join the 5'-phosphoryl termini of RNA to the 3'-hydroxyl termini of DNA or RNA, when they were annealed with DNA. In addition, p(dT)7U could be joined when annealed with poly(dA). No joining was detected when RNA served as the template. Drosophila DNA ligase also catalyzed the joining of oligonucleotides containing a single mismatched nucleotide at their 3'-hydroxyl termini, as well as DNA containing short, complementary 5'-protruding ends, and in the presence of polyethylene glycol 6000, blunt-ended duplex DNA. The overall reaction mechanism was shown to be identical to that of the homologous prokaryotic DNA ligases. The joining reactions catalyzed by the Drosophila and T4 DNA ligases were shown to be reversible. Incubation of superhelical closed circular DNA molecules with the purified enzymes and AMP resulted in the production of a population of DNA molecules which had lost most, if not all, of their superhelical density."

Radiolabel from [adenylate-32P] NAD+ was associated specifically with both the alpha-subunit of G-protein and with A-protein in the presence of activated cholera toxin. In the absence of added A-protein, G-protein appears to undergo ADP-ribosylation at a slower rate. In the absence of G-protein, A-protein was found to be labeled following incubation with [adenylate-32P]NAD+ and cholera toxin. In the presence of G-protein, a light-dependent component of A-protein labeling was observed. A-protein is a labile component of rod outer segments and has an affinity for ADP.

https://openalex.org/W1545582742,"In an attempt to study the mechanisms of action of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, we have applied to rat brain synaptosomal membranes antibodies raised against purified bovine transducin (T) beta gamma subunits. The antibodies recognized one 36-kDa protein in Western blots of the membranes. Adenylate cyclase activation by GTP non-hydrolyzable analogues was greatly decreased in immune, as compared to preimmune, antibody-treated membranes, whereas the enzyme basal activity was unaffected by both types of antibodies. The inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by guanine 5′-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp-(NH)p) was decreased in membranes preincubated with immune, but not preimmune, antibodies. Anti-T beta antibodies moderately decreased the extent of subsequent adenylate cyclase activation by forskolin, while not affecting activation by Al3+/F-. The enzyme activation by Gpp(NH)p in untreated membranes remained the same upon further incubation in the presence of either type of antibodies. Such results were consistent with the decreased exchange of guanine nucleotides which occurred in membrane treated with immune, but not preimmune antibodies, upon addition of GTP. The blockade of the regulation of adenylate cyclase by Gpp(NH)p observed in membranes pretreated by anti-T beta antibodies thus appears to be caused by the impairment of the guanine nucleotide exchange occurring on Gs alpha subunits. The G beta subunits in the adenylate cyclase complex seem to be instrumental in the guanine nucleotide exchange on G alpha subunits, just as T beta subunits are in the transducin complex."
