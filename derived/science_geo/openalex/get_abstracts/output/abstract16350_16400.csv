https://openalex.org/W2016138321,"Direct in situ introduction of exogenous genes into proliferating tumors could provide an effective therapeutic approach for treatment of localized tumors. Rats with a cerebral glioma were given an intratumoral stereotaxic injection of murine fibroblasts that were producing a retroviral vector in which the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HS-tk) gene had been inserted. After 5 days during which the HS-tk retroviral vectors that were produced in situ transduced the neighboring proliferating glioma cells, the rats were treated with the anti-herpes drug ganciclovir. Gliomas in the ganciclovir- and vector-treated rats regressed completely both macroscopically and microscopically. This technique exploits what was previously considered to be a disadvantage of retroviral vectors—that is, their inability to transfer genes into nondividing cells. Instead, this feature of retroviruses is used to target gene delivery to dividing tumor cells and to spare nondividing neural tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2095549425,"Glutamate-operated ion channels (GluR channels) of the L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-kainate subtype are found in both neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system. These channels are assembled from the GluR-A, -B, -C, and -D subunits; channels containing a GluR-B subunit show an outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation and low calcium permeability, whereas channels lacking the GluR-B subunit are characterized by a doubly rectifying current-voltage relation and high calcium permeability. Most cell types in the central nervous system coexpress several subunits, including GluR-B. However, Bergmann glia in rat cerebellum do not express GluR-B subunit genes. In a subset of cultured cerebellar glial cells, likely derived from Bergmann glial cells. GluR channels exhibit doubly rectifying current-voltage relations and high calcium permeability, whereas GluR channels of cerebellar neurons have low calcium permeability. Thus, differential expression of the GluR-B subunit gene in neurons and glia is one mechanism by which functional properties of native GluR channels are regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1987970152,"Glutamate receptors, the most abundant excitatory transmitter receptors in the brain, are not restricted to neurons; they have also been detected on glial cells. Bergmann glial cells in mouse cerebellar slices revealed a kainate-type glutamate receptor with a sigmoid current-to-voltage relation, as demonstrated with the patch-clamp technique. Calcium was imaged with fura-2, and a kainate-induced increase in intracellular calcium concentration was observed, which was blocked by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and by low concentrations of external calcium, indicating that there was an influx of calcium through the kainate receptor itself. The entry of calcium led to a marked reduction in the resting (passive) potassium conductance of the cell. Purkinje cells, which have glutamatergic synapses, are closely associated with Bergmann glial cells and therefore may provide a functionally important stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1536374844,"Serine palmitoyltransferase, 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase and sphinganine N-acyltransferase are responsible for the first steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis forming 3-oxosphinganine, sphinganine, and dihydroceramide, respectively. We confirmed the localization of these enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using highly purified mouse liver ER and Golgi preparations. Mild digestion of sealed right-side out mouse liver ER derived vesicles with different proteolytic enzymes under conditions where latency of mannose-6-phosphatase was 90% produced approximately 60-80% inactivation of serine palmitoyltransferase, 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase, and sphinganine N-acyltransferase activities. These sphingolipid biosynthetic activities (serine palmitoyltransferase, 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase, and sphinganine N-acyltransferase) are not latent, indicating that they face the cytosolic side of the ER, so that substrates have free access to their active sites. Moreover, the membrane-impermeable compound, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, which binds to a large number of ER proteins, inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase and sphinganine N-acyltransferase activities by 30-70%."
https://openalex.org/W2014303424,"The generation of infectious defective interfering (DI) particles of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) entirely from cDNA clones is reported. Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was used to direct the transcription of a complete negative-stranded genomic RNA from a cDNA clone of a VSV DI RNA in cells simultaneously expressing the five VSV proteins from separately transfected cDNA clones. The negative-stranded transcript was encapsidated with N protein, replicated by the VSV polymerase, and the replicated RNAs were assembled and budded to yield infectious DI virions. No helper VSV was required. Replication occurred at high levels and was assayed by direct biochemical means. An exact 3' terminus of the initial transcript, which was generated by autolytic cleavage using a ribozyme from hepatitis delta virus, was critical for replication."
https://openalex.org/W1975741118,"The influence of polysialic acid (PSA) on the neural cell adhesion molecule on motoneuron outgrowth and pathway formation was investigated by determining its temporal and spatial pattern of expression and by the effect that its removal had on motoneuron projection patterns. Motoneurons first expressed PSA as their growth cones began to segregate into motoneuron pool—specific groups in the plexus region; furthermore, PSA levels differed between motoneurons projecting to different targets. When PSA was removed during the period of axonal segregation in the plexus region projection errors were common. However, later removal during the process of muscle nerve formation did not result in projection errors. These results suggest that PSA modulates interactions between motoneuron axons and guidance molecules in the plexus region during axonal pathfinding."
https://openalex.org/W1553563097,"The polyphosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inactivate the actin filament-severing proteins villin and gelsolin and dissociate them from monomeric and polymeric actin. A potential polyphosphoinositide- (PPI) binding site of human plasma gelsolin regulating filament severing has been localized to the region between residues 150-169 and to the corresponding region in villin which occurs in the second of six homologous domains present in both proteins. Synthetic peptides based on these sequences bind tightly to both PIP and PIP2, in either micelles or bilayer vesicles, compete with gelsolin for binding to PPIs, and dissociate gelsolin-PIP2 complexes, restoring severing activity to the protein. These peptides also bind with moderate affinity to F-actin, suggesting that inactivation of the severing function of the intact proteins by PPIs results from competition between actin and PPIs for a critical binding site on gelsolin-villin. The PPI-binding peptides contain numerous basic amino acids, but their effects on PPIs are far greater than those of Arg or Lys oligomers, a highly basic peptide derived from the calmodulin-binding site of myristoylated, alanine-rich kinase C substrate protein, or the 5-kDa actin-binding protein thymosin beta-4, suggesting that specific aspects of the primary and secondary structure of these basic peptides are important for their interaction with the acidic headgroups of PPIs. In addition to elucidating the structure of PIP2-binding sites in gelsolin, the results describe a sensitive assay for phosphoinositide-binding molecules based on their ability to prevent inhibition of gelsolin function."
https://openalex.org/W1539862553,"The mitogenic-adipogenic activity of carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), a stable analogue of prostacyclin (PGI2), has been proposed to be related to its ability to elicit cAMP production and to activate the protein kinase A cascade (Negrel, R., Gaillard, D., and Ailhaud, G. (1989) Biochem. J. 257, 399-405). In the present study, cPGI2 has been compared with other activators of the cAMP pathway, namely isoproterenol, forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, with respect to adipose cell differentiation. Carbaprostacyclin behaved as a much more potent and efficient effector of mouse Ob1771 preadipocyte differentiation than the latter agents. Moreover, cPGI2 also exerted a specific amplifying mitogenic-adipogenic role, as compared with isoproterenol in rat as well as human adipose precursor cells in primary culture, suggesting that the prostanoid was able to generate an additional second messenger. The fact that ionomycin was able to potentiate and amplify the differentiation induced by 8-bromo-cAMP led us to give evidence, using preadipocytes preloaded with the fluorescent calcium chelator Indo-1, that cPGI2, besides its ability to activate adenyl cyclase, was also able to induce a transient increase in intracellular free calcium. This phenomenon was independent of cAMP production or inositol phospholipid breakdown and appeared to be mediated after binding to a single class of PGI2 receptor. The potential to generate simultaneously two synergistic intracellular signals allows us to ascribe to PGI2 a key and specific role in the differentiation of adipose precursor cells in vitro that would likely lead in vivo to the recruitment of dormant preadipocytes to become adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1578479843,"Plasma membranes of cultured cells contain high affinity receptors for high density lipoprotein (HDL) that appear to mediate removal of excess intracellular cholesterol. Recent studies using ligand blot analysis have identified a 110-kDa membrane protein which has features predicted for an HDL receptor, in that it preferentially binds HDL apolipoproteins and undergoes up-regulation in response to cholesterol loading of cells. In this study, we isolated a cDNA clone from an expression library using an antibody raised against partially purified 110-kDa HDL-binding protein. This clone encodes a novel cell protein, designated HBP, comprised mostly of 14 imperfect tandem repeats of approximately 70 amino acids in length. Each repeat appears to contain two amphipathic helices. Expression of HBP in cultured cells was increased severalfold when cells were loaded with cholesterol, as evident by increases in both HBP mRNA and membrane-associated protein. Overexpression of HBP in mammalian cell transfectants was associated with higher HDL binding to isolated cell protein and with modest increases in HDL binding to the cell surface. Proteins identified by ligand blot analysis had lower apparent M(r) than the primary HBP gene product and varied in M(r) and in HDL binding activity between cell types, suggesting that HBP undergoes cell-specific processing. These results provide preliminary evidence that HBP is a component of a cellular pathway that facilitates removal of excess cholesterol from cells, perhaps through its interaction with HDL. However, the predicted structure of HBP does not conform to that of any known receptor, suggesting that it does not function as a classic plasma membrane receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1511488764,"Gelatinases/type IV collagenases have been shown to be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, we examined the effect of culture medium pH on the secretion of the gelatinases from mouse B16 melanoma cell lines and human tumor cell lines using zymography analysis. The highly metastatic clone F10 of B16 melanoma did not secrete any gelatinase in neutral culture media (pH 7.1-7.3), whereas it secreted a high level of a 103-kDa gelatinase in an initial pH range of 5.4-6.1. The addition of an excess amount of glucose into a neutral culture medium also induced the gelatinase secretion from the cells by decreasing the medium pH during incubation. The extent of the acid-induced gelatinase secretion by the B16 melanoma cell lines was in the order of BL6 greater than F10 greater than F1 much greater than the parent B16 line, in good agreement with the order of their metastatic potentials. Two human cell lines (A549 and HT1080) secreted a higher level of a 90-kDa gelatinase at pH 6.8 compared with pH 7.3. The acid-induced gelatinase secretion from B16-F10 cells was blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that the enzyme induction was due to de novo synthesis. When in vitro tumor cell invasion was assayed in Boyden chambers, B16-F10 cells incubated in an acidic medium exerted a more active migration through type IV collagen gel than those in a neutral medium. These results suggest that the acidic environment formed around tumor tissues may be an important factor in invasion and metastasis of some types of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1584619663,"The envelope membrane of rat liver nuclei contains a P-type Ca(2+)-transporting pump, revealed by the presence of a Ca(2+)-stimulated phosphoenzyme. The level of the nuclear phosphoenzyme in autoradiographed polyacrylamide gels was decreased by lanthanum, as typically observed in the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump. It was also decreased by thapsigargin and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone, two accepted inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. Comparative proteolysis of the phosphorylated enzyme of liver microsomes (endoplasmic reticulum) and nuclear membranes revealed an identical cleavage pattern. In addition, antibodies raised against the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump cross-reacted with the pump in the nuclear membranes. The findings show that nuclear membranes contain a Ca(2+)-transporting pump closely related to that of the endoplasmic reticulum, if not identical to it. The pump is likely to be involved in the control of nuclear free calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1525266792,"Protein kinase C (PKC) exhibits both negative and positive cross-talk with multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) in PC12 cells. PKC effects negative cross-talk by inhibiting the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. In the absence of cross-talk, Ca2+ influx induced by depolarization with 56 mM K+ stimulates CaM kinase and its autophosphorylation and converts up to 50% of the enzyme to a Ca(2+)-independent or autonomous species. Acute treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) elicits a parallel reduction in depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx and in generation of autonomous CaM kinase. Negative cross-talk also occurs during stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol signaling system with bradykinin, which activates both PKC and CaM kinase. The extent of CaM kinase activation is attenuated by the simultaneous activation of PKC; it is enhanced by prior down-regulation of PKC. PKC also exhibits positive cross-talk with CaM kinase. Submaximal activation of CaM kinase by ionomycin is potentiated by concurrent activation of PKC with PMA. Such PMA treatment is found to increase the level of cytosolic calmodulin. Enhanced activation of CaM kinase by PKC may result from PKC-mediated phosphorylation of calmodulin-binding proteins, such as neuromodulin and MARCKS, and the subsequent increase in the availability of previously bound calmodulin for activation of CaM kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1548573008,"There are 9 cysteine residues in the rat m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) that are conserved among all five mammalian mAChR subtypes sequenced to date. To study the role of these cysteines in rat m1 mAChR function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert each Cys residue to Ser, and the mutant receptor genes were transfected into mAChR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Substitution of Cys391 (extracellular loop III) or Cys421 and Cys435 (carboxyl terminus) produces receptors with wild type phenotype. Cells transfected with Ser98 or Ser178 (extracellular loops I and II, respectively) receptor genes display no carbachol-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI), and membranes prepared from these cells do not bind the muscarinic antagonist [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate, even though the cells express transcripts of the m1 mAChR as determined by RNA hybridization analysis. Since biochemical evidence suggests that these cysteines form a disulfide bridge (Curtis, C. A. M., Wheatley, M., Bansal, S., Birdsall, N. J. M., Eveleigh, P., Pedder, E. K., Poyner, D., and Hulme, E. C. (1989) 264, 489-495), our findings imply that this disulfide linkage may be critical for formation of the ligand binding domain or for proper protein folding. The Ser394 mAChR (extracellular loop III) exhibits a 44% decrease in efficacy for carbachol-mediated stimulation of PI hydrolysis relative to the wild type receptor, but displays normal ligand binding affinities. The Ser407 m1 mAChR (transmembrane helix VII) displays a decreased efficacy for eliciting carbachol-mediated PI hydrolysis (39% that of CHO cells transfected with the wild type receptor) and a 4-fold shift to the right in the carbachol dose-response curve, which is consistent with the 4-fold decrease in carbachol affinity at the Ser407 m1 mAChR. In contrast, the Ser417 m1 mAChR (transmembrane helix VII) displays an increase in carbachol affinity and a shift to the left in the carbachol dose-response curve for PI hydrolysis. These findings suggest that cysteine residues in the seventh transmembrane helix of the m1 mAChR may influence agonist binding and the efficiency of receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1548790826,"Escherichia coli contains a soluble, [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin of unknown function (Knoell, H.-E., and Knappe, J. (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 50, 245-252). Using antiserum to the purified protein to screen E. coli genomic expression libraries, we have cloned a gene (designated fdx) encoding this protein. The DNA sequence of the gene predicts a polypeptide of 110 residues after removal of the initiator methionine (polypeptide M(r) = 12,186, holoprotein M(r) = 12,358). The deduced amino acid sequence is strikingly similar to those of the ferredoxins found in animal mitochondria which function with cytochrome P450 enzymes and to the ferredoxin from Pseudomonas putida which functions with P450cam. The overall sequence identity is approximately 36% when compared with human mitochondrial and P. putida ferredoxins, and the identities include 4 cysteine residues proposed to coordinate the iron cluster. The protein was overproduced approximately 500-fold using an expression plasmid, and the holoprotein was assembled and accumulated in amounts exceeding 30% of the total cell protein. The overexpressed ferredoxin exhibits absorption, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra closely resembling those of the animal ferredoxins and P. putida ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2092992236,"Modulation of synaptic efficacy may depend on the temporal correlation between pre- and postsynaptic activities. At isolated neuromuscular synapses in culture, repetitive postsynaptic application of acetylcholine pulses alone or in the presence of asynchronous presynaptic activity resulted in immediate and persistent synaptic depression, whereas synchronous pre- and postsynaptic coactivation had no effect. This synaptic depression was a result of a reduction of evoked transmitter release, but induction of the depression requires a rise in postsynaptic cytosolic calcium concentration. Thus, Hebbian modulation operates at isolated peripheral synapses in vitro, and transsynaptic retrograde interaction appears to be an underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1486152838,"The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of the newly identified cytokine receptor superfamily. A common sequence motif, Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser (WSXWS), near the transmembrane domain is highly conserved in this family. To determine the function of this motif, we constructed deletion and insertion mutations in this part of the EPOR and introduced them into an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic Ba/F3 cell line. Cells expressing the wild-type EPOR displayed 1,500 erythropoietin (EPO)-binding sites/cell with a single affinity of about 300 pM and proliferate in the presence of IL-3 or EPO. Ba/F3 cells expressing receptors mutated in the WSXWS motif displayed little EPO binding on the cell surface and did not grow in the presence of EPO. The mutant receptors were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, were unable to bind EPO. A single Gly insertion between the two WS sequences caused defects in receptor structure and function similar to mutations lacking all or part of the WSXWS motif. The EPOR can be activated, resulting in proliferation independent of EPO either by an Arg129 to Cys point mutation or by association with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) envelope glycoprotein gp55. Introduction of the point mutation (Arg129 to Cys) did not activate any of the receptors mutated in the WSXWS motif. Moreover, gp55 did not activate the mutant receptors in Ba/F3 cells. Our study indicates that the WSXWS motif is critical for protein folding, ligand-binding, and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1995548577,We have used cloned T cell receptor (TCR) genes from closely related CD4 T cell lines to probe the interaction of the TCR with several specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II ligands. Complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) equivalents of both alpha and beta TCR chains are required for antigen-MHC recognition. Our data provide novel information about the rotational orientation of TCR-MHC contacts in that exchange of the amino terminal portion of the TCR alpha chain containing the putative CDR1 and CDR2 regions results in both gain and loss of MHC class II specificity by the resulting receptor. These two TCRs differ primarily in recognition of polymorphisms in the second hypervariable region of the MHC class II alpha chain. These results document the involvement of CDR1 and/or CDR2 of the TCR alpha chain in MHC recognition and suggest a rotational orientation of this TCR to its MHC ligand.
https://openalex.org/W1537518949,"It was shown that Tn551 inactivation of two chromosomal (so-called auxiliary) loci other than the mec gene result in a dramatic reduction of methicillin resistance and decreased cell wall turnover and autolytic capacity in a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (de Jonge, B. L. M., de Lencastre, H., and Tomasz, A. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 173, 1105-1110). To understand the mechanistic basis of these phenomena we have examined the status of the autolytic enzymes and the muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectral analyses. While no differences could be detected in the number of autolytic hydrolases, the mutants showed major changes in peptidoglycan composition. Nine prominent muropeptides of the parental strain each carrying a pentaglycyl substituent were missing from the cell wall of one group of mutants. The second mutant lacked four parental muropeptides which were composed of the unsubstituted disaccharide pentapeptide and its alanyl-tetraglycine derivative. The auxiliary genes are genetic determinants involved with the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors, the presence of which in the cell wall may be needed for optimal cell wall turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1515638863,"The amino-terminal sequence of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans Fe(II) oxidase (linked to cytochrome c552) was determined, and the iro gene that encodes this enzyme was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotides as a probe. The DNA sequence of a region (856 base pairs) which encompasses the iro gene revealed that the enzyme was encoded by a 273-base pair open reading frame and consists of 90 amino acids, including a possible 37-residue signal sequence. The iro gene seems to be transcribed independently of any other gene because the transcriptional products are 0.45 and 0.6 kilobases in size. Current protein databases revealed that the iro gene product is a new member of the high redox potential iron sulfur proteins, which generally function in electron transport but do not show enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1540022066,"Endothelins may be important regulators of renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) function. These peptides are secreted in large amounts by IMCD cells and can, in turn, potently inhibit sodium and water transport systems in the IMCD. This study characterized endothelin (ET) receptors in the IMCD in order to gain insight into this unique renal autocrine system. Radioligand binding studies with 125I-ET-1 yielded a B(max) of 205.7 fmol/mg and a KD of 218 pM for ET-1. Similar studies with 125I-ET-3 yielded two populations of receptors for ET-3, one with a KD of 50 pM and one with a KD of 920 pM. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of IMCD cells covalently labeling with 125I-ET-1 yielded two bands, one at 97 kDa with affinities of ET-1 greater than ET-2 much greater than ET-3 and one at 47 kDa with affinities ET-1 greater than or equal to ET-2 = ET-3. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of both endothelin receptor types A and B. These data indicate that IMCD cells have high affinity, high density receptors for endothelin and express both known types of endothelin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1578409740,"DNA fragments containing structural characteristics found in Ser/Thr protein phosphatases were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genome. Amplification was carried out by using degenerate oligonucleotides encoding conserved sequences found in type 1, 2A, and 2B phosphatases. A 215-base pair amplification fragment was used to screen a size-selected library, and a positive clone was isolated and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing revealed a 2076-base pair open reading frame encoding a 692-amino acid protein. The carboxyl half of the protein is structurally related to type 1 phosphatases and virtually identical with the sequence reported as PPZ1, whereas the amino-terminal half of the protein is unrelated to sequences found in other protein phosphatases. This region is very rich in Ser residues and presents a high number of basic amino acids. Therefore, the gene product, on the basis of its unique structure, would represent a novel class of protein phosphatase. The gene, which is located at chromosome XIII, is transcribed as a mRNA of about 2.7 kilobases, and the amount of message has been found to increase 3- to 4-fold during the culture. The product of the gene PPZ1 was identified by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts as a 75-kDa protein, and the amount of immunoreactive protein was increased in cells carrying multiple copies of the gene. Disruption of the gene resulted in viable cells, with no detectable phenotypic change, indicating that the gene is not essential for growth."
https://openalex.org/W1631147118,"Abstract The letA (ccdA) and letD (ccdB) genes of F plasmid contribute to stable maintenance of the plasmid in Escherichia coli cells; a product of the latter has a lethal effect on the host cell and that of the former neutralizes functions of the letD. In cells that overproduce the LetD (CcdB) protein, the plasmid DNA is extensively relaxed. Correspondingly, DNA supercoiling activity in a cell-free extract of the overproducing strain decreases to a level of less than 1% of that seen in normal cells. However, the extract does not inhibit DNA reconstituted from purified subunits, thereby indicating that the intrinsic DNA is in the overproducing strain. Upon addition of purified LetA (CcdA) protein to the extract of LetD overproducing cells, the DNA supercoiling activity was fully restored. Using this rejuvenation as an assay, we purified the inactivated gyrase and obtained evidence that the LetD protein formed an isolable complex with the A subunit of DNA gyrase. Thus, the LetD and the LetA proteins constitute an opposing pair in modulating the DNA supercoiling activity of gyrase, probably by direct interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2094692189,"The mechanism by which DNA helicases unwind DNA was tested; an ""unwinding complex"" between the SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen) and a DNA molecule designed to resemble a replication fork was probed. In an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—dependent reaction, T antigen quantitatively recognized this synthetic replication fork and bound the DNA primarily as a hexamer. The T antigen bound only one of the two strands at the fork, an asymmetric interaction consistent with the 3′ → 5′ directionality of the DNA helicase activity of T antigen. Binding to chemically modified DNA substrates indicated that the DNA helicase recognized the DNA primarily through the sugar-phosphate backbone. Ethylation of six top strand phosphates at the junction of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA inhibited the DNA helicase activity of T antigen. Neither a 3′ single-stranded end on the DNA substrate nor ATP hydrolysis was required for T antigen to bind the replication fork. These data suggest that T antigen can directly bind the replication fork through recognition of a fork-specific structure."
https://openalex.org/W1523503670,"Peptide G25 (KKAVKVPKKEKSVLQGKLTRLAVQI) representing the putative lipid-binding region (G region) of the erythrocyte Ca2+ pump was synthesized. This peptide interacted with acidic lipids, as shown by the increase in size of phosphatidylserine liposomes in its presence. This lipid interaction is consistent with the previous evidence suggesting that the portion of the pump from which this peptide was taken is responsible for the activation of the pump by acidic lipid. G25 also bound to calmodulin, as was shown by its cause of a shift in the fluorescence of 5-dimethylamino naphthalene-1-sulfonyl- (dansyl)-calmodulin, and by its competition with Ca2+ pump for calmodulin. Its Kd for dansyl-calmodulin was much higher (0.8 microM) than that of the peptides representing the primary calmodulin-binding region (C region) of the Ca2+ pump. Although the presence of the G region provided the possibility of a second calmodulin-binding site, activation of the pump by calmodulin always could be fitted by simple saturation kinetics. The calmodulin-binding peptide from the C region of the pump, C28R2, also interacted with lipid with even greater effectiveness than G25. When the C region of the pump was saturated with calmodulin, acidic lipid activation of the pump followed simple saturation kinetics. However, when calmodulin was omitted, a higher concentration of lipid was needed for saturation and the kinetics became complex. The data are consistent with the idea that calmodulin activates the pump only by interaction at the C region, but that acidic lipid activates by interaction at both of the C and G regions."
https://openalex.org/W1487111992,"The present study characterizes the serial reactions of H2O2 with compounds I and II of lignin peroxidase isozyme H1. These two reactions constitute part of the pathway leading to formation of the oxy complex (compound III) from the ferric enzyme. Compounds II and III are the only complexes observed; no compound III* is observed. Compound III* is proposed to be an adduct of compound III with H2O2, formed from the complexation of compound III with H2O2 (Wariishi, H., and Gold, M. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2070-2077). We provide evidence that demonstrates that the spectral data, on which the formation of compound III* is based, are merely an artifact caused by enzyme instability and, therefore, rule out the existence of compound III*. The reactions of compounds II and III with H2O2 are pH-dependent, similar to that observed for reactions of compounds I and II with the reducing substrate veratryl alcohol. The spontaneous decay of the compound III of lignin peroxidase results in the reduction of ferric cytochrome c. The reduction is inhibited by superoxide dismutase, indicating that superoxide is released during the decay. Therefore, the lignin peroxidase compound III decays to the ferric enzyme through the dissociation of superoxide. This mechanism is identical with that observed with oxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin but different from that for horseradish peroxidase. Compound III is capable of reacting with small molecules, such as tetranitromethane (a superoxide scavenger) and fluoride (a ligand for the ferric enzyme), resulting in ferric enzyme and fluoride complex formation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1504901470,"Glutamate receptors and protein kinase C (PKC) may play significant roles in long-term potentiation in hippocampus. To clarify the regulatory involvement of PKC in the functions of glutamate receptors, we examined the effects of PKC activation on current response induced by the activation of each subtype of glutamate receptor in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain RNA. Treatment with the PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), potentiated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current by about 2.5-fold, although it did not affect kainate-induced current at all. Quisqualate-mediated oscillatory current was almost abolished by this treatment. The TPA-induced potentiation of NMDA current was suppressed by staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases. Pretreatment with 4-O-methyl-TPA, an inactive phorbol ester, had no effect on NMDA current. Current response mediated by NMDA receptors would thus appear to be modulated by PKC."

In this study, recombinant p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and fusion proteins containing various subdomains were used to investigate the association of p85 with the IGF-I receptor and to demonstrate that p85 is a direct in vitro substrate of the IGF-I receptor kinase. Solubilized IGF-I receptor was immobilized on antireceptor antibody-agarose beads. Following in vitro receptor phosphorylation and incubation with cell lysate, immobilized receptor became associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and with protein bands with molecular masses of 85 and 110 kDa, which correspond to the known molecular masses of the subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These associations were inhibited by the addition of recombinant intact p85 or SH2-containing fusion proteins, but not by fusion proteins containing its SH3 domain or breakpoint cluster homology region. A fusion protein containing the SH2 domains of Ras GTPase-activating protein also inhibited the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity with immobilized IGF-I receptor, although less effectively than p85, whereas a similar construct containing the SH2 domain of pp60src was without effect. When immobilized phosphorylated IGF-I receptor was incubated with intact p85 or the SH2-containing fusion proteins, it became associated with and phosphorylated these proteins. These results demonstrate that at least in vitro, a tight association occurs between phosphorylated IGF-I receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that the region of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that contains its SH2 domains is directly involved in this association, and that this region is a direct substrate for IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, these results suggest that Ras GTPase-activating protein can also interact with the IGF-I receptor and that different SH2 domain-containing proteins interact with the IGF-I receptor with widely differing affinities."
https://openalex.org/W2133103707,"We have examined the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) on mitogen-stimulated growth and on c-myc proto-oncogene expression in a keratinocyte model of tumor progression. A dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was demonstrated in both established (HPK1A) and malignant (HPK1A-ras) cells. However, this inhibition was observed with the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 at a higher concentration in HPK1A-ras cells than in HPK1A cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed a blockage of the normal progression of the cell cycle from G0 to S phase in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. A higher concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was required in HPK1A-ras cells to overcome the mitogen-stimulated progression into S phase, when compared with HPK1A cells. Analysis of c-myc messenger RNA revealed a strong inhibition of its expression at early time points with higher concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3 being required to obtain an inhibition in HPK1A-ras cells similar to that obtained in HPK1A cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor characterization by sucrose gradient analysis and equilibrium binding demonstrated the presence of a single 3.7 S protein with similar receptor numbers and affinity in both cell lines. These observations therefore demonstrate that an alteration of the growth inhibitory response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 occurs when keratinocytes acquire the malignant phenotype and suggest that the alteration lies beyond the interaction of the ligand with its receptor. In addition, relative resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D3 was also observed in the expression of the cell-cycle associated oncogene c-myc. These studies may therefore have important implications in vivo in the development and growth of epithelial cell cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1551952843,"Abstract Binding of the Escherichia coli Tus protein to its cognate nonpalindromic binding site on duplex DNA (a Ter sequence) is sufficient to arrest the progression of replication forks in a Ter orientation-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. In order to probe the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we have used a strand displacement assay to investigate the effect of Tus on the DNA helicase activities of DnaB, PriA, UvrD (helicase II), and the phi X-type primosome. When the substrate was a short oligomer hybridized to a circular single-stranded DNA, strand displacement by DnaB, PriA, and the primosome (in both directions), but not UvrD, was blocked by Tus in a polar fashion. However, no inhibition of either DnaB or UvrD was observed when the substrate carried an elongated duplex region. With this elongated substrate, PriA helicase activity was only inhibited partially (by 50%). On the other hand, both the 5'----3' and 3'----5' helicase activities of the primosome were inhibited almost completely by Tus with the elongated substrate. These results suggest that while Tus can inhibit the translocation of some proteins along single-stranded DNA in a polar fashion, this generalized effect is insufficient for the inhibition of bona fide DNA helicase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1508552527,"Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II is capable of joining phi X174 (+) strand DNA that it has cleaved to duplex oligonucleotide acceptor molecules by an intermolecular ligation reaction (Gale, K. C. and Osheroff, N. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 9538-9545). In order to investigate potential mechanisms for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA recombination, this intrinsic enzyme activity was further characterized. Intermolecular DNA ligation proceeded in a time-dependent fashion and was concentration-dependent with respect to oligonucleotide. The covalent linkage between phi X174 (+) strand DNA and acceptor molecules was confirmed by Southern analysis and alkaline gel electrophoresis. Topoisomerase II-mediated intermolecular DNA ligation required the oligonucleotide to contain a 3'-OH terminus. Moreover, the reaction was dependent on the presence of a divalent cation, was inhibited by salt, and was not affected by the presence of ATP. The enzyme was capable of ligating phi X174 (+) strand DNA to double-stranded oligonucleotides that contained 5'-overhang, 3'-overhand, or blunt ends. Single-stranded, nicked, or gapped oligonucleotides also could be used as acceptor molecules. These results demonstrate that the type II enzyme has an intrinsic ability to mediate illegitimate DNA recombination in vitro and suggests possible roles for topoisomerase II in nucleic acid recombination in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1571113921,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a dimeric factor stabilized by disulfide bonds. Using an approach involving partial reduction of PDGF, we have identified the 2nd and 4th cysteine residues in the PDGF chains as the cysteine residues forming interchain disulfide bonds. Analysis of PDGF mutants in which the 2nd and 4th cysteine residues were mutated to serine residues revealed that the disulfide bonds are arranged in a cross-wise manner, with the 2nd cysteine residue in one chain being linked to the 4th cysteine residue in the other. A PDGF B-chain mutant, in which both the 2nd and 4th cysteine residues were substituted with serine residues, migrated as a monomer in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and retained receptor binding activity. When analyzed in receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation assays, this mutant showed agonistic activity. Thus, structural information has been obtained that will allow the large scale production of properly folded monomeric PDGF, as well as design of specific PDGF heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W1515208555,"Endo-alpha-D-mannosidase, a Golgi-situated processing enzyme, provides a glucosidase-independent pathway for the formation of complex N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins (Moore, S. E. H., and Spiro, R. G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13104-13112). The present report demonstrates that at least five distinct glycoproteins secreted by HepG2 cells (alpha 1-antitrypsin, transferrin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-fetoprotein) as well as cell surface components can effectively utilize this alternate processing route. During a castanospermine (CST)-imposed glucosidase blockade, these glycoproteins apparently were produced with their usual complement of complex carbohydrate units, and upon addition of the mannosidase I inhibitor, 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ), to prevent further processing of deglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides, Man6-8GlcNAc, but not Man9GlcNAc, were identified; the Man8GlcNAc component occurred as the characteristic isomer generated by endomannosidase cleavage. Although the endomannosidase-mediated deglucosylation pathway appeared to be nonselective, a differential inhibitory effect on the secretion of the various glycoproteins was noted in the presence of CST which was directly related to the number of their N-linked oligosaccharides, ranging from minimal in alpha-fetoprotein to substantial (approximately 65%) in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Addition of DMJ to CST-incubated cells did not further decrease secretion of the glycoproteins, although processing was now arrested at the polymannose stage, and a portion of the oligosaccharides were still in the glucosylated form. These latter findings indicate that complex carbohydrate units are not required for secretion of these glycoproteins and that any effect which glucose residues exert on their intracellular transit would be related to movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1529950285,"A variety of model presecretory proteins, proOmpF-Lpps, possessing different numbers of lysine residues (0, 2, and 4) as positively charged amino acid residues and different numbers of leucine residues (7, 8, and 9) as hydrophobic amino acid residues in their signal peptides were constructed. The effect of positive charges on the in vitro translocation efficiency markedly differed with the number of leucine residues. Positive charges were strongly required for translocation when the hydrophobic region comprised 7 or 8 leucine residues, whereas the translocation of proOmpF-Lpps possessing 9 leucine residues took place efficiently even in the absence of positive charges and the introduction of positive charges did not significantly enhance the translocation efficiency. The translocation of all the proOmpF-Lpps, including one possessing no positive charge, was ATP-, protonmotive force-, and SecA-dependent and accompanied by signal peptide cleavage, indicating that they are translocated via the usual secretory pathway. It is likely that the requirement of positive charges can be compensated for by a longer hydrophobic stretch in the functioning of the signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1548006851,"In order to determine whether distinct platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (alpha and beta) can modulate the activity of one another, PDGF isoform (AA, BB, and AB)-stimulated changes in Ca2+i were monitored by digitized video microscopy in single cells upon sequential addition of PDGF isoforms. In Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, all PDGF isoforms were capable of stimulating increases in Ca2+i of 200-600% above basal levels, although with different potencies: BB greater than or equal to AB greater than AA. All cells were BB-PDGF-responsive, but only 74% of cells examined responded to AA-PDGF. The Ca2+i response elicited by BB-PDGF was inhibited by 60-75% in cells stimulated 10 min earlier with the AA isoform. The half-life of this inhibition was 22 min. In cells in which the alpha receptor was down-regulated by prolonged incubation with AA-PDGF, BB-induced Ca2+i responses were not inhibited. Pretreatment of cells with phorbol ester did not inhibit BB-PDGF-induced increases in Ca2+i, yet down-regulation of PKC activity prevented the AA-PDGF inhibition of BB-PDGF-induced Ca2+i responses. An increase in Ca2+i induced by AlF(4-)-stimulated IP3 generation did not inhibit a subsequent BB-PDGF Ca2+i response; however, attenuation of AA-PDGF-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx with EGTA prevented the inhibition of BB-PDGF-induced Ca2+i increases. Readdition of Ca2+ to the medium after removal of EGTA restored the inhibition of the BB-PDGF Ca2+i response. The inhibition of the BB-PDGF Ca2+i response by AA-PDGF was not caused by inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation, which was unchanged after pretreatment with AA-PDGF. These results demonstrate: (a) that only a subpopulation of cells possess a functional alpha receptor-mediated response as assessed by AA-PDGF-induced increases in Ca2+i, whereas all cells possess the beta receptor-mediated responses; and (b) AA-PDGF and its associated alpha receptor can modulate the activity of the beta receptor through a mechanism that is dependent upon Ca(2+)-influx which may be controlled in part by PKC activation."
https://openalex.org/W1543964313,"Diethylstilbestrol is a potent inhibitory agent of the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Other structurally related molecules, such as dienestrol or hexestrol having hydroxyl groups at para positions of the two benzene rings produce similar effects. The absence or derivatization of the hydroxyl groups as occurs with trans-stilbene or diethylstilbestrol dipropionate converts the structure in an activating agent of the enzyme. The Ca2+ transport profiles in the presence of the referred drugs reproduces the same behavior observed for the hydrolytic activity. There is also a clear indication of a membrane-mediated mechanism of these drugs. Ligand binding experiments at equilibrium indicate that diethylstilbestrol decreases the affinity for Ca2+ of the high affinity Ca2+ sites. Functional studies reveal that the activation/inhibition induced by these drugs is correlated with decreased levels of phosphoenzyme at steady state, and these levels are sensitive to the Ca2+ concentration. Chase experiments of [32P]phosphoenzyme and 45Ca2+ indicate a slight activation effect of diethylstilbestrol dipropionate on Ca2+ dissociation during the enzyme turnover. The use of different anthroyloxy derivatives of stearic acid as a fluorescent probe suggest that diethylstilbestrol and other inhibitory agents could be located close to the polar region of the lipid bilayer, which interferes with the Ca(2+)-binding sites, whereas the activators trans-stilbene and diethylstilbestrol dipropionate may have a deeper position into the membrane, which accelerates the Ca2+ translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W1482375857,"Human HPTP beta, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and leukocyte common antigen-related molecule (LAR) are transmembrane receptor-like proteins whose cytoplasmic regions contain either one (HPTP beta) or two (LCA and LAR) domains that are homologous to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). Whereas the membrane-proximal domain 1 has enzymatic activity, the membrane-distal domain 2 of both LCA and LAR has no detectable catalytic activity. The cytoplasmic regions of HPTP beta, LCA, and LAR were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 90% purity. Modulatory effects of various low molecular weight compounds and homo- and copolymers of amino acids were examined. Several polypeptides that contain a high proportion of tyrosine were strongly inhibitory to these PTPases. To determine a possible role for the LAR domain 2, the properties of recombinant LAR PTPases containing both domains 1 and 2 (LAR-D1D2) or only domain 1 (LAR-D1) were compared. In nearly all aspects examined, LAR-D1 and LAR-D1D2 were indistinguishable. However, polycationic polypeptides strongly stimulated the PTPase activity of LAR-D1D2, but not LAR-D1, using the peptide substrate Raytide. Thus, basic polypeptides seem to indirectly alter the catalytic activity of domain 1 by interacting with domain 2. This result suggests that domain 2 has a regulatory function."

DNA topoisomerase I phosphorylation was stimulated 4-fold by 2 h of TPA treatment (TPA at 100 ng/ml maximally enhanced phosphorylation). Purified DNA topoisomerase I was phosphorylated in vitro in a Ca2+ and phospholipid-dependent fashion by types I, II, and III protein kinase C. The phosphorylation reaction was stimulated by TPA and had an apparent K(m) of 0.4 microM. DNA topoisomerase I was phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro predominantly at serine. The major tryptic phosphopeptides from DNA topoisomerase I in TPA-treated fibroblasts and phosphorylated by protein kinase C comigrated in thin-layer electrophoresis. The half-life of incorporated phosphate on DNA topoisomerase I was 40 min in both TPA-treated and control cells. These results suggest that phosphorylation is a mechanism for activating DNA topoisomerase I in fibroblasts treated with TPA and that protein kinase C functions in the phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1607686789,"The potential contribution of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases in the transcriptional regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor gene expression was explored in human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and U-937 monocyte-like cells using okadaic acid, a potent and specific inhibitor of phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A). In both cell types okadaic acid induced plasminogen activator type 2 (PAI-2) gene transcription and mRNA and potentiated induction mediated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and tumor necrosis factor. Okadaic acid-mediated induction of PAI-2 was inhibited by 8-bromo-cAMP in HT-1080 cells but not in U-937 cells. Okadaic acid had opposite effects on urokinase (u-PA) gene expression in the two cell lines; u-PA mRNA and gene transcription was suppressed in HT-1080 cells but transiently induced in U-937 cells. Tissue-type PA (t-PA) mRNA, although undetectable in U-937 cells, was also suppressed by okadaic acid in HT-1080 cells. This effect was selective, as constitutive and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-mediated expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 mRNA was not modulated by okadaic acid in either cell type. These results indicate that PP1 and PP2A protein phosphatases are involved in signal transduction pathways modulating PAI-2, u-PA, and t-PA, and furthermore, that okadaic acid interaction with the protein kinase C and A pathways are gene- and cell type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1572644512,"Subtypes of insulin-growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors, including hybrid receptors containing insulin receptor alpha beta dimers associated with IGF-I receptor alpha beta dimers, have been described in a number of systems. The molecular basis of the multiple subtypes and their functional significance is not understood. Ligand-dependent phosphorylation of insulin and IGF-I receptors and immunoprecipitation with antipeptide and monoclonal antibodies have been used to characterize the subpopulations of these receptors in the human KB cell line. IGF-I receptors exhibit beta subunits of 95 and 102 kDa in these cells. IGF-I receptors containing 102-kDa beta subunits are immunoprecipitated by the IGF-I receptor-specific antibody alpha-IR3. Antibody alpha-IR3 does not appear to recognize a hybrid receptor in these cells. However, an antipeptide antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain of the insulin receptor (AbP5) immunoprecipitates a population of receptors phosphorylated in response to IGF-I (1 nM) which contains both 95- and 102-kDa beta subunits. These receptors must be hybrid complexes because AbP5 does not recognize the 102-kDa beta subunit directly. The inability of antibody alpha-IR3 to recognize these complexes suggests that their IGF-I receptor alpha subunits must differ from typical IGF-I receptor alpha subunits either in primary sequence or conformation. Therefore, KB cells may contain more than one type of IGF-I receptor alpha subunit. Hybrid IGF-I receptors can also be distinguished from homotypic IGF-I receptors by their responsiveness to IGF-II. Stimulation of autophosphorylation in hybrid IGF-I receptors by IGF-I is 3-4-fold greater than that seen in response to IGF-II. In contrast, IGF-I and IGF-II are nearly equipotent in stimulating autophosphorylation in the alpha-IR3-reactive receptor population. This suggests the existence of functionally distinct receptor subtypes which may differ in their ability to mediate the biological effects of IGF-II."
https://openalex.org/W1481116541,"Actinomycin synthetase I was purified to homogeneiety from actinomycin-producing Streptomyces chrysomallus. The purified enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of M(r) 45,000. It catalyzes the formation of the adenylate of 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-MHA) from the free acid and ATP in an equilibrium reaction. 4-MHA is the precursor of the chromophoric part of actinomycin. By using the 4-MHA analogue, 4-methyl-3-hydroxybenzoic acid, as a model substrate it could be established that the equilibrium constant Keq is independent on enzyme concentration, which suggests that no stoichiometric acyladenylate-enzyme complex is formed in contrast to observations made with aminoacyl adenylates formed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases or multifunctional peptide synthetases. Actinomycin synthetase I does not charge itself with substrate carboxylic acid via a covalent thioester bond as is usual for amino acid activation in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. In addition, the enzyme does not act as an acyl-coenzyme A ligase as revealed by its inability to release AMP in the presence of 4-MHA or other structurally related aromatic carboxylic acids, coenzyme A and ATP. Additional analysis of the activation reaction showed that it is exothermic, whereas the free enthalpy change delta G0 is positive due to a negative entropy change indicating a strong influence of restriction of random motion on the course of the reaction. Determinations of Km and kcat of various substrate carboxylic acids revealed the highest kcat/Km ratio for the natural substrate 4-MHA. From these properties, actinomycin synthetase I represents the prototype of novel chromophore activating enzymes involved in non-ribosomal synthesis of chromopeptide lactones in streptomycetes."
https://openalex.org/W1547416252,"Synapsin I is a synaptic vesicle-specific phosphoprotein which is able to bind and bundle actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. In the present paper we have analyzed the effects of synapsin I on the kinetics of actin polymerization and their modulation by site-specific phosphorylation of synapsin I. We found that dephosphorylated synapsin I accelerates the initial rate of actin polymerization and decreases the rate of filament elongation. The effect was observed at both low and high ionic strength, was specific for synapsin I, and was still present when polymerization was triggered by F-actin seeds. Dephosphorylated synapsin I was also able to induce actin polymerization and bundle formation in the absence of KCl and MgCl2. The effects of synapsin I were strongly decreased after its phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. These observations suggest that synapsin I has a phosphorylation-dependent nucleating effect on actin polymerization. The data are compatible with the view that changes in the phosphorylation state of synapsin I play a functional role in regulating the interactions between the nerve terminal cytoskeleton and synaptic vesicles in various stages of the exoendocytotic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1538009260,"13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to study triglyceride metabolism in 3T3-L1 cells incubated with [1-13/14C] acetate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, or oleate. Labeled cells embedded in agarose filaments were perfused in a specially fitted NMR tube within the spectrometer magnet. Incubation of 3T3-L1 cells with a specific fatty acid enriched the cellular triglycerides with that fatty acid; the NMR signal observed in the carbonyl region of the cell spectrum was due in large part to that fatty acid. NMR data demonstrated that cellular enzymes preferentially esterified saturated fatty acids at the glyceride sn-1,3 position and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position. cellular triglyceride hydrolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase was monitored by measuring the decrease in the integrated intensities of resonances arising from fatty acyl carbonyls esterified at glycerol carbons sn-1,3 and sn-2. Under basal conditions, the time courses were first-order, and the average rates were 0.14% of signal/min at both carbonyl positions. Under isoproterenol stimulated conditions, these rates were still first-order and increased 6.4-fold at the sn-1,3 position and 2.4-fold at the sn-2 position. The observation that the hydrolysis time courses were first-order suggested that only a small amount of cellular triglyceride was available to hormone-sensitive lipase, supporting the view that lipolytic enzymes operate at lipid surfaces where only small amounts of neutral lipid may be soluble. Attempts to correlate the measured rates with the rates of hydrolysis at the sn-1,3 and sn-2 positions were hindered by the fact that the chemical shifts of the carbonyl carbons of the diglyceride hydrolysis product did not overlie those of the triglyceride. Analysis of hydrolysis kinetics revealed that hormone-sensitive lipase exhibited little preference for a particular esterified fatty acid under basal conditions; however, under stimulated conditions, the enzyme exhibited a preference for certain triglyceride species."
https://openalex.org/W1480254681,"Abstract A spin-labeled photoaffinity ATP analog, 2-N3-2',3'-SL-ATP (2-N3-SL-ATP) was specifically loaded at catalytic (exchangeable) or noncatalytic (nonexchangeable) nucleotide-binding sites on nucleotide-depleted mitochondrial F1-ATPase. Photolysis of the enzyme complexes resulted in the specific modification of beta-Tyr-345 when the catalytic sites were occupied and beta-Tyr-368 when noncatalytic sites were filled. These are the same amino acid assignments that were made previously using 2-N3ATP. The results demonstrate that the attachment of a spin label moiety to the ribose ring does not prevent proper binding of the analog at both types of nucleotide sites on F1-ATPase and suggest that the probe can be used for investigations of the nucleotide-binding sites using ESR spectroscopy. Enzyme that is in complex with the 2-N3-SL-ATP exhibits an ESR spectrum that is typical for highly immobilized nitroxyl radicals both in the dark or after photolysis. Additional peaks in the high- and low-field regions arise due to dipolar spin interactions most likely involving a pair of catalytic and noncatalytic sites. The two sites are calculated to be approximately 15 A apart. This distance, obtained through ESR spectroscopy, combined with the finding that the 2 labeled amino acids are only 23 residues apart from each other, further supports an adenylate kinase-like arrangement of nucleotide binding sites on F1-ATPase where catalytic and noncatalytic sites are in close proximity (Vogel, P. D., and Cross, R. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6101-6105)."

The transferase phosphorylated the lysosomal enzymes uteroferrin and cathepsin D 3-90-fold better than nonlysosomal glycoproteins and 16-83-fold better than a Man9GlcNAc oligosaccharide. Deglycosylated uteroferrin was a potent competitive inhibitor of the phosphorylation of intact uteroferrin (Ki of 48 microM) but did not inhibit the phosphorylation of RNase B or the simple sugar alpha-methylmannoside. Deglycosylated RNase (RNase A) did not inhibit the phosphorylation of RNase B or uteroferrin. These results indicate that purified amoeba GlcNAc-phosphotransferase recognizes a protein domain present on lysosomal enzymes but absent in most nonlysosomal glycoproteins. The transferase also exhibited a marked preference for oligosaccharides containing mannose alpha 1,2-mannose sequences, but this cannot account for the high affinity binding to lysosomal enzymes. A. castellanii extracts do not contain detectable levels of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, the second enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker. We conclude that A. castellanii does not utilize the phosphomannosyl sorting pathway despite expression of very high levels of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1487103001,"We used a combination of subcellular fractionation and lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination to examine the polypeptide compositions of three hepatocyte endocytic compartments: early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes. A chemical conjugate of asialoorosomucoid and lactoperoxidase which binds specifically to asialoglycoprotein receptors was perfused through isolated rat livers at 37 degrees C. Subcellular fractions enriched in various endocytic compartments were then isolated by differential and isopycnic centrifugation, and the lactoperoxidase moiety of the internalized conjugate was used to catalyze the iodination of lumenal-facing proteins. The 125I profiles of early and late endosomes were strikingly similar after gel electrophoresis. Using immunoprecipitation, we directly identified and compared the relative amounts of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase and several different acid hydrolases and membrane receptors in all three fractions. The asialoglycoprotein receptor and the low density lipoprotein related protein were approximately nine times more abundant in early endosomes than late endosomes, suggesting that they recycle from early endosomes. In addition, cathepsin D, but not cathepsin L, beta-glucuronidase, and lgp 120, was detected in early endosomes; however, all of these molecules were detected in lysosomes. Our findings provide strong evidence that early endosomes mature into late endosomes and that there is either selective delivery or selective retention of hydrolases at discrete points in the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1546426062,"Expression and function of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was investigated in a metastatic cell clone (MTLn3) derived from the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma. No receptor phosphorylation could be identified in intact cells or in membrane preparations, while EGF-dependent phosphorylation of substrates occurred in intact cells. Indications for active suppression of receptor phosphorylation came from the fact that EGFRs bound in immunocomplexes or associated with the cytoskeleton of detergent treated cells were able to undergo basal and EGF-induced phosphorylation in vitro. Cross-linking experiments with 125I-EGF, as well as [35S]methionine labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with receptor specific antibodies readily detected in MTLn3 cells the expected 170-kDa EGFR protein. In addition, two proteins with molecular masses of 420-480 and 95 kDa specifically bound 125I-EGF on intact MTLn3 and sparse cultures of A431 cells. Phosphorylation of the 420-480 kDa molecule could be identified in immunocomplexes of EGFRs isolated from MTLn3 and sparse A431 cells, but the 95-kDa receptor molecule was never phosphorylated. While the presence of alternative forms of EGFR in the highly metastatic cell clone MTLn3 was unexpected, our observations of inefficient receptor autophosphorylation are in agreement with other recent reports and suggest that in MTLn3 cells EGFR-mediated signal transduction can be an event independent from receptor autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1487956790,"Signal recognition particle (SRP) induces elongation arrest of nascent presecretory proteins as the signal peptide protrudes from the large ribosomal subunit. To examine the relationship between the size of the precursor and extent of SRP mediated inhibition of polypeptide chain elongation, we performed in vitro translation experiments in the presence of SRP using a series of truncated preproinsulin mRNA molecules. These precursors possessed the same NH2 terminus as native preproinsulin followed by progressively shorter COOH termini. SRP inhibited translation of precursors as short as 64 amino acids in length, however, the extent of inhibition diminished for shorter precursors. This correlated with a reduction in the time required for ribosomes to transit through the mRNA encoding the shortened precursors. By exploiting a chimeric protein comprising the first 71 residues of preproinsulin fused to the bacterial cytoplasmic enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, we demonstrate that the largest size a nascent chain can reach and still be susceptible to SRP-mediated elongation arrest is approximately 17 kDa. Our data support the model that SRP binding to the signal peptide is a reversible process even in the absence of microsomal membranes, and that SRP can arrest polypeptide chain elongation at multiple stages during translation."

This protein is covalently modified with GlcNAc-[32P]phosphate when the enzyme preparation is incubated with [beta-32P]UDP-GlcNAc in the absence of an acceptor substrate. The labeling of the 97(43)-kDa protein requires active enzyme and is completely inhibited by the addition of the acceptor substrate alpha-methylmannoside. The GlcNAc-[32P]phosphate transferred to the protein is not bound to serine, threonine, tyrosine, or mannose residues. The 97(43)-kDa protein with covalently bound GlcNAc-P does not serve as a kinetically competent enzyme-substrate intermediate. However, preincubation of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase with UDP-GlcNAc does result in a decrease in the Vmax of the enzyme in subsequent assays. Taken together, these data are consistent with the 97(43)-kDa protein being a subunit of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1481652408,"Soluble phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4- and 3-kinase activities were partially purified and characterized from human placental extracts. The placental PtdIns 4-kinase (type 3) has a Km for ATP of 460 microM and is kinetically different to a partially purified human erythrocyte, membrane-bound, PtdIns 4-kinase (type 2). These three inositol lipid kinases were then used to compare their substrate specificities against the four synthetic stereoisomers of dipalmitoyl PtdIns. Only the placental 4-kinase was influenced by the chirality of the glycerol moiety of PtdIns. However, neither of the 4-kinases was able to phosphorylate L-PtdIns and, therefore, these kinases have an absolute requirement for the inositol ring to be linked to the glyceryl backbone of the lipid through the D-1 position. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, on the other hand, was found to phosphorylate both D- and L-PtdIns. While the 3-kinase phosphorylated exclusively the D-3 position of D-PtdIns, further analyses demonstrated that the same enzyme phosphorylated two sites on L-PtdIns, namely the D-6 and D-5 positions of the inositol ring. Some implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607897209,"We previously located two 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive enhancers, MSTRE-I and MSTRE-II, in the upstream sequence of the MS gene of Epstein-Barr virus (Liu, Q., and Summers, W.C. (1989) J. Virol. 63, 5062-5068). The core sequence of the MSTRE-I enhancer is now determined to be between -718 and -708 of the upstream sequence of the MS gene. The activity of the enhancer is also sensitive to its immediate surrounding sequence on either side. A single copy of a 30-base pair (bp) fragment containing the MSTRE-I sequence was able to confer TPA responsiveness upon the MS promoter even in the absence of an AP-1 binding site. Multiple tandem copies of this 30-bp fragment, regardless of their relative orientations to each other, could function synergistically to enhance the MS promoter activity. At least two copies of the 30-bp fragment were required to bestow TPA induction upon the thymidine kinase gene promoter of herpes simplex virus type 1. The MSTRE-I sequence could also be bound by a Fos-GCN4 chimeric protein but with an affinity much lower than that between the chimeric protein and the AP-1 binding site. This MSTRE-I region has strong homology to one of the TPA-responsive elements (the ZII domain) in the upstream sequence of the EBV BZLF1 gene. In addition, a putative negative regulatory region or silencer was found immediately downstream of the MSTRE-I enhancer. This potential silencer region contains a 14-bp sequence that is homologous to the silencer consensus sequence of the BZLF1 gene. Therefore, the regulation of the MS gene may share the same pathway with the immediate early gene BZLF1."
