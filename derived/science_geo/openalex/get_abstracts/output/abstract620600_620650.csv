ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are multimeric molecular assemblies that regulate chromatin architecture (Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015Kadoch C. Crabtree G.R.

SWI/SNF complexes were originally discovered and characterized in yeast, later in Drosophila (Dingwall et al., 1995Dingwall A.K. Beek S.J. McCallum C.M. Tamkun J.W. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Scott M.P.

Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes are ∼1- to 1.5-MDa entities combinatorially assembled from the products of 29 genes, including multiple paralogs, generating extensive diversity in composition. All complexes contain an ATPase subunit, either SMARCA4 (BRG1) or SMARCA2 (BRM), that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP. The roles of most other accessory subunits in complex assembly and stability as well as targeting and function remain unknown. Over the past several years, mSWI/SNF complexes have emerged as a major focus of attention because of the striking mutational frequencies in the genes encoding their subunits across a range of human diseases, from cancer to neurologic disorders. Indeed, recent exome sequencing studies have revealed that over 20% of human cancers bear mutations in the genes encoding mSWI/SNF subunits (Kadoch et al., 2013Kadoch C. Hargreaves D.C. Hodges C. Elias L. Ho L. Ranish J. Crabtree G.R. Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes identifies extensive roles in human malignancy.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In addition, heterozygous point mutations in mSWI/SNF genes have been implicated as causative events in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (Bögershausen and Wollnik, 2018Bögershausen N. Wollnik B. Mutational Landscapes and Phenotypic Spectrum of SWI/SNF-Related Intellectual Disability Disorders.Front. Mol.

Neurosci. 2015; 9: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) A major barrier to our understanding of the functions, tissue-specific roles, and effect of mutations on mSWI/SNF complex mechanisms lies in the lack of information regarding subunit organization, assembly, and 3D structure. Several factors pose major challenges to such studies. Individually expressed subunits are often unstable or incorrectly folded without their appropriate binding partners, and minimal complexes pieced together via in vitro co-expression may not represent endogenous, physiologically relevant complexes in cells. Large quantities of purified endogenous complexes with minimal heterogeneity are required for downstream analyses, and selection of appropriate purification strategies cannot be informed without understanding modular architecture and assembly order. For these reasons and others, to date only low-resolution maps have been achieved using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) approaches (Dechassa et al., 2008Dechassa M.L. Zhang B. Horowitz-Scherer R.

USA. 2007; 104: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and X-ray crystallographic analyses have been successfully performed on only a few isolated domains (Yan et al., 2017Yan L. Xie S. Du Y. Qian C. Structural Insights into BAF47 and BAF155 Complex Formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 1650-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), including the recently reported yeast Snf2 ATPase domain (Liu et al., 2017Liu X. Li M. Xia X. Li X. Chen Z.

Structure of chromatin remodeler Swi2/Snf2 in the resting state.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To establish a comprehensive structural framework for mSWI/SNF complexes, we used a multifaceted series of approaches involving complex and subcomplex purification, mass spectrometry (MS), crosslinking mass spectrometry (CX-MS), systematic genetic manipulation of subunits and subunit paralog families, evolutionary analyses, and human disease genetics. These studies reveal that mSWI/SNF complexes exist in three non-redundant final form assemblies: BRG1/BRM-associated factor complexes (BAFs), polybromo-associated BAF complexes (PBAFs), and non-canonical BAFs (ncBAFs), for which we establish the assembly requirements and modular organization. We define the full spectrum of endogenous combinatorial possibilities and the effect of individual subunit deletions and mutations, including recurrent, previously uncharacterized missense and nonsense mutations, on complex architecture. These studies provide important insights into mSWI/SNF complex organization, structure, and function and the biochemical consequences of a wide range of human disease-associated mutations. To begin to probe the modular organization and assembly order of mSWI/SNF family complexes, we subjected HEK293T cell nuclear extracts to density sedimentation analyses using 10%–30% glycerol gradients, reasoning that such an approach could reveal the presence of distinct final-form SWI/SNF complexes as well as assembly pathway intermediates (Figure 1A). We identified a range of migration patterns, with subunits such as SMARCD1 and SMARCC1 exhibiting marked spreading across the gradient and complex-defining subunits migrating in a restricted set of fractions, such as DPF2 and ARID1A (fraction of [Fx] 13–14), marking canonical BAF (cB or BAF) complexes and ARID2, BRD7, and PBRM1 in higher-mass fractions, Fx 16–17, marking PBAF complexes. In addition, BRD9 and GLTSCR1/1L subunits, corresponding to a newly identified class of mSWI/SNF complexes we have termed ncBAF (Alpsoy and Dykhuizen, 2018Alpsoy A. Dykhuizen E.C.

Using these results, we developed a robust purification strategy to capture endogenous mammalian complexes at each of these extremes with over 95% purity (Figure S1A; Table S1). SMARCD1-based purifications were used to capture all forms of mSWI/SNF complexes (because SMARCD1 is present across the full gradient), and hemagglutinin (HA)-DPF2 was used to purify fully assembled BAF complexes, which do not contain PBAF or ncBAF complex components (Figures S1B and S1C). Remarkably, density sedimentation and silver staining of purified complexes revealed that SMARCD1-captured complexes spread across the gradient, whereas DPF2 complexes marked only complete BAF complexes with no detectable intermediates (Figures 1B–1D; Figures S1D and S1E; Table S2), highlighting the utility of this approach to detect specific complexes and intermediate modules. Analysis of spectral counts from mass spectrometry performed across SMARCD1 gradient fractions confirmed the silver stain results and further identified components with lower abundance, such as ncBAF and PBAF subunits (Figure 1E; Figure S1F; Table S2). Taken together, these data suggest a stepwise, modular assembly pathway for mSWI/SNF family complexes, resulting in three distinct final complex forms, each with their own combinatorial diversity. We next performed bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3)-based cross-linking mass spectrometry using DPF2 and SS18 as baits to identify BAF subunit architecture and linkages. We generated high-density subunit crosslinking maps based on 1,560 identified spectra for inter-protein crosslinks and 2,373 identified spectra for intra-protein crosslinks with coverage across all BAF complex subunits, with the exception of SS18 (because of limited lysine residues) (Figures 2A and S2A; Table S3; STAR Methods). To comprehensively define regions of crosslinking between BAF complex subunits, we divided each subunit family (collapsed; i.e., SMARCD = SMARCD1, SMARCD2, or SMARCD3) into regions based on existing domain annotation, conservation, and newly defined domains stemming from this cross-linking mass spectrometry work (Figures 2A and S2B). The median distance between crosslinked residues within domains of known structure was 12.2 Å, close to the expected 11.4–30 Å distance for the BS3 crosslinking agent (Figure S2C; Table S4). In addition, the C-alpha distances between crosslinked residues mapped onto the structure of the Snf2 helicase were within expected distances for the nucleosome-bound and free conformations (Liu et al., 2017Liu X.

Individual subunits are divided into domains (per J) and ordered according to Figure 2C. (N) Correlation analysis between D. melanogaster BAP and S. cerevisiae SWI/SNF subunit domain and region interactions from cross-linking mass spectrometry datasets. To elucidate potential crosslinking preferences between subunits, we performed Louvain two-nearest-neighbor analysis, where nodes are subunits (or paralog families) and edges are drawn between the top two crosslinking partners for each subunit based on the number of BAF crosslinks (Blondel et al., 2008Blondel V.D. Guillaume J.-L. Lambiotte R. Lefebvre E. Fast unfolding of communities in large networks.J. Stat. Mech. 2008; 2008: P10008Crossref Scopus (11160) Google Scholar). This clustering revealed three distinct network modules: a catalytic module containing the SMARCA ATPase subunit, β-actin, and ACTL6A, an associated module containing SMARCB1 and BCL7, and a module containing SMARCC, SMARCD, SMARCE1, and ARID1 (Figure 2B), recapitulating our inferred assembly of components. In addition, correlation analyses of total inter-subunit crosslinks for each subunit revealed similar results (Figure S2E). Arthropods represent a parallel evolutionary branch to metazoans that retain at least two classes of SWI/SNF complexes, namely BAP (BAF in mammals) and PBAP (PBAF in mammals). Hence, we isolated BAP complexes from D. melanogaster S2 cells using insect orthologs of DPF2 (D4) and SMARCD1 (BAP60) as baits and performed cross-linking mass spectrometry (Figures S2F and S2G). Similar to mammalian complexes, the ATPase module clustered with BAP55 (ACTL6A ortholog) and ACT2 (β-actin ortholog), and moira (mor) (SMARCC ortholog) formed a tight network with BAP60, BAP111 (SMARCE1 ortholog), and Osa (ARID1 ortholog), whereas Snr1 (SMARCB1 ortholog) and D4 separated as a distinct module (Figures 2C and S2H; Table S5). These cross-linking mass spectrometry results suggest conserved modularity for at least two complex modules: the BAF ATPase module and the “core module” that forms around SMARCC or mor subunits. Finally, using a recently published S. cerevisiae SWI/SNF cross-linking mass spectrometry dataset (Sen et al., 2017Sen P. Luo J. Hada A. Hailu S.G. Dechassa M.L. Persinger J. Brahma S. Paul S. Ranish J. Bartholomew B. Loss of Snf5 Induces Formation of an Aberrant SWI/SNF Complex.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 2135-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found similar clustering of the majority of both core and ATPase subunits, with the SNF2-centered ATPase module containing ARP7, ARP9 (potential orthologs of ACTL6A), and RTT102. SWI3 (SMARCC ortholog) and SNF12 (SMARCD ortholog), along with yeast-specific SNF6 and SWP82, form the core module, and SWI1 (ARID1 ortholog) and SNF5 (SMARCB1 ortholog) subunits cluster and bridge the core and ATPase modules (Figures 2D and S2I–S2L). Using correlation analyses of crosslinks within individual subunit regions and domains across mammalian, fly, and yeast complexes, we found that the most highly conserved interactions were between regions of the BAF core, OSA or ARID1, and ATPase modules (Figures 2E, 2F, S2M, and S2N). Taken together, SWI/SNF complexes retain specific modular organization across evolutionarily distant branches of life, indicating functional conservation of subunit architecture. Complex purifications (Figures 1B and 1D) coupled with these cross-linking mass spectrometry analyses suggested the presence of an early subcomplex containing SMARCD and SMARCC followed by SMARCE1 and SMARCB1 subunits (Figure 3A). Indeed, SMARCC1 purifications showed enrichment of the same subcomplex module (Figure 3B; Table S2). Similar results were obtained from SMARCB1, SMARCE1, and SMARCD2 purifications (Figures S3A–S3I; Table S2) using both mass spectrometry and fluorometric approaches and demonstrated SMARCB1 association with the BAF core module of cBAF and PBAF (Figures S3A–S3G). Of note, ncBAF-specific BRD9 and GLTSCR1 and GLTSCR1L components were completely absent in these three purifications, further suggesting that these subunits mark complexes of unique composition and lack several ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved subunits.Figure S3Purification and Mass Spectrometry Analyses of the BAF Core Module, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Native HA-SMARCB1 BAF complexes purified from WT HEK293T cells and subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation.

Therefore, good in vitro models that encompass unique subtypes are urgently needed for precision medicine development. Here, we have established a primary gastric cancer organoid (GCO) biobank that comprises normal, dysplastic, cancer, and lymph node metastases (n = 63) from 34 patients, including detailed whole-exome and transcriptome analysis. The cohort encompasses most known molecular subtypes (including EBV, MSI, intestinal/CIN, and diffuse/GS, with CLDN18-ARHGAP6 or CTNND1-ARHGAP26 fusions or RHOA mutations), capturing regional heterogeneity and subclonal architecture, while their morphology, transcriptome, and genomic profiles remain closely similar to in vivo tumors, even after long-term culture. Large-scale drug screening revealed sensitivity to unexpected drugs that were recently approved or in clinical trials, including Napabucasin, Abemaciclib, and the ATR inhibitor VE-822.

Complex allelic variation hampers the assembly of haplotype-resolved sequences from diploid genomes. We developed trio binning, an approach that simplifies haplotype assembly by resolving allelic variation before assembly. In contrast with prior approaches, the effectiveness of our method improved with increasing heterozygosity. Trio binning uses short reads from two parental genomes to first partition long reads from an offspring into haplotype-specific sets. Each haplotype is then assembled independently, resulting in a complete diploid reconstruction. We used trio binning to recover both haplotypes of a diploid human genome and identified complex structural variants missed by alternative approaches. We sequenced an F1 cross between the cattle subspecies Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus and completely assembled both parental haplotypes with NG50 haplotig sizes of >20 Mb and 99.998% accuracy, surpassing the quality of current cattle reference genomes. We suggest that trio binning improves diploid genome assembly and will facilitate new studies of haplotype variation and inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W2896032894,"Alteration of tissue mechanical properties is a physical hallmark of solid tumors including gliomas. How tumor cells sense and regulate tissue mechanics is largely unknown. Here, we show that mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo regulates mitosis and tissue stiffness of Drosophila gliomas, but not non-transformed brains. PIEZO1 is overexpressed in aggressive human gliomas and its expression inversely correlates with patient survival. Deleting PIEZO1 suppresses the growth of glioblastoma stem cells, inhibits tumor development, and prolongs mouse survival. Focal mechanical force activates prominent PIEZO1-dependent currents from glioma cell processes, but not soma. PIEZO1 localizes at focal adhesions to activate integrin-FAK signaling, regulate extracellular matrix, and reinforce tissue stiffening. In turn, a stiffer mechanical microenvironment elevates PIEZO1 expression to promote glioma aggression. Therefore, glioma cells are mechanosensory in a PIEZO1-dependent manner, and targeting PIEZO1 represents a strategy to break the reciprocal, disease-aggravating feedforward circuit between tumor cell mechanotransduction and the aberrant tissue mechanics.

https://openalex.org/W2896599301,"Low-grade gliomas almost invariably progress into secondary glioblastoma (sGBM) with limited therapeutic option and poorly understood mechanism. By studying the mutational landscape of 188 sGBMs, we find significant enrichment of TP53 mutations, somatic hypermutation, MET-exon-14-skipping (METex14), PTPRZ1-MET (ZM) fusions, and MET amplification. Strikingly, METex14 frequently co-occurs with ZM fusion and is present in ∼14% of cases with significantly worse prognosis. Subsequent studies show that METex14 promotes glioma progression by prolonging MET activity. Furthermore, we describe a MET kinase inhibitor, PLB-1001, that demonstrates remarkable potency in selectively inhibiting MET-altered tumor cells in preclinical models. Importantly, this compound also shows blood-brain barrier permeability and is subsequently applied in a phase I clinical trial that enrolls MET-altered chemo-resistant glioma patients. Encouragingly, PLB-1001 achieves partial response in at least two advanced sGBM patients with rarely significant side effects, underscoring the clinical potential for precisely treating gliomas using this therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2896321622,"The identification and quantification of proteins lags behind DNA-sequencing methods in scale, sensitivity, and dynamic range. Here, we show that sparse amino acid-sequence information can be obtained for individual protein molecules for thousands to millions of molecules in parallel. We demonstrate selective fluorescence labeling of cysteine and lysine residues in peptide samples, immobilization of labeled peptides on a glass surface, and imaging by total internal reflection microscopy to monitor decreases in each molecule's fluorescence after consecutive rounds of Edman degradation. The obtained sparse fluorescent sequence of each molecule was then assigned to its parent protein in a reference database. We tested the method on synthetic and naturally derived peptide molecules in zeptomole-scale quantities. We also fluorescently labeled phosphoserines and achieved single-molecule positional readout of the phosphorylated sites. We measured >93% efficiencies for dye labeling, survival, and cleavage; further improvements should enable studies of increasingly complex proteomic mixtures, with the high sensitivity and digital quantification offered by single-molecule sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2950604305,"Long-term learning of language, mathematics, and motor skills likely requires cortical plasticity, but behavior often requires much faster changes, sometimes even after single errors. Here, we propose one neural mechanism to rapidly develop new motor output without altering the functional connectivity within or between cortical areas. We tested cortico-cortical models relating the activity of hundreds of neurons in the premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices throughout adaptation to reaching movement perturbations. We found a signature of learning in the ""output-null"" subspace of PMd with respect to M1 reflecting the ability of premotor cortex to alter preparatory activity without directly influencing M1. The output-null subspace planning activity evolved with adaptation, yet the ""output-potent"" mapping that captures information sent to M1 was preserved. Our results illustrate a population-level cortical mechanism to progressively adjust the output from one brain area to its downstream structures that could be exploited for rapid behavioral adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2897182875,"Theta oscillations reflect rhythmic inputs that continuously converge to the hippocampus during exploratory and memory-guided behavior. The theta-nested operations that organize hippocampal spiking could either occur regularly from one cycle to the next or be tuned on a cycle-by-cycle basis. To resolve this, we identified spectral components nested in individual theta cycles recorded from the mouse CA1 hippocampus. Our single-cycle profiling revealed theta spectral components associated with different firing modulations and distinguishable ensembles of principal cells. Moreover, novel co-firing patterns of principal cells in theta cycles nesting mid-gamma oscillations were the most strongly reactivated in subsequent offline sharp-wave/ripple events. Finally, theta-nested spectral components were differentially altered by behavioral stages of a memory task; the 80-Hz mid-gamma component was strengthened during learning, whereas the 22-Hz beta, 35-Hz slow gamma, and 54-Hz mid-gamma components increased during retrieval. We conclude that cycle-to-cycle variability of theta-nested spectral components allows parsing of theta oscillations into transient operating modes with complementary mnemonic roles."
https://openalex.org/W2896416678,"In the developing brain, immature synapses contain calcium-permeable AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) that are subsequently replaced with GluA2-containing calcium-impermeable AMPARs as synapses stabilize and mature. Here, we show that this essential switch in AMPARs and neuronal synapse maturation is regulated by astrocytes. Using biochemical fractionation of astrocyte-secreted proteins and mass spectrometry, we identified that astrocyte-secreted chordin-like 1 (Chrdl1) is necessary and sufficient to induce mature GluA2-containing synapses to form. This function of Chrdl1 is independent of its role as an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Chrdl1 expression is restricted to cortical astrocytes in vivo, peaking at the time of the AMPAR switch. Chrdl1 knockout (KO) mice display reduced synaptic GluA2 AMPARs, altered kinetics of synaptic events, and enhanced remodeling in an in vivo plasticity assay. Studies have shown that humans with mutations in Chrdl1 display enhanced learning. Thus astrocytes, via the release of Chrdl1, promote GluA2-dependent synapse maturation and thereby limit synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2895885016,"Neural induction in vertebrates generates a CNS that extends the rostral-caudal length of the body. The prevailing view is that neural cells are initially induced with anterior (forebrain) identity; caudalizing signals then convert a proportion to posterior fates (spinal cord). To test this model, we used chromatin accessibility to define how cells adopt region-specific neural fates. Together with genetic and biochemical perturbations, this identified a developmental time window in which genome-wide chromatin-remodeling events preconfigure epiblast cells for neural induction. Contrary to the established model, this revealed that cells commit to a regional identity before acquiring neural identity. This “primary regionalization” allocates cells to anterior or posterior regions of the nervous system, explaining how cranial and spinal neurons are generated at appropriate axial positions. These findings prompt a revision to models of neural induction and support the proposed dual evolutionary origin of the vertebrate CNS."

Here, we measure nascent transcriptional activity in early Drosophila embryos and characterize the variability in absolute activity levels across expression boundaries. We demonstrate that boundary formation follows a common transcription principle: a single control parameter determines the distribution of transcriptional activity, regardless of gene identity, boundary position, or enhancer-promoter architecture. We infer the underlying bursting kinetics and identify the key regulatory parameter as the fraction of time a gene is in a transcriptionally active state.

These results point to a shared simplicity underlying the apparently complex transcriptional processes of early embryonic patterning and indicate a path to general rules in transcriptional regulation. A central question in gene regulation concerns how discrete molecular interactions generate a continuum of expression levels observed at the transcriptome level (Lionnet and Singer, 2012Lionnet T. Singer R.H. Transcription goes digital.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Scholes et al., 2017Scholes C. DePace A.H. Sánchez Á. Combinatorial Gene Regulation through Kinetic Control of the Transcription Cycle.Cell Syst. 2017; 4: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A large set of molecular activities is required to elicit RNA transcription, including transcription factor binding, chromatin modifications, and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions (Voss and Hager, 2014Voss T.C. Hager G.L. Dynamic regulation of transcriptional states by chromatin and transcription factors.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, it is unclear which of these interactions predominantly regulate RNA synthesis rates and variability for a given gene (Coulon et al., 2013Coulon A. Chow C.C. Singer R.H. Larson D.R. Eukaryotic transcriptional dynamics: from single molecules to cell populations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 572-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In general, for genes whose transcription rates depend on levels of external inputs, we do not know which regulatory steps are preferably tuned to achieve required mRNA expression levels. Overall, it is unknown whether constraints exist that might select common mechanisms for modulating transcriptional activity across genes, space, and time. Addressing these questions requires measuring the kinetic rates of transcription in absolute units. Many studies using single-molecule counting approaches have documented the inherently stochastic nature of transcription (Little et al., 2013Little S.C. Tikhonov M. Gregor T.

In organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrates, genes exhibit transcription bursts characterized by intermittent intervals of mRNA production followed by protracted quiescent periods (Bothma et al., 2014Bothma J.P.

This inherent stochasticity in gene activation results in higher cell-to-cell variability than expected from constitutive expression (Blake et al., 2003Blake W.J. KAErn M. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Noise in eukaryotic gene expression.Nature. 2003; 422: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). A simple telegraph or two-state model has been used to explain the measured variability in the context of transcriptional bursting (Peccoud and Ycart, 1995Peccoud J. Ycart B. Markovian Modeling of Gene-Product Synthesis.Theor. Popul. Biol. 1995; 48: 222-234Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In this model, a locus switches at random between inactive and active states, with only the latter permitting transcription initiation. Despite its prevalent use, it is not largely known which molecular events determine the kinetic rates of this model (Coulon et al., 2013Coulon A. Chow C.C. Singer R.H. Larson D.R. Eukaryotic transcriptional dynamics: from single molecules to cell populations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 572-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), nor is it widely understood which of these kinetic rates are modulated by external input signals or to what extent. However, with precise measurements and quantitative modeling, it is possible to gain intuition for the mechanisms of transcriptional bursting based on their signature in the measured variability (Jones et al., 2014Jones D.L.

Molina N. Naef F. Structure of silent transcription intervals and noise characteristics of mammalian genes.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11: 823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Drosophila embryos provide an ideal model to investigate transcriptional regulation (Gregor et al., 2014Gregor T. Garcia H.G. Little S.C. The embryo as a laboratory: quantifying transcription in Drosophila.Trends Genet. 2014; 30: 364-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Early embryos express many genes in graded patterns in response to modulatory inputs (Struhl et al., 1992Struhl G. Johnston P. Lawrence P.A. Control of Drosophila body pattern by the hunchback morphogen gradient.Cell. 1992; 69: 237-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Spatial domains, where gene expression levels transition from highly active to nearly silent, are functionally the most critical for the developing embryo, as they determine specification of cell identities (Kornberg and Tabata, 1993Kornberg T.B. Tabata T. Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among the earliest expressed genes in Drosophila development are the gap genes, which encode transcription factors responsible for anterior-posterior (AP) patterning (Jaeger, 2011Jaeger J. The gap gene network.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 243-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Each gap gene is expressed in its own unique domain, and the expression boundaries arise at distinct and precise positions (Dubuis et al., 2013Dubuis J.O. Samanta R. Gregor T. Accurate measurements of dynamics and reproducibility in small genetic networks.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9: 639Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Gene expression levels are spatially graded across several cell diameters, and the intermediate levels of these gap genes confer patterning information necessary for segmentation (Lawrence, 1992Lawrence, P.A. (1992). The making of a fly: The genetics of animal design.Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise control of expression levels is essential for properly patterned cell fate specification. The regulation of gap genes appears highly complex. Many activating and repressing factors determine expression boundaries through complex layers of homo- and heterotypic protein interactions at multiple promoters and enhancers (Estrada et al., 2016Estrada J.

Predicting expression patterns from regulatory sequence in Drosophila segmentation.Nature. 2008; 451: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The collective activity of these factors generates expression rates that vary with position in the embryo (Briscoe and Small, 2015Briscoe J. Small S. Morphogen rules: design principles of gradient-mediated embryo patterning.Development. 2015; 142: 3996-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Lawrence, 1992Lawrence, P.A. (1992).

Given the diversity of cis-regulatory architecture and trans-acting factors regulating these genes, an intuitive expectation is that expression rates emerge from carefully tuned transcription factor concentrations and binding affinities. Since various bursting kinetics could achieve such rates, a straightforward prediction is that the underlying bursting kinetics will differ between boundaries. This expectation is consistent with prior studies in cultured cells suggesting that many regulatory strategies exist (Carey et al., 2013Carey L.B. van Dijk D. Sloot P.M.A. Kaandorp J.A. Segal E.

Transcription factors modulate c-Fos transcriptional bursts.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how bursting rates are modulated across multiple expression boundaries in intact tissues. To address these questions, we developed a single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) method that generates accurate counts of nascent RNA molecules in individual nuclei. We applied this method to assess absolute transcriptional activity of the gap genes in terms of the number and variability of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules at transcribing loci. This approach reveals a common principle that unifies transcriptional activity across expression boundaries. Surprisingly, a single common control parameter globally determines the distribution of transcriptional activity. We use a simple telegraph model to interpret our measurements. We show that the key regulatory parameter is the fraction of time a gene is in a transcriptionally active state, while the Pol II initiation rate is constant. Contrary to the expectation of diverse bursting kinetics, the promoter switching rates are tightly constrained across boundaries. This constraint highlights the conservation of the switching correlation time and predicts synchronous transcriptional outcomes regardless of expression level, gene identity, or position in the embryo. We propose that this synchronicity is important for ensuring precise patterning. Moreover, our results suggest an emergent simplicity in the modulation of bursting that governs the apparently complex process of embryo segmentation. Overall, our quantitative approach provides a framework for uncovering unifying principles of transcriptional regulation that can be applied across genes in any biological context. During early fly development, gene expression boundaries arise from spatially varying transcription factor concentrations. Early embryos thus provide a natural context in which to ask how input factors shape transcription dynamics. Here, we enhanced a previously developed smFISH method (Little et al., 2013Little S.C. Tikhonov M. Gregor T. Precise developmental gene expression arises from globally stochastic transcriptional activity.Cell. 2013; 154: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to yield a 3- to 4-fold increase in sensitivity, enabling precise counting of nascent transcripts and measurement of transcriptional activity across boundaries (STAR Methods). We performed confocal imaging with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes to label single mRNA molecules in fixed embryos followed by analysis to estimate intensities of transcription sites (i.e., spatially co-localized nascent transcripts) and individual cytoplasmic mRNAs. This method measures instantaneous activity per nucleus in terms of intensity units of individual cytoplasmic mRNAs, the “cytoplasmic unit” (C.U.) by normalizing the total intensity of each locus to that of cytoplasmic mRNAs (Figures 1A and 1B ). We measured the transcriptional activity of the four major gap genes hunchback (hb), Krüppel (Kr), knirps (kni), and giant (gt) along the embryo’s AP axis. These genes are expressed early in development in broad spatial domains, permitting measurements of thousands of synchronized nuclei across small numbers of embryos; these factors all favor low measurement error (Figures 1C and 1D; N ∼ 15 embryos per combination of gene/genotype). Analysis of expression levels in mid- to late interphase 13 ensures sufficient time to attain steady-state levels of transcribing Pol II (Figures S1A–S1D and STAR Methods), and DNA replication occurs in early interphase (Blumenthal et al., 1974Blumenthal A.B. Kriegstein H.J. Hogness D.S. The units of DNA replication in Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1974; 38: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) such that these observations eliminate ambiguity arising from varying numbers of loci. Since loci on recently duplicated chromatids are often closely apposed in space, we measure total transcription per nucleus (Little et al., 2013Little S.C. Tikhonov M. Gregor T. Precise developmental gene expression arises from globally stochastic transcriptional activity.Cell. 2013; 154: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) then infer properties of individual loci. As a control, we generated data from embryos heterozygous for a hb deficiency and observed half the wild-type level of expression per nucleus (Figure 1C). Importantly, we observe a corresponding decrease in variance to half of wild-type (Figure 1D), supporting previous findings that all loci behave independently (Little et al., 2013Little S.C. Tikhonov M. Gregor T. Precise developmental gene expression arises from globally stochastic transcriptional activity.Cell. 2013; 154: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the suitability of using total transcriptional activity per nucleus to infer the behavior of individual loci. Since biological variance greatly constrains models of regulatory processes, we needed to determine how variability arises from measurement error, embryo-to-embryo differences, and intrinsic fluctuations in individual nuclei. The performance of our measurements was assessed by labeling each mRNA in alternating colors along the length of the strand. This allowed us to perform independent normalization in each channel, thus characterizing sources of measurement error, such as noise stemming from imaging and normalization (Figure 2A). Estimation of the variance of the mean across embryos (Figure 2B) enables further splitting of the variability in terms of embryo alignment along the AP axis and inherent embryo-to-embryo variability (Figures S1E–S1H and STAR Methods). For all genes and at all positions, measurement variability (imaging and spatial alignment) represents less than 7% of the total variance on average (Figure 2C), indicating that biological variability dominates our measurements (Dubuis et al., 2013Dubuis J.O. Samanta R. Gregor T. Accurate measurements of dynamics and reproducibility in small genetic networks.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2013; 9: 639Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Importantly, this variability arises almost entirely from differences between nuclei rather than differences between embryos (Figure 2D); the low embryo-to-embryo variability in the maximally expressed regions (16 ± 4% coefficient of variation [CV]; Figure 2E) emphasizes that the mean expression levels across embryos are reproducible in absolute units (Figure 1C). Therefore, the measured expression noise mainly stems from zygotic transcription and is intrinsic to the molecular processes of transcription rather than from extrinsic sources of variability. Low measurement error and the predominance of intrinsic variability facilitates analysis of the noise-mean relationship, permitting inference of bursting kinetics from several hundred nuclei at each position along the AP axis (Figure 1B) as detailed below. The expression patterns of the gap genes are determined by multiple enhancer elements at varying distances from their promoters (Kvon et al., 2014Kvon E.Z. Kazmar T. Stampfel G. Yáñez-Cuna J.O.

Each enhancer contains a variable number of binding sites for multiple patterning input factors with cross-regulatory interactions (Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2005Ochoa-Espinosa A. Yucel G. Kaplan L.

Given the diversity of input factors and molecular control elements, it would appear likely that different genes should exhibit vastly different, uniquely defined transcriptional kinetics. To make progress in understanding these complex relationships, we capitalize on the fact that the kinetics of the processes underlying transcription determines not only mean expression levels but also the variability (Figure 1D). Therefore, we can use the noise-mean relationship to characterize the transcription kinetics for individual genes. To characterize noise-mean relationships in our system, we examined the dependence of variability on mean transcription levels (Figure 3A). In agreement with prior measurements (Little et al., 2013Little S.C. Tikhonov M. Gregor T. Precise developmental gene expression arises from globally stochastic transcriptional activity.Cell. 2013; 154: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), genes span a similar dynamic range of expression levels across boundaries, from nearly zero to a maximum value of 34 ± 6 C.U. (Figure 1C). Moreover, transcription is inherently variable: at all positions and for all genes, variability exceeds that expected from a simple model of constitutive activity, with noise (measured as CV2) approximately 10 times larger than Poisson for mean transcriptional activity below 10 C.U. (Figure 3A). However, the noise-mean relationship follows an unexpectedly similar overall trend (Figure 3A and STAR Methods). Unlike many other systems (bacteria, yeast, mammalian cell culture), there is no clearly identifiable noise floor at high expression (Keren et al., 2015Keren L. van Dijk D. Weingarten-Gabbay S. Davidi D. Jona G. Weinberger A. Milo R. Segal E. Noise in gene expression is coupled to growth rate.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Taniguchi et al., 2010Taniguchi Y. Choi P.J. Li G.W. Chen H. Babu M.

Nicolas D. Molina N. Naef F. Structure of silent transcription intervals and noise characteristics of mammalian genes.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2015; 11: 823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The absence of such an extrinsic noise floor is likely a key feature of early embryo development: nuclei are highly synchronized within the cell cycle and share the same environment of the syncytial blastoderm. Sources of extrinsic noise that affect gene expression in cultured cells are thus minimized. Moreover, the collapse on a unique curve is unexpected and atypical given the different promoter-enhancer architectures (Hornung et al., 2012Hornung G. Bar-Ziv R. Rosin D. Tokuriki N. Tawfik D.S. Oren M. Barkai N. Noise-mean relationship in mutated promoters.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Sanchez and Golding, 2013Sanchez A. Golding I. Genetic determinants and cellular constraints in noisy gene expression.Science. 2013; 342: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This result is even more striking when we convert our units of transcriptional activity from C.U. to the actual number count of Pol II molecules, g. Such a conversion is necessary, as the intensity at a given active transcription locus is dependent on the length of the individual gene, the copy number, and the probe arrangement (Figure S2A and STAR Methods). Accounting for these factors, we can describe the shape of the distribution of Pol II counts per locus by calculating the second, third, and fourth cumulants for each gene across each boundary. While again, the expectation is that Pol II counts should differ between different genes, an extra data collapse is observed instead: the second, third, and fourth cumulants for all data points are nearly uniquely determined by a single parameter, the mean activity 〈g〉 (Figures 3B–3D and S2B–S2D). Thus, transcriptional activity for all genes and across the entire expression range is characterized by a unique, common single-parameter distribution. This observation is model-free and indicates that a single parameter determines the generation of all gene expression boundaries. The uniqueness of the Pol II count distribution suggests that despite the well-documented diversity of cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors, a common conserved set of processes is regulated to determine transcription kinetics across all boundaries in the early embryo. The shared Pol II count distribution suggests that a common general model can describe the regulation of all gap genes. The observed intrinsic super-Poissonian variability in our data suggests that these genes operate in a bursting regime. While constitutive genes can be modeled by a single parameter—i.e., the effective initiation rate—multiple independent parameters are required to model transcription kinetics of bursting genes. A popular minimalist model accounting for bursting is the “two-state” or “telegraph” model (Peccoud and Ycart, 1995Peccoud J. Ycart B. Markovian Modeling of Gene-Product Synthesis.Theor. Popul. Biol. 1995; 48: 222-234Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It has been widely used to describe the distribution of mature mRNA and protein counts (Bar-Even et al., 2006Bar-Even A. Paulsson J.

Here, we compare humans with natural-selective bilateral BLA lesions to rats with a chemogenetically silenced BLA. We find, across species, an essential role for the BLA in the selection of active escape over passive freezing during exposure to imminent yet escapable threat (Timm). In response to Timm, BLA-damaged humans showed increased startle potentiation and BLA-silenced rats demonstrated increased startle potentiation, freezing, and reduced escape behavior as compared to controls. Neuroimaging in humans suggested that the BLA reduces passive defensive responses by inhibiting the brainstem via the CeA. Indeed, Timm conditioning potentiated BLA projections onto an inhibitory CeA pathway, and pharmacological activation of this pathway rescued deficient Timm responses in BLA-silenced rats. Our data reveal how the BLA, via the CeA, adaptively regulates escape behavior from imminent threat and that this mechanism is evolutionary conserved across rodents and humans."

The internal organization of eukaryotic cells depends on cytoskeletal networks. Dynamic microtubules and actin filaments, motile crosslinkers, and other associated proteins drive active networks into a variety of organizational states required for distinct cell functions (Helmke et al., 2013Helmke K.J.

In contrast, in large cells of embryos and plants motors mediate the formation of arrays of aligned microtubules or actin filaments, causing global cytoplasmic flows to distribute nutrients and organelles (Ganguly et al., 2012Ganguly S.

These networks consisting of aligned filaments of mixed-polarity are also called “nematic,” a term borrowed from liquid crystal terminology (Needleman and Dogic, 2017Needleman D. Dogic Z. Active matter at the interface between materials science and cell biology.Nat. Rev. Mater. 2017; 2: 1-14Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). How cells control the organization of active filament networks with different topologies is an open question. During cell division, microtubule crosslinking motors organize microtubules into bipolar spindles, an architecture that is crucial for correct chromosome segregation. The role of motors is particularly evident in female meiosis, when the bipolar spindle self-organizes from randomly oriented microtubules nucleated locally in the vicinity of chromosomes (Heald et al., 1996Heald R. Tournebize R. Blank T. Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P. Hyman A. Karsenti E. Self-organization of microtubules into bipolar spindles around artificial chromosomes in Xenopus egg extracts.Nature. 1996; 382: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Minus-end-directed motors contribute to the formation of radial, polarized microtubule arrays with their minus ends focused at the spindle poles, and plus-end-directed motors are required to arrange nematic arrays of aligned microtubules with mixed-polarity in the spindle center (Brugués et al., 2012Brugués J.

Metaphase spindle assembly.Biology (Basel). 2017; 6: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is unclear why particular mitotic motors promote different organizational states. The critical determinants of filament self-organization are not known. Biomimetic systems with limited sets of purified proteins have provided mechanistic insight that can be applied to intracellular networks. When microtubules were grown in the presence of artificial microtubule stabilizers, crosslinking motors produced locally contracting networks, leading to the formation of monopolar structures (asters) (Hentrich and Surrey, 2010Hentrich C.

Nematic networks of extensile bundles were observed in vitro when short, static microtubules were combined with purified artificial kinesin-1 clusters in the presence of crowding agents that promoted microtubule bundling (Henkin et al., 2014Henkin G. DeCamp S.J. Chen D.T. Sanchez T. Dogic Z. Tunable dynamics of microtubule-based active isotropic gels.Philos. Trans. A Math. Phys. Eng.

Motors transported microtubules of mixed-polarity causing bundle extension and large-scale hydrodynamic flows. High microtubule concentrations and the crowding agent present in these experiments appeared to have changed the rules of self-organization. Whether motors can organize microtubules also into nematic networks under more physiological conditions is unknown. Kinesin-5 is the main plus-end-directed microtubule crosslinker that functions in the central region of the spindle and exerts outward forces in spindles (Blangy et al., 1995Blangy A.

Yet, self-organization experiments with purified kinesin-5 and many microtubules have so far failed to reveal network organizations that correspond to this motor’s function in cells (Hentrich and Surrey, 2010Hentrich C.

Taken together, multiple parameters such as protein concentrations, kinetic motor properties, the degree of crowding, and potentially the dynamic properties of microtubules influence the organization of biological filament/motor systems. When trying to understand such a multi-dimensional organizational phase space, the question arises whether it is possible to identify a minimal set of critical determinants or control parameters that predict network organization. Identifying such control parameters can directly provide insight into complex system behavior. To gain such a mechanistic understanding of microtubule/motor network organization, we explored the organizational capacity of human kinesin-5 and kinesin-14 in the presence of dynamic microtubules. In self-organization experiments with purified motors and microtubules with tunable plus- or minus-end dynamics, we show that both motors, despite opposite directionalities, can form either polar or nematic microtubule networks. We find that the normal asymmetry of microtubule growth plays an important role in determining a motor’s natural organizational capacity. Numerical computer simulations of active network organization identify two control parameters, each combining a motor and a microtubule property, that predict the outcome of network organization. Taken together, our results suggest a simple set of rules that explain bipolar spindle organization by mitotic motors and dynamic microtubules. To establish asymmetric microtubule growth dynamics in vitro and mimic the situation in the cell, we used a C-terminal fragment of the human microtubule minus-end stabilizer CAMSAP3 (CAMSAP3-C) (Figures 1A and S1) (Atherton et al., 2017Atherton J.

Addition of CAMSAP3-C stimulated microtubule formation in pure tubulin solutions, as visualized by the end binding protein EB3 (Figures 1B and 1C) (Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2010Montenegro Gouveia S.

CAMSAP3-C suppressed minus-end dynamics and allowed the plus-ends of the nucleated microtubules to grow for at least an hour (Figures 1C and 1D).Figure S1Coomassie-Stained SDS Gel with Purified Recombinant Proteins Used in This Study, Related to STAR MethodsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated how purified human plus-end-directed microtubule crosslinking kinesin-5 KIF11 (Ferenz et al., 2010Ferenz N.P. Gable A. Wadsworth P. Mitotic functions of kinesin-5.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) organizes free microtubules with such asymmetric growth properties. We mixed fluorescently labeled tubulin and motors and initiated microtubule nucleation by a temperature shift (Figure 1E). Within minutes, KIF11 produced dynamic networks of aligned microtubules, generating persistent large-scale wave-like movements (Figure 1F; Video S1). This network differed from unstructured or contractile networks assembled by purified kinesin-5 in the presence of microtubule-stabilizing agents observed previously (Hentrich and Surrey, 2010Hentrich C.

Instead, the aligned microtubule bundles appeared to be locally extensile as shown by increasing bundle lengths or increasing distances between photo-bleached bundle segments over time (Figures S2A and S2B). This suggests that KIF11-dependent anti-parallel sliding drives the organization and motion of these three-dimensional microtubule networks (Figure S2C). Together, these results demonstrate that nematic networks of extensile bundles can be generated by a natural mitotic kinesin and dynamic microtubules with a broad length distribution (Figure S2D). This formation of a nematic network by KIF11 reconstitutes its function in the central part of spindles. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5OGE2MWNiZWIxZjdlMDNiMTBhZDc3MDg0ZjAxMTdhOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4ODcwNTEyfQ.ArI737VRatpSDwpvr9xnpzgMTRLlgkD2Ld45eNTEYmf18PIVFCyPjarVOTnu97gG-_aaYmgGrmqdvRYVtvfhoQXfvVoAe-OOzq2KcwUR3T5aAepa1dvJ-njMxAC2gh7wgi-uu6b40Xb8vzy4Y1hmbfoXV3vb-rYXdtiyZBzKVJNgRipwATzkeHH2Zkmr1hcq97Ttd85veUv7-jwEd2BM6jH5Eh4Z8pV6VUKSGcFrIw9MQxqvyGLIUlAteTpCpL_AaC7wT9jVzjEbRc_zhmZX_xbu3HxRakCyVK2oURZxZA7-93NIR0PNRYQCvbadG0ActkyNtqmyLfMkjNYY5ZQVNA Download .mp4 (1.21 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Plus-end-Directed Kinesin-5 KIF11 (Green) Organizes CAMSAP3-C Nucleated Dynamic Microtubules (Magenta) into Nematic Networks of Extensile Bundles, Related to Figure 1Protein concentrations were: tubulin - 30 μM, mCherry-CAMSAP3-C - 1000 nM, and KIF11-mGFP – 27 nM. Time is in min:s. Imaging was carried out at 33°C. Reducing the CAMSAP3-C concentration lowered the efficiency of nematic network formation by dynamic microtubules and KIF11 (Figure 2A). To understand the reason behind this tendency, we measured the microtubule growth and KIF11 speeds under conditions similar to the self-organization experiments. Plus-end growth speeds decreased slightly with increasing CAMSAP3-C concentration (Figure 2B), probably as a consequence of soluble tubulin depletion at increased nucleation efficiencies resulting in more microtubule polymer (Figure 2C). The KIF11 speed was slightly higher than the microtubule growth speeds (Figures 2B, gray range, and S2E). Nevertheless, KIF11 did not form asters in self-organization experiments by coalescing microtubule plus-ends (Figure 2C) but distributed uniformly throughout the nematic network at the higher CAMSAP3-C concentrations (Figure 1F). These results indicate that increased microtubule densities present at higher CAMSAP3-C concentrations may hinder aster formation by promoting bundling of unsorted microtubules despite the motors moving slightly faster than microtubules grow. To understand KIF11-dependent network assembly, we explored the experimental phase space of microtubule organization. Keeping the CAMSAP3-C concentration fixed (500 nM), we lowered the tubulin concentration to reduce the microtubule plus-end growth speed (Figure 3A) and the amount of polymerized tubulin (Figure 3B). Networks of extensile bundles still formed, but more slowly (Figure 3C). At further reduced tubulin concentration, initially bundled networks appeared to form and began to polarity-sort and contract, as indicated by the local increase of the microtubule and KIF11 intensities (Figure 3D; Video S2). However, over time these foci dissolved accompanied by the relaxation and disengagement of the network as indicated by a rather diffuse distribution of microtubules and motors. Remarkably, when the tubulin concentration was further lowered and the KIF11 concentration increased, isolated asters formed. Strong motor accumulation in the aster center indicated that microtubules were polarity-sorted with their plus-ends focused inward (Figure 3E; Video S3). Increasing both the KIF11 and the tubulin concentration produced tense interconnected contractile networks (Figure 3F). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3YWNjYzhkZmE2ZTdiNzM4NGM4NGY3MmY0MDZkYzYzNCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4ODcwNTEyfQ.irKCZMc1IS7BupH5Wno5IIb47cJVuRpWxqSncZ-iEoUpj0aUdGMJ6DyAmtTQcjaxoGR-d39ny84GZOocRjbyGUMLX_BpN4s1eVQCRV8qrFgXZg3Y4rD2ieVVwKO0XlFv8pGl9p_L8msPO5MKAbfT5VzJczhfgxPHyqyZ4IdOOGVfQI1yLnHnXCzWhWjqv2HWJYvKDpzVcmUzkF7PIr6KdYPjk3Z75AFBVCF5QXPvi4ard1tati5rV1NbVkFrR0UHMmkgBz1SXYLakfTyy5oYg4OlNRFZA6trBqNpkrXmUaqW0aKZVwXIFzpDrr905XZuf-qhmxo-lc9DQ1SM96hS1A Download .mp4 (1.17 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2.

Plus-end-Directed Kinesin-5 KIF11 (green) Organizes CAMSAP3-C Nucleated Dynamic Microtubules (Magenta) into Locally Contractile Polar Networks or Asters, Related to Figure 3Protein concentrations were: tubulin – 7.5 μM, mCherry-CAMSAP3-C - 500 nM, and KIF11-mGFP – 82 nM. Time is in min:s. Imaging was carried out at 33°C. These results demonstrate that the same motor can form either locally extensile nematic or locally contractile polar networks simply depending on the protein composition of the system. High tubulin and low KIF11 concentrations promote nematic network organization (Figure 3G, left, blue), in agreement with high concentrations of static microtubules being a requirement for nematic network formation in the presence of crowding agents (Henkin et al., 2014Henkin G. DeCamp S.J. Chen D.T. Sanchez T. Dogic Z. Tunable dynamics of microtubule-based active isotropic gels.Philos. Trans. A Math. Phys. Eng.

Spontaneous motion in hierarchically assembled active matter.Nature. 2012; 491: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased KIF11 concentrations at low tubulin concentrations produced isolated asters (Figure 3G, left, black) or globally contracting networks (Figure 3G, left, purple). The specific outcome of self-organization also depends critically on the CAMSAP3-C concentration (Figure 3G,right), which affects both the microtubule density and indirectly their growth speed (Figures 2B and 2C). Taken together, higher microtubule concentrations and higher growth speeds promote nematic network formation (Figure 3G, right, blue), whereas slow growth speeds and sparse microtubules promote polar network organization (Figure 3G, right, black). To understand mechanistically how dynamic microtubules and crosslinking motors drive network self-organization, we investigated the organizational phase space with three-dimensional numerical simulations using Cytosim (Nedelec and Foethke, 2007Nedelec F.

The Pro-Code technology enables simultaneous high-dimensional protein-level phenotyping of 100s of genes with single-cell resolution. There are more than 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome, as well as 100s of non-coding RNA genes, including microRNAs. Although there has been progress in assigning functions to many genes, we still do not know all the functions of each gene or the role of many genes in driving or affecting disease. Determining the functions of every gene, in different normal and disease processes, is one of the major goals of the post-genome era. The technology exists to knockout (KO), knockdown (KD), or overexpress (OE) any gene using vectors encoding a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) or shRNA. However, KO, KD, or OE of every gene in a genome in distinct experimental systems is cumbersome, costly, and very time consuming. For in vivo studies, it is even more challenging and not practically feasible. This has led to the increasing use of pooled genetic screens aimed at determining the functions of 100s of genes simultaneously in a single experimental system. Pooled screens have been made possible by using DNA to barcode vectors. Unique nucleotide sequences can be incorporated in to a vector, or alternatively, when the vector encodes an shRNA or CRISPR gRNA, the shRNA or gRNA sequence becomes the barcode (Bassik et al., 2009Bassik M.C. Lebbink R.J. Churchman L.S. Ingolia N.T. Patena W. LeProust E.M. Schuldiner M. Weissman J.S. McManus M.T. Rapid creation and quantitative monitoring of high coverage shRNA libraries.Nat.

Genet. 2015; 16: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Cells can be transduced with 100s of vectors simultaneously, and the frequency of cells carrying each vector can be determined by deep-sequencing (Mullokandov et al., 2012Mullokandov G. Baccarini A. Ruzo A. Jayaprakash A.D. Tung N. Israelow B. Evans M.J. Sachidanandam R. Brown B.D. High-throughput assessment of microRNA activity and function using microRNA sensor and decoy libraries.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The function of a particular gene is inferred by applying a selective pressure, such as time or a drug, and measuring changes in the frequency of each barcode associated with a particular shRNA or gRNA. DNA barcoding has major limitations. One of the most significant is that the readout is performed on bulk cells, which means single cells cannot be readily analyzed. This is a problem for many reasons, but one is that KO, KD, and OE does not occur in 100% of cells, and thus analyzing in bulk includes a mix of cells with and without the genetic perturbation. Another limitation is that DNA barcoding does not enable cells to be directly phenotyped. Instead, the phenotype associated with each gene perturbation is inferred from changes in barcode frequency. This has limited pooled screens largely to vetting genes for their potential impact on cell fitness and inferring a change in shRNA/gRNA frequency is due to KD/KO influencing proliferation or survival (Shalem et al., 2015Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Zhang F. High-throughput functional genomics using CRISPR-Cas9.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). More informative phenotypes, such as upregulation or downregulation of specific proteins, cannot be easily assessed in screens using DNA barcodes. Recently, CRISPR screens have been coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and vector-encoded RNA used as a barcode (Adamson et al., 2016Adamson B. Norman T.M. Jost M. Cho M.Y. Nuñez J.K. Chen Y. Villalta J.E. Gilbert L.A.

This enabled more high-content and high-resolution screens. However, the cell throughput is relatively restrained, and important protein-level phenotypic information, such as signaling alterations, cannot be measured. Here, we show that combinatorial arrangements of linear epitopes can be used to generate a protein barcoding system (Pro-Codes), which is capable of overcoming many limitations of current pooled screening technology. We synthesized sequences encoding 3 combinations of 14 different linear epitopes to create 364 Pro-Codes. Pro-Code-expressing vectors were introduced into cells, and we could simultaneously detect all 364 Pro-Code-expressing cell populations. By pairing each Pro-Code with a different CRISPR gRNA, we were able to analyze multiple proteins on dozens of knockouts with single-cell resolution. We used Pro-Code/CRISPR vectors to screen for genes that influence breast cancer sensitivity and resistance to antigen-specific T cell killing and found evidence that two interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulated genes, the immunoproteasome component Psmb8 and a poorly characterized chaperone Rtp4, are important for antigen-dependent immune editing. Within the same screen, we also found that Socs1 is a negative regulator of the immune checkpoint Pd-l1. This work establishes a new barcoding system that enables simultaneous high-dimensional phenotypic analysis of 100s of genes, at single-cell resolution, with broad applications for helping to advance gene annotation. We sought to generate a vector barcoding system that operates at the protein level, as this would allow us to multiplex many gene delivery vectors together and detect them in cells using high-throughput, single-cell resolution technologies, such as flow and mass cytometry, and enable complex phenotyping. Proteins such as GFP and RFP can be used as vector reporters, but each fluorescent protein requires its own detection channel, which limits the number of unique fluorescent reporters that can be used together, generally to 3 or 4, because fluorescent proteins have broad emission spectrums that can overlap. To solve this problem, we hypothesized that combinations of a limited number of antibody-detectable epitopes (n) could be arranged together in specific multiples (r) to form a higher order set of barcodes (C) (Figure 1A). Using this strategy, as few as 10 epitopes can be arranged in sets of 3 to create 120 unique combinations, and with just 20 epitopes and 7 positions, 77,520 combinations can be generated. We reasoned linear epitopes would be needed to assemble the barcodes because they can be encoded by a short sequence (18–42 nucleotides). We selected 10 linear epitopes for which there are antibodies for detection. Among these were epitopes commonly used as protein tags, such as HA and FLAG (Table S1). We synthesized the DNA sequence encoding each epitope and assembled them in every possible combination of 3, for a total of 120 different 3-epitope combinations. We fused each epitope combination to dNGFR, a truncated receptor without an intracellular domain, which is commonly used as a reporter protein (Mullokandov et al., 2012Mullokandov G. Baccarini A. Ruzo A. Jayaprakash A.D. Tung N. Israelow B. Evans M.J. Sachidanandam R. Brown B.D. High-throughput assessment of microRNA activity and function using microRNA sensor and decoy libraries.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This served as a scaffold to facilitate epitope transport to the cell surface (Figure 1A). Each of the 120 3-epitope/dNGFR combinations (herein referred to as Pro-Codes) were cloned into lentiviral vectors (LV) downstream of the EF1a promoter. Vector plasmids were pooled in equimolar ratio and used to make a pool of LV encoding the Pro-Codes. We transduced 293T kidney cells with a pool of 18 LVs each encoding a different 3-epitope Pro-Code. The cells were transduced at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) so each cell was only transduced with a single Pro-Code vector. The cells were then harvested and stained with antibodies for NGFR and all 10 of the linear epitopes. Each of the antibodies were conjugated with a different metal, and samples were analyzed on a time-of-flight mass cytometer (CyTOF) (Figure 1B). We used mass cytometry because CyTOF permits detection of over 45 different metal-conjugated antibodies (Bendall et al., 2011Bendall S.C. Simonds E.F. Qiu P. Amir E. -a. D. Krutzik P.O. Finck R. Bruggner R.V. Melamed R. Trejo A. Ornatsky O.I. et al.Single-cell mass cytometry of differential immune and drug responses across a human hematopoietic continuum.Science. 2011; 332: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) and would thus enable detection of the Pro-Code epitopes along with more than 35 phenotypic markers. All 10 epitope tags were detected with a clear signal over background, and all of the epitope-positive cells were positive for NGFR (Figure S1A). To determine if we could resolve cells expressing specific Pro-Codes, we analyzed NGFR+ cells using a debarcoder algorithm (Fread et al., 2017Fread K.I. Strickland W.D. Nolan G.P. Zunder E.R. An unpdated debarcoding tool for mass cytometry with cell type-specific and cell sample-specific stringency adjustment.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2017; 22: 588-598PubMed Google Scholar). Eighteen distinct cell populations were detected (Figures 1C and S1B), with each population corresponding to a unique Pro-Code (i.e., positive for precisely 3 of the 10 epitopes). For example, one population of cells was positive for the E3, E4, and E5 epitopes and negative for all other epitopes, indicating the cells expressed the E3-E4-E5 Pro-Code (Figure S1C). We clustered NGFR+ cells based on their epitope tag expression. Once again 18 distinct populations were identified with each cluster positive for only 3 epitopes and thus corresponding precisely to a specific Pro-Code (Figures 1D and 1E). To determine if we could increase the number of epitopes per Pro-Code, we generated 14 Pro-Codes with 4 epitopes per Pro-Code. We cloned each one in to an LV, transduced 293T with the pool, and analyzed by CyTOF. We detected all 10 epitopes, and cells were positive for 4 epitopes. This enabled us to identify all 14 4-epitope Pro-Code populations (Figure S1D). Next, we pooled 120 different 3-epitope Pro-Code plasmids together in a roughly equimolar ratio and made a library of LV. We transduced 293T, as well as monocytic cells (THP1), leukemic T cells (Jurkat), and mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) with the 120 vector library. After 1 week, cells were stained with the 10 metal-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by CyTOF. Unsupervised clustering resolved 120 distinct populations (Figures 1F–1I), with each population corresponding to one Pro-Code (Figures 1J and S2A–S2C). The frequency of each population ranged from 0.1% to 3%, with the majority of Pro-Code populations (65%) being between 0.4%–1.5% (Figure S2D), which is close to the expected frequency of 0.83% if each of the 120 Pro-Codes was in equimolar concentration. Using an expanded set of 14 epitopes, we generated 364 3-epitope Pro-Code vectors and introduced them in to 293T. The cells were stained for NGFR and all 14 epitopes, analyzed by CyTOF, and all 364 Pro-Code-expressing populations were readily identified and clustered (Figure S3). Thus, with only 14 antibodies (i.e., 14 detection channels), we could detect 364 different vector-expressing cell populations. These results demonstrate that combinations of linear epitopes can be used to generate protein barcodes detectable at the protein level and at single-cell resolution. One important application of vector barcoding is in cell clone and lineage tracing (Lu et al., 2011Lu R. Neff N.F. Quake S.R. Weissman I.L. Tracking single hematopoietic stem cells in vivo using high-throughput sequencing in conjunction with viral genetic barcoding.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Fluorescent proteins provide a powerful way to do this, but the number of populations that can be tracked is quite limited. DNA barcodes can tag an almost infinite number of cells, but only provide bulk resolution. The Pro-Codes could potentially be used for clone tracking, but an important requirement is in vivo use. To address this, we transduced 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells with a pool of 120 Pro-Code vectors at low MOI. Cells were sorted based on NGFR, as dNGFR serves not only as a Pro-Code scaffold, but also as a selectable marker of transduced cells. The transduced cells were injected in to the right and left mammary gland of wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5 mice, 2 tumors per mouse) (Figure 2A). Because cells expressing non-self-proteins can be subject to immune clearance in immunocompetent animals, we also injected Rag1−/− immunodeficient mice for comparison (n = 6 mice, 2 tumors per mouse). Mice were sacrificed 14 days after cell injection, and 18 different tumors were removed and cultured for 3 days to enrich for the cancer cells. The cells were stained for NGFR and each of the 10 Pro-Code epitopes. We were able to identify 118–120 Pro-Code populations in each tumor (Figure 2B). While the proportion of each population varied for different Pro-Codes, this reflected a bias in the original population, as indicated by the comparison of each Pro-Code’s frequency in the pre-inoculation cells versus the tumors. Importantly, there was no significant difference in the proportion of the vast majority of Pro-Code populations in WT or Rag1−/− mice. This demonstrates the Pro-Codes are not differentially rejected and can be used in vivo. Although each mouse was injected with the same pool of cells, the specific Pro-Code composition of each tumor was different (Figure 2C). While most individual Pro-Codes were present in <1% of tumor cells, there was variability in the percent of each Pro-Code between tumors and mice. For each tumor, we plotted the proportion of the 10 most abundant Pro-Codes (Figure 2D). The same initial mix of 120 Pro-Code subpopulations developed into heterogenic tumors, in which 10 populations accounted for up to 50% of the total cell number. Some Pro-Code populations were abundant in every tumor (e.g., Pro-Codes 108 and 21), but their proportion within each tumor varied greatly, whereas other Pro-Code populations were only abundant in a single tumor, such as Pro-Code 6 (Figure 2D). These results support a model in which clonal growth was largely stochastic and not impacted by the Pro-Codes and demonstrate Pro-Codes can be used for cell tracking studies. One of the advantages of the Pro-Codes is that it could permit addition of protein-level phenotyping in genetic screens. To test this possibility, we generated 96 CRISPR gRNAs targeting 54 different genes (1–3 gRNA/gene) and paired each gRNA with a different Pro-Code. As it has recently been reported that packaging vector pools together can lead to varying degrees of barcode swapping (Hill et al., 2018Hill A.J. McFaline-Figueroa J.L. Starita L.M. Gasperini M.J.

The cells were cultured for 10 days, then stained for NGFR, the Pro-Codes, and CD4, CD40, CD44, CD45, CD116, CD164, CD220, HLA-A, HLA-DR, and IFNGR1, which were all targeted by CRISPR gRNAs in the vector library (Figure 3A). We then analyzed 500,000 cells by CyTOF. All 96 Pro-Code populations were resolved and clustered. This enabled us to examine expression of the surface proteins on each of the 96 Pro-Code/CRISPR populations with single-cell resolution. In each Pro-Code population in which one of the membrane-bound proteins was targeted, there was an increase in the percent of cells negative for the cognate protein (Figures 3B and 3C). For example, in cells expressing Pro-Code 3, which was linked to a gRNA targeting the CD4 gene, 85% of the cells were CD4 negative, whereas cells expressing Pro-Codes linked to gRNAs targeting unrelated genes were almost all CD4 positive (Figures 3B, 3C, and S4A). High efficiency protein loss was also observed for CD44, CD45, CD116, CD164, CD220, and IFNGR1. HLA-A (MHC class I) was expressed by >90% of cells in each Pro-Code/CRISPR cluster, except those expressing Pro-Codes 23 and 24, which were linked to gRNAs targeting B2m; in these populations 45% and 80% of THP1 were HLA-A negative, respectively. As B2m is required for HLA stability, the loss of HLA in these clusters represents a downstream phenotype of B2m KO. There was little evidence of KO for some gRNAs, consistent with the known variability in CRISPR efficiency between gRNAs. These results demonstrate Pro-Codes can mark cells encoding a specific CRISPR gRNA. They also demonstrate how Pro-Codes enable protein-level phenotyping in pooled CRISPR screens. The library used above was made with vectors packaged individually and pooled subsequently. This prevents the possibility of barcode swapping. Recently, it was reported in pre-print studies that swapping can be reduced by co-packaging libraries with a low homology transfer vector (Adamson et al., 2018Adamson B. Norman T.M. Jost M. Weissman J.S. Approaches to maximize sgRNA-barcode coupling in Perturb-seq screens.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/298349Crossref Google Scholar, Feldman et al., 2018Feldman D. Singh A.

Lentiviral co-packaging mitigates the effects of intermolecular recombination and multiple integrations in pooled genetic screens.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/262121Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine if this would be compatible with the Pro-Codes, we produced the 96 Pro-Code/CRISPR library as a pool and during vector packaging we spiked in a plasmid encoding an LV-expressing GFP and no CRISPR or Pro-Code. THP1-Cas9 cells were transduced with the 96 Pro-Code/CRISPR library at low MOI. The cells were stained for NGFR, the Pro-Code epitopes, and all 10 membrane-bound molecules, as above. We also stained for GFP to distinguish cells transduced with the GFP encoding LV in the pool and analyzed cells by CyTOF. Similar to the library made with individually packaged vectors, we resolved all 96 Pro-Code populations and consistently observed loss of a specific protein on a high percent of cells expressing a Pro-Code linked to a gRNA targeting the cognate gene (Figures S4B and S4C). The frequency of cells negative for the targeted protein was ∼90% similar between the libraries generated with vectors produced individually or as a pool with the low homology spike in vector. These results indicate Pro-Code/CRISPR libraries can be produced as a pool and function at high efficiency and further support the ability of Pro-Codes to facilitate high-dimensional phenotypic screens. Intracellular signaling plays an essential role in numerous cellular processes. The activation and de-activation of specific proteins in signaling pathways is a post-translational event and is thus optimally studied at the protein level. This makes it challenging to directly assess signaling alterations with current screening approaches. We decided to test if the Pro-Codes would facilitate a genetic screen of STAT signaling. STAT proteins function downstream of cytokine receptors. When different cytokines engage their cognate receptors, specific STAT proteins are phosphorylated and transmit the cytokine signal. IFNγ engagement of the IFNγ receptor (comprised of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 subunits) triggers phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT1), whereas interleukin (IL)-6 induces pSTAT1 and pSTAT3, and GM-CSF induces pSTAT5 (Figures 4A and 4B ). We constructed a library of 24 LVs, each encoding a different Pro-Code and gRNA (Figure 4C). The gRNAs targeted the IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL6R (IL-6 receptor), and CD116 (GM-CSF receptor) genes. We generated 5–6 gRNAs/gene, as well as one control gRNA targeting an irrelevant gene and cloned each one with a different Pro-Code. THP1-Cas9 cells were transduced with the pool of Pro-Code/CRISPR vectors. After 1 week the cells were stimulated with IFNγ, GM-CSF, IL-6, or PBS. After 15 min, cells were fixed, stained with metal-conjugated antibodies specific for the Pro-Code epitopes, as well as pSTAT1, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5, and analyzed by CyTOF. All 24 Pro-Code populations were resolved and uniquely clustered (Figures 4D and S5A). We examined the expression of pSTAT1, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5 in each Pro-Code population. In all cases, we observed decreased phospho-signaling in cells expressing a Pro-Code linked to a gRNA targeting the cognate receptor (Figures 4E–4H and S5B). Looking at the mean change in signaling, there was a 15-fold decrease in pSTAT1 levels in cells expressing Pro-Codes linked to gRNAs targeting IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 (Figures 4E and 4F). In cells expressing the same Pro-Code/CRISPRs, pSTAT5, pSTAT1, and pSTAT3 levels were normal in response to GM-CSF and IL-6. This indicated the IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 gRNAs only impaired pSTAT1 signaling in response to IFNγ. Similarly, in cells encoding the Pro-Codes linked to gRNAs targeting GM-CSF there was a 3-fold reduction in pSTAT5 levels in response to GM-CSF, and in cells carrying gRNAs targeting IL6R there was a 2-fold reduction in both pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels in response to IL-6 (Figures 4G and 4H). The ability to analyze the cells at single-cell resolution enabled us to look at the heterogeneity in each Pro-Code/CRISPR population of cells. When we treated cells with IFNγ, 70% of the cells in the Pro-Code clusters linked to gRNAs targeting CD116 and IL6R had increased pSTAT1, whereas in the Pro-Code clusters linked to gRNAs targeting IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, only ∼25% of the cells had increased pSTAT1 (Figures 4I and 4J). When the cells were treated with GM-CSF, 60%–70% of the cells in the clusters encoding gRNAs targeting IL6R, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 upregulated pSTAT5, but only 30%–40% of the cells in the Pro-Code clusters encoding CD116 gRNAs upregulated pSTAT5 (Figures 4I and 4J). Looking at the viSNE clusters, in which each dot is representative of a single cell, there were cells positive and negative for pSTAT (Figures 4J and S5). Thus, while the bulk analysis indicated a major reduction in pSTAT signaling downstream of the receptor targeted by a specific CRISPR, single-cell analysis indicated there was significant heterogeneity between cells even within the same Pro-Code cluster. This heterogeneity reflects biological differences between cells in their response to cytokine stimulation, but also reveals cell-to-cell heterogeneity in CRISPR KO, as observed in our studies above measuring the protein levels of the gene targeted by specific CRISPRs. This is not unexpected, as the editing efficiency of CRISPR is variable, but highlights the important utility of single-cell analysis in CRISPR screens. Together, these results demonstrate Pro-Codes enable direct single-cell phenotypic analysis of signaling pathways in CRISPR screens, which is not feasible with DNA or RNA level analysis. Cancer cells acquire mutations, which generate neo-antigens that are loaded on to MHC class I (MHC-I) and make the cancer cells targets for CD8+ T cell killing (Schumacher and Hacohen, 2016Schumacher T.N. Hacohen N. Neoantigens encoded in the cancer genome.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2016; 41: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, cancer cells can alter gene expression to resist being killed. Although some of the genes important for cancer immune editing have been identified, the potential contributions of many genes still need to be interrogated. Recently, several studies have performed pooled CRISPR screens, using DNA barcodes for deconvolution, to identify novel sensitivity and resistance genes (Manguso et al., 2017Manguso R.T. Pope H.W.

We set out to determine if we could use the Pro-Codes to aid in the identification of genes conferring cancer cell sensitivity or resistance to T cell immunity. We generated a library of 56 CRISPR gRNAs targeting 14 different genes (3–4 gRNAs/gene) and paired each CRISPR with a unique Pro-Code, to form a pool of 56 Pro-Code/CRISPR vectors (including 4 scrambled gRNAs) (Figure 5A). We selected the 14 genes to contain known regulators of immunity, such as B2m, and several genes with no known role, such as Cldn4. As a model of breast cancer, we utilized the 4T1 mammary carcinoma line. In previous screens, antigen-specific T cells targeting model tumor-associated antigen (TAA), such as OVA, gp100, and NY-ESO-1, were used (Manguso et al., 2017Manguso R.T. Pope H.W.

Our findings reveal how an interbacterial arms race has produced a unique solution for safeguarding the integrity of bacterial cell division machinery against inactivating post-translational modifications. Microbial communities are of fundamental importance to virtually all natural ecosystems. Although the term “communities” implies cooperation, it is now appreciated that antagonistic behavior directed against closely interacting microbes serves as a key driver of composition and resilience within these consortia (Foster and Bell, 2012Foster K.R. Bell T. Competition, not cooperation, dominates interactions among culturable microbial species.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1845-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Reflecting this central role of antagonism, pathways dedicated to interspecies antibacterial toxin delivery occur broadly throughout both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Jones et al., 2017Jones A.M.

These include the Esx pathway, prevalent in the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which is widespread in the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Pathogenic bacteria may use these pathways to facilitate invasion of or dominance within polymicrobial infections, whereas for commensal organisms they can dictate compatibility within consortia (Sana et al., 2016Sana T.G.

Contact-dependent interbacterial competition is generally mediated by secreted toxic effector proteins. Complex export machinery enables these effectors to access target molecules that reside within the cell envelope of competitor cells (Russell et al., 2011Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M.

Bryant D. et al.A broadly distributed toxin family mediates contact-dependent antagonism between gram-positive bacteria.eLife. 2017; 6: e26938Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The T6SS and Esx pathways deliver effectors indiscriminately; therefore, bacteria harboring effectors transported by these systems require a means of inhibiting self-intoxication. To date, protection against all characterized effectors of these systems has been shown to derive from the production of specific immunity determinants that bind cognate toxins and inhibit their enzymatic function (Alcoforado Diniz et al., 2015Alcoforado Diniz J. Liu Y.C. Coulthurst S.J. Molecular weaponry: diverse effectors delivered by the Type VI secretion system.Cell. Microbiol. 2015; 17: 1742-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cognate effector and immunity proteins, herein referred to as E-I pairs, are without known exception encoded adjacently. Identification and characterization of toxic effectors from a growing number of species has revealed that these proteins exhibit tremendous sequence and biochemical diversity. For instance, large superfamilies of toxins that share little homology beyond conserved catalytic residues target amide or glycosidic bonds in the bacterial cell wall, DNA, membrane phospholipids, and the cellular metabolite NAD+ (Alcoforado Diniz et al., 2015Alcoforado Diniz J. Liu Y.C. Coulthurst S.J. Molecular weaponry: diverse effectors delivered by the Type VI secretion system.Cell.

By targeting highly conserved, essential primary metabolites, interbacterial effectors allow bacteria to compete effectively against a wide phylogenetic cross-section of organisms. Multiple toxins targeting a broad array of cellular structures are often employed simultaneously by a single delivery pathway, which promotes bacterial competitiveness via synergistic toxigenic activities and widens the environmental conditions under which at least one effector is efficacious (LaCourse et al., 2018LaCourse K.D. Peterson S.B. Kulasekara H.D. Radey M.C. Kim J. Mougous J.D. Conditional toxicity and synergy drive diversity among antibacterial effectors.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite a high degree of toxin diversity, genes encoding effector proteins of interbacterial antagonistic systems are often readily recognizable in bacterial genomes. These genes are typically characterized by 5′ regions encoding conserved effector targeting domains and by polymorphic toxin modules encoded at their 3′ ends. Targeting domains linked to T6SS effectors include PAAR, RHS, and VgrG, whereas LXG is the sole domain so far implicated in the recognition of antibacterial substrates by the Esx pathway (Cianfanelli et al., 2016Cianfanelli F.R.

Bryant D. et al.A broadly distributed toxin family mediates contact-dependent antagonism between gram-positive bacteria.eLife. 2017; 6: e26938Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is substantial overlap in the modes of action of bacterial toxins that target eukaryotic host cells and those that target other bacteria. For instance, structurally related NADases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are employed to neutralize competing Gram-negative bacterial cells and to induce necrotic cell death in human macrophages, respectively (Sun et al., 2015Sun J. Siroy A. Lokareddy R.K. Speer A. Doornbos K.S. Cingolani G. Niederweis M. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.Nat. Struct. Mol.

In some cases, the same toxin may be capable of targeting cells of both domains, as described for T6SS-delivered phospholipases (Bleves, 2016Bleves S. Game of trans-kingdom effectors.Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24: 773-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results point toward the important role that interbacterial antagonism can play in shaping the toxin repertoire and emergence of bacterial pathogens. Here, we describe an interbacterial toxin that inactivates the critical cell division protein, FtsZ, via ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) activity. This toxin is the first characterized member of a large family of related ART toxins, with phylogenetically broadly distributed representatives bearing hallmarks of interbacterial effectors exported by the T6SS and the Esx pathway. Proteins with this activity, such as cholera and diphtheria toxins, are known to be widely utilized by pathogens (Simon et al., 2014Simon N.C. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. Novel bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins: structure and function.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); however, proteins with this activity have not previously been demonstrated to participate in interbacterial antagonism. Finally, structural analyses reveal that protection against ART toxins is conferred by bifunctional immunity determinants, which concomitantly utilize active site occlusion to inactivate cognate effector proteins and a promiscuous ADP-ribosylhydrolase (ARH) activity to reverse ART-catalyzed modifications more broadly. During the course of our efforts to define mechanisms of interbacterial competition, we found an uncharacterized protein domain common to predicted effectors of diverse contact-dependent antagonism pathways. In Gram-negative bacteria, this domain is found in proteins also containing PAAR, RHS, or both of these domains, indicative of intercellular delivery via the T6SS pathway (Figure 1A; Table S1) (Cianfanelli et al., 2016Cianfanelli F.R. Monlezun L. Coulthurst S.J. Aim, Load, Fire: The Type VI Secretion System, a Bacterial Nanoweapon.Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In Gram-positive species, proteins with this domain additionally contain LXG domains, indicative of transit through the Esx pathway (Whitney et al., 2017Whitney J.C. Peterson S.B. Kim J. Pazos M. Verster A.J. Radey M.C. Kulasekara H.D. Ching M.Q. Bullen N.P. Bryant D. et al.A broadly distributed toxin family mediates contact-dependent antagonism between gram-positive bacteria.eLife. 2017; 6: e26938Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In all cases, the uncharacterized domain resides at the C terminus of the protein—the stereotyped position in each of these systems for the toxin domain of their substrates. Subsequent sequence analyses showed that the domain possesses a constellation of conserved amino acids characteristic of RSE family ART enzymes (Figure 1B) (Cohen and Chang, 2018Cohen M.S. Chang P. Insights into the biogenesis, function, and regulation of ADP-ribosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Bacterial members of this family include eukaryotic cell-targeting toxins; however, members of this family are not known to act between bacterial cells. ADP-ribosylation can be a reversible modification, and enzymes belonging to the ARH family are known to catalyze ADP-ribose removal (Cohen and Chang, 2018Cohen M.S. Chang P. Insights into the biogenesis, function, and regulation of ADP-ribosylation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2018; 14: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noted that the genes immediately downstream of predicted antibacterial RSE family genes encode ARH family proteins (Figure 1C; Table S1). Immunity determinants of interbacterial toxins are typically encoded in this position, suggesting that the role of these proteins may be to provide protection from ART-based intoxication via hydrolysis of ADP-ribose adducts. The active site of ARH proteins contains metal ions coordinated by a network of conserved, predominately acidic, residues (Berthold et al., 2009Berthold C.L. Wang H. Nordlund S. Högbom M. Mechanism of ADP-ribosylation removal revealed by the structure and ligand complexes of the dimanganese mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase DraG.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14247-14252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These amino acids are conserved in the ARH family proteins we identified, further suggesting an enzymatic mechanism of immunity (Figure 1D). Taken together with prior bioinformatic analyses (Aravind et al., 2015Aravind L. Zhang D. de Souza R.F. Anand S. Iyer L.M. The natural history of ADP-ribosyltransferases and the ADP-ribosylation system.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2015; 384: 3-32PubMed Google Scholar), these observations led us to hypothesize that toxins with ART activity are widespread mediators of bacterial competition. To investigate the potential for ART enzymes to mediate interbacterial antagonism, we initially focused on a predicted ART toxin of Serratia proteamaculans. This protein, which we termed Tre1 (type VI secretion ADP-ribosyltransferase effector 1), contains an N-terminal PAAR domain, a configuration consistent with known T6SS effector proteins (Figure 1A). Relative to control E. coli cultures, those expressing Tre1 or its c-terminal toxin domain (Tre1tox) displayed a significant loss in colony forming units (Figure 2A). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that this loss in viability was associated with both cellular elongation and lysis (Figures 2B and S1A; Videos S1 and S2). To determine whether the toxicity of Tre1 derives from its predicted ART activity, we expressed a Tre1tox protein in which the catalytic glutamic acid within the RSE motif is substituted with glutamine (Tre1toxE415Q) (Tsuge et al., 2003Tsuge H. Nagahama M. Nishimura H. Hisatsune J. Sakaguchi Y. Itogawa Y. Katunuma N. Sakurai J. Crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis of enzymatic components from Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite expression levels matching that of Tre1tox, this predicted catalytically inactive protein did not reduce E. coli viability, nor did it promote cell elongation and lysis to levels approaching the wild-type (Figures 2A, 2C, S1A, and S1B; Videos S1 and S2). Co-expression of Tre1tox with the predicted ARH family protein encoded downstream, which we subsequently refer to as Tri1, restored the viability of E. coli to that of the control (Figures 2A and S1A). Together, these data demonstrate that Tre1 and Tri1 are an E-I pair, and they are consistent with the toxicity of Tre1 deriving from its ART-like domain.Figure S1Induction of Tre1tox Expression Leads to Death of E. coli Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Viable E. coli cells recovered following induction of expression of the indicated proteins.

Time-Lapse Phase Contrast Microscopy Series of E. coli Containing an Empty Vector (Left) or Expressing Tre1tox (Right), Related to Figure 2 We next sought to determine whether Tre1 functions as an interbacterial T6SS toxin. To this end, we used allelic exchange to generate a strain of S. proteamaculans bearing a deletion of the tre1 tri1 locus (Figure S1C). Growth competition assays performed under contact-promoting conditions revealed that this strain exhibits a fitness defect when incubated with wild-type, but not with S. proteamaculans lacking a functional T6SS (ΔicmF) (Figure 2D). To determine the contribution of the putative catalytic activity of Tre1 to this phenotype, we generated a S. proteamaculans strain expressing the E415Q allele from the native tre1 chromosomal locus (tre1E415Q). Tre1E415Q was produced at the same level as the native protein, yet unlike wild-type S. proteamaculans, the strain producing this variant displayed equal fitness with Δtre1 Δtri1 in co-culture (Figures 2D and S1D). These data show that Tre1 and Tri1 can function as a T6S-dependent E-I pair between cells of S. proteamaculans. In other bacteria, T6S-exported toxins can be delivered to competing Gram-negative organisms and thus enhance the fitness of the producing organism during co-culture with other species. Indeed, we found that inactivation of the S. proteamaculans T6SS significantly diminished fitness in co-culture with E. coli (Figure 2E). We next measured the contribution of the toxic activity of Tre1 to this phenotype. The S. proteamaculans tre1E415Q strain was employed in this experiment, because removing a PAAR domain-containing effector can lead to a generalized structural perturbation of the secretory apparatus. Our results showed that Tre1 inactivation yields a strain with fitness intermediate to that of wild-type and ΔicmF strains, consistent with Tre1 constituting one component of a multi-part effector payload delivered by this S. proteamaculans T6S pathway (Figure 2E). Ectopic expression of Tri1 in E. coli abrogated the tre1-dependent fitness advantage of wild-type, further confirming the contribution of this toxin to antagonism of E. coli by S. proteamaculans (Figure 2E). Bioinformatic analysis of Tri1 suggested that, unlike previously characterized immunity determinants of toxins delivered between bacteria, it could provide protection from intoxication via an enzymatic mechanism. However, we found that Tri1 stably interacts with Tre1, a feature shared with immunity proteins that function by inhibiting the active site of their cognate toxin (Figures S2A and S2B). To gain insight into both the mechanism of Tre1-induced toxicity and of Tri1-mediated immunity, we determined a 2.3 Å X-ray crystal structure of Tre1tox in complex with Tri1 (Figure 3A). Phases were obtained experimentally using selenomethionine-substituted protein, and molecular replacement with the resulting model was used to solve the structure of the native crystal in a second space group (Table S3). In our structure, the exclusively α-helical Tri1 and mixed α,β-Tre1 share an extensive interaction surface (2,604 Å2) consisting of two distinct regions: the plane formed between the two globular domains of the proteins (1,178 Å2) and an interface formed by a 65-amino acid N-terminal extension (NTE) of Tri1 (1,550 Å2). This striking structural feature of Tri1 extends away from the core of the immunity protein, reaches into the active site of the toxin, and at its distal end returns to pack into the Tre1tox -Tri1 globular domain interface (Figure 3A and 3B).Figure 3Tri1 Provides Immunity to Intoxication by Tre1 through Two Structurally Distinct MechanismsShow full caption(A) Ribbon diagram representation of the X-ray crystal structure of Tre1tox (yellow) in complex with Tri1 (blue).

The structure revealed that Tre1 shares a high degree of similarly to the catalytic domains of RSE-type ART enzymes (Figure 3C) (Cohen and Chang, 2018Cohen M.S. Chang P.

https://openalex.org/W2897902358,"Food aversions develop when the taste of a novel food is associated with sickness, which often occurs after food poisoning or chemotherapy treatment. We identified calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) as sufficient and necessary for establishing a conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Photoactivating projections from CGRPPBN neurons to either the central nucleus of the amygdala or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis can also induce robust CTA. CGRPPBN neurons undergo plasticity following CTA, and inactivation of either Arc or Grin1 (genes involved in memory consolidation) prevents establishment of a strong CTA. Calcium imaging reveals that the novel food re-activates CGRPPBN neurons after conditioning. Inhibition of these neurons or inactivation of the Grin1 gene after conditioning attenuates CTA expression. Our results indicate that CGRPPBN neurons not only play a key role for learning food aversions but also contribute to the maintenance and expression of those memories."
https://openalex.org/W2896104239,"The super elongation complex (SEC) is required for robust and productive transcription through release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with its P-TEFb module and promoting transcriptional processivity with its ELL2 subunit. Malfunction of SEC contributes to multiple human diseases including cancer. Here, we identify peptidomimetic lead compounds, KL-1 and its structural homolog KL-2, which disrupt the interaction between the SEC scaffolding protein AFF4 and P-TEFb, resulting in impaired release of Pol II from promoter-proximal pause sites and a reduced average rate of processive transcription elongation. SEC is required for induction of heat-shock genes and treating cells with KL-1 and KL-2 attenuates the heat-shock response from Drosophila to human. SEC inhibition downregulates MYC and MYC-dependent transcriptional programs in mammalian cells and delays tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model of MYC-driven cancer, indicating that small-molecule disruptors of SEC could be used for targeted therapy of MYC-induced cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2765660648,"CRISPR-Cas systems confer an adaptive immunity against viruses. Following viral injection, Cas1-Cas2 integrates segments of the viral genome (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, efficient ""primed"" spacer acquisition and viral degradation (interference) require both the Cascade complex and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease. Here, we present single-molecule characterization of the Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) primed acquisition complex (PAC). We show that TfuCascade rapidly samples non-specific DNA via facilitated one-dimensional diffusion. Cas3 loads at target-bound Cascade and the Cascade/Cas3 complex translocates via a looped DNA intermediate. Cascade/Cas3 complexes stall at diverse protein roadblocks, resulting in a double strand break at the stall site. In contrast, Cas1-Cas2 samples DNA transiently via 3D collisions. Moreover, Cas1-Cas2 associates with Cascade and translocates with Cascade/Cas3, forming the PAC. PACs can displace different protein roadblocks, suggesting a mechanism for long-range spacer acquisition. This work provides a molecular basis for the coordinated steps in CRISPR-based adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2896653780,"Teenage pregnancy and child marriage are prevalent in Zambia and are complexly interrelated issues with common causes and effects. The aim of this study was to explore factors in the social and cultural environment shaping young people's sexual behaviour, with specific attention to teenage pregnancy and child marriage in Eastern Zambia. The study was conducted in selected wards in Petauke, Chadiza and Katete districts, using an exploratory mixed-method design including a household survey, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The participants included 1,434 young females and males aged 15 to 24, female and male parents and caregivers; grandmothers; traditional leaders; teachers; health and social workers; representatives from youth associations, community-based and non-governmental organizations; and district level policy makers. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis and NVivo was used to manage the data, while survey data were analysed using Stata. The study revealed a high prevalence rate of teenage pregnancy (48%) and child marriage (13%) among young women. The mean age at first pregnancy or fatherhood was lower among female (17) than male respondents (20). A clear interlinkage between teenage pregnancy and child marriage was found, the two issues were mutually reinforcing. While teenage pregnancy appeared both as a cause and consequence of child marriage, marriage was mostly a common response to pregnancy. Early sexual debut, limited knowledge and use of contraception, poverty and limited future perspectives as well as sexual and gender norms were identified as the main causative factors of teenage pregnancy and therefore, child marriage. Based on the findings, a conceptual model to explain the interrelationships between young people's sexual behaviour, teenage pregnancy and child marriage is discussed. To address teenage pregnancy and child marriage in Eastern Zambia, there is a need to look into the realities and needs of young people regarding sex and relationships."

Application of CLOC to the yeast pheromone response pathway revealed surprisingly distinct dynamic requirements for three well-studied feedback regulators. CLOC, a marriage of control theory and traditional genetics, presents a broadly applicable methodology for defining the dynamic function of biological feedback regulators. The classical genetic complementation experiment tests whether phenotypes produced by a mutation can be rescued by the wild-type allele (Collins et al., 2006Collins S.R. Schuldiner M. Krogan N.J. Weissman J.S. A strategy for extracting and analyzing large-scale quantitative epistatic interaction data.Genome Biol. 2006; 7 (R63)Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This experiment, however, does not reveal whether the time-dependent regulation of the corresponding gene or gene product is important for maintaining the wild-type phenotype. Such knowledge is particularly germane to feedback regulation in signaling and transcriptional networks, where the dynamic interplay between pathway activity and feedback activation enables cells to monitor and adjust the activity of upstream components in real time. Feedback regulation is a widespread cellular strategy that underlies diverse cellular behaviors, including perfect adaptation (Alon et al., 1999Alon U. Surette M.G. Barkai N. Leibler S. Robustness in bacterial chemotaxis.Nature. 1999; 397: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), multi-stability (Xiong and Ferrell, 2003Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. A positive-feedback-based bistable ‘memory module’ that governs a cell fate decision.Nature. 2003; 426: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and oscillations (Tsai et al., 2008Tsai T.Y.-C.

Robust, tunable biological oscillations from interlinked positive and negative feedback loops.Science. 2008; 321: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In these contexts, feedback plays a dominant qualitative role that can be assessed by inference because its loss usually induces visible disruption of a phenotype; for example, loss of oscillations (Lahav et al., 2004Lahav G. Rosenfeld N. Sigal A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Levine A.J. Elowitz M.B. Alon U. Dynamics of the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop in individual cells.Nat.

A systems-level analysis of perfect adaptation in yeast osmoregulation.Cell. 2009; 138: 160-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, the majority of feedback loops seem to play quantitative roles, fine-tuning the operation of cellular pathways to demands and fluctuations in the environment (Nevozhay et al., 2009Nevozhay D. Adams R.M. Murphy K.F. Josic K. Balázsi G. Negative autoregulation linearizes the dose-response and suppresses the heterogeneity of gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Such regulation is challenging to understand quantitatively because the input-output relationship of many interconnected signaling components must be measured and modeled mathematically (Garmendia-Torres et al., 2007Garmendia-Torres C.

Cellular noise suppression by the regulator of G protein signaling Sst2.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We describe here a general method to study cellular feedback regulation that employs and updates the conceptual framework of genetic compensation experiments (Figure 1A). In this approach, we define a quantitative, dynamic phenotype associated with the loss of a pathway-controlled regulator: the time-dependent difference between the outputs of the wild-type and mutant pathways. We use this information and a minimal mathematical model to compute continuously, for every time point at which the output is measured, how much of the missing regulator needs to be added back into the cell to rescue this phenotype and restore wild-type output dynamics. We then inject the computed level of the regulator into the mutant cell using an optogenetic construct that controls its transcription. In this closed-loop optogenetic compensation (CLOC) approach, both fully and partially compensatory inputs produce focused hypotheses about the temporal demands on the feedback regulator. Below, we describe how we have applied CLOC to three well-studied negative regulators of the yeast pheromone response mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase Msg5, the disheveled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin domain-regulatory of G protein signaling (DEP-RGS) protein Sst2, and the Gα protein Gpa1. Our studies reveal distinct dynamic requirements for each of these pheromone-induced regulatory factors and also reveal the power of elucidating the timescales of gene function, which cannot be fully interrogated by compensation with static genetic alleles. The yeast mating pheromone response pathway is a model signal transduction network (Bardwell, 2005Bardwell L. A walk-through of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.Peptides. 2005; 26: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) where extensive work mapping pathway components and interactions has identified numerous feedback regulators (Kaffman et al., 1998Kaffman A.

Proteomics. 2005; 4: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the binding of mating pheromone to the G-protein-coupled receptor Ste2 (a cells) or Ste3 (α cells) is transduced by a MAPK cascade into activation of the transcription factor Ste12. Ste12 drives the expression of genes required for mating as well as genes encoding for pathway components that regulate upstream signaling. We investigated three such negative regulators whose transcription is stimulated by pheromones: Sst2 (Dietzel and Kurjan, 1987Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Pheromonal regulation and sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SST2 gene: a model for desensitization to pheromone.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), Msg5 (Doi et al., 1994Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. MSG5, a novel protein phosphatase promotes adaptation to pheromone response in S. cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and Gpa1 (Nakayama et al., 1988Nakayama N. Kaziro Y. Arai K. Matsumoto K. Role of STE genes in the mating factor signaling pathway mediated by GPA1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3777-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). Gpa1 is the α subunit of the receptor-controlled G protein that inhibits the Gβγ complex (Ste4–Ste18), which, when freed from inhibition, is the key activator of the MAPK cascade. Msg5 is the dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates the MAPK Fus3. Sst2 is the DEP-RGS protein that enhances guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by Gpa1, terminating signaling and promoting receptor downregulation. Although these three negative regulators are well-studied, how their temporal regulation by the MAPK pathway shapes signaling dynamics is not well understood. To study the dynamic requirements of these pheromone-controlled pathway regulators, we constructed feedback-deficient mutants (sst2Δ, msg5Δ, and gpa1Δ) in which the endogenous Ste12-inducible copy of each gene is knocked out and replaced with a corresponding optogenetically inducible copy (Figure 1C). This effectively replaces the native Ste12-activated expression of the feedback regulators with expression that can be experimentally activated with light. Light-based inputs, which can be easily varied in time and magnitude, are particularly well suited for fine, dynamic control of gene expression. We used a modified version of a previously reported cryptochrome-based optogenetic expression system (Kennedy et al., 2010Kennedy M.J. Hughes R.M. Peteya L.A. Schwartz J.W. Ehlers M.D. Tucker C.L. Rapid blue-light-mediated induction of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 12-16Crossref Scopus (757) Google Scholar) in which the cytochrome protein Cry2phr is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and its interacting partner Cib1 is fused to the activation domain of Rtg3 (Rothermel et al., 1997Rothermel B.A. Thornton J.L. Butow R.A. Rtg3p, a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper protein that functions in mitochondrial-induced changes in gene expression, contains independent activation domains.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19801-19807Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by blue light, Cry2phr-Gal4DBD undergoes a conformational change that enables it to bind Cib1-Rtg3AD and drive expression from the pGAL1 promoter of either Sst2 (Opto-Sste2), Msg5 (Opto-Msg5), or Gpa1 (Opto-Gpa1). The Cry2phr-Gal4DBD optogenetic construct was effective at expressing these proteins, and we observed robust and dose-dependent repression of pathway output upon exposure to blue light, as measured by a pheromone-responsive pAGA1-YFP reporter (McCullagh et al., 2010McCullagh E.

To assess the effect of removing Sst2, Msg5, or Gpa1 on mating pathway-signaling dynamics, we used α-factor to induce each feedback-deficient mutant in the dark (with no induction of Opto-Msg5, Opto-Sst2, or Opto-Gpa1) and compared its pathway output with that of the wild-type (Figure 1D). In sst2Δ cells, the difference in pathway output relative to wild-type increases steadily over time, whereas, in msg5Δ cells, this difference remains roughly constant for the duration of the experiment after an initial rise. Unlike the other mutants, gpa1Δ cells display a quantitative and reproducible increase in basal signaling prior to pheromone addition. This initial difference in pathway activity decreases during early induction and then increases as gpa1Δ reaches a higher maximum pathway activity than the wild-type. One strategy for restoring wild-type pathway dynamics in the feedback-deficient mutants would be to iteratively test predetermined optogenetic inputs until one that restores wild-type output is found. This strategy, referred to in engineering as open-loop control, requires a predictive understanding of how pathway output changes as a function of optogenetic input and can therefore be unreliable if this function is affected by day-to-day variation in pathway behavior (Milias-Argeitis et al., 2011Milias-Argeitis A.

The alternative “closed-loop” approach would leverage the same strategy that endogenous cellular feedback loops use to produce robust signaling dynamics; namely, to monitor the pathway output in real time and correspondingly adjust the activity of the feedback regulators (Figure 2). In our case, this entails real-time, in silico adjustment of the optogenetic input to change in vivo regulator expression and, in this fashion, staple the output of the mutant to that of the wild-type. Similar closed-loop control schemes have recently been used to control intracellular processes in live cells (Milias-Argeitis et al., 2011Milias-Argeitis A. Summers S. Stewart-Ornstein J. Zuleta I.

Historically, they form the basis of patch-clamp studies in neurobiology (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.J. Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (14349) Google Scholar), where a controller-supplied current that is updated in real time to compensate for neuron voltage changes serves as a proxy for measuring endogenous neuron currents. To accomplish closed-loop control, we designed and fabricated an automated yeast culturing, light delivery, and cytometric measurement device (Figure 2A). The device consists of eight temperature-controlled and aerated yeast incubators with individually addressable and integrated blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for light delivery. A selection valve and syringe pump is used to automate the addition of fresh medium and α-factor to the cultures as well as the injection of culture into a flow cytometer to measure pathway activity. The device is controlled via customized code that allows the user to set experimental parameters, including measurement frequency and the timing of α-factor introduction (Methods S1). The device uses a particular closed-loop control strategy, model predictive control (MPC) (Borrelli et al., 2017Borrelli, F., Bemporad, A., and Morari, M. (2017) Predictive control for linear and hybrid systems. https://www.cambridge.org/vi/academic/subjects/engineering/control-systems-and-optimization/predictive-control-linear-and-hybrid-systems?format=HB.Google Scholar), to determine the appropriate optogenetic input for CLOC from real-time output measurements of the mating pathway (Figure 2B). Although MPC requires the construction of a rudimentary model of the system, it has the advantage over system-agnostic control schemes such as the classical proportional-integral-derivative method in that it is better suited for systems with significant delays, such as those inherent to transcription and translation (Fiore et al., 2016Fiore G. Perrino G. di Bernardo M. di Bernardo D. In Vivo Real-Time Control of Gene Expression: A Comparative Analysis of Feedback Control Strategies in Yeast.ACS Synth. Biol. 2016; 5: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MPC is better able to circumvent these delays because, by design, it considers what input is needed now to adequately guide the system in the future. We chose a two-state ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that yielded a simplified description of how pAGA1-YFP expression responds to both mating pheromone (α-factor) and light in the feedback-deficient mutants (Methods S1). The two variables described in the model represent the dynamics of light-induced expression of the feedback regulator and the measured fluorescent output in response to this regulator. This model is a parsimonious and generic description, and we chose it with the explicit intent of developing a generalized approach without the need for detailed mechanistic models. During a typical CLOC experiment, we induce signaling using α-factor and measure the pAGA1-YFP output via flow cytometry. The MPC controller uses this measurement to estimate the states of the ODE model and then selects a light input that the model predicts minimizes the future difference between the activity of the mutant pathway and the desired wild-type pathway (Figure 2C). This light input is then applied to the mutants for 15 min, at which point the operation is repeated. The states of the model are re-estimated based on the current measurements of pAGA1-YFP, and a new light input is selected and administered. Using our automated closed-loop control device, we performed time-dependent genetic compensation of the sst2Δ, msg5Δ, and gpa1Δ strains with Opto-Sst2, Opto-Msg5, and Opto-Gpa1, respectively. In each case, we initially tested constant-light induction of the negative regulator in an open loop (that is, without changing light input as a function of pAGA1-YFP measurements) for a range of light"
https://openalex.org/W2896145479,"One of the main inputs driving striatal activity is the thalamostriatal projection. While the hypothesis postulating that the different thalamostriatal projections contribute differentially to shape the functions of the striatum is largely accepted, existing technical limitations have hampered efforts to prove it. Here, through the use of electrophysiological recordings of antidromically photo-identified thalamostriatal neurons and the optogenetic inhibition of thalamostriatal terminals, we identify that the thalamostriatal projections from the parafascicular and the ventroposterior regions of the thalamus contribute to the smooth initiation and the appropriate execution of a sequence of movements. Our results support a model in which both thalamostriatal projections have specific contributions to the initiation and execution of sequences, highlighting the specific contribution of the ventroposterior thalamostriatal connection for the repetition of actions."
https://openalex.org/W2897771749,"An integrative computational approach leverages data from model systems and human genome-wide studies to predict genes that have a functional role in disease. Effective discovery of causal disease genes must overcome the statistical challenges of quantitative genetics studies and the practical limitations of human biology experiments. Here we developed diseaseQUEST, an integrative approach that combines data from human genome-wide disease studies with in silico network models of tissue- and cell-type-specific function in model organisms to prioritize candidates within functionally conserved processes and pathways. We used diseaseQUEST to predict candidate genes for 25 different diseases and traits, including cancer, longevity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Focusing on Parkinson's disease (PD), a diseaseQUEST-directed Caenhorhabditis elegans behavioral screen identified several candidate genes, which we experimentally verified and found to be associated with age-dependent motility defects mirroring PD clinical symptoms. Furthermore, knockdown of the top candidate gene, bcat-1, encoding a branched chain amino acid transferase, caused spasm-like 'curling' and neurodegeneration in C. elegans, paralleling decreased BCAT1 expression in PD patient brains. diseaseQUEST is modular and generalizable to other model organisms and human diseases of interest."

In the brain, both ATP7A and ATP7B are present; however, the role of ATP7B, which is highly homologous to ATP7A, remains unclear. We hypothesized that ATP7B may affect DBH activity indirectly by altering Cu levels in the cytosol or regulating the cellular behavior of DBH. By testing this hypothesis, we discovered a previously unanticipated role for both of the Cu transporters in the regulation of DBH export from neuronal cells. DBH exists in three forms, which have different fates within the secretory pathway (Fig. 1). Membrane-bound DBH is targeted to secretory granules. In granules, it converts DA to NE, which is released from cells in response to neuronal activation. Soluble DBH is generated from the membrane-bound DBH through proteolysis, which occurs in the early compartments of the secretory pathway, most likely in the TGN (19Sabban E.L. Greene L.A.

Biophys. 1991; 290 (1929417): 503-51010.1016/0003-9861(91)90573-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and then exported from cells under resting conditions (export/constitutive secretion). The fraction of soluble DBH directed for constitutive secretion is relatively minor (7–12% of a newly synthesized DBH (21Oyarce A.M. Fleming P.J. Multiple forms of human dopamine β-hydroxylase in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290 (1929417): 503-51010.1016/0003-9861(91)90573-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with very little known about this process. Available data suggest that the constitutive secretion maintains stable levels of DBH in the cerebrospinal fluid, as these levels are independent of neuronal activity (22O'Connor D.T. Cervenka J.H. Stone R.A. Levine G.L. Parmer R.J. Franco-Bourland R.E. Madrazo I. Langlais P.J. Robertson D. Biaggioni I. Dopamine β-hydroxylase immunoreactivity in human cerebrospinal fluid: Properties, relationship to central noradrenergic neuronal activity and variation in Parkinson's disease and congenital dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency.Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1994; 86 (8143425): 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that the constitutive secretion of DBH requires Cu and is tightly and oppositely regulated by ATP7A and ATP7B. This unexpected finding brought to light a new functional link between Cu homeostasis and catecholamine balance; thus the results of this study have implication for several neuropsychiatric disorders, in which Cu levels in noradrenergic neurons are altered. To better understand the role of copper transporters in regulating DBH, we first characterized the Cu status of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major hub of DBH expressing neurons in the central nervous system (Fig. 2a). Previously, the importance of Cu homeostasis in the LC was suggested by its high Cu content in humans (23Naeve G.S. Vana A.M. Eggold J.R. Kelner G.S. Maki R. Desouza E.B. Foster A.C. Expression profile of the copper homeostasis gene, rAtox1, in the rat brain.Neuroscience. 1999; 93 (10473283): 1179-118710.1016/S0306-4522(99)00175-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Popescu B.F. Nichol H. Mapping brain metals to evaluate therapies for neurodegenerative disease.CNS Neurosci.

To determine whether high Cu in the LC is common for different species, we quantitatively imaged Cu in coronal sections of adult mouse brain using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). The LC was identified by high DBH expression (Fig. 2b). Throughout the entire coronal section, Cu levels were fairly uniform (Fig. 2c). The notable exceptions were ventricles, where Cu enters the brain (25Nishihara E. Furuyama T. Yamashita S. Mori N. Expression of copper trafficking genes in the mouse brain.Neuroreport. 1998; 9 (9831461): 3259-326310.1097/00001756-199810050-00023Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the LC: both regions had much higher Cu levels compared with the rest of the parenchyma (Fig. 2d). In ventricles, several metals were elevated including copper, potassium, and zinc. In the LC, only Cu was elevated (Fig. 2c). To account for possible variations in the sections’ thickness, we normalized the Cu levels to zinc and found that Cu levels in the LC were three times higher than in the pons (1.01 ± 0.08 versus 0.33 ± 0.01 mm) (Fig. 2, e and f). This significant enrichment of Cu in the LC across species pointed to the importance of Cu homeostasis in LC physiology. To determine whether ATP7A regulates Cu homeostasis in the LC alone or together with ATP7B, we immunostained mouse brain sections with anti-ATP7A or anti-ATP7B antibodies (Fig. 3). Co-staining with DBH, used as an LC marker, demonstrated that ATP7A was present in mouse LC and was more abundant in this region compared with the surrounding tissue (Fig. 3a). Immunostaining of ATP7B also showed expression and similar enrichment of ATP7B in the LC (Fig. 3b). The specificity of ATP7B staining was confirmed by the absence of a signal in the LC of the ATP7B−/− brain (Fig. 3c). The specificity of ATP7A antibody was verified by the presence in the Western blotting of the band with the expected mass in cells expressing ATP7A and the absence of this band in HepG2 cells (which do not express ATP7A). Within the LC, ATP7A and ATP7B were present in the same neurons, but their intracellular localization was very different. ATP7B was vesicular and distributed throughout the cytosol, whereas ATP7A was perinuclear and clustered at the side of the nucleus (Fig. 3d). There was little, if any, overlap between the ATP7A and ATP7B patterns. Thus, both of the Cu transporters contribute to Cu homeostasis in the LC neurons and appear to function in distinct intracellular compartments. Mouse LC is tiny (∼0.03 mm3) and difficult to study biochemically. Consequently, to characterize the role of Cu homeostasis in DBH regulation, we initially used SH-SY5Y cells. These cells express adrenergic markers and can be differentiated to have a neuron-like morphology (26Kovalevich J. Langford D. Considerations for the use of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in neurobiology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1078 (23975817): 9-2110.1007/978-1-62703-640-5_2Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). ATP7A and ATP7B were both expressed in either nondifferentiated or differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4a) in agreement with a previous report (27Hatori Y. Yan Y. Schmidt K. Furukawa E. Hasan N.M. Yang N. Liu C.N. Sockanathan S. Lutsenko S. Neuronal differentiation is associated with a redox-regulated increase of copper flow to the secretory pathway.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (26879543)1064010.1038/ncomms10640Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similar to the LC, in SH-SY5Y cells ATP7A had a predominantly asymmetric perinuclear pattern (Fig. 4c). Co-staining with TGN46 (a marker of the trans-Golgi network) demonstrated that ATP7A was targeted primarily to the TGN. A small fraction of ATP7A was detected in vesicles (Fig. 4c). The ATP7B pattern was mostly vesicular, and the overlap with TGN46 was minor (Fig. 4d). Similar to the LC neurons, there was little overlap between ATP7A and ATP7B in vesicles (Fig. 4e). To test whether the co-expression of ATP7A and ATP7B would be observed in other DBH-containing neurons, we examined primary cortical neurons. In these cells, ATP7A and ATP7B were both expressed; ATP7A was found clustered at the axonal side of the nuclei, whereas ATP7B was present in vesicles distributed around the nucleus and in the cytosol (Fig. 4f). Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells have high levels of DBH and produce both the soluble (smaller) DBH and the membrane-bound (larger) DBH (Fig. 4a). Typically, two bands (membrane-bound and soluble) are detected on Western blots; occasionally, the lower band appears as a doublet (Fig. 4b). SH-SY5Y cells export soluble DBH under basal (resting) conditions (Fig. 4b, upper panel). The nonsaturable time-dependent increase in the amount of extracellular DBH (Fig. 4b) indicates that the export of soluble DBH significantly exceeded the re-uptake. To measure DBH activity, we analyzed the hydroxylation of the DBH substrate tyramine in the presence and absence of a specific DBH inhibitor, nepicastat. Over 75% of the tyramine hydroxylation was because of DBH activity (Fig. 4b, lower left). The activity of DBH in the extracellular medium increased with time and positively correlated with the amount of DBH protein (Fig. 4b, lower right). Thus, similar to LC neurons, SH-SY5Y cells express and secrete active DBH and have relevant Cu transporters to regulate Cu homeostasis. These characteristics make SH-SY5Y cells a useful model for studying the role of Cu in DBH regulation. DBH has a complex intracellular behavior, which includes proteolytic processing, sorting within the secretory pathway, and export. To determine whether any of these steps depend on the activity of ATP7A and/or ATP7B, we individually decreased ATP7A and ATP7B levels in SH-SY5Y cells using siRNA (Fig. 5a). The maximum down-regulation using nucleofection was ∼50% for either ATP7A or ATP7B (Fig. 5b). Down-regulation of ATP7A did not cause a compensatory up-regulation of ATP7B (a slight decrease in protein intensity was observed), and reciprocally, down-regulation of ATP7B did not significantly alter the ATP7A levels (Fig. 5b). This lack of significant changes in the abundance of one Cu-ATPase in response to down-regulation of the other is consistent with a previously reported lack of such compensatory changes in a brain (28Niciu M.J. Ma X.M. El Meskini R. Pachter J.S. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Altered ATP7A expression and other compensatory responses in a murine model of Menkes disease.Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 27 (17588765): 278-29110.1016/j.nbd.2007.05.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The DBH protein levels showed a trend toward being higher upon down-regulation of either ATP7A or ATP7B (1.21 ± 0.14, n = 3, p = 0.2; and 1.50 ± 0.19, n = 3, p = 0.054, respectively), but the increase was not statistically significant. The most notable effect was on the abundance of extracellular DBH under resting conditions (constitutive secretion), which was significantly and oppositely affected by the ATP7A and ATP7B knockdowns (Fig. 5d). The down-regulation of ATP7A decreased the amount of DBH in the growth medium by 20% (0.81 ± 0.06, p = 0.0265) compared with cells treated with a nontargeting siRNA, whereas ATP7B knockdown increased the extracellular levels of DBH by 53% (1.53 ± 0.13, p = 0.004) (Fig. 5c). To better characterize the relationship between the two Cu transporters and DBH export, we correlated the remaining cellular levels of ATP7A or ATP7B after siRNA treatment with the amount of extracellular DBH (Fig. 5d). The levels of ATP7A in cells positively correlated with the amount of exported DBH (Fig. 5d, upper panel), i.e. ATP7A facilitates the export of DBH. In contrast, the protein levels of ATP7B showed negative correlation with the secreted DBH (Fig. 5d, lower panel), i.e. ATP7B was inhibitory to DBH secretion. The activity of DBH in the extracellular medium remained proportional to DBH protein, independently of which Cu transporter was inhibited (Fig. 5e). Specifically, ATP7A down-regulation decreased the total DBH activity in the medium by 23% (0.28 ± 0.01 versus 0.36 ± 0.04, p = 0.116), whereas ATP7B knockdown increased the DBH activity in the medium by ∼60% (0.58 ± 0.02 versus 0.36 ± 0.04, p = 0.002). Normalizing DBH activity to DBH protein confirmed that the specific activity of extracellular DBH was largely unaffected by either ATP7A or ATP7B knockdowns (93 ± 4% of control for ATP7A knockdown and 105 ± 3% of control for ATP7B knockdown) (Fig. 5f). This result suggests that DBH is exported from cells in an active Cu-bound form and that DBH activation and export could be coupled. The significant increase in total DBH activity, with no change in DBH activity/protein (Fig. 5g), strongly suggests that ATP7B negatively regulates the abundance of extracellular DBH (rather than its enzymatic activity), which is a novel function for this transporter. The role of either ATP7A or ATP7B in regulating protein secretion has not been reported previously. To better understand how ATP7A and ATP7B can influence the export of soluble DBH, we first determined whether under basal conditions ATP7A and/or ATP7B were targeted to DBH-containing vesicles or secretory granules. For the purpose of this study, we defined secretory granules as DBH-positive compartments with an average diameter of 0.45–1.12 μm and intense DBH staining. The smaller, more heterogeneous compartments with a less intense DBH staining were defined as vesicles. Our co-immunostaining experiments illustrate that ATP7A does not co-localize with DBH in either vesicles or granules (Fig. 6a, left panels). This result was not surprising because ATP7A is targeted primarily to the TGN (as expected). ATP7B and DBH both show vesicular localization; however, these vesicles are distinct, i.e. ATP7B is not targeted to DBH-positive vesicles/granules (Fig. 6a, right panels). The lack of co-localization between DBH and ATP7B was also observed in primary neurons (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these data demonstrate that neither ATP7A nor ATP7B is present at detectable levels in the DBH-positive post-Golgi compartments. Therefore, they regulate vesicular DBH indirectly, most likely by influencing Cu levels in cells. The loading of the DBH catalytic site with Cu, which likely takes place when DBH traffics through the TGN on its way to vesicles/granules, may contribute to the regulation of DBH cellular distribution. At this point, our data could be rationalized by the following model. In noradrenergic neurons, ATP7A is targeted to the TGN and transfers Cu to DBH when a newly synthesized DBH traffics through the TGN to its final destinations. ATP7B functions in vesicles to sequester excess Cu away from ATP7A and inhibits excessive DBH secretion. To test the predicted role of ATP7B in limiting Cu access to ATP7A, we overexpressed ATP7B in SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons using adenovirus-mediated infection (Fig. 7a). Changes in cytosolic Cu were evaluated by measuring the mRNA levels for the copper chaperone CCS, which are responsive to cytosolic Cu levels and are higher when Cu is low, at least in some tissues (29Fu S. Jiang W. Zheng W. Age-dependent increase of brain copper levels and expressions of copper regulatory proteins in the subventricular zone and choroid plexus.Front Mol. Neurosci. 2015; 8 (26106293): 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Han H. Archibeque S.L. Engle T.E. Characterization and identification of hepatic mRNA related to copper metabolism and homeostasis in cattle.Biol. Trace Elem.

Upon ATP7B overexpression, the abundance of CCS mRNA increased 2-fold, consistent with a decrease in cytosolic Cu (Fig. 7b). The levels of ATP7A were unchanged (Fig. 7c). Under these conditions, the amounts of intracellular DBH increased (Fig. 7d) and extracellular DBH decreased significantly (Fig. 7e). Thus, the excess ATP7B limits Cu levels in the cytosol, and this deficiency inhibits DBH export. To verify that the inhibition of constitutive DBH secretion was related to ATP7B activity and not merely protein overexpression, we measured the levels of extracellular DBH following expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of ATP7B, ATP7B-D1027A (Fig. 7f). This inactive mutant was expressed at higher levels than the WT ATP7B but produced no change in DBH secretion (Fig. 7f). We confirmed these findings in the primary cortical neurons (Fig. 7g). Overexpression of ATP7B in these neurons showed an increase in intracellular DBH (Fig. 7g), whereas extracellular DBH was markedly decreased (Fig. 7h). Inhibition of DBH export was not observed when neurons expressed an inactive ATP7B-D1027A mutant. These results confirm that the activity of ATP7B is responsible for the regulation of DBH export. The down-regulation of ATP7A is expected to increase Cu levels in the cytosol (at least temporarily), whereas overexpression of ATP7B decreases cytosolic Cu; yet both manipulations inhibit DBH export. It is possible that either high or low cytosolic Cu inhibits DBH export. More likely, the inhibition of DBH secretion is a result of insufficient Cu availability in the lumen of the TGN (which would occur upon either ATP7A down-regulation or ATP7B overexpression). To test more directly whether low and/or high Cu influence constitutive secretion of DBH, we treated the SH-SY5Y cells for 5 and 16 h with either excess Cu or a combination of an extracellular Cu chelator, bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), and an intracellular Cu chelator, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), to decrease Cu levels (Fig. 8, a and b). Excess Cu within a physiological range of concentrations did not significantly alter the levels of extracellular DBH (Fig. 8b). In contrast, Cu limitation significantly inhibited DBH export, and the effect was stronger with a longer chelation time. Depleting Cu for 16 h increased DBH in cells by ∼5-fold compared with nontreated cells (Fig. 8a). Concomitantly, DBH concentration in the medium was decreased by 43% (Fig. 8b). Thus, we concluded that Cu is required for constitutive export of DBH. DBH retention in cells upon Cu depletion could be caused by the inhibition of proteolytic processing within the secretory pathway. However, analysis of the proteolytic pattern of DBH under low and high Cu (as well as following the knockdowns of the Cu transporters) revealed that neither condition blocked the proteolytic conversion of membrane-bound DBH (Fig. 8a). With a prolonged Cu chelation, the shorter variant of DBH was not only produced but was more abundant. Consequently, to bett"

However, it is unknown how CHD2 mutations lead to impaired brain function. Here we report mice with heterozygous mutations in Chd2 exhibit deficits in neuron proliferation and a shift in neuronal excitability that included divergent changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function. Further in vivo experiments show that Chd2+/- mice displayed aberrant cortical rhythmogenesis and severe deficits in long-term memory, consistent with phenotypes observed in humans. We identified broad, age-dependent transcriptional changes in Chd2+/- mice, including alterations in neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, and disease-related genes. Deficits in interneuron density and memory caused by Chd2+/- were reproduced by Chd2 mutation restricted to a subset of inhibitory neurons and corrected by interneuron transplantation. Our results provide initial insight into how Chd2 haploinsufficiency leads to aberrant cortical network function and impaired memory."

The mechanisms that regulate DNMT1 activity and targeting are complex and poorly understood. We used embryonic stem (ES) cells to investigate the function of the uncharacterized bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domains and the glycine–lysine (GK) repeats that join the regulatory and catalytic domains of DNMT1. We removed the BAH domains by means of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion within the endogenous Dnmt1 locus.

The data indicate that ablation of the BAH domains causes DNMT1 to be excluded from replication foci even in the presence of the replication focus–targeting sequence (RFTS). The GK repeats resemble the N-terminal tails of histones H2A and H4 and are normally acetylated. Substitution of lysines within the GK repeats with arginines to prevent acetylation did not alter the maintenance activity of DNMT1 but unexpectedly activated de novo methylation of paternal imprinting control regions (ICRs) in mouse ES cells; maternal ICRs remained unmethylated. We propose a model under which DNMT1 deposits paternal imprints in male germ cells in an acetylation-dependent manner.

There has been a focus on the mechanism of interaction of UHRF1 and DNMT1, but little attention has been directed to the function of well-conserved domains located within the N-terminal regulatory region of DNMT1 that are not known to interact with UHRF1. Two bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domains of unknown function are conserved among nearly all DNMT1 homologs. BAH domains are present in ∼20 mammalian proteins of diverse function. Some BAH domains have been reported to bind to histone tails in a modification-dependent manner (for a review, see Ref. 18Yang N. Xu R.-M. Structure and function of the BAH domain in chromatin biology.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 48 (23181513): 211-22110.3109/10409238.2012.742035Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). BAH domains fall into two general groups: ORC1-like and SIR3-like. In DNMT1, BAH1 is a member of the ORC1-like group, and BAH2 is a member of the SIR3-like group. Just C-terminal of BAH2, a stretch of alternating lysine and glycine residues (the GK repeats) joins the N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal catalytic domain (19Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding DNA methyltransferase of mouse cells. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the mammalian enzymes is related to bacterial restriction methyltransferases.J. Mol.

Yang H. Fang J. Ma L. Gong R. Wang P. Li Z. Xu Y. Molecular mechanism for USP7-mediated DNMT1 stabilization by acetylation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25960197): 702310.1038/ncomms8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but recent data indicate that the stability of DNMT1 is independent of the GK repeats and of USP7 (21Yarychkivska O. Tavana O. Gu W. Bestor T.H. Independent functions of DNMT1 and USP7 at replication foci.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (29482658): 910.1186/s13072-018-0179-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have addressed the function of the BAH domains and the GK repeats. We found that the BAH domains are required for maintenance methylation by mediating the association of DNMT1 with replication foci during S phase. Substitution of the GK repeats with GR repeats did not affect DNMT1 protein stability and did not affect maintenance methylation in vivo. It was very surprising to find that the GR substitution caused de novo methylation specifically of imprinting control regions (ICRs) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that are normally methylated in male germ cells; maternal ICRs remained unmethylated. These and other data suggest that DNMT1 is likely to be involved in the de novo methylation of paternal ICRs in male germ cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, DNMT1 contains multiple functional domains. In the crystal structure of DNMT1 bound to unmethylated DNA (5Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331 (21163962): 1036-104010.1126/science.1195380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), the BAH domains are remote from the active site of the catalytic domain, but an acidic autoinhibitory linker extends from BAH1 to the CXXC domain, which binds to unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and prevents their entry into the active site of the catalytic domain (5Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331 (21163962): 1036-104010.1126/science.1195380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). BAH2 extends a long solvent-exposed loop (the BAH2-TRD loop) that interacts with the target recognition domain (TRD) within the catalytic domain. The function of this interaction is unknown. Both the BAH1 autoinhibitory linker and the BAH2-TRD loops bind to the BAH-binding pockets (Fig. 1C) that in other proteins interact with histone tails in a manner that depends on the modification status of lysine residues (for a review, see Ref. 18Yang N. Xu R.-M. Structure and function of the BAH domain in chromatin biology.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

In the case of DNMT1, BAH1 binds to a sequence centered on Leu-721, whereas BAH2 binds to Phe-952; lysines are not involved in either case. However, interaction with neighboring lysines cannot be excluded as the BAH1-CXXC linker shifts positions between different conformations of DNMT1 (5Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331 (21163962): 1036-104010.1126/science.1195380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Z.-M.

To address the functions of the BAH domains, the endogenous Dnmt1 locus was modified by Cas9-mediated deletion of exons 11–16 (Fig. 2A), which encode only the BAH domains and leave the remainder of the protein intact. The joining of exons 10 and 17 produces an in-frame splicing event. As shown in Fig. 2B, the DNMT1 protein lacking the BAH domains is stable and produced at levels very similar to that of the full-length protein. Internally deleted protein does not aggregate in the cytoplasm and localizes to the nucleus as does full-length DNMT1 (Fig. 2C). Two ES cell clones that had undergone homozygous deletions were subjected to further study. DNMT1 is present at constant levels in populations of dividing cells but is recruited to replication foci at S phase (6Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei.Cell. 1992; 71 (1423634): 865-87310.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-PAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, deletion of the BAH domains caused a failure of DNMT1 to be incorporated into replication foci with >90% of S-phase cells displaying a diffuse nucleoplasmic localization in independent clones. This was unexpected as the RFTS is intact in the internally deleted protein, and recruitment of DNMT1 to replication foci had been reported to involve binding of the RFTS domain to histone H3 ubiquitylated by UHRF1 (16Ishiyama S.

In addition, the isolated RFTS domain is capable of localizing to replication foci (6Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei.Cell. 1992; 71 (1423634): 865-87310.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-PAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The diffuse nucleoplasmic localization phenotype observed in cells with the BAH deletion is similar to that of Uhrf1-null ES cells (23Sharif J. Muto M. Takebayashi S. Suetake I. Iwamatsu A. Endo T.A. Shinga J. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Toyoda T. Okamura K. Tajima S. Mitsuya K. Okano M. Koseki H. The SRA protein Np95 mediates epigenetic inheritance by recruiting Dnmt1 to methylated DNA.Nature. 2007; 450 (17994007): 908-91210.1038/nature06397Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). These data indicate that BAH domains are required for targeting of DNMT1 to replication foci during S phase even in the presence of the RFTS and UHRF1. As shown in Fig. 2D, the BAH-deleted form of DNMT1 was unable to maintain DNA methylation genome-wide or at IAP retrotransposons and major satellite DNA, sequences that are normally densely methylated. Minor satellite DNA was partially methylated (Fig. 2D), which confirms that BAH-deleted DNMT1 has enzymatic activity in vivo. The inability of BAH-deleted DNMT1 to perform maintenance methylation is consistent with the failure of the protein to be incorporated into replication foci. All known DNMT1 homologs contain at least one GK dipeptide between the N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal catalytic domain (Fig. 3A) (21Yarychkivska O. Tavana O. Gu W. Bestor T.H. Independent functions of DNMT1 and USP7 at replication foci.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (29482658): 910.1186/s13072-018-0179-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DIM-2, a DNMT1 homolog from the ascomycete Neurospora crassa, has a single GK dipeptide at this position (24Kouzminova E. Selker E.U. dim-2 encodes a DNA methyltransferase responsible for all known cytosine methylation in Neurospora.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11483533): 4309-432310.1093/emboj/20.15.4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). DNMT1 homologs of eutherian mammals contain 13 alternating Gly and Lys residues. The GK repeats are not resolved in any of the extant DNMT1 crystal structures and are likely to be very mobile; they are rendered in Fig. 1B to show the approximate spatial relationship of the GK repeats to the other domains of DNMT1. The GK repeats resemble the N-terminal tails of histones H2A and H4, which are also highly flexible. It had been previously shown that the GK repeats were not required for the stabilization of DNMT1 protein (21Yarychkivska O. Tavana O. Gu W. Bestor T.H. Independent functions of DNMT1 and USP7 at replication foci.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (29482658): 910.1186/s13072-018-0179-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The GK repeats are subject to acetylation at multiple lysine residues (25Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. Grishin N.V. White M. Yang X.-J. Zhao Y. Substrate and functional diversity of lysine acetylation revealed by a proteomics survey.Mol.

We tested the function of the GK repeats by replacement of each of the lysines with arginine, which maintains the basic nature of the sequence but prevents acetylation. Full-length DNMT1 bearing the GK → GR substitutions (Fig. 3B) was expressed in transfected Dnmt1−/− ES cells (26Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. De novo DNA cytosine methyltransferase activities in mouse embryonic stem cells.Development. 1996; 122 (8898232): 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under the control of the Dnmt1 promoter, which causes DNMT1 to be expressed at close to the levels of endogenous DNMT1 (27Damelin M. Bestor T.H. Biological functions of DNA methyltransferase 1 require its methyltransferase activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27 (17371843): 3891-389910.1128/MCB.00036-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, ES cell clones were obtained that expressed GR DNMT1 at levels very close to that of endogenous DNMT1. Levels of DNA methylation in cells expressing GR DNMT1 were compared with those of WT cells and Dnmt1−/− cells expressing recombinant GK DNMT1 of WT sequence. In contrast to the BAH deletion mutants, the GR mutants were capable of rescuing and maintaining DNA methylation genome-wide as assessed by luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) (Fig. 3E) and at IAP retrotransposons and minor satellite DNA (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the GK repeats are not essential for the genome-wide maintenance of DNA methylation. As was shown in Fig. 3D, both GR DNMT1 and GK DNMT1 were capable of restoring genome-wide DNA methylation when expressed in Dnmt1−/− ES cells. Dnmt1−/− ES cells expressing either GR DNMT1 or GK DNMT1 were examined by bisulfite genomic sequencing for methylation at ICRs where allele-specific methylation confers allele-specific expression to imprinted genes (28Li E.

We analyzed methylation of all known paternally methylated ICRs, H19, Dlk1/Gtl2, and Rasgrf1, and the following maternal ICRs: Igf2, Snrpn, Peg3, Kcnq1ot1, and Peg1. It had previously been reported that Dnmt1 rescue resulted in global genome remethylation, but allele-specific methylation at imprinted genes was not reestablished without passage through the germ line (31Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Germ-line passage is required for establishment of methylation and expression patterns of imprinted but not of nonimprinted genes.Genes Dev. 1996; 10 (8608936): 1008-102010.1101/gad.10.8.1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32McGraw S.

In accordance with these data, Dnmt1−/− ES cells that expressed GK DNMT1 showed full rescue of genome-wide DNA methylation but did not remethylate maternal or paternal ICRs. Surprisingly, in the presence of GR DNMT1, all paternally methylated ICRs (H19, Dlk1/Gtl2, and Rasgrf1) underwent de novo methylation, whereas maternal DMRs (Igf2, Snrpn, Peg3, Kcnq1ot1, and Peg1) remained unmethylated (Fig. 4). Paternal ICRs exhibited a statistically significant gain of methylation in GR as compared with GK cells (Fig. 4C). We performed bisulfite sequencing of ICRs in biological replicates, demonstrating reproducibility of de novo methylation at paternal ICRs. These data indicate that lysine-to-arginine substitution that prevents acetylation of the GK repeats activates de novo methylation specifically at paternal ICRs. The preference of DNMT1 for hemimethylated DNA could have been predicted to result simply from the selective recognition and methylation of hemimethylated DNA. However, there is no evidence that this occurs, and DNMT1 does not possess a domain that is able to recognize and bind hemimethylated DNA. DNMT1 has a CXXC domain that binds unmethylated DNA and is involved in autoinhibition (5Song J. Rechkoblit O. Bestor T.H. Patel D.J. Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.Science. 2011; 331 (21163962): 1036-104010.1126/science.1195380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In our study, we discovered that the BAH domains and the GK repeats are involved in two distinct targeting mechanisms, one to maintain DNA methylation in the case of BAH domains and one to carry out a novel function, de novo methylation of paternal imprints, in the case of the GK repeats. The function of the two BAH domains of DNMT1 had not been previously addressed. We used a novel Cas9-mediated approach to delete the exons that encode the BAH domains from the endogenous Dnmt1 locus. The internally deleted protein was stable and expressed at the same level as the full-length protein. However, it was unable to associate with replication foci during S phase and displayed a diffuse nucleoplasmic localization. The same localization phenotype has been observed in Uhrf1-null ES cells (23Sharif J. Muto M. Takebayashi S. Suetake I. Iwamatsu A. Endo T.A. Shinga J. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Toyoda T. Okamura K. Tajima S. Mitsuya K. Okano M. Koseki H. The SRA protein Np95 mediates epigenetic inheritance by recruiting Dnmt1 to methylated DNA.Nature. 2007; 450 (17994007): 908-91210.1038/nature06397Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Previous data had shown that the RFTS alone is capable of targeting heterologous proteins to replication foci (6Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei.Cell. 1992; 71 (1423634): 865-87310.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-PAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we conclude that in the absence of the BAH domains DNMT1 is actively excluded from replication foci by a mechanism that regulates conformational change within the molecule necessary for RFTS- and UHRF1-dependent targeting. We propose that this conformational change could be brought about by the autoinhibitory (BAH1-CXXC) linker, which forms hydrogen bonds with RFTS (22Zhang Z.-M. Liu S. Lin K. Luo Y. Perry J.J. Wang Y. Song J. Crystal structure of human DNA methyltransferase 1.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 (26070743): 2520-253110.1016/j.jmb.2015.06.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and BAH1. The function of the GK repeats was also unknown; a role in an acetylation-dependent interaction with USP7 that protected DNMT1 from proteasomal degradation (20Cheng J. Yang H. Fang J. Ma L. Gong R. Wang P. Li Z. Xu Y. Molecular mechanism for USP7-mediated DNMT1 stabilization by acetylation.Nat.

Focub strains are divided into races according to their host specificity, but which virulence factors underlie these interactions is currently unknown. In the F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Fol)-tomato system, small secreted fungal proteins, called Six proteins, were identified in the xylem sap of infected plants. The Fol Six1 protein contributes to virulence and has an avirulence function by activating the I-3 immune receptor of tomato. The Focub tropical race 4 (TR4) genome harbors three SIX1 homologs: SIX1a, b and c. In this study, the role of Focub-SIX1a in pathogenicity was evaluated since this homolog is present in not only TR4 but also in other races. A deletion mutant of the SIX1a gene from Focub TR4 strain II5 was generated (FocubΔSIX1a) and tested in planta. Mutants were found to be severely compromised in their virulence. Ectopic integration of the Focub-SIX1a gene in the FocubΔSIX1a strain restored virulence to wild type levels. We conclude that Focub-SIX1a is required for full virulence of Focub TR4 towards Cavendish banana."

Nonetheless, because daily time is limited, time spent on each movement behavior is co-dependent. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BM and movement behaviors in elderly people using compositional data analysis.We analyzed 871 older people [395 men (76.9±5.3y) and 476 women (76.7±4.7y)]. Time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was assessed using accelerometry. BM was determined by bone densitometry (DXA). The sample was divided according to sex and bone health indicators.The combined effect of all movement behaviors (PA and SB) was significantly associated with whole body, leg and femoral region BM in the whole sample (p≤0.05), with leg and pelvic BM (p<0.05) in men and, with whole body, arm and leg BM (p<0.05) in women. In men, arm and pelvic BM were negatively associated with SB and whole body, pelvic and leg BM were positively associated with MVPA (p≤0.05). In women, whole body and leg BM were positively associated with SB. Arm and whole body BM were positively associated and leg BM was negatively associated with LPA and arm BM was negatively associated with MVPA (p≤0.05). Women without bone fractures spent less time in SB and more in LPA and MVPA than the subgroup with bone fractures.We identified that the positive effect of MVPA relative to the other behaviors on bone mass is the strongest overall effect in men. Furthermore, women might decrease bone fracture risk through PA increase and SB reduction, despite the fact that no clear benefits of PA for bone mass were found."
https://openalex.org/W2896025532,"Cellular function is critically regulated through degradation of substrates by the proteasome. To enable direct analysis of naturally cleaved proteasomal peptides under physiological conditions, we developed mass spectrometry analysis of proteolytic peptides (MAPP), a method for proteasomal footprinting that allows for capture, isolation and analysis of proteasome-cleaved peptides. Application of MAPP to cancer cell lines as well as primary immune cells revealed dynamic modulation of the cellular degradome in response to various stimuli, such as proinflammatory signals. Further, we performed analysis of minute amounts of clinical samples by studying cells from the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We found increased degradation of histones in patient immune cells, thereby suggesting a role of aberrant proteasomal degradation in the pathophysiology of SLE. Thus, MAPP offers a broadly applicable method to facilitate the study of the cellular-degradation landscape in various cellular conditions and diseases involving changes in proteasomal degradation, including protein aggregation diseases, autoimmunity and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2896212932,"Proteins of the cyclin M family (CNNMs; also called ancient conserved domain proteins, or ACDPs) are represented by four integral membrane proteins that have been proposed to function as Mg2+ transporters. CNNMs are associated with a number of genetic diseases affecting ion movement and cancer via their association with highly oncogenic phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs). Structurally, CNNMs contain an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain (DUF21), and a large cytosolic region containing a cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain and a putative cyclic nucleotide–binding homology (CNBH) domain. Although the CBS domain has been extensively characterized, little is known about the CNBH domain. Here, we determined the first crystal structures of the CNBH domains of CNNM2 and CNNM3 at 2.6 and 1.9 Å resolutions. Contrary to expectation, these domains did not bind cyclic nucleotides, but mediated dimerization both in crystals and in solution. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments revealed an inverse correlation between the propensity of the CNBH domains to dimerize and the ability of CNNMs to mediate Mg2+ efflux. CNBH domains from active family members were observed as both dimers and monomers, whereas the inactive member, CNNM3, was observed only as a dimer. Mutational analysis revealed that the CNBH domain was required for Mg2+ efflux activity of CNNM4.

Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments revealed an inverse correlation between the propensity of the CNBH domains to dimerize and the ability of CNNMs to mediate Mg2+ efflux. CNBH domains from active family members were observed as both dimers and monomers, whereas the inactive member, CNNM3, was observed only as a dimer. Mutational analysis revealed that the CNBH domain was required for Mg2+ efflux activity of CNNM4. This work provides a structural basis for understanding the function of CNNM proteins in Mg2+ transport and associated diseases."

Structure-guided mutagenesis in the vicinity of the chromophore and along the presumed conduction pathway has led to some notable successes, with examples of interchanged functionality (Inoue et al., 2015Inoue K.

Polovinkin V. Borshchevskiy V. Bamann C. Astashkin R. Marin E. Popov A. Balandin T. Willbold D. Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2.Science. 2017; 358 (eaan8862)Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), however, and the consequences of individual mutations do not seem to readily confer predictable functional changes to different opsin backbones (Lin et al., 2013Lin J.Y. Knutsen P.M. Muller A. Kleinfeld D. Tsien R.Y. ReaChR: a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin enables deep transcranial optogenetic excitation.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These factors limit the effectiveness of structure-guided mutagenesis and argue for diversification in the available approaches for further expanding the toolkit. Although a major driving force for the evolutionary expansion of membrane protein families and refinement of their function may have come from relatively conservative point mutations, changes in membrane topology are also hypothesized to have contributed to this process (Rapp et al., 2007Rapp M. Seppälä S. Granseth E. von Heijne G. Emulating membrane protein evolution by rational design.Science. 2007; 315: 1282-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Seppälä et al., 2010Seppälä S.

While some membrane proteins can be induced to adopt a non-canonical orientation with a few mutations (Seppälä et al., 2010Seppälä S. Slusky J.S. Lloris-Garcerá P. Rapp M. von Heijne G. Control of membrane protein topology by a single C-terminal residue.Science. 2010; 328: 1698-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), evolution of altered topology would most easily arise through the introduction of large sequences by recombination. In one striking example, ionotropic glutamate receptors appear to have arisen following the insertion of a potassium channel gene in the middle of a periplasmic glutamate binding protein (Chen et al., 1999Chen G.-Q.

Structure and gating of the glutamate receptor ion channel.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The resulting addition of a large extracellularly targeted domain onto the previously intracellular N terminus of the potassium channel is thought to have imposed a topological inversion of the channel portion, although direct tests of this proposal remain lacking. Perhaps surprisingly, the inverted channel domain in ionotropic glutamate receptors displays significantly greater permeability for Na+ and Ca2+ (Sobolevsky et al., 2003Sobolevsky A.I. Yelshansky M.V. Wollmuth L.P. Different gating mechanisms in glutamate receptor and K+ channels.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7559-7568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) despite sharing the core residues important for K+ selectivity with their presumed evolutionary ancestors (Wood et al., 1995Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M. VanDongen A.M. Structural conservation of ion conduction pathways in K channels and glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). If topological inversion of true channels significantly alters ion permeability, it may have even greater consequences for proteins that move ions across the membrane in a transporter-like fashion. Transporters are distinguished by intramolecular ion coordination and conformational changes that restrict and permit, in sequence, access to internal and external compartments. In addition to altering selectivity, their inversion thus has the potential of reversing the movement of ions independent of electrochemical gradients by altering which residues are exposed to the extra- and intracellular compartments. Rhodopsin family members that appear to behave like transporters have properties of both transporters and channels, reflecting a proposed functional continuum (Gadsby, 2009Gadsby D.C. Ion channels versus ion pumps: the principal difference, in principle.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar): their currents show strong dependence on electrochemical gradients, but the flux is markedly lower than that of diffusion-limited channels. We therefore hypothesized that inversion of rhodopsins could yield new variants with unexpected, and perhaps desirable, functional properties. Here, we demonstrate that topological inversion can be robustly achieved by the introduction of strategically targeted N-terminal domains. When applied to rhodopsins, such “topological engineering” can lead to the generation of variants with unique functional properties of use in neuroscience research. We highlight two engineered variants that display properties that have not to date been engineered through structure-guided mutagenesis: a cation channel that displays markedly greater selectivity for K+ over Na+ (generated through an inversion of CsChrimson) and a non-specific cation pump (generated through an inversion of a Channelrhodopsin [ChR]). The latter, dubbed FLInChR (full-length inversion of ChR), represents a novel light-gated inhibitor of neural activity, and we demonstrate that it is sufficiently potent for common optogenetic experiments such as in vivo circuit interrogation. Thus, topological inversion permits access to new functionalities without fundamentally impairing the ionic flux and therefore has the potential to rapidly produce new variants of use to the neuroscience community. Our findings suggest that topological inversion is not energetically prohibitive and is robust to the nature of the N-terminal inversion domain, thus supporting the notion that domain recombination may indeed be sufficient to drive changes in membrane topology observed in the evolution of membrane protein families. Further, these data suggest that membrane topology is a useful, general, and unique dimension of protein engineering—in addition to immediately permitting as much as a doubling of the available toolkit, it may aid future structure-function studies of permeation in Channelrhodopsins. To begin to evaluate the potential of topological engineering for generating novel rhodopsin variants, we designed a leader sequence that contains the signal sequence and the transmembrane (TM) domain of Neurexin 1B-delta—a type I integral membrane protein—that could, in principle, impose topological inversion on any membrane protein with an extracellular N terminus (Figure 1A). To impart further stability on the orientation of the N-terminal TM domain, we also included a short positively charged peptide into the presumed cytoplasmic portion of the leader sequence (Bernsel et al., 2008Bernsel A. Viklund H. Falk J. Lindahl E. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Prediction of membrane-protein topology from first principles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Gafvelin and von Heijne, 1994Gafvelin G. von Heijne G.

Membrane protein structure prediction. Hydrophobicity analysis and the positive-inside rule.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). We chose a positively charged peptide that serves as the recognition sequence for a Golgi-bound protease, furin (Thomas, 2002Thomas G. Furin at the cutting edge: from protein traffic to embryogenesis and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), because establishing that the fusion protein is protected from furin-mediated cleavage would lend further support for the desired orientation of the leader sequence. Fusion between the Neurexin (Nx)-based N-terminal domain and ChR2 E123T/T159C—a variant chosen because of its fast kinetics and robust membrane insertion (Berndt et al., 2011Berndt A. Schoenenberger P. Mattis J. Tye K.M. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Oertner T.G. High-efficiency channelrhodopsins for fast neuronal stimulation at low light levels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7595-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)—resulted in a protein that could be easily expressed at high levels, displayed efficient membrane targeting, and trafficked well down axons (Figure S1). Immunostaining for the N-terminal myc− epitope tag under non-permeabilized conditions and live-cell GFP florescence imaging in the presence of proteinase K verified that both N and C termini of the fusion protein are in the extracellular space, as predicted for successful topological inversion (Figures 1B and 1C). Pairing the Neurexin-based N-terminal domain with either CsChrimson or ArchT was equally effective at achieving inversion (Figure 1C), as was pairing ChR E123T/T159C with an alternative N-terminal domain that contained the transmembrane domain of Synaptobrevin (Syb) (Figure S2).Figure S2Inversion Is Robust to the Choice of N-Terminal Linker Domain, Related to Figure 1Show full captionProteinase K-based evaluation of the location of the C-terminal-mVenus domain in primary neuronal cultures for FLInChR(Nx) (as in Figure 1) and FLInChR(Syb) (n = 16).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteinase K-based evaluation of the location of the C-terminal-mVenus domain in primary neuronal cultures for FLInChR(Nx) (as in Figure 1) and FLInChR(Syb) (n = 16). We also explored whether any naturally existing non-canonical orientation of a transmembrane protein may be attributed to its N-terminal domain. We focused on insect odorant receptors—a family of heptahelical proteins that have the opposite membrane orientation compared with their mammalian counterparts and function as odor-gated ion channels rather than G-protein-coupled receptors (Benton et al., 2006Benton R. Sachse S. Michnick S.W. Vosshall L.B. Atypical membrane topology and heteromeric function of Drosophila odorant receptors in vivo.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e20Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Strikingly, fusion of the N-terminal leader sequence from the Drosophila OR 59D.1 gene to ChR E123T/T159C also resulted in an inversion (Figure 1D). This finding lends further credence to the notion that introduction of targeted N-terminal domains through recombination may have contributed during evolution to changes in membrane protein orientation and possibly to the emergence of new functionalities. To evaluate the functional consequences of rhodopsin inversion, we next examined the current evoked by photoactivation of the inverted proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons (transfected at DIV7, evaluated at DIV 14-21). Flipping the orientation of CsChrimson in the membrane preserved the inward direction of the photocurrent at resting membrane potential and had no significant effect on the current’s spectral sensitivity (Figure 2A). The photocurrent still reversed when the membrane was depolarized (Figure 2B). However, the reversal potential of the inverted CsChrimson was significantly lower than that of the original opsin (−35.3 ± 5.2 mV, n = 5 versus 4.7 ± 2.5 mV, n = 5, p < 0.0001). Decreasing the extracellular Na+ concentration from 130 mM to 5 mM caused a further leftward shift in the reversal potential (to −62.7 ± 3.6 mV, n = 5, p < 0.001 versus 130 mM Na+), bringing it closer to the reversal potential for K+. Together, these results indicate that, for CsChrimson, topological inversion preserved the opsin’s cation channel-like properties but led to a significantly (∼7- to 8-fold) increased K+ permeability—a sought-after functional change that has eluded other molecular engineering efforts (Grote et al., 2014Grote M. Engelhard M. Hegemann P. Of ion pumps, sensors and channels—Perspectives on microbial rhodopsins between science and history.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inversion of ChR E123T/T159C led to an even more dramatic change in opsin functionality. Cells expressing inverted ChR E123T/T159C variants—dubbed full-length Inversion of ChR (FLInChRs)—displayed robust outward currents, suggesting that inversion converted this opsin from a potent activator into an inhibitor (Figure 2C). Comparison of current amplitudes elicited by photostimulation at varying wavelengths revealed that the spectral response of FLInChR photocurrents was red-shifted with respect to its “topological isomer,” peaking around 560 nm (Figure 2D). FLInChR photocurrents were outward at all tested membrane potentials and exhibited a very weak voltage dependence regardless of the internal solution used, implicating a pump-like mechanism for FLInChR conductance (mean increase of 18% ± 4% at +40 mV compared to −80 mV, n = 16, Figure 2C). Replacement of external ions with sucrose had no effect on FLInChR photocurrent amplitude (p = 0.5, n = 4, Figure 2E), indicating that FLInChR photocurrents result from transport of cations out of the cell. An ammonium pre-pulse protocol (Schwiening and Boron, 1994Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. Regulation of intracellular pH in pyramidal neurones from the rat hippocampus by Na(+)-dependent Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange.J. Physiol. 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) designed to shift the cell’s pH—first basic, and then acidic—had no effect on FLInChR current amplitude (Figure 2F, n = 5, p = 0.9), suggesting that protons are not the exclusive charge carrier of the FLInChR photocurrent. We did not detect any change in photocurrent amplitude when switching between Na+- and K+-based internals (Figure 2G, n = 9 versus n = 22, p > 0.5). Nevertheless, increasing cation size further by substituting with TEA+-based internal resulted in a significant drop in the photocurrent (Figure 2G, 165 ± 22 pA for K+, n = 22 versus 106 ± 15 pA for TEA+, n = 20, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey’s test). Taken together, the above evidence is most consistent with the notion that inversion transformed ChR2 E123T/T159C into a potent optogenetic inhibitor that functions like a light-activated, non-selective cation pump. Thus, topological engineering can indeed be sufficient to produce marked changes in the functional properties of opsins. Moreover, similarly to the case of CsChrimson inversion, inversion of ChR E123T/T159C resulted in a functionality (cation pumping) distinct from those attained with previous molecular engineering efforts. This finding, together with the observation that inversion also markedly altered the action spectrum of ChR2 ET/TC (Figures 2D), suggests that topological engineering induces a significant rearrangement of side chains around the active site. The efficiency of optogenetic-based manipulations of cell activity critically depends on both the properties of the opsin as well as the biophysics of the targeted cell type. Thus, it is desirable to have a range of opsin properties (different ions conducted, a continuum from pump-like to channel-like behavior, etc.) for specific use cases. However, to qualify as a viable optogenetic tool for neuroscience, a new reagent must be capable of dramatically perturbing activity in at least some cell types. We therefore next aimed to verify that the altered active site packing of the inverted configuration retains sufficient light-dependent ion transport for robust circuit interrogation by evaluating the inhibitory potential of FLInChR variants in brain slices. We first chose to target substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons due to extensive prior experience using the parent ChR2 variant in this experimental preparation (Brown et al., 2014Brown J. Pan W.-X. Dudman J.T. The inhibitory microcircuit of the substantia nigra provides feedback gain control of the basal ganglia output.eLife. 2014; 3: e02397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the fact that tonically active neurons provide an ideal test case for evaluating inhibitory optogenetic actuators. We prepared midbrain slices from adult GAD-Cre mice that had been injected into SNr with an adeno-associated virus carrying mVenus-tagged FLInChR or ArchT and targeted for whole-cell recordings SNr GABAergic neurons visually identified to express the opsin (Figure 3A). To further ascertain that inversion resulted in a marked change in the opsin function as well as to detect any contribution from potentially native, un-flipped ChR, we first chose conditions (wide-field illumination with a 1 ms pulse of 470 nm light; holding potential of −70 mV) that have previously been shown to elicit strong inward currents in ChR2-expressing SNr GABAergic cells (Brown et al., 2014Brown J. Pan W.-X. Dudman J.T. The inhibitory microcircuit of the substantia nigra provides feedback gain control of the basal ganglia output.eLife. 2014; 3: e02397Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). FLInChR-expressing cells displayed robust outward currents under these conditions (Figure 3B for FLInChR[Nx] and Figure 3C for FLInChR[Syb]). Consistent with our observations in dissociated cultures, FLInChR-mediated photocurrent was observed even when cells were stimulated with 590 nm light (Figures 3B and 3C)—conditions under which the parent ChR2 variant is not expected to display robust activity (Berndt et al., 2011Berndt A. Schoenenberger P. Mattis J. Tye K.M. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Oertner T.G. High-efficiency channelrhodopsins for fast neuronal stimulation at low light levels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7595-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Evoked outward currents were on par with those mediated by ArchT—a commonly used and potent optogenetic inhibitor (Figure 3D). We observed a similarly rapid onset latency (FLInChR[Nx]: 0.33 ± 0.01 ms @ 470 nm; 0.30 ± 0.01 ms @ 590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3E, top; FLInChR[Syb] 0.24 ± 0.01 ms @ 470 nm; 0.24 ± 0.01 ms @590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3F, top; ArchT: 0.25 ± 0.04 ms @ 470 nm; 0.22 ± 0.03 ms @ 590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3G, top) and rapid decay time constants (FLInChR[Nx]: 2.51 ± 0.14 ms @ 470 nm; 2.60 ± 0.25 ms @ 590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3E, bottom; FLInChR[Syb] 3.07 ± 0.13 ms @ 470 nm; 3.31 ± 0.24 ms @590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3F, bottom; ArchT: 2.49 ± 0.04 ms @ 470 nm; 2.24 ± 0.03 ms @ 590 nm, n = 4, Figure 3G, bottom) for FLInChR- and ArchT-mediated currents. The comparable performance of Arch and FLInChR variants argues that the structural re-arrangements in the vicinity of the active site (a consequence of inversion) are compatible with efficient light-dependent ion transport. We next took advantage of the fact that SNr GABAergic cells respond to depolarizing current in vitro with firing rates of > 150 Hz (Figure 4A) to examine the efficiency, with which FLInChR can inhibit evoked activity. In the absence of light stimulation, we were able to evoke progressively higher spiking frequency in FLInChR-expressing neurons by injecting increasing steps of depolarizing current in a whole-cell current clamp mode. Brief pulses (100 ms) of photostimulation induced significant hyperpolarization of the membrane voltage that was maintained even during depolarizing current injection steps. Evoked spiking was mostly eliminated during photostimulation and could only be partially recovered with very large (> 400 pA) current injections (Figures 4A and 4B). Similarly, efficient suppression of evoked spiking could be observed in FLInChR-expressing cortical neurons (Figure S3). The ability to sustain photoinhibition for prolonged periods (Figures 4A and 4C) was likely due to only moderate desensitization of FLInChR-mediated currents beyond the initial 100 ms (Figure S4, photocurrent amplitude normalized to peak: 0.8062 ± 0.0743 at 100 ms, 0.6333 ± 0.1131 ms at 1000 ms, n = 4). Combined, these results demonstrate that FLInChR is a robust optogenetic inhibitor that can suppress evoked activity even in fast-spiking neurons and may be sufficient for in vivo circuit interrogation experiments in behaving animals.Figure S3FLInChR Mediates Efficient Suppression of Spiking in Cortical Neurons, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Responses of a FLInChR-expressing layer 4 stellate cell to step current injections with and without 470nm light.

Therefore, a verifiable and comprehensive description of the development of the human notochord is needed. Our analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 27 sectioned human embryos ranging from Carnegie Stage 8 to 15 (17–41 days of development), resulted in a comprehensive and verifiable new model of notochordal development. Subsequent to gastrulation, a transient group of cells briefly persists as the notochordal process which is incorporated into the endodermal roof of the gut while its dorsal side attaches to the developing neural tube. Then, the notochordal process embeds entirely into the endoderm, forming the epithelial notochordal plate, which remains intimately associated with the neural tube. Subsequently, the notochordal cells detach from the endoderm to form the definitive notochord, allowing the paired dorsal aortae to fuse between the notochord and the gut. We show that the formation of the notochordal process and plate proceeds in cranio-caudal direction. Moreover, in contrast to descriptions in the modern textbooks, we report that the formation of the definitive notochord in humans starts in the middle of the embryo, and proceeds in both cranial and caudal directions."

The overall figures mask the subnational heterogeneity crucial for designing insurance coverage for 1.3 billion population across India. We estimated CHE in every state of India and the changes over a decade. Methods We used National Sample Survey data on health care utilisation in 2004 and 2014. The states were placed in four groups based on epidemiological transition level (ETL), defined on the basis of ratio of disability-adjusted life-years from communicable diseases to those from non-communicable diseases and injuries combined, with a low ratio denoting high ETL state group. CHE was defined as the proportion of households that had out-of-pocket payments for health care equalling or exceeding 10% of the household expenditure. We assessed variation in the magnitude and distribution of CHE between ETL state groups and between states of India. Results In 2014, CHE was higher in the high (30.3%, 95% confidence interval: 28.5 to 32.1) and higher-middle (27.4%, 26.3 to 28.6) ETL state groups than the low (21.8%, 20.8 to 22.8) and lower-middle (19.0%, 17.1 to 21.0) groups. From 2004 to 2014, CHE increased only in the high and higher-middle ETL groups (1.19 and 1.34 times, respectively). However, the individual states with substantial increase in CHE were spread across all ETL groups. The gap between the highest CHE of an individual state and the lowest was 8-fold in 2014. CHE was disproportionately concentrated among the rich in 2004 for most of India, but in 2014 CHE was distributed equally among the rich and poor because of the substantial increase in CHE among the poor over time. Conclusions Better provision of quality health care should be accompanied by financial protection measures to safeguard the poor from increasing CHE in India. The state-specific CHE trends can provide useful input for the planning of the recently launched National Health Protection Mission such that it meets the requirement of each state."
https://openalex.org/W2897016104,"We define a homeostatic function for innate immune signaling within neurons. A genetic analysis of the innate immune signaling genes IMD, IKKβ, Tak1, and Relish demonstrates that each is essential for presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP). Subsequent analyses define how the rapid induction of PHP (occurring in seconds) can be coordinated with the life-long maintenance of PHP, a time course that is conserved from invertebrates to mammals. We define a novel bifurcation of presynaptic innate immune signaling. Tak1 (Map3K) acts locally and is selective for rapid PHP induction. IMD, IKKβ, and Relish are essential for long-term PHP maintenance. We then define how Tak1 controls vesicle release. Tak1 stabilizes the docked vesicle state, which is essential for the homeostatic expansion of the readily releasable vesicle pool. This represents a mechanism for the control of vesicle release, and an interface of innate immune signaling with the vesicle fusion apparatus and homeostatic plasticity."

To clarify the role of this site in regulating RyR1 activity, here we applied mutational, electrophysiological, and computational methods. Three amino acid residues that interact directly with Ca2+ were replaced, and these RyR1 variants were expressed in HEK293 cells. Single-site RyR1-E3893Q, -E3893V, -E3967Q, -E3967V, and -T5001A variants and double-site RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q and -E3893V/E3967V variants displayed cellular Ca2+ release in response to caffeine, which indicated that they retained functionality as caffeine-sensitive, Ca2+-conducting channels in the HEK293 cell system. Using [3H]ryanodine binding and single-channel measurements of membrane isolates, we found that single- and double-site RyR1-E3893 and -E3967 variants are not activated by Ca2+.

RyR1-T5001A exhibited decreased Ca2+ sensitivity compared with WT-RyR1 in single-channel measurements. Computational methods suggested that electrostatic interactions between Ca2+ and negatively charged glutamate residues have a critical role in transducing the functional effects of Ca2+ on RyR1. We conclude that the removal of negative charges in the recently identified RyR1 Ca2+-binding site impairs RyR1 activation by physiological Ca2+ concentrations and results in loss of binding to Ca2+ or reduced Ca2+ affinity of the binding site.

There are three mammalian RyR isoforms. RyR1 is present in skeletal muscle, RyR2 is present in heart muscle, and RyR3 is present at low levels in many tissues, including brain and slow-twitch skeletal muscle. Calcium ions play a predominant role in the regulation of RyRs. Activation by micromolar Ca2+ and inhibition by millimolar Ca2+ suggest the presence of high-affinity Ca2+ activation and low-affinity Ca2+ inactivation sites. Additional regulation is mediated by ATP and caffeine, which increase Ca2+-gated RyR activities. Mg2+ inhibits Ca2+-activated RyRs by competing with Ca2+ for high-affinity Ca2+ activation sites and by binding to inhibitory low-affinity divalent cation sites (3Meissner G.

Three conserved amino acid residues contribute to the primary coordination sphere of bound Ca2+ in the large cytoplasmic domain of RyRs. Thr-5001 is conserved in RyRs, whereas RyR1 residues Glu-3893 and Glu-3967 are conserved in both RyRs and the related inositol trisphosphate receptor families. The RyRs and IP3 receptors are expressed in intracellular membrane compartments containing up to millimolar concentrations of bound and free Ca2+. The release of Ca2+ is triggered by a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism for the cardiac and brain RyR isoforms and by the action of IP3 and Ca2+ for the IP3 receptors (3Meissner G. The structural basis of ryanodine receptor ion channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2017; 149 (29122978): 1065-108910.1085/jgp.201711878Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Patterson R.L.

This suggests that while having a predominant role in the regulation of cardiac and brain RyR isoforms, Ca2+ may have a more confined role in the activation of mammalian skeletal-muscle RyRs.

Five single-site RyR1 variants (E3893Q, E3893V, E3967Q, E3967V, and T5001A) and two double-site RyR1 variants (E3893Q/E3967Q and E3893V/E3967V) were expressed as caffeine-sensitive, Ca2+-conducting channels in HEK293 cells. Studies using membrane isolates suggested that Ca2+ did not significantly activate single- and double-site RyR1-E3893 and -E3967 variants, whereas RyR1-T5001A exhibited altered Ca2+-dependent regulation compared with WT. Computational methods using cryo-EM micrograph densities provided structural information on the interaction between Ca2+ and amino acid residues of the Ca2+-binding sites of RyR1-WT and variant channels. Three conserved amino acid residues (Glu-3893, Glu-3967, and Thr-5001) were shown previously to directly interact with Ca2+ in a Ca2+-binding site in RyR1 (Fig. 1) (9des Georges A. Clarke O.B.

In the present study, we focused on the role of the two negatively charged glutamates in regulating RyR1 activity. Negative charges were removed by replacing one or both Glu residues with Gln or Val (RyR1-E3893Q, -E3893V, -E3967Q, -E3967V, -E3893Q/E3967Q, and -E3893V/E3967V) while maintaining residue volumes (17Tsai J.

A variable caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was observed in 30–60% of HEK293 cells transfected with WT-RyR1. The variable response may have resulted from uneven exposure to caffeine and/or removal of released Ca2+ by HEK293 cellular transport systems. The number of variant HEK293 cells showing caffeine-induced Ca2+ release ranged from 46.5% for RyR1-E3967V to 119% for RyR1-E3893Q compared with WT (Table 1). These observations suggest that all variants expressed caffeine-sensitive, Ca2+-conducting channels in HEK293 cells. Two methods were used to determine WT and variant activities. Regulation by Ca2+ was directly measured using the lipid bilayer method (19Smith J.S. Coronado R. Meissner G. Sarcoplasmic reticulum contains adenine nucleotide-activated calcium channels.Nature. 1985; 316 (2410798): 446-44910.1038/316446a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (see below). In a second widely used but less direct method, Ca2+-dependent RyR activity was determined using the RyR-specific plant alkaloid ryanodine (20Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels: does diversity in form equal diversity in function?.Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76 (8874493): 1027-107110.1152/physrev.1996.76.4.1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Specific [3H]ryanodine binding to WT showed a bimodal Ca2+ activation/Ca2+ inhibition profile with peak activity at ∼70 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 3). [3H]Ryanodine binding to RyR1-T5001A was lower than WT. In contrast to RyR1-WT and -T5001A, RyR1-E3893 and -E3967 variants displayed the highest [3H]ryanodine binding levels at submicromolar Ca2+ (Fig. 3). RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q bound the highest amount of [3H]ryanodine at <1 μm Ca2+ (∼275 fmol/mg protein), followed by E3967Q and E3893Q (∼55 and ∼40 fmol/mg protein, respectively), E3893V (∼20 fmol/mg protein), and E3967V and E3893V/E3967V variants (∼11 and 15 fmol/mg protein, respectively). Elevated Ca2+ concentrations inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding for all variants, with IC50 values ranging from 50 to 200 μm Ca2+. We considered the possibility that the different [3H]ryanodine binding levels of the variants in Fig. 3 could be accounted for by varying levels of expression in HEK293 cells and/or recovery of functional variants in the membrane isolates. We assessed this in recording single channels using the lipid bilayer method, which directly compares WT and variant activities. RyR1s were recorded as K+-conducting channels using 0.25 m KCl on both sides of the bilayer at cytosolic Ca2+ ranging from 0.01 μm Ca2+ to 10 mm Ca2+. RyR1-WT showed a biphasic Ca2+ activation/inhibition profile with a maximum averaged channel open probability (Po) of 0.16 at ∼20 μm cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 4). RyR1-T5001A resulted in a rightward shift of the Po–Ca2+ activation response curve and reduced peak Po at ∼100 μm Ca2+ compared with WT at 20 μm Ca2+. In agreement with the [3H]ryanodine-binding data of Fig. 3, RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q was not significantly activated by Ca2+. Averaged Po was 0.02 at 0.01 μm Ca2+ (Table 1) and half-maximal levels at ∼6 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4B) suggested that binding of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ had an inhibitory effect (p < 0.05). One possibility we could not rule out is that the presence of Ca2+-inhibitory sites interfered with the activation of RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q by the binding of Ca2+ to low-affinity sites. RyR1-E3893Q, -E3893V, -E3967Q, -E3967V, and -E3893V/E3967V had very low averaged Po values of 0.002 and less at Ca2+ ranging from 0.01 to 2 μm (Table 1). The results suggest that the two negatively charged Glu-3893 and Glu-3967 residues have a critical role in transducing the functional effects of Ca2+ in RyR1. The amino acid mutations could have potentially modified the RyR1 ion permeation properties, resulting in reduced K+ conductances and loss of Ca2+ conductances (3Meissner G. The structural basis of ryanodine receptor ion channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2017; 149 (29122978): 1065-108910.1085/jgp.201711878Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, measurement of the voltage dependence of variant channel currents indicated that K+ conductances were similar to WT (Table 1). In the presence of 10 mm luminal Ca2+, RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q and T5001A variants conducted Ca2+ and maintained a Ca2+/K+ permeability ratio similar to WT. The permeability ratio of the remaining variants could not be determined due to low open channel probabilities. Des Georges et al. (9des Georges A. Clarke O.B. Zalk R. Yuan Q. Condon K.J.

FKBP12.6 and the related FKBP12 bind with nanomolar affinity to RyRs and are considered constitutive members of RyR ion channel complexes. Dissociation of FKBP12 from the homotetrameric RyR1 complex increased channel open probability and induced substates in single-channel measurements (21Brillantes A.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E.

We addressed the presence of RyR1–FKBP12 complex by incubating membrane isolates for 30 min with 5 μm FKBP12 before addition to the cis bilayer chamber (23Mei Y. Xu L. Kramer H.F. Tomberlin G.H. Townsend C. Meissner G.

We found that treatment with FKBP12 did not significantly alter channel open probability at 2 μm cytosolic of RyR1-WT (Po = 0.07 ± 0.02 and 0.11 ± 0.02 with and without FKBP12, respectively, n = 8–9) and RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q (Po = 0.022 ± 0.011 and 0.030 ± 0.019 with and without FKBP12, respectively, n = 6–7). RyR1 is activated by ATP and caffeine and inhibited by Mg2+ (3Meissner G. The structural basis of ryanodine receptor ion channel function.J. Gen. Physiol. 2017; 149 (29122978): 1065-108910.1085/jgp.201711878Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Single-channel traces (Fig. 5A) and averaged -fold changes of Po values (Fig. 5B) show that at 0.01 μm cytosolic Ca2+, the initial addition of 5 mm caffeine increased RyR1-WT, RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q, and E3893V/E3967V channel activities from their low Po values (Table 1). The addition of caffeine significantly increased channel activity using Student's t test. The subsequent addition of 2 mm ATP further increased channel activities (Fig. 5A). One-way but not two-way ANOVA (except for WT) indicated significant increases of Po after the addition of 5 mm caffeine and 2 mm ATP compared with control (Fig. 5B). RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q was inhibited ∼10-fold by 0.25 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas inhibition of RyR1-WT and RyR1-E3893V/E3967V was not determined due to very low open channel probability. The results suggest that RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q and E3893V/E3967V maintained the ability of WT to be activated by caffeine and ATP and of E3893Q/E3967Q to be inhibited by Mg2+. Single RyR1-WT and RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q, -E3893V/E3967V, and -T5001A variant channel activities were also determined under conditions comparable with those of open RyR1 channels in the presence of the three channel activators Ca2+, ATP, and caffeine (9des Georges A. Clarke O.B. Zalk R. Yuan Q. Condon K.J. Grassucci R.A. Hendrickson W.A. Marks A.R. Frank J. Structural basis for gating and activation of RyR1.Cell. 2016; 167 (27662087): 145-157.e1710.1016/j.cell.2016.08.075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The addition of 2 mm ATP and 5 mm caffeine to cytosolic 30 μm Ca2+ raised single-channel activities of WT and variant channels (Fig. 6A). Averaged Po values of RyR1-WT increased 2.9-fold from 0.20 to 0.57, those of RyR1-E3893Q/E3967Q increased 70-fold from 0.003 to 0.207, those of RyR1-E3893V/E3967V increased 46-fold from 0.0003 to 0.014, and those of RyR1-T5001A increased 11-fold from 0.029 to 0.32 (Fig. 6B), confirming that all three variants retained ATP/caffeine activation. Three amino acid residues that directly interact with Ca2+ in the high-affinity Ca2+-binding site were mutated and characterized. The results suggest that the high-affinity Ca2+-binding site plays a critical role in Ca2+-dependent activation of RyR1. Neutralization of negatively charged Glu-3893 and Glu-3967 resulted in loss of Ca2+-dependent activation of RyR1. Loss of activation appeared to be specific because other regulatory mechanisms, such as RyR1 ion permeation, inhibition by Mg2+ and elevated levels of Ca2+, and activation by ATP and caffeine, were maintained in single-channel measurements. RyR1-T5001A differentially affected RyR1 Ca2+ activation by shifting the Ca2+ activation/inactivation curve rightward relative to WT in single-channel measurements. Computational analysis using cryo-EM densities determined the structure of the Ca2+-binding sites of nominally Ca2+-free and Ca2+/ATP/caffeine-activated variant channels. The Ca2+-binding site is located in the large cytoplasmic side of RyR1 ∼70 nm from the transmembrane effector channel sites. This suggests that transition from the nominally Ca2+-free closed to the Ca2+-activated open channel involves additional sites. RyR1-E4032A mutation outside the Ca2+-binding site (9des Georges A.

The underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and no effective interventions to limit the transmission of metabolic disease from the obese mother to her infant are currently available. Obese pregnant women have decreased circulating levels of adiponectin, which is associated with increased placental nutrient transport and fetal overgrowth. We have reported that normalization of adiponectin levels during late gestation reversed placental dysfunction and fetal overgrowth in a mouse model of maternal obesity in pregnancy. In the current study, we hypothesized that adiponectin supplementation during pregnancy in obese mice attenuates the adverse metabolic outcomes in adult offspring. Adult male offspring of obese mice developed obesity, fatty liver, and insulin resistance, with adult female offspring of obese mice having a less pronounced metabolic phenotype. These metabolic abnormalities in offspring born to obese mice were largely prevented by normalization of maternal adiponectin levels in late pregnancy. We provide evidence that low circulating maternal adiponectin is a critical mechanistic link between maternal obesity and the development of metabolic disease in offspring. Strategies aimed at improving maternal adiponectin levels may prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction in offspring of obese mothers.-Paulsen, M. E., Rosario, F. J., Wesolowski, S. R., Powell, T.

The purpose of this study is to show that the activity of the members of the xylanase family in the specified pH and temperature conditions can be computationally predicted. The proposed computational regression model was trained and tested with the Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) features extracted solely from the amino acid sequences of enzymes. The xylanases with experimentally determined activities were used as the training dataset to adjust the model parameters. To develop the model, 41 strains of Bacillus subtilis isolated from field soil were screened. From them, 28 strains with the highest halo diameter were selected for further studies. The performance of the model for prediction of xylanase activity was evaluated in three different temperature and pH conditions using stratified cross-validation and jackknife methods. The trained model can be used for determining the activity of newly found xylanases in the specified condition. Such computational models help to scale down the experimental costs and save time by identifying enzymes with appropriate activity for scientific and industrial usage. Our methodology for activity prediction of xylanase enzymes can be potentially applied to the members of the other enzyme families. The availability of sufficient experimental data in specified pH and temperature conditions is a prerequisite for training the learning model and to achieve high accuracy."

Hundreds of clinics in India offer unproven stem cell therapies despite having remarkably stringent guidelines and regulations for fraudulent advertisements and clinical practice. We discuss the challenges with current regulations, how a recently proposed amendment may further legitimize unproven stem cell therapies, and discuss paths forward in a global context. In recent years there has been a global expansion of unregulated, dubious stem cell clinics. Although developed nations are beginning to face this problem more frequently (Turner, 2018Turner L. The US Direct-to-Consumer Marketplace for Autologous Stem Cell Interventions.Perspect. Biol. Med. 2018; 61: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), stereotypically it is thought that this phenomenon is more rampant in developing countries due to a lack of policy and regulation (Berger et al., 2016Berger I.

Global distribution of businesses marketing stem cell-based interventions.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 158-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, this is not the case in India. Despite having some of the strictest guidelines for stem cell research and therapy in the world and various regulations (Table 1) from multiple agencies (Figure 1), India has emerged as one of the key destinations for unproven stem cell therapies. The situation is so serious that the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) recently wrote a letter to the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and requested an investigation (cf. ISSCR Letter to Dr. Krishnaswamy VijayRaghavan, June 6, 2017).Table 1Stem-Cell-Related Regulations in IndiaGuidelines/LegislationsDepartment/AgencyRemarksNational guidelinesNational Stem Cell Guidelines for Research, 2017The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT)although they are written by the ICMR and the DBT, neither department has jurisdiction over clinicians; violators of the guidelines cannot be punished, as there is no legal backup to guidelinesRegulations for fraudulent advertisementsChapter 6 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002The Medical Council of India (MCI)/state medical councilsclinicians are prohibited to advertise medical products and services; in the case of a violation, clinicians can lose their license to practice for a limited period of time as decided by the Medical Council of India/state medical councilsThe Drugs and Magical Remedies (The Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954The Directorate General of Health Servicesprohibits misleading advertisements related to drugs and magical remedies; if found guilty, imprisonment can be 6 to 12 months, fines, or bothThe Schedule J of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)a drug may not purport or make claims to prevent or cure diseases which are listed in Schedule J, such as cancer, genetic disorders, Parkinson’s, etc.self-regulationThe Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)only a code of conduct, as the ASCI is not a government body and it has no legal power to punish violators; however, respective regulatory bodies can take action based on the ASCI reportsRegulations for clinical practicesThe Medical Council of India Act, 1956MCI/state medical councilsregulates clinical practices by providing license to practiceThe Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002MCI/state medical councilsregulates ethical conduct of cliniciansSection 304-A of the Indian Penal Code; The Civil Law of Tortslaw enforcement agencies such as police and courtshandles medical malpractice and negligenceConsumer Protection Act, 1986consumer forumsprotects the interests of consumers (patients) from poor products and services (medical services); it can only be used against clinicians who offer paid services, i.e., private medical practitionersProposed Amendments in Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945CDSCOstem cell and stem-cell-based products derived with substantial, or more than minimal, manipulation will be considered a drug; this excludes minimally manipulated stem cells and their homologous use from the category of drugsNote that if violations occur, any person can submit a complaint to the respective department/agency and actions will be taken.

Unproven stem cell therapies have flourished in India since the early 2000s. Based on the official information provided to the Indian Parliament by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, there are 59 stem cell clinics across the country (Lok Sabha, 2017Lok Sabha (2017) Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Lok Sabha, Unstarred Question No. 3448. Published online August 04. http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/12/AU3448.pdf.Google Scholar). However, others (such as Iyer, 2017Iyer, M. (2017) Read these new rules before going in for a ‘stem cell cure’. The Times of India. Published online July 18 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/read-these-new-rules-before-going-in-for-a-stem-cell-cure/articleshow/59641244.cms.Google Scholar and Pharmabiz in 2017) have reported that these clinics could number between 300 and 500. Here, we discuss why stem cell clinical activities have been notoriously difficult to regulate in India despite the strict guidelines and regulations, propose some potential paths forward, and analyze India’s situation in a global context. Furthermore, the Indian FDA, i.e. the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), recently drafted an amendment related to stem cell and stem-cell-based products. In this article, we also analyze whether the proposed amendment will be effective in preventing the mushrooming of unproven stem cell therapies in India. The key document regulating stem cell activities in India is the National Stem Cell Guidelines. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the DBT jointly prepared the document in 2007. The guidelines were revised in 2013 and in October of 2017. In contrast to the first guidelines, the 2013/2017 guidelines are stricter. First, they sent a strong message by omitting the word “therapy” from the title of the guidelines. In 2007, the document was titled Guidelines for Stem cell Research and Therapy; in 2013/2017 it was changed to [National] Guidelines for Stem Cell Research. Second, it was emphasized that, “…stem cells are still not a part of standard of care; hence there can be no guidelines for therapy until efficacy is proven… and… any stem cell use in patients, other than that for hematopoietic stem cell reconstitution for approved indications, is investigational at present” (ICMR-DBT National Guidelines for Stem Cell Research 2013 and 2017). The 2017 guidelines also listed certain approved disease conditions for which minimally manipulated stem cells, such as those derived from bone marrow/peripheral blood, can be used as a homologous application. However, it stated that CDSCO approval is required to administer stem cells that have undergone substantial or more than minimum manipulation in patients. The definition of what constitutes “minimal manipulation” and “substantial or more than minimal manipulation” is highly problematic. Allegedly, as per a stem cell scientist cum entrepreneur, this allows clinicians to mislead vulnerable patients who do not understand these terminologies (as reported in Pharmabiz in 2017). Moreover, it appears that Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) derived from adipose tissue is being freely administered as a minimally manipulated stem cell product although, according to the current guidelines, it is categorized as more than minimum manipulation and hence clinical trials are required before patient use. The other major problem is that the violations of these guidelines carry no legal ramifications. Many clinicians have daringly stated that these are not hard laws, but only guidelines (Bhutia, 2017Bhutia, L.G. (2017). Hardcell. Open. Published online December 08, http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/health/hardcell.Google Scholar). Moreover, both the ICMR and the DBT have no jurisdiction over clinicians to compel them to follow the mandates of the guidelines. As a government advisory body on health matters, the role of the ICMR is limited to the formulation, coordination, and promotion of biomedical research. Similarly, the DBT is designated to promote biotechnology in the country and has no enforcement ability on clinics. The ICMR and the DBT are well aware of the limitations of the guidelines, including their inherent inability to regulate unproven stem cell therapies. To address the above issue, they have highlighted the role of other agencies and acts in the guidelines, specifically pointing to those related to regulating misleading advertisements, which can be helpful in preventing the purported stem cell therapies. The direct-to-consumer advertising is a serious problem in the stem cell sector. Globally, it has been noted that exaggerated claims regarding the benefits of stem cell interventions have attracted many patients toward stem cell clinics (Sipp et al., 2017Sipp D. Caulfield T. Kaye J. Barfoot J. Blackburn C. Chan S. De Luca M. Kent A. McCabe C. Munsie M. et al.Marketing of unproven stem cell-based interventions: A call to action.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: 9Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This may be one reason stem cell guidelines placed a greater emphasis on curbing misleading advertisements. The guidelines highlight three acts that are designated to regulate fraudulent advertisements, especially in the biomedical sector. One of the key acts is the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. Its Chapter 6 (Section 6.1) states that the soliciting of patients directly or indirectly by medical practitioners through advertising or publicity is an unethical act. Although the respective state medical councils, overseen by the Medical Council of India are the designated authority to implement the above regulations, they have not yet effectively exercised their powers to address these unethical activities (Tiwari and Raman, 2014Tiwari S.S. Raman S. Governing stem cell therapy in India: regulatory vacuum or jurisdictional ambiguity?.New Genet. Soc. 2014; 33: 413-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Other acts limiting misleading advertisements are the Drugs and Magical Remedies (The Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and the Schedule J of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. They are administered by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and the CDSCO, respectively. In addition to the above acts, the guidelines also emphasize the role of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self-regulatory body, in addressing misleading advertisements (as written in the ICMR-DBT National Guidelines for Stem Cell Research in 2017). The role of the ASCI is very crucial in this regard, as they monitor fraudulent advertisements. The ASCI, in association with the National Apex Committee for Stem Cell Research and Therapy (a committee that oversees the activities in the field of stem cell research in India) has been monitoring stem-cell-related advertisements since 2015. They found that the promotional advertisements of various clinics, hospitals, and companies are deceptive and lack comprehensive and accurate information in many cases. For instance, Vibes Healthcare Ltd. is a company that has continued to falsely advertise the benefits of stem cell technology in hair regrowth despite a complaint that was upheld by the ASCI (as reported by BestMediainfo in 2017). Similarly, many clinicians’ websites still make exaggerated claims and use the photographs of eminent stem cell scientists. The Stem Cell Society of India (a national association of stem cell therapists) even highlighted the image of the Prime Minister of India on its website, including his visit to stem cell laboratories. These marketing ploys all have the potential to mislead patients as they imply that renowned scientists and the government endorse these stem-cell-based treatments. The essence of the regulations described above is that doctors are prohibited from making unsubstantiated claims about the clinical benefits of a drug or a medical procedure. Unfortunately, the respective regulators such as the medical councils, the DGHS, and the CDSCO have not yet effectively enforced existing rules, which would allow the revocation of a violator’s license to practice or 6 to 12 months imprisonment. It is worth noting that the ASCI has no legal power to punish violators. However, other regulators can take action based on the ASCI reports. Although the 2017 guidelines only highlighted regulations related to misleading advertisements, there are many other statutory and quasi-statutory options available through the Indian Penal Code (criminal acts) and the 1986 Consumer Protection Act related to medical malpractice, negligence, and poor medical services. These legislations require a complaint. However, given the distinctive social and cultural factors in India, such as lay deference to clinicians and lengthy and expensive legal procedures, there is little possibility that vulnerable patients will challenge clinicians as they may in other countries such as the USA and Japan (Horner et al., 2018Horner C. Tenenbaum E. Sipp D. Master Z. Can civil lawsuits stem the tide of direct-to-consumer marketing of unproven stem cell interventions.NPJ Regen Med. 2018; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Tiwari, 2013Tiwari S.S. The ethics and governance of stem cell clinical research in India. Ph.D. dissertation. The University of Nottingham, 2013Google Scholar). Overall, guidelines and existing regulations cannot prevent the mushrooming of stem cell clinics in India. The ICMR has argued for many years that stem cell interventions should be categorized as drugs. They opined that this would be the only effective way to regulate stem cell activities in the country. In April 2018, the CDSCO proposed an amendment to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to categorize certain stem cell interventions as a drug (see CDSCO Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Notification, April 4, 2018, GSR 334(E)). Time will determine whether this will be effective in preventing the growth of unproven stem-cell-based therapies. In the proposed amendment, stem cell and stem-cell-based products derived from substantial, or more than minimal, manipulation would be considered a drug. This could be viewed as a welcome step from the CDSCO, for which the ICMR was advocating for many years. However, the amendment excludes minimally manipulated stem cells from the category of drugs, and this omission may legitimize the use of unproven stem cell treatments. It is notable that a majority of stem cell clinics in India are using autologous, minimally manipulated stem cells for unapproved conditions, which was also highlighted in the ISSCR letter to the DBT. If the current amendment passes, these autologous minimally manipulated stem cells can still be freely administered to patients without clinical trials, i.e., exclusive of ensuring safety and efficacy. As per a recent media report in Scroll.in, the ICMR has expressed its concerns to the CDSCO and stressed that minimally manipulated stem cells must be included under the category of a new drug or it will further accelerate the use of unproven treatments. In contrast to the ICMR, the Drugs Controller General of India, who oversees the CDSCO, defended the proposed amendment in the name of bringing uniformity and clarity on stem cell products in the country. However, according to the ISSCR, the CDSCO’s definition of minimal and substantial or more than minimal manipulation is not in alignment with the guidelines of the ICMR and international regulations such as those from the USA, Australia, and Europe. For instance, the adipose tissue processing to isolate the SVF by centrifugation and/or enzymatic digestion is considered more than minimal manipulation by the regulators in the USA and Australia, while the proposed amendment is silent on this important categorization. Additionally, the ISSCR believes that there is a need for more clarity between homologous and non-homologous use in the proposed amendment (cf. ISSCR Letter to Dr. S. Eswara Reddy, May 10, 2018). The difficulties in regulating stem cell therapies in India are largely attributed to (1) non-statutory guidelines, (2) incoherent rules and regulations, and (3) an implementation gap. The recently proposed amendment has further complicated the situation. What are the most constructive paths forward? Clearly, Indian regulatory authorities should make an effort to provide a legal backup to existing guidelines. The rules and regulations, especially advertising rules, need to be modernized and covered together under a single apex body that can take action in the case of violations. At the moment, there is no monitoring of news and social media content. Even the public service broadcasters, who are supported by the government, broadcast interviews with stem cell clinicians, who seemingly solicit patients for unproven treatments. However, the proposed amendment does to some extent address the issue that the current non-statutory guidelines require a revisit. The contents of the proposed amendment should be aligned with ICMR-DBT stem cell guidelines and other countries’ regulations, especially the definition of minimal and substantial or more than minimal manipulation. We further suggest that minimal manipulation in stem cells should also be regulated as a drug, as the exemption of “minimal manipulation” of cells and “homologous use” from the drug approval process has enabled the mushrooming of unproven stem cell therapies in many developed nations, such as the USA. The international community also needs to rethink whether “minimal processing and homologous use” should be allowed without stringent oversight in the name of “clinical innovation” (Lipworth et al., 2018Lipworth W. Stewart C. Kerridge I. The Need for Beneficence and Prudence in Clinical Innovation with Autologous Stem Cells.Perspect. Biol. Med. 2018; 61: 90-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a lack of interaction among different mechanisms of the stem cell governance system in India, which includes, but is not limited to, scientists, clinicians, industry, and policymakers. The inconsistencies between the national stem cell guidelines and the draft amendment have exposed this deficit. The entire episode suggests that even the key departments of the same ministry are not in alignment with each other. Unless the above deficits are addressed, the administration of unproven stem cell therapies will continue to flourish in India.

https://openalex.org/W2896841300,"Animal-induced galls are considered extended phenotypes of their inducers, and therefore plant morphogenesis and metabolism may vary according to the species of gall inducers. The alterations in vacuolar and apoplastic polyphenols, carotenoids, chlorophyll fluorescence rates, PSII quantum yield, and phospholipid peroxidation were studied in galls induced by Ditylenchus gallaeformans (Nematoda) on Miconia albicans and M. ibaguensis (Melastomataceae), and by an unidentified Eriophyidae (Acarina) on M. ibaguensis. The focus currently addressed is gall metabolism as the extended phenotype of the gall inducers, and the neglected determination of gall functionalities over host plant peculiarities. Galls induced by D. gallaeformans on M. albicans and by the Eriophyidae on M. ibaguensis have increased accumulation of apoplastic and vacuolar phenolics, which is related to the control of phospholipid peroxidation and photoprotection. The galls induced by D. gallaeformans on M. ibaguensis have higher carotenoid and vacuolar polyphenol contents, which are related to excessive sunlight energy dissipation as heat, and photoprotection. Accordingly, antioxidant strategies varied according to the gall-inducing species and to the host plant species. The distinctive investments in carotenoid and/or in polyphenol concentrations in the studied galls seemed to be peculiar mechanisms to maintain oxidative homeostasis. These mechanisms were determined both by the stimuli of the gall-inducing organism and by the intrinsic physiological features of the host plant species. Therefore, the roles of both associated organisms in host plant-galling organisms systems over gall metabolism is attested."
https://openalex.org/W2897859297,"Background and purpose Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common metabolic disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia, it can be categorized by T1DM and T2DM. T1DM is also reported to cause bone loss. However, most reports regarding this aspect of T1DM have only investigated a single site; a comparison of bone loss from different areas of the body is still lacking. Methods Thirty-five 12-week-old Sprague Dawley® (SD) rats were separated to seven groups. Five rats were euthanized without any surgery at 0 weeks for histological examination and determination of baseline characteristics. In 15 of the rats, DM was induced via Streptozotocin (STZ)-injection, and they were separated to 3 groups (4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after STZ-injection). The remaining 15 rats were used as the control group (4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after saline-injection). We tested bone-mass loss at four skeletal sites, the tibia, the femur greater trochanter, the spine, and the mandibular bones using micro-computed tomography (CT) and histological tests. Results Tibia was influenced the most obvious(BV/TV decreased by 27.3%, 52.5%, and 81.2% at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, respectively. p<0.05). In contrast, the other three sites were influenced to a lesser extent and bone loss became prominent at a later time point according to the histological and micro-CT tests(Femur: BV/TV did not decrease significantly at the first month or second month. However, and decreased by 49.4% at the third month, P<0.05. Mandible: the BV/TV only decreased by 6.5% at 1 month after STZ-injection. There was still a significant difference between the second and third months. The BV/TV decreased by 47.0% and 68.1% at 2 months and 3 months, respectively, (p<0.05) Spine: the BV/TV only decreased by 6.7%. However, significant change was observed in the spine at the second month and third month after STZ injection. The BV/TV decreased by 45.4% and 64.3%, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion The results indicate that T1DM can severely influence the bone structure of the 4 skeletal sites. Further, areas with dense trabecular bones were influenced less and at a later time point in comparison to the tibial region. Clinical relevance Our research can serve as a guide to help increase the success rate of implant treatment, and help decrease the fracture risk in different bone types with greater accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2897767563,"Nutrient loss reduction strategies have recently been developed in the U.S. Midwest to decrease the environmental footprint associated with nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. Although these strategies generally suggest decreasing N rates and shifting the timing of N application from fall to spring, the spatiotemporal impacts of these practices on maize yield and fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE, kg grain yield increase per kg N applied) have not been assessed at the watershed scale using crop simulation models. We simulated the effects of N fertilizer rate (0, 168, 190, 224 kg N ha-1) and application timing [fall-applied N (FN): 100% N applied on 1 December; spring-applied N (SN): 100% N applied 10 days before planting; split N: 66% N applied on 1 December + 34% N applied 10 days before planting] on maize grain yield (GY) across 3042 points in Illinois during 2011–2015 using the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model. When simulations were scaled up to the watershed level, results suggest that increases in average maize GY for SN compared to FN occurred in years with higher than average winter rainfall (2011, 2013), whereas yields were similar (+/- 4%) in 2012, 2014, and 2015. Accordingly, differences in NUE for SN compared to FN were small (0.0–1.4 kg GY/kg N) when cumulative winter rainfall was < 300 mm, but increased to 0.1–9.2 kg GY/kg N when winter rainfall was > 500 mm at both 168 kg N ha-1 and 224 kg N ha-1. The combined practice of reducing N fertilizer amounts from 224 kg N ha-1 to 190 kg N ha-1 and shifting from FN to SN resulted in a wide range of yield responses during 2011–2015, with the probability of increasing yields varying from <10% to >70% of simulation points within a watershed. Positive impacts on both GY and NUE occurred in only 60% of simulations for this scenario, highlighting the challenge of simultaneously improving yield and NUE with a 15% N rate reduction in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2896062316,"Models to predict codend size selectivity for four major commercial species-European hake (Merluccius merluccius), Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), and Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus)-in Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries were established based on data collected during fishing trials using the two legal codends: a 40 mm square-mesh codend and a 50 mm diamond-mesh codend. The models were applied to predict the extent to which size selection depend on codend type, also accounting for the potential effect of codend catch size and fishing season. The size selectivity of the two codends was evaluated and compared in identical simulated controlled conditions. Mesh type significantly affected the size selection of Norway lobster alone, with a slightly better performance of the 40 mm square-mesh codend. A high risk of retention of undersized individuals was predicted for both codends for all species except Norway lobster."
https://openalex.org/W2896259239,"Introduction Maternal mortality was the subject of the United Nations’ fifth Millennium Development Goal which was to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters from 1990 to 2015. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), target 3.1 requires participating countries to reduce their maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Although much research has been conducted, knowing the spatial patterns and risk factors associated with maternal mortality in developing countries helps target scarce resources and intervention programmes to high risk areas for the greatest impact. Methods Data were analysed from a longitudinal open cohort of women aged 15 to 49 years, enrolled from 2006 to 2010. An inverse distance weighted method of interpolation was used to assess spatial patterns of maternal mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with maternal mortality. Results The overall maternal mortality rate for the 36 792 study participants for the five years was 0.79 per 1000 person years. The trend declined from 90.42 in 2006 to 57.42 in 2010. Marked geographical differences were observed in maternal mortality patterns. The main causes of maternal death were eclampsia (23%), haemorrhage (22%) and abortion-related complications (10%). There was a reduced risk of 82% (HR = 0.18, 95% CI:0.05–0.74) and 78% (HR = 0.22, 95% CI:0.05–0.92) for women aged 20–29 and 30–39 years, respectively, compared with those younger than 20 years. While being married had a protective effect of 94% (HR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01–0.51) compared with being single, women who were widowed had an increased risk of maternal death of 913% (HR = 9.13, 95% CI: 1.02–81.94). Women who belong to poorer, poor and least poor socioeconomic quintile had 84%, 71% and 72% reduction in risk of maternal mortality respectively compared to those in the poorest category (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06–0.42; HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12–0.69; HR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10–0.80). Conclusion Maternal mortality has declined in rural southern Tanzania since 2006, with geographical differences in patterns of death. Eclampsia, haemorrhage and abortion-related complications are the three leading causes of maternal death in the region, with risk factors being younger than 20 years, being single or widowed, and having a low socioeconomic status."
https://openalex.org/W2896588336,"Purpose The survival benefit of second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) has recently been established. We conducted a nationwide population-based outcomes study of patients with MGC receiving second-line chemotherapy to better understand real-world treatment patterns and outcomes. Materials and methods Data were collected from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We identified 509 newly diagnosed patients with MGC in 2010 who received second-line chemotherapy. These patients were divided into three groups for analyses: Group A comprised all patients who received second-line chemotherapy (N = 509); Group B comprised those who received fluoropyrimidine (Fp) plus platinum as first-line treatment, followed by irinotecan-based or taxane-based regimens as second-line chemotherapy (N = 284); and Group C comprised those who received Fp plus cisplatin as first-line treatment, followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/oxaliplatin, irinotecan-based, or taxane-based regimens as second-line chemotherapy (N = 184). Results Among patients who received first-line chemotherapy, 47.2% (509/1,078) continued to receive second-line chemotherapy. The most commonly used second-line chemotherapy regimens were 5-FU/irinotecan, 5-FU/oxaliplatin, and docetaxel. The median overall survival (OS) of all 509 patients was 5.2 months. The time from the start date of first-line chemotherapy to the start date of second-line chemotherapy > 6.1 months was an independent prognostic factor for improved OS. The type of chemotherapy regimen was not a significant factor affecting OS. Conclusion The findings provide a better understanding of second-line treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with MGC and will help guide treatment decisions in real-world clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2953275646,"Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) proteins are an important family of chromosomal proteins conserved among all major eukaryotic lineages. While HP1 proteins are best known for their role in heterochromatin, many HP1 proteins function in euchromatin as well. As a group, HP1 proteins carry out diverse functions, playing roles in the regulation of gene expression, genome stability, chromatin structure, and DNA repair. While the heterochromatic HP1 proteins are well studied, our knowledge of HP1 proteins with euchromatic distribution is lagging behind. We have created the first mutations in HP1B, a Drosophila HP1 protein with euchromatic function, and the Drosophila homolog most closely related to mammalian HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ. We find that HP1B is a non-essential protein in Drosophila, with mutations affecting fertility and animal activity levels. In addition, animals lacking HP1B show altered food intake and higher body fat levels. Gene expression analysis of animals lacking HP1B demonstrates that genes with functions in various metabolic processes are affected primarily by HP1B loss. Our findings suggest that there is a link between the chromatin protein HP1B and the regulation of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2896073742,"To investigate the effect of a free radical scavenger (tempol) after relief of partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) on bladder function in a rat model.pBOO was induced in 50 eight-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats and relieved 3 weeks later. The rats were divided randomly into 5 groups: sham-operated, tempol-treated for 1 week (Treat-1w) or 3 weeks (Treat-3w), and no treatment for 1 week (nonTreat-1w) or 3 weeks (nonTreat-3w). Awaken cystometrograms were obtained 1 or 3 weeks after relief according to the grouping. The bladders were isolated and weighed. H&E, Masson's trichrome and TUNEL staining were used to analyze histological changes. The oxidative stress assessed using malondialdehyde. The expression of beta-3 adrenoreceptor was examined by Western blotting.The tempol-treated groups exhibited a significant decrease in the number of non-voiding contractions per voiding cycle (nonTreat-1w vs. Treat-1w, 1.18±0.82 vs. 0.36±0.40, P = 0.010; nonTreat-3w vs. Treat-3w, 1.51±0.69 vs. 0.23±0.25, P = 0.002). The thickness and collagen fiber deposition of the detrusor muscle layer was significantly decreased in the treated groups. Apoptosis detected was mainly observed in the urothelial cell layer, although the rate of apoptosis was significantly decreased in the treated groups (48.9±3.36% vs. 32.7±11.10%, P = 0.024; 25.8±4.67% vs. 15.7±9.83%, P = 0.314). The tempol-treated groups showed significant decreases in the MDA concentrations at both 1 and 3 weeks after relief. The expression of the beta-3 adrenoreceptor was increased in the tempol-treated rats.Ischemic reperfusion injury after relief of pBOO caused histological and functional changes in the bladder. Free radical scavenger treatment prevented this oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2896648213,"A range of cellular functions have been attributed to caveolae, flask-like invaginations of the plasma membrane. Here, we have used RNA-seq to achieve quantitative transcriptional profiling of primary embryonic fibroblasts from caveolin 1 knockout mice (CAV1-/- MEFs), and thereby to gain hypothesis-free insight into how these cells respond to the absence of caveolae. Components of the extracellular matrix were decisively over-represented within the set of genes displaying altered expression in CAV1-/- MEFs when compared to congenic wild-type controls. This was confirmed biochemically and by imaging for selected examples. Up-regulation of components of the extracellular matrix was also observed in a second cell line, NIH-3T3 cells genome edited to delete CAV1. Up-regulation of components of the extracellular matrix was detected in vivo by assessing collagen deposition and compliance of CAV1-/- lungs. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the cellular function of caveolae."
https://openalex.org/W2949465362,"Prosthetic elevated vacuum is a suspension method used to reduce daily volume changes of the residual limb. Evaluation of the effectiveness of these systems is limited due to a lack of correlation to actual socket air pressure, particularly during unconstrained movements. This may explain some of the variability in functional outcomes reported in the literature. Our objective was to develop a light-weight portable socket measurement system to quantify internal socket air pressure, temperature, and acceleration; and to present preliminary results from implementation with three transtibial prosthesis users with mechanical elevated vacuum pumps. Participants completed five functional tasks with and without the vacuum pumps actively connected, including the 2-Minute Walk test, 5-Times Sit-to-Stand test, 4-Square Step test, L-Test, and Figure-8 test. Results demonstrated different gait profiles and pressure ranges for each user. Two of the participants demonstrated substantially lower air pressure (higher vacuum) over time while the pump was active compared to inactive. The minimum air pressure measured for all participants was -34.6 ± 7.7 kPa. One participant did not show substantial changes in pressure over time for either pump condition. Functional task performance was not significantly different between pump conditions. Correlation with accelerometer readings indicated peak positive pressures occurred just following initial contact of the foot in early stance, and the most negative pressures (highest vacuum) were observed throughout swing. This study has demonstrated the use of a portable data logging tool that may serve the clinical and research communities to quantify the operation of elevated vacuum systems, and better understand the variability of mechanical pump operation and overall system performance."
https://openalex.org/W2897168437,"Pancreatic Autoimmunity is defined as the presence of autoantibodies and more frequent need for insulin treatment. Affected women presenting recurrent implantation failure (RIF) or recurrent miscarriage (RM) are often misdiagnosed. The objective of thestudy was to describe clinical and metabolic profiles suggestive of Pancreatic Autoimmunity and therapeutic strategy in patients with RIF/RM. We analyzed retrospectively 735 patients, and have identified a subset (N = 20) with similar metabolic characteristics. At the same time, we included a control group (n = 39), with similar demographic characteristics and negative for pancreatic, thyroid or celiac disease autoimmunity. The patients identified with autoimmune metabolic problem (N = 20) had relatives with diabetes mellitus. At 120 minutes after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) low level of insulin secretion (<2 IU/ml) was found in 70% of patients. Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibodies, with or without other autoantibodies, were positive in80% of patients and anti-IA2 alone were positive I the rest. Since pregestational period, insulin administration was recommended for 10 patients, metformin for 4 patients and exclusively diet control in 5 of them. Significantly increased live bith rates (LBR) per cycle were observed after metabolic control (52%) compared with live birth rate (LBR) after cycles without control (7.5%) (p<0.0001). We noticed 2 cases of pre-eclampsia and 6 low-birth weights. Insulin administration was needed during the pregnancy in 68% of patients and after childbirth in 31.57% of them. In our control group, all of patients (n = 39) underwent ART (53.8% SET and 46.1% DET) with a 50% (SET) and 61.9% (DET) live birth rate (LBR) per cycle. Patients with RIF/RM, normal BMI, low insulin levels after OGTT could benefit from additional metabolic immune testing. A correct diagnosis and treatment could have a positive impact on their reproductive results and live birth rate."
