https://openalex.org/W2092111364,"The biogenic amines serotonin and octopamine are present in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Serotonin, detected histochemically in whole mounts, is localized in two pharyngeal neurons that appear to be neurosecretory. Octopamine, identified radioenzymatically in crude extracts, probably is also localized in a few neurons. Exogenous serotonin and octopamine elicit specific and opposite behavioral responses in Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that these compounds function physiologically as antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1560554297,"A culture of the human epidermoid carcinoma HEp 3 produces a plasminogen activator of Mr = 53,000 which we have purified to apparent homogeneity from serum-free conditioned medium by the combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The highly purified protein has the following properties: 1) It is indistinguishable from urinary urokinase in electrophoretic mobility, in immunodiffusion, and in autoradiographically visualized tryptic peptide maps obtained from the 125I-labeled proteins. 2) The HEp 3 protein differs from urinary urokinase in the following respects: (a) although the apparent molecular weights of the two are identical (Mr = 53,000), the urinary enzyme consists of two polypeptide chains, whereas the HEp 3 protein is a single chain form. (b) Urinary urokinase can be labeled easily by incubation with radioactive diisopropylfluorophosphate but the HEp 3 protein cannot. (c) When assayed by the hydrolysis of a synthetic chromogenic peptide substrate, the HEp 3 enzyme has less than 1% of the catalytic activity of urinary urokinase. 3) On controlled exposure to plasmin, the HEp 3 protein is converted to an active enzyme that is identical with urinary urokinase in molecular weight, polypeptide chain composition, diisopropylfluorophosphate labeling, and specific catalytic activity. We conclude that the HEp 3 protein is a proenzyme that can be converted to active two-chain urokinase by plasmin, probably by a single proteolytic nick in the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1642493314,"A differentiated population of cells with metachromatically staining granules and surface IgE receptors was obtained from mouse bone marrow cultured for 2 weeks in the presence of conditioned medium derived from concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes. The cells were found to incorporate large amounts of [35S]sulfate into an intracellular 35S-labeled proteoglycan of Mr approximately 200,000 containing a maximum of seven glycosaminoglycan side chains (Mr = 25,000). After chondroitinase ABC treatment of density gradient-purified [3H] serine-labeled proteoglycan, the resulting core was Mr approximately 26,000 as assessed by gel filtration. Two-dimensional cellulose acetate electrophoresis of beta-eliminated 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan revealed a single type of glycosaminoglycan that migrated at the position of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate E from squid cartilage. Chondroitinase ABC degradation of the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan yielded two cleavage products in approximately equal molar amounts which co-migrated in both descending paper chromatography and high voltage paper electrophoresis with a monosulfated disaccharide, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactose, and a disulfated disaccharide, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-6-di-O-sulfo-D-galactose. The release of some free [35S]sulfate from the oversulfated disaccharide with either chondro-4-sulfatase or chondro-6-sulfatase and the complete desulfation by their combined action established that the oversulfated disaccharide contained N-acetylgalactosamine-4,6-disulfate. The 35S]labeled proteoglycan of these unique IgE receptor-bearing and histamine-containing cells, therefore, is composed of chondroitin sulfate E rather than heparin glycosaminoglycan, and thus is the first identification of such an intracellular localized proteoglycan in a mammalian cell."
https://openalex.org/W1542802597,"Fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) was identified and isolated from rat liver cytosol by gel filtration, thin layer isoelectric focusing, and affinity chromatography. FABP (Mr 12,080 +/- 80) exists in several immunochemically identical forms differing in isoelectric pH, which may in part reflect differences in their respective complements of bound endogenous ligand. FABP-bound fatty acids accounted for 60% of total cytosolic long chain fatty acids but contained no detectable phospholipid; the substantial enrichment of FABP in 18:2 and 20:4 as compared with whole liver homogenate was not influenced by homogenization of tissue in EDTA. The amino acid composition of FABP suggests that it is closely related or identical with certain similar neutral and acidic cytosolic proteins reported from other laboratories. By quantitative radial immunodiffusion, FABP concentration in cytosol from livers of sexually mature female rats exceeded that from mature males (51.7 +/- 3.0 versus 39.8 +/- 4.0 micrograms/mg of protein, p less than 0.05), confirming earlier studies in which sex steroid effects on rates of fatty acid utilization were correlated with FABP concentration as determined by means of a binding assay. The abundance of FABP, its importance in the cytosolic binding of endogenous as well as exogenous fatty acids, and its demonstrated correlation with rates of hepatocyte fatty acid utilization provide additional evidence for its relationship to the cellular metabolism of long chain fatty acids."

https://openalex.org/W1598307552,"Microsomal heme oxygenase has been purified from bovine spleen to homogeneity using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, initial hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel filtration, and repeat hydroxyapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of congruent to 31,000. It had a Km for heme of 0.93 microM, a specific activity of 6770 units/mg of protein, and a turnover number of 3.5 mol/mol of enzyme/min. Amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme revealed an abundance of glutamine and glutamic acid residues, a log tryptophan content (2 tryptophan residues/mol of enzyme), and four free sulfhydryl groups, only two of which were accessible to sulfhydryl (--SH) inactivating reagents without unfolding of the protein. Consistent with these findings, the purified enzyme had a relatively low extinction coefficient at 280 nm (E11%cm = 8.12) and was relatively resistant to inactivation by --SH inactivating reagents. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase from bovine liver was purified to homogeneity and biliverdin reductase from bovine spleen was partially purified. The heme oxygenase system was reconstituted from preparations of all three purified enzymes and, utilizing this reconstituted system, the specific sites of the inhibitory actions of --SH inactivating reagents, inorganic metals, and metalloporphyrins on the heme degrading sequence of reactions were examined. Sn-, Co-, Zn-, and Mn-protoporphyrin strongly inhibited heme degradation in a competitive manner. The Ki values for Sn-, Co-, and Zn-protoporphyrin were determined to be 0;033, 0.082, and 0.13 microM, respectively. Mg-, Ni-, and Cu-protoporphyrin had little effect on heme degradation by the reconstituted system. Metals such as Pt2+ and Hg2+ strongly inhibited the activity of the reconstituted heme oxygenase system, but the principal site of action of these metals was at the level of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase or biliverdin reductase. Similarly --SH inactivating reagents, such as p-chloromercuribenzoate, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), or N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the reaction catalyzed by the reconstituted heme oxygenase system principally by inhibiting the activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1570572659,"The major labeled constituent produced in cellular protein during the incubation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with [3H]putrescine or [terminal methylenes-3H]spermidine was identified as hypusine (N epsilon -(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine). This unusual amino acid was found to occur predominantly in one relatively acidic low molecular weight protein. When CHO cells were labeled with [4,5-3H)lysine, a small portion of the radioactivity of the cellular protein fraction, after release by proteolytic digestion or acid hydrolysis, chromatographed at the position of hypusine. Oxidative degradation of this isolated labeled material yielded labeled lysine, thus, providing evidence that lysine is the amino acid precursor of hypusine. Upon incubation of CHO cells with the metal chelator, alpha,alpha-dipyridyl, and either [4,5]3H]lysine or [terminal methylenes-3H]spermidine, label was incorporated into a protein-bound material, the chromatographic properties of which, after release by digestion, were found to be different from those of hypusine. This constituent of cell protein was identified as the unhydroxylated form of hypusine, deoxyhypusine (N epsilon -(4-aminobutyl)lysine). Evidence that the normal biosynthesis of hypusine proceeds through hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine was obtained by demonstration of conversion of protein-bound deoxyhypusine to protein-bound hypusine both in intact cells and in cell-free lysate. In the presence of the metal chelator, alpha,alpha-dipyridyl, deoxyhypusine accumulated in a single protein whose two dimensional electrophoretic properties were indistinguishable from those of the usual hypusine-containing protein. This finding supports the proposed mechanism in which peptide-bound lysine is converted to peptide-bound hypusine through hydroxylation of the transitory intermediate, deoxyhypusine."
https://openalex.org/W1608617433,"In the absence of Ca2+ cells were not sensitive to the toxic proteins abrin and modeccin and the sensitivity to ricin and diphtheria toxin was reduced. Calcium deprivation had little effect on the binding and endocytosis of abrin, modeccin, and ricin. The binding of diphtheria toxin to cells was, however, reduced, Verapamil and Co2+ inhibited 45Ca2+ uptake and protected cells against abrin and modeccin at low concentrations of Ca2+. At higher Ca2+ concentrations the protection was overcome. La3+ inhibited strongly 45Ca2+ uptake and protected well against all four toxins, even at high Ca2+ concentrations. Fe3+ also afforded protection although it did not inhibit Ca2+ uptake. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, which strongly increases the uptake of 45Ca2+, protected cells well against abrin and modeccin, slightly against diphtheria toxin, but not against ricin. Both Ca2+ deprivation and treatment with A23187 protected well against the hybrid toxin abrin A-chain/ricin B-chain. Such treatment afforded little protection against the hybrid ricin A-chain/abrin B-chain. Apparently the protection against abrin is associated with its A-chain. The calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine, protected strongly against modeccin and diphtheria toxin. The data indicate that Ca2+ is involved in the entry mechanism for abrin, modeccin, and ricin, possibly as a Ca2+ flux together with the toxins."

https://openalex.org/W1589742976,"Treatment of male mice with excess androgens increased the activity of renal ornithine decarboxylase 60-fold in the BALB/c strain and 4-fold in the CD-1 strain. Part of the increase in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase was due to a decreased rate of degradation of the enzyme since activity declined more slowly (t1/2 80 min) in androgen-treated BALB/c mice than in controls (t1/2 20 min) when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. When ornithine decarboxylase protein was labeled in vivo by injection of [5-14C]difluoromethylornithine, the rate of disappearance of the labeled protein was exactly the same as the rate of loss of ornithine decarboxylase activity when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, confirming that ornithine decarboxylase protein does turn over rapidly in vivo. The half-life of another rapidly turning over enzyme important in polyamine metabolism, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, was also increased in the mouse kidney by androgen treatment. These results indicate that steroid hormones can affect the level of certain proteins by changing the rate of degradation and that the labeling of ornithine decarboxylase by reaction with radioactive alpha-difluoromethylornithine in vivo provides a useful method for studying the degradation of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1600354532,"An E. coli mutant that lacks tRNA-guanine transglycosylase was isolated by random screening from a collection of Escherichia coli mutants obtained with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The defective gene, named tgt, was mapped at about 9 min on the E. coli chromosome, and the gene order was shown to be phoB-tgt-tsx. tgt was transferred to an E. coli strain with a defined genetic background by P1 transduction to investigate its function. The mutant thus obtained lacked queuosine (2-amino-5-[3S, 4R, 5S)-4,5-dihydroxycyclopent-1-en-3-ylaminomethyl]-7-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-pyrro lo-[2,3-D]-pyrimidin-4-one) in tRNA, indicating that the enzyme is actually involved in the biosynthesis of queuosine in tRNA. No clear biological defect was observed in the mutant, and, in fact, it grew slightly faster than the control isogenic strain. tRNATyr lacking queuosine, isolated from the mutant, showed no significant biological difference from normal queuosine-containing tRNA in amino acid acceptor activity or amino acid transfer in a cell-free protein synthesizing system directed by synthetic polynucleotide. The only phenotypic change observed in the mutant thus far is marked reduction of viability when the cells are kept under unsuitable conditions for growth, suggesting that the presence of queuosine in tRNA is important to E. coli for survival in the natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W66128515,"A new system was developed for studying the assembly of collagen fibrils in vitro. A partially purified enzyme preparation containing both procollagen N-proteinase and c-proteinase (EC 3.4.24.00) activities was used to initiate fibril formation by removal of the N- and C-propeptides from type I procollagen in a physiological buffer at 35-37 degrees C. The kinetics of fibril formation were similar to those observed for fibril formation with tissue-extracted collagen in the same buffer system, except that the lag phase was longer. The longer lag phase was in part accounted for by the time required to convert procollagen to collagen. Similar results were obtained when an intermediate containing the C-propeptide but not the N-propeptide was used as a substrate. Therefore, removal of the c-propeptide appeared to be the critical step for fibril formation under the conditions used here. The fibrils formed by enzymic cleavage of procollagen or pCcollagen appeared microscopically to be more tightly packed than fibrils formed directly from collagen under the same conditions. This impression was confirmed by the observation that the fibrils formed by cleavage of procollagen were stable to temperatures 1.5-2 degrees C higher than fibers formed from extracted collagen under the same conditions. When smaller amounts of procollagen proteinase were used, the rate of cleavage of procollagen to collagen was markedly reduced. The fibrils which formed under these conditions were up to 3 micrometers in diameter. Some appeared to contain branch points."

https://openalex.org/W1594409612,"Binding of fluorescyl ligand by five IgG anti-fluorescyl hybridoma proteins (4-4-20, 6-10-6, 20-4-4, 20-19-=1, 20-20-3) was examined. Relative reduction in fluorescence of bound fluorescein, deuterium oxide (D2O)-induced enhancement of fluorescence, and the effects of pH on binding kinetics were measured for each clone. Individual hybridoma proteins (all of which bind fluorescein with relatively high affinity) exhibited significant differences in the relative contribution of various forces (hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions) to binding and hence, affinity. The extent of such variations in binding mechanisms among monoclonal antibodies binding the same hapten is indicative of the extreme functional diversity of active sites. In addition, ligand binding by clone 20-20-3 was examined in greater detail. ABsorption spectra of ligand bound by purified intact antibody, Fab fragments, and reassociated heavy and light chains indicated that protonation of the fluorescyl ligand by a residue within the active site contributed significantly to the binding free energy. Comparative dissociation rates of fluorescein and a structural analog, rhodamine 110, were used to quantitatively substantiate the contribution of this interaction. Association and dissociation rate studies with fluorescein and antibody indicated that: 1) the active site appeared to undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding, and 2) neither intact disulfides nor intersite cooperativity affected the dissociation rate of bound ligand. Observed mechanisms of ligand binding are discussed in terms of proposed mechanisms of antibody affinity maturation and diversity."

https://openalex.org/W1604010542,"Elicited rat peritoneal mononuclear cells converted arachidonic acid to a new dihydroxy acid, 5(S), 15(S)-dihydroxy-6,13-trans-8,11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-DiHETE). In this system, the amount of 5,15-DiHETE formed was about 20% that of leukotriene B4. The structure of the compound was determined by ultraviolet and mass spectrometric analysis, and comparison to a reference compound prepared by incubation of synthetic 5(R,S)-hydroxy- or hydroperoxy-6-trans-8,11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(R,S)-HETE or HPETE) with soybean lipoxygenase (linoleate:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.12). Cell incubations performed under an atmosphere of 18O2 demonstrated that both hydroxyl groups in the cell product derived from molecular oxygen and that the oxygen atoms were from different oxygen molecules. Steric analysis indicated that each hydroxyl group had the S-configuration. The structural data thus indicate that 5,15-DiHETE is formed by an enzymatic double oxygenation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by both C-5 and C-15 lipoxygenases. Incubations with with [3H 8]5 (S)-HETE and [3H8]15(S)-HETE revealed that both compounds could be converted to the product. When [3H8]5(S), 15(S)-DiHPETE was added to cells, the majority of the substrate was reduced to 5,15-DiHETE. Leukocytes obtained from three human donors with peripheral blood eosinophilia also synthesized 5,15-DiHETE. Formation of the compound occurred in both eosinophils and neutrophils from these donors."
https://openalex.org/W1517402475,"Cell surface glycosyltransferases are thought to participate in a variety of cellular interactions, but their specific glycoside acceptors have received little attention. In this paper, poly(N)-acetyllactosamine glycoconjugates are shown to be the endogenous substrates for embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell surface galactosyltransferases. All controls have been performed to ensure a surface localization for the galactosyltransferase activity. The galactosylated product(s) is relatively insoluble in organic solvents, is larger than conventional glycopeptides following pronase digestion, and is highly sensitive to endo-beta-galactosidase degradation. Solubilized polylactosaminyl glycoconjugates serve as competitive exogenous acceptors for the surface galactosyltransferase. In addition, the endogenous galactosyl acceptor(s) reacts with antiserum directed against EC cell poly(N)-acetyllactosamines. Anti-EC antiserum inhibits galactosylation of endogenous acceptors, simultaneously stimulates galactosylation of an exogenous acceptor, and immunoprecipitates 74% of the reaction product. Differentiated EC cells no longer react with anti-EC antiserum and no longer show anti-EC antiserum effects on surface galactosyltransferase activity. Interestingly, forced galactosylation with UDPGal releases polylactosaminyl substrates from the cell surface. In the absence of UDPGal, glycoconjugate release is dramatically reduced. GDPMan cannot substitute for UDPGal, and a galactosyltransferase inhibitor prevents glycoside release from the cell surface. Thus, surface galactosyltransferase preferentially binds poly(N)-acetyllactosamine glycoconjugates and serves as at least one of their surface receptors on EC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1497802086,"Microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity toward chenodeoxycholic acid and testosterone has been isolated from rat liver and appears to be homogeneous in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. The conjugating activities toward chenodeoxycholic acid and testosterone co-purified and showed identical mobilities in disc gel electrophoresis, indicating that chenodeoxycholic acid and testosterone are glucuronidated by a single form of enzyme. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities toward estrone, bilirubin, 4-nitrophenol, and morphine did not co-purify with the activity toward chenodeoxycholic acid and testosterone and were not detectable in the pure enzyme in the presence or absence of phospholipids. In addition to glucuronic acid conjugation, the enzyme is able to catalyze galacturonic acid conjugation of chenodeoxycholic acid and testosterone. The enzyme has a subunit Mr approximately 54,000 and in the presence of the stabilizing detergent chenodeoxycholic acid, it appears to exist as an aggregate with an apparent Mr = 318,000 as estimated by gel filtration and 316,000 by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1590455940,"Purified rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase were co-reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylserine vesicles using a cholate dialysis technique. The co-reconstitution of the enzymes was demonstrated in proteoliposomes fractionated by centrifugation in a glycerol gradient. The proteoliposomes catalyzed the N-demethylation of a variety of substrates. Rotational diffusion of cytochrome P-450 was measured by detecting the decay of absorption anisotropy r(t), after photolysis of the heme.CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. The rotational mobility of cytochrome P-450, when reconstituted alone, was found to be dependent on the lipid to protein ratio by weight (L/P450) (Kawato, S., Gut, J., Cherry, R. J., Winterhalter, K. H., and Richter, C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7023-7029). About 35% of cytochrome P-450 was immobilized and the rest was rotating with a mean rotational relaxation time phi 1 of about 95 mus in L/P450 = 1 vesicle. In L/P450 = 10 vesicles, about 10% of P-450 was immobile and the rest was rotating with phi 1 congruent to 55 mus. Co-reconstitution of equimolar amounts of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into the above vesicles results in completely mobile cytochrome P-450 with a phi 1 congruent to 40 mus. Only a small decrease in the immobile fraction of cytochrome P-450 is observed when the molar ratio of cytochrome P-450 to the reductase is 5. The results suggest the formation of a monomolecular 1:1 complex between cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in the liposomes."
https://openalex.org/W1527756075,"The effect of bovine brain calmodulin on the assembly of pure bovine brain tubulin has been examined in the presence and absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). In the absence of MAPs, calmodulin enhances the rate and extent of polymerization of pure tubulin, probably by sequestering Ca2+ from tubulin since the effect is mimicked by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and parvalbumin. From stoichiometric considerations, all 4 Ca2+ binding sites of calmodulin appear to participate in this effect. In the presence of MAPs, calmodulin confers increased Ca2+ sensitivity on the tubulin polymerization process, enhancing the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on the rate and extent of assembly. The effect of calmodulin on the assembly of tubulin is dependent on the presence of Ca2+. The data suggest that calmodulin of both low (Ca1-22+.calmodulin) and high (Ca3-42+.calmodulin) Ca2+-induced inhibition of polymerization. Thus, calmodulin has dual and opposing actions on Ca2+ sensitivity of tubulin polymerization depending on the presence or absence of MAPs."

The initial oxidation products are radical cations which exhibit visible absorption maxima at 514, 490, and 472 nm (phenidone) and 535, 500, and 488 nm (BW755C). The radical cation of phenidone can be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as a complex multiline signal centered at g = 2.0039. In addition to being oxidized by peroxidases both compounds are cofactors for the reduction of 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid to 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid by the hydroperoxidase activity of purified and hematin-reconstituted prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase. As a consequence of their oxidation by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase, phenidone and BW755C inhibit the hydroperoxide-dependent oxidation of phenylbutazone, luminol, diphenylisobenzofuran, epinephrine, and guaiacol by ram seminal vesicle microsomes. The inhibition of phenylbutazone oxidation is competitive and exhibits Ki values of 16 microM (BW755C) and 45 microM (phenidone). BW755C and phenidone stimulate prostaglandin biosynthesis by purified and reconstituted prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase at concentrations up to 100 microM but inhibit at higher concentrations (I50 values approximately 210 microM and 1180 microM, respectively). The ability of phenidone and BW755C to act as peroxidase reducing cofactors or radical scavengers may contribute to their observed biochemical and pharmacological effects."

The functional roles of the two sites of covalent H2DIDS attachment have been investigated using reductive methylation with formaldehyde and borohydride, which is a substrate for band 3. Reductive methylation of outward facing lysing residues of intact cells can block the covalent H2DIDS reaction with both the 60,000- and the 38,000-dalton chymotryptic peptides (CH60 and CH38, respectively). The methylation does not interfere with reversible H2DIDS binding. Methylation of all copies of and 3 at both sites of covalent H2DIDS attachment inhibits Cl-Cl exchange by 75%. The same treatment does not detectably alter the apparent affinity for extracellular substrate (Br). The extent of transport inhibition by reductive methylation correlates very well with the extent of blockage of the Amino acid analysis indicates that the H2DIDS-binding lysine on CH38 rather than some coincidentally modified lysine is responsible for the inhibition. This lysine is therefore likely to be closely associated with the anion transport pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1501783828,"Evidence is presented that chemotaxis requires ATP or a closely related metabolite, in addition to its known requirements of ATP for synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and maintenance of the proton motive force. Previous studies demonstrated a loss of tumbling and chemotaxis, and depletion of ATP when hisF auxotrophs of Salmonella typhimurium are starved for histidine (Galloway, R. J., and Taylor, B. L. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 144, 1068-1075). In the present study, intracellular [AdoMet], membrane potential, and [ATP] were measured in a hisF mutant of S. typhimurium. Membrane potential, determined from partitioning of [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium ion between the inside and the outside of the cell, was about -150 mV at pH 7.6, and did not decrease in histidine starvation but was slightly increased. The concentration of AdoMet decreased from 0.4 mM to 0.3 mM during starvation but when cycloleucine, an inhibitor of AdoMet synthetase, was used to decrease [AdoMet] by a similar amount in histidine-fed cells there was little change in tumbling frequency. Intracellular [ATP] was reduced from 4.5 mM to less than 0.2 mM by histidine starvation. About 0.2 mM ATP was necessary for spontaneous tumbling. A similar [ATP] was required for tumbling in arsenate-treated cells. Adenine at concentrations as low as 20 nM caused a transient increase in both tumbling frequency and [ATP] in histidine-starved cells. Thus, out of three parameters tested, only the intracellular [ATP] correlated with changes in tumbling frequency in the histidine-starved cells."
https://openalex.org/W153832917,Active calcium uptake was demonstrated in a subcellular fraction of islets which was enriched in endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium uptake was stimulated by ATP in a magnesium-dependent manner. The rate of calcium accumulation was sustained by oxalate (10 mM) and uptake was prevented or reversed by addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. This calcium uptake process was not affected by azide or ruthenium red. Direct comparison of calcium uptake by endoplasmic reticulum-enriched and plasma membrane-enriched fractions indicated that the uptake was not due to contamination of the fraction with plasma membrane vesicles. These factors as well as the purity of the fraction indicate that the calcium uptake system resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. The properties of the islet endoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake system are similar to properties reported for endoplasmic reticulum derived from other cell types. These properties include stimulation by potassium and a Km for ionized calcium of 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM. The islet-cell endoplasmic reticulum may play a critical role in cellular calcium homeostasis and contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion.

In all cases, the major methylated lysine species is e-N-trimethyl lysine. The major arginine species is pmonomethyl arginine. The stoichiometry of the methylation was determined in similar experiments using proteins isolated from cells cultured in the presence of both ~-[~H]leucine and ~-[rnethyl-~H]-~-methionine. It is estimated that each of the three polypeptides contain one to three methylated lysine residues per molecule. In addition, there are one to two p-monomethyl arginines per molecule of both 68,000 polypeptide A and 68,000 polypeptide B."
https://openalex.org/W1580176171,"Mouse peritoneal macrophages have a phospholipase A2 activity which is optimally active at pH 8.5 (PLA8.5), requires 2 mM Ca2+ and is capable of hydrolyzing arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The specific activity of PLA8.5 can be greatly increased in macrophage sonicates by their incubation at 37 degrees C. This augmentation of PLA8.5 activity occurs maximally at pH 7.5, requires Ca2+, and is inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid and EDTA. The sulfhydryl-specific reagents N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibit PLA8.5 activation but have no effect on the fully activated PLA8.5 enzyme itself. PLA8.5 activation is also augmented by ATP and is inhibited by pretreatment of the sonicates with ATPase and by beta-gamma-methylene ATP. The addition of the catalytic subunit of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase to macrophage sonicates in the presence of 1 mM reduced glutathione augments PLA8.5 activation. These data suggest that a protein kinase may be involved in the activation of PLA8.5 in mouse macrophage sonicates."
https://openalex.org/W1538339687,"A competitive labeling method that measures the relative reactivity of lysines was used to study the structure of troponin-I. Troponin-I was acetylated free and complexed with troponin-C and troponin-T in the native state with [3H]acetic anhydride. The [3H]troponin-I was combined with [14C]troponin-I that had been acetylated in 6 M guanidine HCl and completely chemically labeled. Peptides containing labeled lysines were isolated following digestion with trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease and identified in the published sequence. The 3H/14C ratio of these peptides was used as a measure of the relative reactivity of the lysines. Troponin-I contains 24 lysines; we have identified 23 of these in 16 peptides. When troponin-I is labeled in a native complex, the lysines in the region from residues 40 to 98 are influenced: five become relatively less reactive (40, 65, 70, 78, and 90) and three become relatively more reactive (84, 87), and 98). All of these changes except Lys 70 can be seen when troponin-I binds to troponin-T. Lys 70 is reduced in reactivity when it binds to troponin-C. The lysines that appear to be important in binding of troponin-I to troponin-T are influenced by the binding of Ca2+ to troponin-C in the native troponin complex (in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2), suggesting for the first time that the troponin-IT interaction is affected by Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1541457771,"The marine sponge Microciona prolifera aggregation factor (MAF) is a 2 X 10(7) dalton proteoglycan. MAF mediates species-specific cell-cell recognition through two functionally different sites: a Ca2+-independent species-specific cell binding site and a Ca2+-dependent MAF-MAF binding site. Dissociation procedures combined with protease treatment were used to produce cell-binding pieces from the large complex. The seven different sized fragments produced were all uronic acid-rich glycoproteins of the apparent molecular weights: 15 X 10(6), 2.5 X 10(5), 1.2 X 10(5), 7 X 10(4), 2.7 X 10(4), 5 X 10(3), and 3.6 X 10(3). Each of the fragments retained species-specific binding to Microciona cells and was also capable of inhibiting MAF-promoted cell aggregation. However, the fragments were unable to bind to MAF-conjugated agarose beads in the presence or absence of CA2+ ions. These three properties are those expected for the cell binding site of MAF. Since the binding affinity decreased linearly with decreasing molecular weight of the fragments, we believe that the cell binding sites in MAF may be highly polyvalent, although to fully support such a concept, a detailed chemical characterization of each of the fragments is needed. A high valency of cell binding sites would overcome a relatively low Ka for the single site and would thereby not only guarantee specificity but also explain the need for the large size of the proteoglycan complex found to mediate species-specific sponge aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1544666832,"An 18O exchange method has been used to determine the location of carbonic anhydrase in mitochondria from rat liver and to examine the role of this enzyme in the kinetics of CO2 in resting and respiring mitochondria. Using digitonin subfractionation, we have determined that a substantial fraction, 40 to 60%, of the carbonic anhydrase activity in the mitochondrion from rat liver is located in the space between the inner and outer membranes; the remaining activity was found in the matrix with no detectable activity in the sedimented membranes. The total catalytic CO2 hydration activity measured in intact mitochondria from rat liver was about 1% of that found in an equal volume of rat erythrocytes. The apparent permeability constant representing the barrier for the diffusion of HCO3(-) from external solution to intramitochondrial carbonic anhydrase, 9 X 10(-5) cm s-1, is near in magnitude to the permeability constant for the diffusion of HCO3(-) across the rat erythrocyte membrane, 4 X 10(-4) cm s-2. Calcium-induced respiratory jumps were shown to cause changes in the rate of 18O exchange between CO2 and H2O that were consistent with a net uptake of CO2 by the mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1679047160,"Microtubule assembly is inhibited by anti-mitotic drugs such as colchicine or podophyllotoxin and also by sulfhydryl-oxidizing reagents, but it is not known which tubulin-tubulin interactions are disrupted by these agents. We have studied the interactions of a complex of tubulin, vinblastine, and tau protein with these agents. This complex has the form of a spiral filament and may consist of tubulin dimers joined end to end as in a protofilament; presumably, therefore, the lateral interaction sites should be accessible in this structure but not in the intact microtubule. Unlike the microtubule, the complex binds to colchicine and podophyllotoxin with high affinity. Again, unlike intact microtubules, the complex reacts with N,N'-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide) to generate an intra-chain cross-link in beta-tubulin. Tubulin molecules containing this cross-link are unable to polymerize, suggesting that formation of this cross-link involves sulfhydryl groups that are critical for assembly. These results are consistent with a model whereby colchicine-, podophyllotoxin-, and sulfhydryl-oxidizing agents inhibit microtubule assembly by preventing lateral interactions between tubulin molecules in adjacent protofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W1997419271,"The synergistic effect of serum on the drug combination of salicylhydroxamic acid plus glycerol, which is active against Trypanosoma brucei, is due to diffusible calcium ions. The synergistic activity can be removed by dialysis of the serum or by addition of calcium chelating agents. A buffer containing calcium can mimic the synergistic activity of serum. This finding may have important implications in the clinical management of African trypanosomiasis in humans. Calcium also has a synergistic effect on melarsoprol, the only drug available for treating sleeping sickness patients with central nervous system involvement, and the concentration of calcium has been reported to be depressed inthe serum of experimentally infected animals."
https://openalex.org/W1517337988,"7 alpha-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12 alpha-monooxygenase was purified from liver microsomes of phenobarbital-treated rabbits. The purification was carried out by solubilization of microsomes by cholate, fractionation with polyethylene glycol, affinity chromatography on cholate-Sepharose 4B column, hydroxylapatite column chromatography, chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column, and a second hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The purified preparation gave a single major band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contained 9.0 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein, which corresponded to 5.3-fold purification from microsomes on the basis of specific heme content. The specific activity of the enzyme expressed as enzyme activity per mg of enzyme protein was increased 315-fold from microsomes. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 56,000 from calibrated polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme-pH curve gave a peak at pH 7.0. The Michaelis constant for 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was 27 microM. Absorption spectra of the oxidized form of the enzyme showed a Soret band at 418 nm. 7 alpha-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12 alpha-monooxygenase activity was reconstituted from the purified cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, dilauroylglyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine, and NADPH. The purified enzyme was free from steroid 25-hydroxylase activity and that of 26- or 27-hydroxylase but revealed some activity for benzphetamine N-demethylation. The enzyme activity was not inhibited by metapyrone, aminoglutethimide, and KCN, but was seriously inhibited by nonionic detergents such as Emulgen 913. The enzyme was labile under low buffer concentrations but was stabilized at least for 4 weeks under higher buffer concentration such as 300 mM phosphate buffer."

https://openalex.org/W1562986785,"The production of highly purified, chemically well defined, iodinated beta-melanotropin possessing full biological activity is described. beta-Melanotropin, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, was iodinated using Iodogen as the oxidizing agent. Biological activity was recovered, following iodination, by incubating the iodinated peptide mixture in 0.75 M dithiothreitol at 37 degrees C for 18-24 h. The qualitative and quantitative effects of dithiothreitol and the changes that occurred in the iodination mixture with time were examined using high pressure liquid chromatography. This separation technique has proved to be a useful tool both for optimizing the iodination procedure and for the rapid, efficient purification of mono- and diiodinated beta-melanotropins. Amino acid analysis of these two peptides revealed modifications only of the one tyrosine residue (Tyr 5): the expected incorporation of iodine to form mono- or diiodo tyrosine. Monoiodo-beta-melanotropin had full biological activity, as measured by tyrosinase stimulation in Cloudman S91 melanoma cells, while diiodo-beta-melanotropin was an order of magnitude less active."
https://openalex.org/W1588166554,"Milk xanthine oxidase reacted with fluorodinitrobenzene resulting in the modification of two lysine residues with a 6-fold decrease in catalytic activity. Continued reaction with fluorodinitrobenzene up to a total of 11 dinitrophenyl residues/equivalent of enzyme-bound FAD resulted in no further decrease in activity. Stopped flow studies revealed that the modification perturbed the reduction of the enzyme by xanthine; this was 6-fold lower with modified than with native enzyme. The reaction of the reduced modified enzyme with oxygen was qualitatively and quantitatively the same as with native enzyme. One nitro group of each dinitrophenyl lysine residue is slowly reduced by xanthine; reduction of both nitro groups is achieved by dithionite. The two dinitrophenyl lysine reduces can be distinguished on the basis of their kinetics of reduction. One appears to be located on the protein surface and is reduced in an intermolecular reaction, while the other appears to be located in a pocket of the enzyme and is reduced in a slow intramolecular reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1573102197,"Following receptor-mediated endocytosis of trimethyllysine-labeled asialofetuin and agalacto-orosomucoid by liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells, respectively, the glycoproteins are degraded and the methylated lysine residues released. The free intracellular trimethyllysine is then converted, in addition to 2-N-acetyl-6-N-trimethyllysine, to 4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate, carnitine, and acetylcarnitine. In the presence of 1-amino-D-proline, a vitamin B6 antagonist, the total production from protein-bound trimethyllysine of 4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate, the immediate precursor of carnitine, carnitine, and its acetylated derivative was depressed by as much as 60-80% in perfused rat liver. The decreased synthesis of carnitine was accompanied by an accumulation of 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine, and intermediate in the carnitine biosynthetic pathway. The extent of 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine accumulation, which was not evident in the absence of added 1-amino-D-proline, depended on the dose of 1-amino-D-proline perfused through the liver. In addition, those effects of 1-amino-D-proline were almost completely reversed by inclusion of pyridoxine in the perfusing medium. These results support the suggestion of a requirement for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in the biosynthesis of carnitine by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1550739085,"Cloned mastocytoma P-815, 2-E-6 cells were used to investigate regulation of 5-lipoxygenase activity. 2-E-6 cells had high 5-lipoxygenase activity with slight 12-lipoxygenase activity. The 5-lipoxygenase activity was increased over 5-fold by treatment of the cells with 1 mM n-butyrate for 18 h. the most effective dose range being 0.1-5.0 mM. Treatment with n-butyrate for 18 h was more effective than treatment for 40 h. Addition of n-butyrate to an untreated cell homogenate had no stimulatory effect. The enhancement of 5-lipoxygenase activity by n-butyrate was accompanied by new synthesis of protein(s). 12-Lipoxygenase activity was not increased so much as 5-lipoxygenase activity by the treatment. This is the first report of stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase activity in cultured cells. The different responses of the two lipoxygenases to n-butyrate treatment strongly suggest that 5-lipoxygenase is a different enzyme from 12-lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1583618668,"NADH-dependent reduction of microsomal cytochrome P-450 has been analyzed kinetically by observing formation of the ferrous-carbonyl complex. Reduction is best described by two exponential equations with apparent first-order rate constants of 1.49 +/- 0.20 and 0.077 +/- 0.015 min-1. By either selective removal or inhibition of specific electron carriers, the kinetic data of minimally altered microsomes are further resolved into a third slow phase. Either addition of anti-cytochrome b5 immune globulin or reduction of cytochrome b5 with ascorbic acid markedly diminishes only the third phase. In reconstitution of purified flavoproteins, phospholipids, and a single isozymic form of cytochrome P-450, without cytochrome b5 only biphasic reduction of cytochrome P-450 is observed. Thus, microsomal cytochrome P-450 appears to be reduced via two independent pathways of electron transport from NADH; the biphasic reduction occurs via cytochrome P-450 reductase while the slower monophasic reduction occurs via cytochrome b5. Multiphasic reduction occurs via cytochrome b5. Multiphasic kinetics are not altered by in vivo inductions of different isozymes of cytochrome P-450. Accordingly, the rates of reduction appear to be an intrinsic property of the electron transport process and not directed by the heterogeneity of the isozymic mixture of ultimate electron acceptors."
