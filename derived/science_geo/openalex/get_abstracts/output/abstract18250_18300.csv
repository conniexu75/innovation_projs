https://openalex.org/W1521387895,"We have identified and purified a protein complex from human red blood cells that activates the multicatalytic protease (MCP). The complex, which we call the regulator, sediments at 11 S and is composed of 30-kDa subunits. The regulator does not hydrolyze fluorogenic peptides, but when multicatalytic protease and regulator are combined, MCP cleaves succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin and Leu-Leu-Glu-p-nitroanilide as much as 60-fold faster. Hydrolysis of several other fluorogenic peptides is stimulated to a lesser extent, and activated MCP does not degrade ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates, bovine serum albumin, or lysozyme. Latent and activated forms of MCP display similar sensitivity to protease inhibitors, suggesting that activation does not generate new kinds of catalytic sites. In addition, ATP suppresses peptide hydrolysis by activated and latent MCPs to the same extent. Activation involves binding of regulator to MCP, and activated MCP migrates slower on native acrylamide gels. Dissociation of the MCP regulator complex during prolonged sedimentation on glycerol gradients releases active regulator and MCP molecules capable of being reactivated. Moreover, two-dimensional electrophoresis does not reveal changes in MCP or regulator subunits following activation. Thus, activation appears to result from reversible association of regulator subunits with MCP."
https://openalex.org/W2127115156,"The internalization of oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) by macrophages is hypothesized to contribute to foam cell formation and eventually to atherosclerotic lesion formation. OxLDL is a ligand for the acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) receptor, however, our data show that this receptor accounts for less than half of OxLDL uptake by mouse macrophages, suggesting additional receptors for OxLDL. We have developed a novel expression cloning strategy in order to isolate clones encoding OxLDL receptors. In addition to the AcLDL receptor, we isolated a molecular clone for a structurally unrelated receptor capable of mediating the high affinity uptake of OxLDL following transfection into cells. This receptor has been identified as the mouse Fc gamma RII-B2, a member of a family of receptors known to mediate immune complex uptake through recognition of the Fc region of IgG. The uptake of OxLDL by cells transfected with the Fc gamma RII-B2 clone is not blocked by AcLDL but is blocked by the anti-Fc gamma RII monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2."
https://openalex.org/W1581477122,"The proteins Fos and Jun dimerize to constitute the transcription factor AP-1 which is known to respond to treatment with phorbol esters. AP-1 binds to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements (TREs) palindromic sequences. cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) are very similar to TREs and CRE-binding proteins are similar in structure to Fos and Jun. Thus, the two main signal transduction pathways have closely related nuclear effectors which could possibly overlap and/or cross-talk. The gene CRE modulator (CREM) encodes both antagonists and an activator of the cAMP transcriptional response by alternative splicing. In this report we show that CREM antagonists are able to block the transcriptional activation elicited by c-Jun. The mechanism by which this repression is obtained does not require heterodimerization between CREM and the Fos and/or Jun proteins. In contrast, we show that both CREM and CRE-binding proteins (CREB) are able to bind TREs and therefore compete with c-Jun for this site. Removal of the phosphorylation domain in CREM does not affect the down-regulatory function. We also show that c-Fos does not affect the inhibitory function of CREM on c-Jun and that the transcriptional activation elicited by the other members of the jun family (JunB, JunD, and v-Jun) is also down-regulated by CREM."

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified 26 S enzyme reveals more than 20 polypeptides ranging in apparent molecular masses from 20 to 110 kDa. Although many of the subunits smaller than 30 kDa are members of the multicatalytic protease family, the identity and function of the larger polypeptides have remained unknown. We report here the cDNA sequence for subunit 4, a 51-kDa chain of the 26 S protease. Subunit 4 belongs to a recently identified eukaryotic ATPase family, which includes proteins involved in peroxisome formation, secretion, and human immunodeficiency virus gene expression. Subunit 4 also shows weak similarity to ClpA, the ATP-binding subunit of the Escherichia coli protease, Clp."
https://openalex.org/W1504754156,"The primary sequence of the microtubule-associated protein tau contains multiple repeats of the sequence -X-Ser/Thr-Pro-X-, the consensus sequence for the proline-directed protein kinase (p34cdc2/p58cyclin A). When phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinase in vitro, tau was found to incorporate up to 4.4 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Isoelectric focusing of the tryptic phosphopeptides demonstrated the presence of five distinct peptides with pI values of approximately 6.9, 6.5, 5.6-5.9, 4.7, and 3.6. Mapping of the tryptic phosphopeptides by high performance liquid chromatography techniques demonstrated three distinct peaks. Data from gas phase sequencing, amino acid analysis, and phosphoamino acid analysis suggest that proline-directed protein kinase phosphorylates tau at four sites. Each site demonstrates the presence of a proline residue on the carboxyl-terminal side of the phosphorylated residue. Two phosphorylation sites are located adjacent to the three-repeat microtubule-binding domain that has been found to be required for the in vivo co-localization of tau protein to microtubules. Two other putative phosphorylation sites are located within the identified epitope of the monoclonal antibody Tau-1. Phosphorylation of these sites altered the immunoreactivity of tau to Tau-1 antibody. Since the neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau is multiply phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease, and Tau-1 immunoreactivity is similarly reduced in neurofibrillary tangles and enhanced after dephosphorylation, phosphorylation at one or more of these sites may correlate with abnormally phosphorylated sites in tau protein in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1532295568,"Recombinant human myoglobin mutants with the distal His residue (E7, His64) replaced by Leu, Val, or Gln residues were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Escherichia coli. Electronic and coordination structures of the ferric heme iron in the recombinant myoglobin proteins were examined by optical absorption, EPR, 1H NMR, magnetic circular dichroism, and x-ray spectroscopy. Mutations, His-->Val and His-->Leu, remove the heme-bound water molecule resulting in a five-coordinate heme iron at neutral pH, while the heme-bound water molecule appears to be retained in the engineered myoglobin with His-->Gln substitution as in the wild-type protein. The distal Val and distal Leu ferric myoglobin mutants at neutral pH exhibited EPR spectra with g perpendicular values smaller than 6, which could be interpreted as an admixture of intermediate (S = 3/2) and high (S = 5/2) states. At alkaline pH, the distal Gln mutant is in the same so-called hydroxy low spin form as the wild-type protein, while the distal Leu and distal Val mutants are in high states. The ligand binding properties of these recombinant myoglobin proteins were studied by measurements of azide equilibrium and cyanide binding. The distal Leu and distal Val mutants exhibited diminished azide affinity and extremely slow cyanide binding, while the distal Gln mutant showed azide affinity and cyanide association rate constants similar to those of the wild-type protein."
https://openalex.org/W1599596785,"We previously reported that treatment of Hep G2 cells with oleate significantly increased apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion by reducing early intracellular degradation of nascent apoB. In the current study, inhibitors of secretory protein transport (brefeldin A and monensin), cell fractionation studies, and protease protection assays were utilized to determine the location of apoB degradation and to better define the mechanism whereby oleate treatment reduces nascent apoB intracellular degradation. When cells were treated with brefeldin A, which blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi protein transport, apoB degradation continued in control cells, suggesting that apoB is degraded in the ER. When oleate-treated cells were blocked with brefeldin A, oleate failed to protect apoB from intracellular degradation. The effects of brefeldin A were not due to effects on lipid synthesis as brefeldin A did not inhibit the synthesis of triglyceride, phospholipid, free cholesterol, or cholesteryl ester in control cells and did not prevent the increases in triglyceride (14-fold) and phospholipid (1.4-fold) synthesis seen in oleate-treated cells. Simultaneous treatment of cells with brefeldin A and nocodazole, which inhibits retrograde transport of proteins from Golgi to ER, added to the evidence for the ER as the site of apoB degradation. This conclusion received further support from experiments in which cells were treated with monensin, a Na+ ionophore which halts protein secretion at the level of the trans-Golgi network. Early degradation of nascent apoB (between 10 and 20 min of chase) was observed in monensin-treated cells, but then cellular apoB degradation ceased and apoB was stable during the remaining chase period. More apoB accumulated in the Golgi of cells that had been treated with oleate and monensin. These results suggest that ER degradation occurs in monensin-treated cells, but then stops as apoB is transferred to the Golgi. The results obtained in whole cells were confirmed in studies using isolated ER and Golgi, which indicated that ER contains a proteolytic activity which degrades apoB, in vitro, whereas Golgi does not. ApoB degradation in isolated ER was not reduced by pretreatment with oleate. Finally, protease protection assays carried out with isolated microsomes indicated that a majority of the apoB in both control or oleate-treated HepG2 cells was located on the cytosolic side of the membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1561958599,"It was shown previously that the Escherichia coli gene ppfA (dsbA) encodes a periplasmic protein, and its inactivation leads to a deficiency in disulfide bond formation of envelope proteins (Kamitani, S., Akiyama, Y., and Ito, K. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 57-62; Bardwell, J. C. A., McGovern, K., and Beckwith, J. (1991) Cell 67, 581-589). The DsbA/PpfA protein was overproduced, purified, and examined for its activities in vitro. Its abundance in a wild-type cell was estimated to be about 850 molecules which probably exist as homodimers as suggested by size exclusion chromatography. Purified DsbA markedly stimulated disulfide bond formation of E. coli alkaline phosphatase, either in vitro synthesized or purified and denatured, as well as of reduced bovine ribonuclease A. The DsbA-catalyzed rapid disulfide bond formation occurred after a lag period which appeared to be determined by the redox state of the reaction mixture and concentration of DsbA. Inclusion of higher concentrations of oxidized glutathione or DsbA shortened the lag period. We propose that DsbA, which proved to directly catalyze disulfide bond formation, may also have a role in maintaining the bacterial periplasm oxidative."
https://openalex.org/W1526838717,"Adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin from Bordetella pertussis penetrates eukaryotic cells and upon activation by calmodulin generates unregulated levels of intracellular cAMP. The process of toxin penetration into sheep erythrocytes was resolved into three consecutive steps including insertion, translocation, and intracellular cleavage. Insertion of the toxin into the cell membrane occurred over a wide temperature range (4-36 degrees C). In contrast, translocation of the toxin, i.e. transfer of the NH2-terminal catalytically active fragment across the membrane, occurred only above 20 degrees C and was highly temperature-dependent. While a single exposure of the toxin to Ca2+ was sufficient for its insertion into the plasma membrane, toxin translocation required exogenous Ca2+ at mM concentrations. Translocation was not affected by pretreatment of cells with trypsin, N-ethylmaleimide, and sodium carbonate at alkaline pH. The NH2-terminal fragment of the toxin was cleaved in the cell releasing the 45-kDa active AC into the cytosol. The cleavage was blocked by treatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide. It is hypothesized that the COOH-terminal portion of the toxin creates in the membrane a channel through which the NH2-terminal fragment is translocated."
https://openalex.org/W1522896890,"A kinetic study of the regeneration reaction of vitamin E (tocopherol) with eight biological hydroquinones (HQs) (ubiquinol-10 (Q10H2 1); ubiquinol-0 (Q0H2 2); vitamin K1 HQ (VK1H2 3); vitamin K3 HQ (VK3H2 4); alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tocopherol-HQs (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-TQH2 5-7); and 2,3,5-trimethyl-1,4-HQ (TMQH2 8)) in solution was performed. The second-order rate constants (k4) for the reaction of HQs 1-8 with alpha-tocopheroxyl and 5,7-diisopropyltocopheroxyl radicals in ethanol, benzene, and isopropyl alcohol/water (5:1, v/v) solutions were measured with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The order of magnitude of k4 values obtained for HQs is VK1H2 > VK3H2 > alpha-TQH2 > beta-TQH2 approximately gamma-TQH2 approximately TMQH2 > Q10H2 > Q0H2, being independent of the kinds of tocopheroxyl radicals and the polarity of the solvents. The log of the k4 values obtained for HQs was found to correlate with their peak oxidation potentials. Comparing the k2 value (2.68 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 obtained for the reaction of alpha-tocopheroxyl with vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) with those (k4 = 2.54 x 10(5) and 8.15 x 10(5) M-1 s-1) obtained for the reaction of alpha-tocopheroxyl with Q10H2 and alpha-TQH2 in isopropyl alcohol/water mixtures, the former is approximately 11 and 3 times as reactive as the latter, respectively. On the other hand, the k2 value obtained for sodium ascorbate is smaller than the k4 values obtained for VK1H2 and VK3H2. These results suggest that mixtures of vitamin E and these HQs (as well as those of vitamins E and C) may function synergistically as antioxidants in various tissues and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1595036009,"Enzyme systems within living cells have recently been shown to be highly ordered structures that violate classic assumptions of the Michaelis-Menten formalism, which originally was developed for the characterization of isolated reactions in vitro. This evidence suggests that a thorough examination of alternative kinetic formalisms for integrated biochemical systems is in order. The purpose of this series of papers is to assess the utility of an alternative power-law formalism by carrying out a detailed comparative analysis of a relatively large, representative system--the tricarboxylic acid cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum. This system was chosen because considerable experimental information already has been synthesized into a detailed kinetic model of the intact system. In this first paper, we set the stage for subsequent analysis within the framework of the power-law formalism: we review the underlying theory, emphasizing recent developments, formulate the model in terms that are convenient for the analysis to follow, and develop the system representation in both the Michaelis-Menten and power-law forms. In the second paper (Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22919-22925), these alternative representations are shown to be internally consistent and locally equivalent. The third paper (Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22926-22933) provides a complete analysis of the steady state behavior and also treats the dynamic behavior of the model."
https://openalex.org/W1650787723,"We determined the trans effects of extracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) on the rate of efflux of endogenous labeled GSH from freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The presence of GSH (10 mM) in the medium significantly stimulated the fractional rate of efflux of [35S]GSH from 5.2 to 12.6%/15 min (p < 0.01). This effect was concentration-dependent, had sigmoid type of kinetics (D50 of 0.32 mM), and was reversible upon removal of external GSH. trans-Stimulation (counter-transport) was also observed with 5 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and ophthalmic acid (fractional [35S] GSH efflux: 13.4% +/- 4.1 and 8.8% +/- 2.3 in 15 min, respectively, compared with control: 4.7 +/- 2.5/15 min). Bromosulphthalein-glutathione (BSP-GSH, 5 mM) in Krebs buffer inhibited the fractional [35S]GSH efflux (1.1%/15 min), whereas in Cl(-)-free buffer, GSH efflux was stimulated (14.2%/15 min) compared with control. trans-Stimulation was independent of chloride. BSP-GSH cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated the initial rate of GSH transport in basolateral-enriched membrane vesicles (bLPM) but not in canalicular-enriched membrane vesicles (cLPM). gamma-Glutamyl compounds also cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated GSH transport in bLPM vesicles. GSH-depleted hepatocytes incubated with 10 mM [35S]GSH accumulated more GSH than repleted cells, but the initial rate of uptake of radioactivity was faster in repleted cells. In contrast, repleted hepatocytes incubated with tracer or 50 microM [35S]GSH did not take up GSH. Thus, the sinusoidal membrane GSH transporter exhibits low affinity kinetics with sigmoid features for both GSH uptake and trans-stimulation of efflux, explaining the lack of uptake of GSH at low physiologic extracellular concentrations. Therefore, our findings support and explain the widely held view that GSH transport is unidirectional under physiologic conditions. However, the efflux of GSH may also occur in exchange for the uptake of organic anions and gamma-glutamyl compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1529551630,"Pyrococcus furiosus is a marine hyperthermophile that grows optimally at 100 degrees C. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) from P. furiosus is a hexamer of identical subunits and has an M(r) = 270,000 +/- 5500 at 25 degrees C. Electron micrographs showed that the subunit arrangement is similar to that of GDH from bovine liver (i.e. 3/2 symmetry in the form of a triangular antiprism). However, GDH from P. furiosus is inactive at temperatures below 40 degrees C and undergoes heat activation above 40 degrees C. Both NAD+ and NADP+ are utilized as cofactors. Apparently the inactive enzyme also binds cofactors, since the enzyme maintains the ability to bind to an affinity column (Cibacron blue F3GA) and is specifically eluted with NADP+. Conformational changes that accompany activation and thermal denaturation were detected by precision differential scanning microcalorimetry. Thermal denaturation starts at 110 degrees C and is completed at 118 degrees C. delta(cal) = 414 Kcal [mol GDH]-1. Tm = 113 degrees C. This increase in heat capacity indicates an extensive irreversible unfolding of the secondary structure as evidenced also by a sharp increase in absorbance at 280 nm and inactivation of the enzyme. The process of heat activation of GDH from 40 to 80 degrees C is accompanied by a much smaller increase in absorbance at 280 nm and a reversible increase in heat capacity with delta(cal) = 187 Kcal [mol GDH]-1 and Tm = 57 degrees C. This absorbance change as well as the moderate increase in heat capacity suggest that thermal activation leads to some exposure of hydrophobic groups to solvent water as the GDH structure is opened slightly. The increase in absorbance at 280 nm during activation is only 12% of that for denaturation. Overall, GDH appears to be well adapted to correspond with the growth response of P. furiosus to temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1556117342,"Two Ca(2+)-dependent endopeptidase activities are involved in proinsulin to insulin conversion: type I cleaves COOH-terminal to proinsulin Arg31-Arg32 (B-chain/C-peptide junction); and type II preferentially cleaves at the Lys64-Arg65 site (C-peptide/A-chain junction). To further understand the mechanism of proinsulin processing, we have investigated types I and II endopeptidase processing of intact proinsulin in parallel to that of the conversion intermediates, des-31,32-proinsulin and des-64,65-proinsulin. The type I processed des-64,65-proinsulin and proinsulin at the same rate. In contrast, the type II endopeptidase processed des-31,32-proinsulin at a much faster rate (> 19-fold; p < 0.001) than it did intact proinsulin. Furthermore, unlabeled proinsulin concentrations required for competitive inhibition of 125I-labeled des-64,65-proinsulin and 125I-proinsulin processing by a purified insulin secretory granule lysate were similar (ID50 = 14-16 microM), whereas inhibition of 125I-labeled des-31,32-proinsulin processing required a higher nonradiolabeled proinsulin concentration (ID50 = 197 microM). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding Lys64-Arg65 (AC-peptide/substrate) and Arg31-Arg32 (BC-peptide/substrate) of human proinsulin were synthesized for use as specific substrates or competitive inhibitors. Cleavage of the BC-substrate by type I and AC-substrate by type II was COOH-terminal of the dibasic sequence, with similar Ca(2+)-and pH requirements previously observed for proinsulin cleavage. Apparent Km and Vmax for type I processing of the BC-substrate was Km = 20 microM; Vmax = 22.8 pmol/min, and for type II processing of the AC-substrate was Km = 68 microM; Vmax = 97 pmol/min. In competitive inhibition assays, the BC-peptide similarly blocked insulin secretory granule lysate processing of des-64,65-proinsulin and proinsulin (ID50 = 45-55 microM), but did not inhibit des-31,32-proinsulin processing. However, the AC-peptide preferentially inhibited insulin secretory granule lysate processing of des-31,32-proinsulin (ID50 = microM) compared to proinsulin (ID50 = 330 microM), and not des-64,65-proinsulin. We conclude that the type I endopeptidase recognized des-64,65-proinsulin and proinsulin as similar substrates, whereas the type II endopeptidase has a stronger preference for des-31,32-proinsulin compared to intact proinsulin. Furthermore, we suggest that in intact proinsulin there exists a constraint to efficient processing that is relieved following type I processing. Structural flexibility, in addition to the presence of Lys64-Arg65, therefore appears to be important for type II endopeptidase specificity and may provide a molecular basis for a preferential route of proinsulin conversion via des-31,32-proinsulin."
https://openalex.org/W1589015308,"The Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) protein was characterized and shown to form a stable complex with Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung). As determined by mass spectrometry, the Ugi protein had a molecular weight of 9,474. We confirmed this value by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and determined that Ugi exists as a monomeric protein in solution. Amino acid analysis performed on both Ugi and Ung proteins was in excellent agreement with the amino acid composition predicted from the respective nucleotide sequence of each gene. The Ung.Ugi complex was resolved from its constitutive components by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and shown to possess a 1:1 stoichiometry. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies revealed that the Ung.Ugi complex had a molecular weight of 35,400, consistent with the complex containing one molecule each of Ung and Ugi. The acidic isoelectric points of the protein species were 6.6 (Ung) and 4.2 (Ugi), whereas the Ung.Ugi complex had an isoelectric point of 4.9. Dissociation of the Ung.Ugi complex by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed no apparent alteration in the molecular weight of either polypeptide subsequent to binding. Furthermore, when the Ung.Ugi complex was treated with urea and resolved by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both uracil-DNA glycosylase and inhibitor activities were recovered from the dissociated complex. Thus, the complex seems to be reversible. In addition, we demonstrated that the Ugi interaction with Ung prevents enzyme binding to DNA and dissociates uracil-DNA glycosylase from a preformed DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1558867219,"The human m1 (hm1) and m2 (hm2) muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus were tested for their ability to undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization. The muscarinic agonist carbachol induced phosphorylation of the hm2 mAChR in the Sf9 cells incubated with 32P(i) to an extent of 4-5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor. In contrast, no phosphorylation of the hm1 mAChR was observed. The hm2 mAChR stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding to, and GTPase activity of, the insect cell G-proteins. These receptor-mediated activities were reduced by 50% in membranes prepared from agonist-treated cells compared to control, suggesting that the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the hm2 mAChR resulted in desensitization of the receptors. No role for protein kinase C or cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases in receptor phosphorylation and desensitization was suggested from studies using agents known to modulate the activity of these enzymes. However, pertussis toxin was found to completely eliminate the interaction of the hm2 receptors with the insect cell G-proteins, but did not perturb the ability of carbachol to induce agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptors. These results suggested that G-proteins and/or G-protein-activated signalling were not necessary for the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the receptors. Overall, the data indicated that the human m2 (but not the human m1) mAChR expressed in Sf9 insect cells undergo phosphorylation and desensitization in an agonist-dependent, G-protein-independent fashion by an endogenous insect cell kinase. The results demonstrated that a human G-protein-linked receptor is regulated in insect cells in a manner that is similar to that involving members of the G-protein receptor-kinase family."
https://openalex.org/W1585096463,"When kinetic models of complex biochemical systems are reconstructed from knowledge of the component reactions that have been characterized in vitro, or when values must be assumed for some of the parameters, errors are invariably encountered, and, as a consequence, the resulting model is frequently internally inconsistent. The simplest and most basic manifestations of such logical inconsistency are the failure of the model to exhibit a steady state or to yield a steady state that is in agreement with the actual steady state of the integrated system, or to yield a steady state that is dynamically stable. Models that are consistent may nonetheless be lacking in robustness, which is manifested as a pathological sensitivity to small changes in the values of their parameters. In this paper, we examine the current model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in Dictyostelium discoideum (see Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22912-22918) with regard to these basic indicators of model quality. This may be viewed as a preliminary analysis; the object is to determine whether or not the model is reasonable and worthy of a more refined analysis and, if not, to diagnose the areas in need of modification before further analysis is undertaken. The results demonstrate that the current model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle is self-consistent and possesses a steady state that is in agreement with experimental evidence. However, the results also suggest that this model is not very robust. The high sensitivities of parameters influencing pyruvate metabolism indicate that the experimental characterization of these reactions might be fruitfully re-examined. These high sensitivities lead us to predict that this model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle should be accurate only over a very narrow range in variation of the independent variables. This is verified by the results presented in the following paper (Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22926-22933)."
https://openalex.org/W1520533727,"Proinsulin conversion in the insulin secretory granule is mediated by two sequence-specific endoproteases related to the Kex2 homologues, PC2 and PC3 (Bennett, D. L., Bailyes, E. M., Nielsen, E., Guest, P. C., Rutherford, N. G., Arden, S. D., and Hutton, J. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15229-15236; Bailyes, E. M., Bennett, D. L., and Hutton, J. C. (1992) Enzyme, in press). Radiolabeling studies using isolated rat islets showed that PC2 was synthesized initially as a 76-kDa glycoprotein which was converted by limited proteolysis to the mature 64-66-kDa form. Conversion was initiated approximately 1 h after synthesis and proceeded via intermediates of 71, 68, and 66 kDa with a t1/2 of 140 min. Release of only the 66- and 64-66-kDa radiolabeled forms of PC2 was induced by glucose and then only at times more than 2 h following synthesis. Proinsulin conversion, by contrast, was more rapid (delay = 30 min, t1/2 = 60 min), and release commenced as soon as 1 h after synthesis with the secreted material being comprised of the precursor, intermediate, and mature forms of insulin. Ultrastructural analysis of islet beta cells showed that PC2 was concentrated in secretory granules. Subcellular fractionation combined with immunoblot analysis showed that insulinoma secretory granules contained only the mature 64-66-kDa form of PC2, whereas fractions enriched in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum contained a mixture of the 76- and 66-kDa forms of the enzyme. These results indicate that post-translational proteolysis of PC2 is initiated before sorting into the regulated pathway of secretion and that the relative proportions of proinsulin and PC2 packaged into secretory granules will change with physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1557022910,"The Lewis alpha (1-->3/4)-fucosyltransferase (Le-FucT) is known to fucosylate both Type I (beta Gal(1-->3) beta GlcNAc) and Type II (beta Gal(1-->4) beta GlcNAc) sequences even when these are sialylated at OH-3 or fucosylated at OH-2 of the terminal Gal residues. These acceptor sequences are ubiquitous on mammalian cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. The Le-FucT enzyme is therefore a potential candidate as a universal reagent for the modification of cell surfaces. We have found that a readily accessible, partially purified Le-FucT from human milk, which normally uses GDP-fucose (a 6-deoxy sugar) as the donor for the transfer of a single fucose residue, will also transfer a fucose residue substituted on C-6 by a very large sterically demanding structure, in this instance, a synthetic blood group antigen. As a demonstration of the ability of the Le-FucT to modify glycoconjugates in a mild and specific manner, we chemically synthesized the complex sugar-nucleotide alpha Gal(1-->3) [alpha Fuc(1-->2)]-beta Gal-O-(CH2)8COHN(6)-beta-L-fucose-GDP (13) which is a GDP-fucose analog where the human blood group trisaccharide antigen is covalently linked to C-6 of fucose through an amino group. It is shown that, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the Le-FucT uses both immobilized beta Gal(1-->3) beta GlcNAc-bovine serum albumin conjugates and fetuin as acceptor substrates and renders them blood group B-active as detected by a monoclonal anti-B blood-grouping antibody. The fucose residue to which the B-trisaccharide is linked therefore becomes covalently attached to the acceptor oligosaccharide chains of those glycoproteins. Incubation of type O erythrocytes with the Le-FucT and complex donor 13 results in the covalent transfer of alpha Gal(1-->3) [alpha Fuc(1-->2)] beta Gal-O-(CH2)8COHN(6)-beta-L-Fuc to cell-surface acceptors since the cells become phenotypically B and are agglutinated by the same antibody. It is proposed that the Le-FucT represents a powerful new tool with the ability to label animal cell surfaces with preassembled oligosaccharide and possibly also other complex recognition markers."
https://openalex.org/W1583305131,"Abstract The mechanism of inhibition of the sarcoplamc reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase by the fluoroaluminate complexes was investigated. First, AlF4- was shown to bind to the Ca(2+)-free conformation of the enzyme by a slow quasi-irreversible process. The rate constants of the reaction are k+ = 16 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 and k- < 1.5 10(-3) s-1. We directly measured a stoichiometry of about 4.8 nmol of AlF4- bound/mg of protein. Mg2+ was a necessary cofactor for the reaction with a dissociation constant of 3 mM. It was demonstrated (Dupont, Y., and Pougeois, R. (1983) FEBS Lett. 156, 93-98) that phosphorylation by P(i) induced a dehydration of the catalytic site. The same process has been shown here to occur upon AlF4- binding either by the use of Me2SO or by demonstration of an increase of bound 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienyldene)adenosine triphosphate fluorescence. Phosphorylation by P(i) is inhibited by the binding of AlF4-. Second, a fluoroaluminate complex, presumably AlF4-, was also shown to bind to the Ca(2+)-bound conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase in the presence of ADP and stabilize a E1.Ca2.ADP.AlFx complex. The dissociation constant of the nucleotidic site for ADP was shifted to the micromolar range. The Ca2+ ions bound on the external high affinity sites became occluded upon binding of (ADP + AlFx). We propose that AlF4- mimics P(i) binding to the Ca(2+)-free conformation of the ATPase and stabilizes an intermediate similar to the acyl-phosphate derivative; it also acts as an analogue of the gamma-phosphate of ATP and stabilizes an E1.[Ca2].ADP.AlF4 complex where the Ca2+ ions are occluded."
https://openalex.org/W1559338898,"We have investigated the frequency of replication origin usage in bacterial plasmids containing more than one potential origin. Escherichia coli recA- cells were selectively transformed with pBR322 monomers, dimers, or trimers. Plasmid DNA was isolated and digested with a restriction enzyme that cut the monomer only once, and the replicative intermediates (RIs) were analyzed by neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. Evidence for initiation outside the linearized plasmid was found only for oligomers. Moreover, in dimers, the intensity of the signal indicative for external initiation was equivalent to that reflecting internal initiation, whereas it was approximately twice as strong in trimers. To determine whether initiation could occur simultaneously at two origins in a single plasmid, we studied the replication of a neodimer in which both units could be unambiguously distinguished. The results showed that although both origins were equally competent to initiate replication, only one was active per plasmid. These observations strongly suggest that in ColE1 plasmids, replication initiates at a single site even when there are several identical potential origins per plasmid. In addition to the conventional two-dimensional gel patterns, novel specific patterns were observed with intensities that varied from one DNA sample to another. These unique patterns were the result of breakage of the RIs at a replication fork. This type of breakage changes both the mass and shape of RIs. When the entire population of RIs is affected, a new population of molecules is formed that may generate a novel pattern in two-dimensional gels."
https://openalex.org/W1576663068,"The kinetics of Ca2+ release and contraction induced by photolytic release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) were determined in permeabilized smooth muscle. The rate of Ca2+ release was half-maximal at 1 microM InsP3. The concentration-dependent delay of Ca2+ release at saturating InsP3 concentration was approximately 10 ms and within the uncertainty of the measurements. The relationship between the delay and InsP3 concentration showed no evidence of a high level (n = 4 or higher) of cooperativity but could not distinguish between no cooperativity (n = 1) or a low level (n = 2) of cooperativity. Submaximal [InsP3] caused only partial Ca2+ release from the InsP3-sensitive stores. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was markedly potentiated by ATP or by adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene-triphosphate), but neither the rate nor the amplitude of release was significantly affected by procaine (2-5 mM). Heparin increased the delay between photolysis and Ca2+ release, indicating that the off rate of inert ligand(s) bound to InsP3 receptors may contribute to the physiological delay in Ca2+ release. There was a much longer (370 ms +/- 45 S.E.) delay between the rise of Ca2+ and force development, presumably reflecting events preceding and associated with myosin light chain phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1604120362,"The cell surface receptor tissue factor (TF) initiates coagulation by supporting the proteolytic activation of factors X and IX as well as VII to active serine proteases. Architectural similarity of TF to the cytokine receptor family suggests a strand-loop-strand structure for TF residues 151-174. Site-directed Ala exchanges in the predicted surface loop demonstrated that residues Tyr157, Lys159, Ser163, Gly164, Lys165, and Lys166 are important for function. Addition of side chain atoms at the Ser162 position decreased function, whereas the Ala exchange was tolerated. The dysfunctional mutants bound VII with high affinity and fully supported the catalysis of small peptidyl substrates by the mutant TF.VIIa complex. Lys159-->Ala substitution was compatible with efficient activation of factor X, whereas the Try157-->Ala exchange and mutations in the carboxyl aspect of the predicted loop resulted in diminished activation of factor X. The specific plasma procoagulant activity of all functionally deficient mutants increased 7- to 200-fold upon the supplementation of VIIa suggesting that TF residues 157-167 also provide important interactions that accelerate the activation of VII to VIIa. These data are consistent with assignment of the TF 157-167 region as contributing to protein substrate recognition and cleavage by the TF.VIIa complex."
https://openalex.org/W1567986819,"A major in vivo substrate of Ca(2+)-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS)) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the particulate as well as from the cytoplasmic fractions of calf brain using a calmodulin affinity column. The two preparations were characterized and compared with various biochemical and biophysical techniques. Although they behave similarly in various chromatographic procedures during purification, their elution positions from the gel filtration column are markedly different. Stokes radii of 85 and 45 A were measured for the cytoplasmic and membrane MARCKS, respectively. Once purified, however, they show a similar small Stokes radius (45 A), suggesting the dissociation of a component or a drastic conformational change in the cytoplasmic preparation during purification. The electrospray mass spectroscopic analysis of the two preparations revealed the existence of at least three major subpopulations with molecular mass differences of 80 daltons, which suggests the presence of protein phosphorylated in different degrees. The cytoplasmic preparation contains more phosphorylated species compared with the membrane preparation, whereas the calculated molecular weight of each peak was indistinguishable between the two preparations. Correspondingly, when the two preparations were phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C in vitro, more phosphate groups were transferred to the membrane preparation (4 mol/mol) than to the cytoplasmic preparation (2.9 mol/mol). A significant difference was also observed in the inhibition of calmodulin of the phosphorylation reaction. On the other hand, the circular dichroism of the two preparations showed similar spectra rich in random coil with little contribution of alpha-helix (approximately 10%), suggesting that there is not a significant difference in the overall conformation. These results clearly established that the two preparations are the same protein coded by a single gene but they differ in their degree of phosphorylation, and that the difference observed in their Stokes radius is due to the presence of an unidentified factor that is removed from the cytoplasmic MARCKS during purification."
https://openalex.org/W1596715422,"The intracellular C-terminal domain is diverse in size and amino acid sequence among facilitative glucose transporter isoforms. The characteristics of glucose transport are also divergent, and GLUT2 has far higher Km and Vmax values compared with GLUT1. To investigate the role of the intracellular C-terminal domain in glucose transport, we expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells the mutated GLUT1 protein whose intracellular C-terminal domain was replaced with that of GLUT2 by means of engineering the chimeric cDNA. Cytochalasin B, for which GLUT2 protein has much lower affinity, bound to this chimeric protein in a fashion similar to GLUT1. In contrast, greater transport activity was observed in this chimeric glucose transporter compared with the wild-type GLUT1 at 10 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose concentration. The kinetic studies on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake revealed a 3.8-fold increase in Km and a 4.3-fold increase in Vmax in this chimeric glucose transporter compared with the wild-type GLUT1. Thus, replacement of the intracellular C-terminal domain confers the GLUT2-like property on the glucose transporter. These results strongly suggest that the diversity of intracellular C-terminal domain contributes to the diversity of glucose transport characteristics among isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1551863855,"The amino terminus of nerve growth factor (NGF) is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. A comparison of the bioactivity of highly purified full-length recombinant human (1-118)rhNGF and NH2-terminal truncated (10-118)rhNGF revealed lower potency of (10-118)rhNGF with regard to early NGF responses in neuron-like PC12 cells. Approximately 50 times higher concentrations of (10-118)rhNGF than (1-118)rhNGF were required to elicit the same extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of key enzymes in different second messenger pathways, i.e. the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase p140trkA, phospholipase C gamma-1, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1. A similar reduced potency for induction of the transcription factor c-Fos was observed with (10-118)rhNGF compared to (1-118)rhNGF. The lower potency of (10-118)rhNGF in triggering early responses correlated with its 40-fold lower affinity for PC12 cells. Whereas (10-118)rhNGF had a more than 300-fold lower affinity for the high affinity receptor p140trkA than (1-118)rhNGF, amino-terminal truncation of NGF changed its affinity for the low affinity receptor p75NGFR only slightly (5-10-fold). These observations suggest that amino acids 1-9 of NGF are important for binding to the signal transducing receptor p140trkA. Proteolytic cleavage of the NGF amino terminus, therefore, reduces its potency in starting several second messenger pathways leading to neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594509828,"Abstract Incubation of human plasma prorenin (PR), the enzymatically inactive precursor of renin (EC 3.4.23.15), with a number of nonpeptide high-affinity active site-directed renin inhibitors induces a conformational change in PR, which was detected by a monoclonal antibody that reacts with active renin but not with native inactive PR. This conformational change also occurred when inactive PR was activated during exposure to low pH. Nonproteolytically acid-activated PR, and inhibitor-activated PR, as well as native PR, were retained on a blue Sepharose column, in contrast to proteolytically activated PR. Kinetic analysis of the activation of plasma prorenin by renin inhibitor (INH) indicated that native plasma contains an open intermediary form of prorenin, PRoi, in which the active site is exposed and which is in rapid equilibrium with the inactive closed form, PRc. PRoi reacts with inhibitor to form a reversible complex, PRoi.INH, which undergoes a conformational change resulting in a tight complex of a modified open form of prorenin, PRo, and the inhibitor, PRoi.INH-->PRo.INH. The PRoi-to-PRo conversion leads to the expression of an epitope on the renin part of the molecule that is recognized by a renin-specific monoclonal antibody. Presumably, PRo corresponds to the enzymatically active form of PR that is formed during exposure to low pH. Thus, it seems that the propeptide of PR interacts with the renin part of the molecule not only at or near the enzyme's active site but also at some distance from the active site. Interference with the first interaction by renin inhibitor leads to destabilization of the propeptide, by which the second interaction is disrupted and the enzyme assumes its active conformation. The results of this study may provide a model for substrate-mediated prorenin activation and increase the likelihood that enzymatically active prorenin is formed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1559602969,"Malondialdehyde induces frameshift mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strain hisD3052. The ability of propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG), a structural analog of the major malondialdehyde-deoxyguanosine adduct, to induce site-specific frameshift mutations was tested in the (CpG)4 hot-spot of hisD3052 carried on an M13 vector (M13MB102). PdG was introduced at position 6248 of duplex M13MB102 by ligation of the oligonucleotide 5'-CGC(PdG)CGGCATG-3' into a heteroduplex containing an 11-nucleotide gap in the (-)-strand between the SphI and BssHII restriction sites and deoxyuridine in place of thymidine in the (+)-strand. Ligation proceeded with 70% efficiency, and closed circular duplex DNA molecules were isolated in 40% yield. The adducted genome was sensitive to cleavage by SphI but resistant to cleavage by BssHII. Transformation of Escherichia coli strain JM105 with adducted M13MB102 led to 25% reduced survival relative to unadducted M13MB102 and produced frameshift mutations in 2.5% of the progeny phage. All of the mutations were deletions, and 70% occurred by deletion of CpG. Unadducted genomes exhibited a 40-fold lower mutation frequency, and all the mutations were single-base deletions at the sites of ligation of the 11-mer. These results illustrate that PdG, a structural analog of the major malondialdehyde-deoxyguanosine adduct, induces frameshift mutations in M13MB102 and that single-stranded nicks are efficient premutagenic lesions in this recombinant bacteriophage."
https://openalex.org/W1496092928,"The examination of model robustness in the previous paper (Shiraishi, F., and Savageau, M. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22919-22925 led to the suggestion that the current model for the tricarboxylic acid cycle in Dictyostelium discoideum is ill-determined with respect to one or more of the features reflecting pyruvate metabolism. This conclusion is further supported here by results of steady state and dynamic analyses. The tricarboxylic acid cycle, according to the current model, is poised on a knife's edge with its behavior rigidly determined; any alteration of the system's components leads to nonviable behavior, as exemplified by explosive accumulation of pyruvate and loss of steady state in response to a minute change in the level of malate dehydrogenase. With the additional results in this paper, we are able to refine the diagnosis of the problem and suggest three different areas of the current model that might profitably be re-examined by experiment. These include the kinetics of the reactions at the malate branch point, the turnover times for the alanine, glutamate, and aspartate pools in vivo, and the dynamic mass balances for the cofactor NAD. We also suggest a minimal modification in the current model that could alleviate or circumvent some of these problems."
https://openalex.org/W1547107037,"The primary structure of the Lewis lung carcinoma protein HMGY belonging to the nuclear group of proteins HMGI (high mobility group I) was determined using electrospray and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. It was demonstrated that the sequence of the tumor protein corresponds to the amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA from cultured cells and that the N-terminal serine residue is N-acetylated. Moreover, the two high performance liquid chromatography-purified forms Y1 and Y2 of the protein HMGY were shown to differ at the level of serine phosphorylation, since they contain three phosphate and two phosphate groups, respectively, in the C-terminal region. No other modification was detected in the remaining part of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1571485829,"Abstract Biosynthesis of glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane glycoproteins proceeds through the attachment of a preformed glycolipid onto a C-terminal amino acid rapidly after translation. Here we describe the structural analysis of two very polar glycolipids which can be observed after metabolic labeling of lymphoma cell lines S1A and EL-4 with either tritiated myo-inositol, mannose, or ethanolamine. These lipids are not made by mutant cells deficient in the biosynthesis of glycophosphatidylinositol anchors. The lipids were isolated, and their carbohydrate moiety was characterized using hydrofluoric acid dephosphorylation, nitrous acid deamination, acetolysis, exoglycosidase treatments, and combinations thereof to produce labeled fragments which could be analyzed by paper chromatography. Results are compatible with the structure (X-->)Man alpha 1,2 Man alpha 1,6(Y-->)Man alpha-GlcN-acylinositol, X and Y being hydrofluoric acid-sensitive substituents (most likely phosphoethanolamine). The anchor oligosaccharide of the glycophosphatidylinositol protein anchors of S1A cells was isolated, similarly characterized, and found to contain the identical carbohydrate structure. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the very polar glycolipids have half-lives which are much longer than the one of phosphatidylinositol. The results suggest that these very polar glycolipids represent supernumerary precursor glycolipids which did not get transferred onto proteins or represent processed forms of such precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1604340704,"The XylS protein is the positive regulator of the promoter controlling the meta-cleavage pathway (Pm) for catabolism of certain alkylbenzoates on the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas. Transcription from Pm is mediated by XylS either in the presence of benzoate effectors or through XylS hyperproduction. Two regions of the NH2 terminus of XylS (residues 37-45) had been predicted to be involved in effector control of XylS transcriptional activation. Different methods were used to induce mutations in this region, including genetic selections (where Pm controlled a tetracycline resistance gene), bisulfite mutagenesis at a unique restriction site, and extensive oligonucleotide mutagenesis at residues 41 and 45. The mutants fell into four classes based on their phenotypes with respect to effector-mediated activation of a Pm-lacZ fusion: (a) effector profiles similar to wild type, (b) no Pm stimulation with benzoates, (c) altered effector specificity, and (d) higher basal Pm activities, in some cases including changes in effector specificity. In some mutants, higher basal Pm activity was apparently due to mutations that increased XylS stability. Substitutions at Arg-41 resulted in all four mutant phenotypes, indicating that this is a critical residue in XylS for effector stimulation of transcription activity."
https://openalex.org/W1568189659,"Approximately 98% of turkey erythrocyte phospholipase C (PLC) is cytosolic and is released by hypotonic lysis of the cells and extensive washing of the resultant erythrocyte ghosts. Well washed turkey erythrocyte ghosts retain a fraction of tightly associated PLC, which is activated by the P2y-purinergic receptor and G-protein present in ghost membranes. The particulate PLC is sufficient to couple to all the available purinergic receptor-regulated G-protein. In contrast to ghosts, turkey erythrocyte plasma membrane preparations contain no detectable PLC. To investigate the subcellular location of the ghost-associated PLC, cytoskeletons were prepared by Triton X-100 extraction of turkey erythrocyte ghosts. The ghost-associated PLC was quantitatively recovered in cytoskeleton preparations. Cytoskeleton-associated PLC was solubilized by sodium cholate extraction, partially purified, and shown to reconstitute with PLC-free plasma membrane preparations in an agonist and guanine nucleotide-dependent fashion, indicating that the cytoskeleton-associated PLC is G-protein-regulated. Dissociation of erythrocyte ghost cytoskeletons with the actin-binding protein DNase 1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of agonist and guanine nucleotide-stimulated PLC responses in ghosts and caused release of PLC from ghost or cytoskeleton preparations. These data demonstrate the specific association of a receptor and G-protein-regulated PLC with a component of the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton and indicate that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is important for localization and effective coupling of PLC to the relevant G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1524711469,"The goal of this study was to understand why the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by the liver is poorly down-regulated by cholesterol. We examined the hypothesis that 7 alpha-hydroxylase may indirectly induce the expression of the LDL receptor by metabolizing, i.e. inactivating oxysterol repressors. Non-hepatic Chinese hamster ovary cells, transfected with a plasmid encoding 7 alpha-hydroxylase, expressed both the mRNA and functional activity of this liver-specific enzyme. In the presence of 5% serum, expression of the LDL receptor by transfected cells was > 20 times that of non-transfected cells despite a 50% increased content of cholesterol ester. Both cell types displayed an almost complete repression of the LDL receptor by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol, suggesting that transcriptional control of the LDL receptor gene remained intact in the transfected cells. However, only cells expressing 7 alpha-hydroxylase showed a derepression of the LDL receptor with time. This transient sensitivity to 25-hydroxycholesterol repression was attributed to a 3-fold greater rate of metabolism of [3H]25-hydroxycholesterol. The paradoxical induction of LDL receptor mRNA in transfected cells having greater amounts of cholesterol esters suggests that 7 alpha-hydroxylase may preferentially use oxysterols rather than cholesterol as substrates. The combined data are consistent with the proposal that 7 alpha-hydroxylase indirectly induces the LDL receptor gene by metabolizing (inactivating) oxysterol repressors. Liver-specific expression of 7 alpha-hydroxylase can account for the relative resistance of hepatic LDL receptors to down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1567529717,"The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), primarily synthesized in the liver of several species, is expressed at very low levels in a number of transformed human liver cell lines. The human CETP gene promoter contains a sequence that closely resembles the binding site for the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). This site is capable of binding C/EBP, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprint analyses. Transient expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of the human CETP gene promotor gave low activities in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. However, in the presence of C/EBP, CAT activity was markedly elevated indicating that CETP gene promoter activity was enhanced. In primary cultures of isolated hepatocytes, CETP mRNA was lost rapidly and in parallel with the C/EBP mRNA. C/EBP may play an important role in the proper maintenance of CETP gene promoter activity, and its low levels in proliferating or cultured cells may account for the low level of the CETP gene expression in immortalized human liver cell lines or cultured hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1599418772,"Membrane transport pathways for transplacental transfer of the water-soluble vitamin pantothenate were investigated by assessing the possible presence of a Na(+)-pantothenate cotransport mechanism in the maternal facing membrane of human placental epithelial cells. The presence of Na(+)-pantothenate cotransport was determined from radiolabeled tracer flux measurements of pantothenate uptake using preparations of purified brush-border membrane vesicles. Compared with other cations the imposition of an inward Na+ gradient stimulated vesicle uptake of pantothenate to levels approximately 40-fold greater than those observed at equilibrium. The observed stimulation of pantothenate uptake was not the result of indirect electrostatic coupling to an inside positive Na+ diffusion potential. In the absence of Na+ and pantothenate concentration gradients an inside negative voltage difference induced a Na(+)-dependent net influx of pantothenate, suggesting the presence of an electrogenic Na(+)-pantothenate cotransport mechanism. The effect of biotin on the kinetics of Na(+)-dependent pantothenate uptake and the effect of pantothenate on the kinetics of Na(+)-dependent biotin uptake suggested that placental absorption of biotin and pantothenate from the maternal circulation occurs by a common Na+ cotransport mechanism in apical brush-border membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1526596450,"Phosphorylation of membrane glycoproteins has often been invoked as a determinant of receptor internalization and receptor trafficking in a more general sense. Here we have studied the trafficking of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules and transferrin receptor (Tfr) related to their phosphorylation status in the human lymphoblastoid cell line JY. High resolution isoelectric focusing (IEF) allows the visualization of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated protein species simultaneously, using protein backbone-labeling. Analysis on IEF was combined with a neuraminidase protection assay, in which sialic acid modification of the N-linked glycans present on Tfr and Class I molecules is used as a reporter group for cell surface expression. Phosphorylation of Class I heavy chains and Tfr was induced by exposure of cells to the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. We show that 1) phosphorylation of MHC Class I molecules is restricted to the cell surface fraction, 2) phosphorylation of MHC Class I molecules by protein kinase C (PKC) is not correlated with their internalization, as no internalization of Class I molecules, phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated, could be detected, 3) the initial rate, but not the final extent of the internalization of Tfr is affected by activation of PKC, and 4) phosphorylated Tfr behaves in a manner identical to non-phosphorylated Tfr in terms of internalization. The effect of activation of PKC on internalization of Tfr therefore most likely takes place at the level of the internalization machinery. Our data concerning the internalization of MHC Class I molecules contrast with earlier studies describing constitutive internalization in the B lymphoblastoid cell line A 46 and in HPB-ALL cells."

A minor bend is induced by TFIIIA, and a very strong bend, centered at its upstream DNA-binding site, is induced by TFIIIB. Despite binding to different DNA sequences on the 5S rRNA gene and the previously analyzed tRNA(Glu) gene, TFIIIB generates nearly identical bends in each site. Fully assembled transcription factor complexes bend the 5S rRNA gene in the same net direction as does TFIIIB alone."
https://openalex.org/W1871708598,The crystal structure of ribonuclease A with bound thymidylic acid tetramer is reported at 2.5-A resolution. The diffusion of the tetramer into native orthorhombic crystals of the ribonuclease allows for the formation of a structurally stable complex where the single-stranded nucleic acid enters and leaves the enzyme's catalytic region in a persistent 5'-3' direction. The binding of the tetramer to the enzyme's surface is facilitated and mediated by electrostatic interactions between basic protein residues and nucleotide phosphates. Two pyrimidine nucleotides are bound to the enzyme's active site in a manner similar to that observed for other complexes between ribonuclease A and nucleic acid oligomers.
https://openalex.org/W1552438247,"Platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PAF) is a phospholipid with many physiological actions. It is synthesized by endothelial cells and a variety of others in response to stimulation with receptor-mediated agonists. In endothelial cells it remains associated with the surface of the cell and serves as a signal for adhesive interactions with leukocytes. Thus, its synthesis must be precisely regulated. In previous work we have shown that PAF synthesis is regulated at the initiating step, a phospholipase A2. Here we demonstrate that the subsequent step of PAF synthesis, the acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, is rapidly activated when cells are exposed to thrombin or other agonists. We found that the activity increased from basal values (5 nmol/mg/min) to approximately 3-fold higher within 1 min following the addition of agonists. The enzyme activity returned to basal levels within 10 min. The pattern of activation and inactivation suggested covalent modification of the enzyme. This was supported in experiments in which we showed that homogenates had stable enhanced activity and that there was no evidence for an activator or inhibitor. Pretreatment of the cells with vanadate, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, markedly prolonged the activation state. In subsequent studies we pretreated intact cells with vanadate to block inactivation of the enzyme and then measured the accumulation of PAF in response to thrombin. We found that it was markedly augmented and prolonged. From this we conclude that the synthesis of PAF in intact cells is regulated by the activity of the acetyltransferase. We characterized requirements for activation of acetyltransferase and found that it was not dependent on the influx of intracellular calcium but that calcium entry did influence the length of time for which the enzyme was activated. The acetyltransferase in endothelial cells was shown to be a specific enzyme that did not catalyze the transfer of long chain acyl groups from acyl-CoA to lysophospholipids and demonstrated modest specificity for the acceptor lysophospholipids. These results suggest that activation of the acetyltransferase is a crucial determinant of the amount of PAF synthesized in activated endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1906498720,"A novel series of glycosphingolipids containing choline phosphate has been demonstrated in whole tissues of the earthworm, Pheretima hilgendorfi. The thin layer chromatographic pattern of the total polar glycolipids revealed the presence of more than three components with positive reactions toward orcinol-sulfuric acid (sugar), molybdate (phosphate), and Dragendorff's (choline) spray reagents. Two of these polar glycolipids (PGL1 and PGL2) were purified by the use of successive column chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A-25 and silicic acid (Iatrobeads) and detected during elution by the presence of galactose-bound choline phosphate. The structural elucidation of the oligosaccharide moieties was performed by compositional sugar analysis, hydrogen fluoride degradation, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis. Thus, the structures of PGL1 and PGL2 were deduced to be as follows: cholinephosphoryl-->6Gal beta 1-1Cer and cholinephosphoryl-->6Gal beta 1-6Gal beta 1-1Cer. Although the oligosaccharide structures of both PGL1 and PGL2 have previously been found in other organisms, the presence of a choline phosphate group as an oligosaccharide substituent is the first finding in nature. The main molecular species of the ceramide moieties were composed of beheninyl- and lignocerinyloctadecasphingenines and their nonadecasphingenine homologues."

A., Crouch, R.J., and Satow, Y. (1990) Science 249, 1398-1405). In an effort to examine any biochemical effects due to the replacement of Met residues by SeMet, we chose to compare the kinetic and binding properties of selenomethionyl dihydrofolate reductase with those of the wt enzyme. There are 5 Met residues in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase with 2 located in the Met-20 loop, which is a sequence of residues forming a lid over the active site. Utilizing plasmid pWT8, which affords 10-15% soluble protein as E. coli dihydrofolate reductase, we readily isolated both the SeMet and wt enzymes from E. coli DL41 utilizing a novel purification protocol. Both enzymes exhibited essentially the same kinetic and binding properties, including specific activities (45 mumol/min/mg), Km (7,8-dihydrofolate = 0.39 microM; NADPH = 2.0 microM), kcat (13.5/s), and 1:1 noncovalent inhibitory binding ratios with methotrexate. The inhibitory effects of divalent and monovalent cations on activity were also assessed, with the SeMet-containing enzyme exhibiting a uniformly greater sensitivity than the wt enzyme. We conclude that the biochemical properties of dihydrofolate reductase are virtually unperturbed by SeMet inclusion. Analysis of SeMet dihydrofolate reductase by 77Se nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed five distinct resonances, thus indicating the potential value of this technique in employing selenium as a nonperturbing NMR probe of protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1533552571,"Several 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides (ddNs), agents that inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus, enter mammalian cells by simple diffusion. In this report, we show that the membrane permeation of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine (ddG) in human erythrocytes and CCRF-CEM cells, in contrast with that of other ddNs, is transporter-mediated. Inward fluxes of ddG in both cell types were inhibited by adenine, hypoxanthine, and acyclovir, but not by inhibitors of nucleoside transport (nitrobenzylthioinosine, dipyridamole, dilazep). Fluxes of ddG in human erythrocytes were attributable to a single, rate-saturable process (Km, 380 +/- 90 microM and Vmax, 7.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/s/microliter cell water) that was competitively inhibited by adenine (Ki, 16 microM). These results showed that ddG entered human erythrocytes and CCRF-CEM cells by a transporter-mediated process that was also the basis for entry of purine nucleobases. In contrast, inward fluxes of 2,6-diaminopurine-2',3'-dideoxyriboside (ddDAPR), a prodrug of ddG, were not affected by purine nucleobases or nucleoside transport inhibitors in either cell type. Thus, the permeation properties of ddDAPR resembled those of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine, a diffusional permeant (cell uptake is transporter-independent), and contrasted with those of ddG, the deamination product of ddDAPR. This study demonstrated that the nucleobase moiety of ddNs is an important determinant of membrane permeation."
https://openalex.org/W1500104402,"The activation of protein kinase C (PKC) usually displays cofactor requirements that include phosphatidylserine (PS), diacylglycerol, and calcium. A complicating factor is that good exogenous substrates of PKC are polycationic proteins or peptides that form aggregates with PS in the assay. This study examined the autophosphorylation of PKC using assays with phospholipid provided in the form of vesicles or phospholipid-Triton mixed micelles. The results showed a close correlation between PKC autophosphorylation and the formation of aggregated assay components. Aggregation occurred primarily by the action of Mg2+ on phospholipids and appeared to underlie a number of major features of PKC autophosphorylation. For example, autophosphorylation required higher concentrations of PS than phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. This appeared to be the result of the different PS requirements of aggregation by divalent metal ions and cationic substrates. An unanticipated result was that aggregation of mixed micelles showed specificity for PS, high cooperativity with respect to several agents, and a requirement for calcium. These parameters were remarkably similar to those describing PKC autophosphorylation. Several major implications are evident in this study. Since the autophosphorylation assay is not a well defined system of monodisperse materials, autophosphorylation of PKC may proceed by intra- or interpeptide mechanism. The uniform correlation between aggregation and production of PKC activity suggested that kinetic parameters may represent interactions of assay components other than the enzyme. Aggregation, which appeared necessary for in vitro activation of PKC, may represent the expression of important but undefined in vivo requirements for this enzyme's function."
https://openalex.org/W1565873176,"Lovastatin blocks the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, mevalonate. When Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are cultured in medium containing lovastatin, the precursor of murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (gPr90env) fails to undergo proteolytic processing, which normally occurs in the Golgi complex. Consequently, newly synthesized envelope proteins are not incorporated into viral particles that are shed into the culture medium. gPr90env appears to be localized in a pre-Golgi membrane compartment, based on its enrichment in subcellular fractions containing NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity and the sensitivity of its carbohydrate chains to digestion with endoglycosidase H. Arrest of gPr90env processing occurs at concentrations of lovastatin that are not cytostatic, and the effect of the inhibitor is prevented by addition of mevalonate to the medium. The low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins, rab1p and rab6p, which are believed to function in early steps of the exocytic pathway, are normally modified posttranslationally by geranylgeranyl isoprenoids. However, in MEL cells treated with 1 microM lovastatin, nonisoprenylated forms of these proteins accumulate in the cytosol prior to arrest of gPr90env processing. These observations suggest that lovastatin may prevent viral envelope precursors from reaching the Golgi compartment by blocking the isoprenylation of rab proteins required for ER to Golgi transport."
https://openalex.org/W1497072049,"We have previously described a subline of L1210 murine leukemia cells (LL1) selected in a low level of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate which overexpresses a membrane-bound folate-binding protein (FBP1) and exhibits a rearrangement at the locus encoding this protein. Genomic clones containing the entire FBP1-encoding DNA from both L1210 and LL1 were isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis indicates that, with exception of the 5'-region, the FBP1-encoding locus in both cell lines is identical. The rearrangement in LL1 results from the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) in the head-to-head (antisense) orientation 72 base pairs (bp) upstream of the FBP1 ATG start codon. The IAP likely provides an alternative promoter for FBP1 expression which may produce a novel transcript with enhanced stability. Presence of the IAP appears to inactivate or relocate normal cis-acting regulatory sequences as expression of the FBP1 transcript in LL1 is not regulated by the folate status of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1521096239,"We investigated the stability of the desensitized state of the human choriogonadotropin (hCG)-sensitive adenylylcyclase of the pig ovarian follicle. A 20,000 x g membrane preparation of pig follicular membranes was incubated under conditions which resulted in the hormone-induced desensitization of the hCG-responsive adenylylcyclase. The desensitized state was maintained upon subsequent incubation of the membranes with GTP, GDP, GMP, ATP, ADP, AMP, CTP, UTP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P), and adenyl (beta, gamma-methylene)-diphosphonate (AMP-P(CH2)P); however, the desensitized state was reverted to a fully active state upon incubation with guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). The reversal effect of GDP beta S on hCG-responsive adenylylcyclase activity was time- and temperature-dependent, and showed a selectivity for GDP beta S over adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S) (half-maximal effective dose of 12 microM versus 260 microM, respectively). GDP beta S had no effect on the binding affinity or apparent number of luteinizing hormone (LH)/CG receptors or on the dissociation rate of 125I-hCG from the receptor. GDP beta S promoted an hCG- and time-dependent release of guanine nucleotides from the membranes. A model is proposed which accounts for the unique characteristics of LH/CG-sensitive adenylylcyclase desensitization and subsequent reactivation by GDP beta S."
https://openalex.org/W1540822061,"In order to characterize the interaction between the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc25 protein and Harvey-ras (p21H-ras), we have constructed a yeast strain disrupted at the RAS1 and RAS2 loci, expressing both p21H-ras and the catalytic domain of the bovine GTPase activating protein (GAP) and containing the cdc25-2 mutation. Such a strain exhibits a temperature-sensitive phenotype. The shift to the nonpermissive temperature is accompanied by the loss of guanyl nucleotide-dependent activity of adenylylcyclase in vitro. The temperature-sensitive phenotype can be rescued by CDC25 itself, as well as by a plasmid containing a truncated SDC25 gene. In addition, wild type CDC25 significantly improves the guanyl nucleotide response observed in the background of the cdc25ts allele at the permissive temperature in a dosage-dependent manner and restores the guanyl nucleotide response at the restrictive temperature. Both CDC25 and a truncated SDC25 also restored p21H-ras-dependent guanyl nucleotide response in a strain isogenic to the one described above but containing a disrupted CDC25 locus instead of the temperature-sensitive allele. These results suggest that the S. cerevisiae Cdc25 protein interacts with p21H-ras expressed in yeast by promoting GDP-GTP exchange. It follows that the yeast system can be used for characterizing the interaction between guanyl nucleotide exchangers of Ras proteins and mammalian p21H-ras."
