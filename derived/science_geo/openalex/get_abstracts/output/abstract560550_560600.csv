Cui et al. developed a copper-based metal-organic framework with hexafluorosilicate and organic linkers designed to have a high affinity for acetylene. These materials, which capture four acetylene molecules in each pore, successfully separated acetylene from mixtures with ethylene. Propane and propylene are both important feedstock chemicals. Their physical and chemical similarity, however, requires energy-intense processes to separate them. Cadiau et al. designed a fluorinated porous metal-organic framework material that selectively adsorbed propylene, with the complete exclusion of propane.

https://openalex.org/W2396232752,"Promoter elements enhance the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we show how methanol synthesis from synthesis gas over copper (Cu) nanoparticles is boosted by zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. By combining surface area titration, electron microscopy, activity measurement, density functional theory calculations, and modeling, we show that the promotion is related to Zn atoms migrating in the Cu surface. The Zn coverage is quantitatively described as a function of the methanol synthesis conditions and of the size-dependent thermodynamic activities of the Cu and ZnO nanoparticles. Moreover, experimental data reveal a strong interdependency of the methanol synthesis activity and the Zn coverage. These results demonstrate the size-dependent activities of nanoparticles as a general means to design synergetic functionality in binary nanoparticle systems."

This approach allows for control of the final core-shell architecture, including particle size, monolayer coverage, and heterometallic composition. Carbon-supported Ti(0.1)W(0.9)C nanoparticles coated with Pt or bimetallic PtRu monolayers exhibited enhanced resistance to sintering and CO poisoning, achieving an order of magnitude increase in specific activity over commercial catalysts for methanol electrooxidation after 10,000 cycles. These core-shell materials provide a new direction to reduce the loading, enhance the activity, and increase the stability of noble metal catalysts."

Despite tumors harboring many mutations, most individuals have very few T cells that respond to these so-called “neo-antigens.” Strønen et al. isolated T cells from healthy donors that responded to predicted neo-antigens expressed by melanomas taken from three patients, sometimes including neo-antigens that the patient's own T cells ignored (see the Perspective by Yadav and Delamarre). Testing whether such an outsourcing strategy could improve clinical outcomes will be an important next step. Science , this issue p. 1337 ; see also p. 1275"

However, available on-board power and mechanical fatigue constrain their flight time, especially for smaller, battery-powered aircraft. Perching on elevated structures is a biologically inspired approach to overcome these limitations. Previous perching robots have required specific material properties for the landing sites, such as surface asperities for spines, or ferromagnetism. We describe a switchable electroadhesive that enables controlled perching and detachment on nearly any material while requiring approximately three orders of magnitude less power than required to sustain flight. These electroadhesives are designed, characterized, and used to demonstrate a flying robotic insect able to robustly perch on a wide range of materials, including glass, wood, and a natural leaf."
https://openalex.org/W1525928775,"A key actor in the conventional theory of superconductivity is the induced interaction between electrons mediated by the exchange of virtual collective fluctuations, originally phonons. Other collective modes that can play the same role, especially spin-fluctuations, have been widely discussed in the context of high-temperature and heavy Fermion superconductors. The strength of such collective fluctuations is measured by the associated susceptibility. Here we use differential elastoresistance measurements on five optimally doped Fe-based superconductors to reveal that a diverging \emph{nematic} susceptibility appears to be a generic feature in the optimal doping regime of these materials. The observation motivates consideration of the effects of nematic fluctuations on the superconducting pairing interaction in this family of compounds, and possibly beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2277573220,"A novel promising route for creating topological states and excitations is to combine superconductivity and the quantum Hall (QH) effect. Despite this potential, signatures of superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime remain scarce, and a superconducting current through a QH weak link has so far eluded experimental observation. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new type of supercurrent-carrying states in a QH region at magnetic fields as high as 2Tesla. The observation of supercurrent in the quantum Hall regime marks an important step in the quest for exotic topological excitations such as Majorana fermions and parafermions, which may find applications in fault-tolerant quantum computations."
https://openalex.org/W2400568150,"Planning allows actions to be structured in pursuit of a future goal. However, in natural environments, planning over multiple possible future states incurs prohibitive computational costs. To represent plans efficiently, states can be clustered hierarchically into ""contexts"". For example, representing a journey through a subway network as a succession of individual states (stations) is more costly than encoding a sequence of contexts (lines) and context switches (line changes). Here, using functional brain imaging, we asked humans to perform a planning task in a virtual subway network. Behavioral analyses revealed that humans executed a hierarchically organized plan. Brain activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex scaled with the cost of hierarchical plan representation and unique neural signals in these regions signaled contexts and context switches. These results suggest that humans represent hierarchical plans using a network of caudal prefrontal structures. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2395067586,"Methyl-coenzyme M reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation, is responsible for the biological production of more than 1 billion tons of methane per year. The mechanism of methane synthesis is thought to involve either methyl-nickel(III) or methyl radical/Ni(II)-thiolate intermediates. We employed transient kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to study the reaction between the active Ni(I) enzyme and substrates. Consistent with the methyl radical–based mechanism, there was no evidence for a methyl-Ni(III) species; furthermore, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy identified the Ni(II)-thiolate intermediate. Temperature-dependent transient kinetics also closely matched density functional theory predictions of the methyl radical mechanism. Identifying the key intermediate in methanogenesis provides fundamental insights to develop better catalysts for producing and activating an important fuel and potent greenhouse gas."

However, it has proven difficult to achieve tailored long-range ordering of their diverse configurations, limiting both fundamental and applied research directions. We designed an artificial spin structure that produces a magnetic charge ice with tunable long-range ordering of eight different configurations. We also developed a technique to precisely manipulate the local magnetic charge states and demonstrate write-read-erase multifunctionality at room temperature. This globally reconfigurable and locally writable magnetic charge ice could provide a setting for designing magnetic monopole defects, tailoring magnonics, and controlling the properties of other two-dimensional materials."

However, how satellite cells operate inside living tissue is unclear. Gurevich et al. exploited the optical clarity of zebrafish larvae and used a series of genetic approaches to study muscle injury. After injury, satellite cells divide asymmetrically to generate a progenitor pool for muscle replacement and at the same time “self-renew” the satellite stem cell. This results in regeneration that is highly clonal in nature, validating many decades of in vitro analyses examining the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle. Science , this issue p. 136"

Dopamine (DA) depletion, caused by pharmacological agents or genetic models of DA neuron degeneration, produces a pronounced motor deficit that closely resembles the motor symptoms characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (Bergman and Deuschl, 2002Bergman H.

However, this basic research has struggled to accurately and consistently relate the motor deficits produced by DA depletion to specific changes in striatal neuronal activity and circuit function. This is owing, in large part, to technical limitations such as the experimental variability inherent to 6-OHDA lesions (Deumens et al., 2002Deumens R. Blokland A. Prickaerts J.

DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) are critical to motor output because global deletion of D2Rs leads to similar motor deficits as those seen after DA depletion (Baik et al., 1995Baik J.H. Picetti R. Saiardi A.

However, in the striatum alone, D2Rs are expressed on at least five different types of neurons: indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs), cholinergic interneurons, a subset of GABA interneurons, and afferents to the striatum from DA and prefrontal cortex neurons (Bamford et al., 2004Bamford N.S.

Dopaminergic modulation of striatal neurons, circuits, and assemblies.Neuroscience. 2011; 198: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether ubiquitous activation of all these striatal D2Rs or selective activation of a subset of D2Rs is responsible for generating the motor deficits of DA depletion models. Furthermore, it is unknown whether D2Rs expressed in the cortex and other non-striatal regions that receive projections from midbrain DA neurons also contribute to this motor phenotype. In this study, we generated a mouse line with a precise genetic manipulation that allows for reliable titration of the levels of D2Rs on iMSNs by crossing conditional Drd2loxP/loxP mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase selectivity in striatal iMSNs (Adora2A-Cre+/−). This mouse line, referred to as iMSN-Drd2KO, exhibits bradykinesia while showing normal DA release properties, indicating that downregulation of D2R function in iMSNs is sufficient to recapitulate the motor impairments of DA depletion models. Based on the “go-no go” model of basal ganglia function, direct-pathway MSNs (dMSNs) and iMSNs exert opposite effects on motor output, where increased activity of dMSNs facilitates movement and increased activity of iMSNs suppresses movement (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

Regulation of parkinsonian motor behaviours by optogenetic control of basal ganglia circuitry.Nature. 2010; 466: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the model posits that DA in the striatum enhances locomotion mainly via activation of Gs/olf-coupled DA D1Rs expressed by dMSNs and activation of Gi/o-coupled D2Rs expressed by iMSNs (Durieux et al., 2012Durieux P.F. Schiffmann S.N. de Kerchove d’Exaerde A.

This model is the basis for one of the current hypotheses of Parkinson’s disease, which postulates that decreased activity of dMSNs and increased activity of iMSNs, resulting from a lack of D1R and D2R activation, respectively, is responsible for the motor impairment. Several studies report enhanced in vivo somatic firing rate after 6-OHDA lesion, although this finding has been inconsistent across studies (Chan et al., 2012Chan C.S. Peterson J.D. Gertler T.S.

It is then still unclear how striatal circuit activity changes during the motor impairment and whether these changes are causative or rather homeostatic alterations aimed at compensating for the motor dysfunction. In this study, targeted deletion of D2Rs to striatal iMSNs is performed to parse the specific role of these receptors in controlling neuronal excitability, in vivo MSN firing, and inhibitory transmission, and to determine how these cellular changes may relate to the observed motor impairment, one of the main symptoms that defines Parkinson’s disease. Mice carrying the conditional Drd2 allele (Drd2loxP/loxP) were crossed with BAC transgenic Adora2A-Cre+/− mice to generate mice lacking D2Rs selectively in iMSNs throughout the striatum (iMSN-Drd2KO), while preserving other striatal and non-striatal D2Rs. Adora2A-Cre+/− transgenic mice provide specific Cre expression in iMSNs (>80% co-expression with met-enkaphalin) with no expression in dMSNs, cholinergic interneurons, and midbrain DA neurons (Figure S1, available online). There was a pronounced gene-dependent reduction of Drd2 mRNA in striatal tissue for iMSN-Drd2HET (Drd2WT/loxP × Adora2A-Cre+/− ) (∼40%) and iMSN-Drd2KO mice (>80%) relative to Drd2loxP/loxP mice (one-way ANOVA, F2, 8 = 83.75, p < 0.0001, n = 3–5 mice) with no reduction in Drd1 mRNA levels (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.43; Figure 1A). Locomotor activity in the home cage was reduced by >50% in both iMSN-Drd2HET and iMSN-Drd2KO mice compared to control Drd2loxP/loxP littermates (time × genotype interaction, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, F46,759 = 4.635, p < 0.0001, n = 9–14; Figure 1B). When placed in a novel open field chamber, iMSN-Drd2KO mice spent more time immobile (hypokinesia) and were slower when mobile (bradykinesia), contributing to an overall lower distance traveled (85% ± 3% versus 67% ± 3% immobile for iMSN-Drd2KO and Drd2loxP/loxP, respectively; speed when mobile [>2 cm/s] = 4.5 cm/s versus 6 cm/s; one-way ANOVA, F2,59 = 13.9 and 29.9, respectively, p < 0.0001, n = 9–28; Figure 1C). In addition, iMSN-Drd2KO mice showed impaired performance on a motor skill task assayed using the rotarod (Figure 1D). iMSN-Drd2HET mice displayed an intermediate phenotype in both assays (post hoc tests, p < 0.05 compared to Drd2loxP/loxP and iMSN-Drd2KO; n = 9–28; Figures 1C and 1D), demonstrating haploinsufficiency and the ability of this genetic model to tightly control the expression level of D2Rs and titrate the motor phenotype. These results indicate that reduction of striatal D2R levels specifically in iMSNs is sufficient to reproduce the motor deficits of global D2R knockout mice and DA depletion models (Baik et al., 1995Baik J.H.

Interestingly, we also noticed that iMSN-Drd2KO mice showed less motor impairment during the novelty phase of the open field assay (the first minute), and iMSN-Drd2HET displayed similar locomotor response to control Drd2loxP/loxP mice during this first minute of open field exposure (post hoc test, p = 0.93, n = 9–24; Figures 1C and S2). These observations suggested that environmental salience could reduce the impact of the motor impairment. We performed two additional experiments to more directly evaluate the impact of environmental salience. First, we tested whether exposure to a novel object, an appetitive stimulus known to evoke phasic DA (Fink and Smith, 1980Fink J.S. Smith G.P.

When a novel object was introduced in the center of the open field chamber, iMSN-Drd2KO mice spent more time in the object’s perimeter and traveled larger distances around the object compared to Drd2loxP/loxP mice (t tests, p = 0.04, n = 20–21). In this context, their speed around the object did not differ from control littermates (t test, p = 0.96, n = 20–21; Figures 1E and S3). Second, we measured motor activity of the same two groups of mice (iMSN-Drd2KO and control Drd2loxP/loxP) in two environments that carried different motivational salience: a cylindrical empty chamber and a cylindrical chamber of identical dimensions filled with water. Spontaneous locomotion was measured for 15 min over a 2 day period, counterbalanced across animals. In the empty chamber, iMSN-Drd2KO mice displayed a similar motor deficit as seen in the novel open field described above (Figure 1F). In contrast, during forced swim, iMSN-Drd2KO mice did not exhibit significant differences in speed or distance traveled compared to control Drd2loxP/loxP littermates (t tests, p = 0.4, n = 9–11; Figure 1F). Collectively, the results indicate that the motor activity stimulated by salient stimuli is normal, or even possibly enhanced, in iMSN-Drd2KO compared to control littermates, again replicating the motor phenotype of DA depletion models. To further evaluate the spatio-temporal dependence of the D2R deletion on the motor impairment, D2R deletion was restricted to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult mice using bilateral stereotaxic injections of AAV viral vectors expressing Cre recombinase in the NAc of adult (>post-natal day [p]60) Drd2loxP/loxP mice (Figures 2A and 2B ). This manipulation, while not selective for iMSNs, produced an 80% reduction of Drd2 mRNA levels in the NAc (Figure 2C) and minimizes possible compensatory changes caused by lack of D2Rs during brain development. Knockdown of D2Rs in the NAc decreased homecage locomotion (time × viral type interaction, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, F23,276 = 1.83, p = 0.01; main effect of viral type, F23,276 = 6.65, p = 0.008, n = 5–9; Figure 2D). Moreover, NAc-Drd2 knockdown reduced horizontal locomotor activity in a novel locomotor chamber compared to GFP-expressing mice (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, main effect of viral type, F1,20 = 17.68, p = 0.004, n = 10–12; Figure 2E). The pattern of locomotor activity between naive Drd2loxP/loxP control mice and Drd2loxP/loxP expressing GFP viral particles was nearly identical (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, F11,308 = 0.5, p = 0.55, n = 12–18). Acute knockdown of D2Rs in the NAc completely recapitulated the locomotor deficit observed in iMSN-Drd2KO mice in this particular behavioral assay (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, F11,209 = 0.5, p = 0.63, n = 10–11). However, acute knockdown of D2Rs in the NAc did not impair motor skill performance or motor skill learning on a rotarod (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, F25,325 = 0.73, p = 0.39, n = 6–9; Figure 2F). These results are consistent with other studies that suggest a regional dissociation between spontaneous locomotion and motor skill learning (Durieux et al., 2012Durieux P.F. Schiffmann S.N. de Kerchove d’Exaerde A. Differential regulation of motor control and response to dopaminergic drugs by D1R and D2R neurons in distinct dorsal striatum subregions.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and are complementary to recent findings showing increased locomotion following D2R overexpression in the NAc (Gallo et al., 2015Gallo E.F. Salling M.C. Feng B. Morón J.A. Harrison N.L. Javitch J.A. Kellendonk C. Upregulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens indirect pathway increases locomotion but does not reduce alcohol consumption.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the locomotor deficit does not require absence of D2Rs throughout development. Moreover, it suggests that manipulating DA transmission in the NAc alone can alter movement. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure DA signals in both the dorsal striatum (DS) and the NAc in brain slices from iMSN-Drd2KO and control Drd2loxP/loxP mice. In the DS, the DA concentrations evoked by one pulse stimulation were higher than the NAc, and there were no differences between genotypes (two-way ANOVA; main effect of region, F1,36 = 10.52, p = 0.003; no region × genotype interaction, F1,36 = 1.3E−5, p = 0.99, n = 7–14; Figures 3A and 3B ). Single-pulse stimulation evoked the maximal DA concentration transient at 0.5 ms duration in both genotypes, which plateaued with longer durations (two-way repeated measures ANOVA; main effect of stimulation duration, F5,60 = 10.89, p < 0.0001; Figure 3C). There was no difference between genotypes in the peak DA concentration following 20-pulse stimulation or in the 1 pulse:20 pulse ratio, which was higher in the NAc than in the DS (two-way ANOVA; main effect of region, F1,36 = 13.36, p = 0.0008; no region × genotype interaction, F1,36 = 0.1371, p = 0.7, n = 7–14; Figures 3D and 3E). Sulpiride, a D2-like receptor antagonist, increased DA transients evoked by trains, and, as expected, the increase was greater in the NAc than in the DS (two-way repeated measures ANOVA; main effect of region, F1,12 = 15.13, p = 0.002; Figures 3F and 3G). Importantly, the effect of sulpiride was similar in both genotypes (two-way ANOVA; region × genotype interaction, F1,25 = 0.33, p = 0.53, n = 5–8; Figures 3F and 3G), as was the effect of a D2-like agonist, quinpirole, at the IC50 concentration (0.03 μM) or maximal concentration of 1 μM (two-way ANOVA; drug concentration × genotype interaction, F2,24 = 1.47, p = 0.25, n = 4–9; Figures 3H and 3I). Thus, the DA release properties and the modulation of DA transmission by D2R autoreceptors are intact in this mouse model lacking D2Rs in striatal neurons. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that increased firing rate of iMSNs may account for the motor deficits of iMSN-Drd2KO mice (Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2000Hernandez-Lopez S. Tkatch T. Perez-Garci E. Galarraga E. Bargas J. Hamm H. Surmeier D.J. D2 dopamine receptors in striatal medium spiny neurons reduce L-type Ca2+ currents and excitability via a novel PLC[beta]1-IP3-calcineurin-signaling cascade.J.

To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo recordings in the dorsal striatum of freely moving control and iMSN-Drd2KO mice. Single-unit recordings from MSNs and interneurons were sorted based on their waveform and firing rates (Figure S4). The same motor deficit was seen in iMSN-Drd2KO mice, from whom we recorded single-unit activity, compared to control mice (Figure S4). The average firing rate per MSN was not significantly different between genotypes (control, 0.86 ± 0.1 Hz; iMSN-Drd2KO, 0.76 ± 0.10 Hz; t test, p = 0.42, n = 107–117 cells; Figures 4A and 4B ). However, there was a significant variation in the number of cells recorded per animal, including a disproportionally large number of neurons recorded from one low firing control. We therefore assessed the average firing rate per animal, which was significantly lower in iMSN-Drd2KO mice relative to controls (control, 0.91 ± 0.11 Hz; iMSN-Drd2KO, 0.46 ± 0.11 Hz; t test, p = 0.02, n = 5–7 mice; Figure 4C). Furthermore, there was no evidence of a bimodal distribution of firing rates in either genotype, indicating an overall decrease in firing rate across the two subpopulations of MSNs in iMSN-Drd2KO mice. To examine firing rates of iMSNs more specifically, we expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in a cre-dependent manner and used optogenetic stimulation to identify single units arising specifically from iMSNs (optogenetic tagging). For these experiments, Adora2A-Cre+/− mice, which display similar locomotor activity as Drd2loxP/loxP littermates, were used as the control group (Figure S2). The firing rates of tagged iMSNs were also significantly lower in the iMSN-DrdKO mice (Adora2A-Cre+/−, 0.91 ± 0.23 Hz versus iMSN-DrdKO, 0.33 ± 0.11 Hz; one-tailed t test, p = 0.03, n = 5–6 cells; Figures 4D–4F), consistent with the results shown above. We were also able to record from a handful of putative GABAergic interneurons (based on fast waveform; Figure S4). There was also a significant decrease in firing in this putative interneuron population (control, 16.1 ± 3.5 Hz; iMSN-Drd2KO, 4.6 ± 1.3 Hz; t test, p = 0.02, n = 9–11 cells; Figure 4G). Taken together, we conclude that firing of both iMSNs and dMSNs is depressed in iMSN-Drd2KO mice, in contrast to our prediction that firing of iMSNs would be heightened following the loss of D2Rs. Furthermore, the reduction in putative interneuron firing indicates an overall depression in striatal network activity. The in vivo firing of neurons in the globus pallidus external (GPe), the downstream target of iMSNs, was assessed next. There was a dramatic decrease in the firing rate of GPe neurons in iMSN-Drd2KO mice compared to controls (control, 30.2 ± 5.1 Hz; iMSN-Drd2KO, 14.3 ± 2.4 Hz; p = 0.002, n = 35–49 cells; Figures 4H and 4I). This finding is consistent with the motor deficit of these mice but paradoxical when considering the decreased firing of iMSNs. To probe the cellular mechanism(s) underlying the changes in basal ganglia activity, we turned to slice electrophysiology where we were able to isolate currents and selectively record from dMSNs and iMSNs. Changes in intrinsic excitability of MSNs might contribute to the observed reduction of in vivo firing rat"

We show that ppGpp is robustly, but transiently, induced in response to DNA damage and is required for efficient nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER). This explains why relA-spoT-deficient cells are sensitive to diverse genotoxic agents and ultraviolet radiation, whereas ppGpp induction renders them more resistant to such challenges. The mechanism of DNA protection by ppGpp involves promotion of UvrD-mediated RNAP backtracking. By rendering RNAP backtracking-prone, ppGpp couples transcription to DNA repair and prompts transitions between repair and recovery states."

Song production in the zebra finch provides an excellent opportunity to examine the processes that shape the representation of a single complex learned behavior as it progresses from dedicated higher-order centers through downstream targets, ultimately leading to the flexion of muscles needed to produce the song (Ashmore et al., 2005Ashmore R.C.

Although the motor pathway in the songbird is composed of well identified and spatially segregated neural circuits (Nottebohm et al., 1976Nottebohm F. Stokes T.M. Leonard C.M.

Neuroscience: The units of a song.Nature. 2013; 495: 56-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). One controversy centers on a single forebrain area (called HVC) that plays a central role in song production (Long and Fee, 2008Long M.A. Fee M.S.

In one view, HVC projection neurons reflect motor-related aspects of the ongoing song (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D.

Distinguishing between these mechanisms of motor control would be a significant step forward in our understanding of how singing behavior is encoded within HVC, potentially extending to skilled behaviors in other forebrain circuits. Technical challenges using traditional electrophysiological approaches in singing birds have prevented a clear characterization of the HVC premotor network (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S.

In the rodent, in vivo two-photon imaging has enabled the study of large populations of motor cortical neurons during the performance of tractable behaviors (Huber et al., 2012Huber D. Gutnisky D.A. Peron S. O’Connor D.H. Wiegert J.S. Tian L. Oertner T.G. Looger L.L. Svoboda K.

Emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity during motor learning.Nature. 2014; 510: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we developed a head-fixed preparation that enabled us to image populations of HVC projection neurons during singing. We then applied a new computational algorithm that enabled high-precision estimates for event timing by integrating across song trials. Additionally, we analyzed a series of intracellular recordings in which spikes and excitatory postsynaptic events were used to reflect motor-related network activity within HVC. First, we demonstrate that the rate of HVC premotor bursts during silent gaps in the song does not differ relative to epochs of active singing. We then found that HVC activity occurs continuously within the context of a syllable rather than concurrent with identified motor components of the song. Our results show that behaviorally relevant temporal sequences within HVC of the zebra finch are uncoupled from the properties of each constitutive movement, akin to higher-order cortical areas in primates (e.g., Tanji and Shima, 1994Tanji J. Shima K. Role for supplementary motor area cells in planning several movements ahead.Nature. 1994; 371: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We wanted to test the proposed hypotheses of song representation by examining the neuronal activity at a population level with two-photon microscopy (Denk et al., 1990Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8283) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have used two-photon imaging of HVC activity in the anesthetized zebra finch to measure sensory responses within that structure (Graber et al., 2013Graber M.H. Helmchen F. Hahnloser R.H. Activity in a premotor cortical nucleus of zebra finches is locally organized and exhibits auditory selectivity in neurons but not in glia.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e81177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Peh et al., 2015Peh W.Y. Roberts T.F. Mooney R. Imaging auditory representations of song and syllables in populations of sensorimotor neurons essential to vocal communication.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5589-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To adapt this approach to address motor dynamics, we developed a head-fixed singing bird preparation. Because we were not able to elicit head-fixed song in initial attempts (n = 6 birds), we used operant conditioning to encourage this behavior. Male zebra finches were separated from females by a glass partition whose transparency was under experimental control, and they were given visual access to females at regular intervals (Figure 1A). Males were rewarded for singing during those epochs (Figure 1B; Figures S1A–S1D) and then transitioned to a head-fixed context when song could be evoked reliably (Figure 1C; Figures S1E, S1F, and S1I). The vast majority of these birds (71 of 78) produced at least one head-fixed song motif (Table 1). Although head fixation can alter behavior and the associated neural activity for certain tasks (Ravassard et al., 2013Ravassard P. Kees A. Willers B. Ho D. Aharoni D. Cushman J. Aghajan Z.M. Mehta M.R. Multisensory control of hippocampal spatiotemporal selectivity.Science. 2013; 340: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we found that the quality (p = 0.27, F = 1.47, one-way ANOVA) and timing (p = 0.95, paired t test) of singing behavior for five individual birds were not significantly different compared with song produced during free movement (Figures S1J–S1L).Table 1Zebra Finch TrainingFreely MovingHead-Fixed (No 2P)Head-Fixed 2PHead-Fixed 2P and ImagingNumber of birds trained10978176Number of sessions5402,47418785Number of trials18,50061,7502,8341,405Trials with song7,46311,8111,509756Number of song motifs37,11266,0256,8002,868Motifs per trial2.01.12.42.0Shown is the performance of zebra finches in each phase of the training program.

Under the last two conditions, only a subpopulation of head-fixed birds was used for this study, and further training was carried out under the two-photon microscope (2P). A subset of the head-fixed singing birds was acclimated to the two-photon microscope (Figures S1G and S1H; Movie S1). In those individuals, we virally expressed a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f) (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar) to report the activity of HVC neurons during singing. To calibrate the calcium indicator in vivo, we performed simultaneous juxtacellular recordings and calcium imaging (Figure S2A) of bursting activity in an anesthetized and pharmacologically disinhibited zebra finch (Figures S2B–S2E). The latency from the first spike of the burst to the onset of the calcium transient was 5.9 ± 3.7 ms (n = 3 neurons from 2 birds). The standard deviation of onset timing within individual neurons was 3.5 ± 1.3 ms (e.g., Figure S2E), which supported the notion that GCaMP6 could reliably report neural activity with high temporal precision. During singing, the majority of HVC neurons exhibited one (cells 1, 4, and 5) or a few (cells 2 and 3) distinct calcium transients (Figures 1D and 1E), consistent with previous measurements taken with a head-mounted CMOS camera (Markowitz et al., 2015Markowitz J.E. Liberti 3rd, W.A. Guitchounts G. Velho T. Lois C. Gardner T.J. Mesoscopic patterns of neural activity support songbird cortical sequences.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For this study, we restricted our analysis to these sparsely active neurons that are likely to represent HVC premotor [HVC(RA)] or basal ganglia-projecting [HVC(X)] cells (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H.

An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird.Nature. 2002; 419: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Kosche et al., 2015Kosche G. Vallentin D. Long M.A. Interplay of inhibition and excitation shapes a premotor neural sequence.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 1217-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We next asked whether our approach could provide sufficient temporal resolution to test hypotheses concerning the representation of singing behavior within the HVC circuit. High temporal resolution is critical for detecting the precise onset of (∼10 ms) bursting responses within HVC (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird.Nature. 2002; 419: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Long et al., 2010Long M.A. Jin D.Z. Fee M.S. Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation.Nature. 2010; 468: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, the onset time of putative burst events was difficult to estimate precisely in individual trials (e.g., Figures 2A, 2C, and 2E ). To address this problem, we took advantage of the stereotyped timing inherent in both the zebra finch song as well as the underlying HVC bursting activity (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. An ultra-sparse code underlies the generation of neural sequences in a songbird.Nature. 2002; 419: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. Singing-related activity of identified HVC neurons in the zebra finch.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For a given focal plane, we imaged during several renditions of the song (Figure 2B) and aligned calcium traces from multiple trials to the singing behavior (Figure 2D). Using a Bayesian method (Figures S2D and S2F–S2I), we found that combining fluorescence measurements across trials could greatly sharpen the temporal resolution of our estimates for burst onsets (Figures 2C–2G; see Experimental Procedures for details). For instance, in an example cell that had been imaged for 23 song motifs, the burst events could be detected with significantly more precision when considering all trials (mean σonset = 3.0 ms; Figure 2F) compared with estimates taken from single trials (mean σonset = 16.3 ms; Figure 2E). Across our dataset, the uncertainty of our estimate for burst onsets decreased as a function of the number of motifs analyzed (Figure 2G) and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio of measurements from individual neurons (Figure 2H). When the timing of HVC bursts was determined, we examined the relationship between these events and singing behavior. We asked whether bursts occurred preferentially during periods of active singing. Zebra finches produce a repeated series of vocal elements, known as “syllables,” that are approximately 75–300 ms in length and are separated by shorter (15- to 100-ms) silent “gaps” during inspiration (Hartley and Suthers, 1989Hartley R.S. Suthers R.A. Airflow and pressure during canary song: direct evidence for mini-breaths.J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1989; 165: 15-26Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Figures 3A and 3B ). Although syringeal muscles can be activated during both syllables and gaps, electromyogram recordings during song production show dynamic patterns of muscle activation that correlate with the rapidly changing acoustic features of song (Goller and Cooper, 2004Goller F. Cooper B.G. Peripheral motor dynamics of song production in the zebra finch.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2004; 1016: 130-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Riede and Goller, 2010Riede T. Goller F. Functional morphology of the sound-generating labia in the syrinx of two songbird species.J. Anat. 2010; 216: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Suthers et al., 1994Suthers R.A. Goller F. Hartley R.S. Motor dynamics of song production by mimic thrushes.J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 917-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Vicario, 1991aVicario D.S. Contributions of syringeal muscles to respiration and vocalization in the zebra finch.J. Neurobiol. 1991; 22: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As a result, the kinematic hypothesis would predict that HVC projection neurons would be significantly more active during syllables than during silent gaps, whereas the temporal sequence hypothesis would not anticipate a difference between these conditions. In total, we considered 294 burst events (250 cells) from five birds producing a total of 45 syllables (Figure 3; Figure S3). We found no relationship between the relative frequency of HVC projection neuron bursts and the presence of a syllable (74.0 bursts/s) or a gap (76.7 bursts/s) (p > 0.05, paired t test), supporting the notion that bursts are forming a continuous sequential representation throughout the song motif. Additionally, there was no temporal alignment of burst events to the onsets (Figure 3C) or offsets (Figure 3D) of syllables. We next wanted to examine the fine structure of syllables to test whether HVC projection neuron activity is best explained by the presence of specific motor movements or by a continuous temporal sequence. Because a direct assessment of muscular activity was not feasible in our preparation, we turned to a previously established tool for estimating vocal muscle gestures from recorded songs (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Boari et al., 2015Boari S. Sanz Perl Y. Amador A. Margoliash D. Mindlin G.B. Automatic reconstruction of physiological gestures used in a model of birdsong production.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar; Figure S4). These events, called gesture-trajectory extrema (GTEs), are associated with changes in syringeal tension or subsyringeal pressure (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and can be estimated by analyzing song structure (Boari et al., 2015Boari S. Sanz Perl Y. Amador A. Margoliash D. Mindlin G.B. Automatic reconstruction of physiological gestures used in a model of birdsong production.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We first examined the relationship between GTEs and burst onsets (e.g., Figure 3B) and found no significant correlation between these events at any time lag in both individual birds and across the population (Figure 3E). To validate our method, we performed a simulation where burst events were placed at syllabic and subsyllabic time points and adjusted for associated experimental uncertainties as well as the inherent temporal variance suggested previously to exist between these events (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In these simulated positive controls, we were able to detect a significant correlation between motor events and bursting activity (Figure 3F). To formally test hypotheses concerning motor representations within HVC, we defined the predictions of two models: a movement model based on GTE events and a uniform distribution model in which bursts are spread evenly throughout the song (Figure 3G). When we smoothly interpolated between these two models with a likelihood-ratio test to consider a range of mixed coding schemes (see Experimental Procedures for details), we found that our data strongly favored a uniform distribution (Figure 3H), supporting the notion of a song-related temporal sequence within HVC. As before, we confirmed the efficacy of this method by finding a strong preference for the GTE model in our simulated positive control (Figure 3I). One limitation of the likelihood-ratio approach is that it tests the GTE model with no temporal offset, which was a choice that was originally motivated by the previous claim that GTE and bursts co-occur (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although our decision to focus on a zero latency relationship is consistent with our observation of a lack of strong correlations at a variety of time offsets (e.g., Figure 3E), we repeated the log likelihood analysis at a range of possible offsets (−30 to 30 ms). The repeated testing at various negative time offsets can help to counteract any systematic inaccuracy in our estimate of the lag between the true burst time and the calcium onset resulting from our calibration conditions (Figure 4A). The positive time offsets enable us to consider a “causal” scenario in which the accepted premotor delays (∼15–20 ms) existing between HVC activity and song (Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. Singing-related activity of identified HVC neurons in the zebra finch.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) are incorporated into the analysis (Figure 4B). Across these various tests, we continued to find strong support for a uniform distribution compared with a subsyllabic kinematic model. We considered a number of potential sources of error that may have biased our findings. First, our ability to precisely estimate burst onset times for individual neurons was variable (Figures 2G and 2H). Although our analyses take this variability into account (see Experimental Procedures), it is possible that neurons with the highest amount of uncertainty were obscuring an existing relationship between bursts and GTEs. To address this concern, we restricted our analysis to only bursts with an onset uncertainty of less than 10 ms (1"

https://openalex.org/W2397427953,"The face of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy is changing dramatically. Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) specifically targeting HCV proteins have been developed and entered clinical practice in 2011. However, despite high sustained viral response (SVR) rates of more than 90%, a fraction of patients do not eliminate the virus and in these cases treatment failure has been associated with the selection of drug resistance mutations (RAMs). RAMs may be prevalent prior to the start of treatment, or can be selected under therapy, and furthermore they can persist after cessation of treatment. Additionally, certain DAAs have been approved only for distinct HCV genotypes and may even have subtype specificity. Thus, sequence analysis before start of therapy is instrumental for managing DAA-based treatment strategies. We have created the interpretation system geno2pheno[HCV] (g2p[HCV]) to analyse HCV sequence data with respect to viral subtype and to predict drug resistance. Extensive reviewing and weighting of literature related to HCV drug resistance was performed to create a comprehensive list of drug resistance rules for inhibitors of the HCV protease in non-structural protein 3 (NS3-protease: Boceprevir, Paritaprevir, Simeprevir, Asunaprevir, Grazoprevir and Telaprevir), the NS5A replicase factor (Daclatasvir, Ledipasvir, Elbasvir and Ombitasvir), and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Dasabuvir and Sofosbuvir). Upon submission of up to eight sequences, g2p[HCV] aligns the input sequences, identifies the genomic region(s), predicts the HCV geno- and subtypes, and generates for each DAA a drug resistance prediction report. g2p[HCV] offers easy-to-use and fast subtype and resistance analysis of HCV sequences, is continuously updated and freely accessible under http://hcv.geno2pheno.org/index.php. The system was partially validated with respect to the NS3-protease inhibitors Boceprevir, Telaprevir and Simeprevir by using data generated with recombinant, phenotypic cell culture assays obtained from patients' virus variants."

We find that PN bursts in adult birds are continuously and nearly uniformly distributed throughout song.

Continuous activity in HVC(RA) neurons also figures into recent models of sequence generation in which these neurons form a synaptically connected chain that supports the propagation of bursting activity (Glaze and Troyer, 2007Glaze C.M.

Finally, a recent model of vocal learning (Fee and Goldberg, 2011Fee M.S. Goldberg J.H. A hypothesis for basal ganglia-dependent reinforcement learning in the songbird.Neuroscience. 2011; 198: 152-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) incorporates X-projecting HVC (HVC(X)) neurons to form a continuous-time code (or clock), allowing temporal specificity in learning (Charlesworth et al., 2011Charlesworth J.D.

Lipkind D. Parra L.C. Tchernichovski O. Vocal exploration is locally regulated during song learning.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3422-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these models require continuous sequential activity in the population of HVC PNs; thus, we refer to them collectively as continuous-time models. While the simplest instantiations of these models generally assume an equal number of neurons participating at each time in the sequence, such a uniform density of bursts is not required for their function. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed recently (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), in which HVC activity is organized around a small number of time points in the song corresponding to discrete events in the trajectory of vocal control parameters, called gesture trajectory extrema (GTE). Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar reported that bursts of PNs, as well as the minima of interneuron firing rates, were tightly synchronized with GTEs (4- to 7-ms SD). Based on their observations, Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar went on to conclude that HVC PNs, as a population, must be silent between GTEs. Not only are these findings incompatible with the continuous-time models described above, but the near-zero latency of HVC bursts relative to song features rules out a premotor role for HVC in vocal output. In short, the GTE model would force a dramatic revision of our understanding of the mechanisms of song production. Here we set out to reexamine the relation between HVC activity and vocal structure in the song by analyzing a large dataset of PNs and interneurons recorded in singing birds. Our analysis initially focused on neurons recorded in birds with mature adult song, testing the continuity and uniformity of HVC burst coverage, as well as investigating the alignment of PN and interneuron activity to GTEs and other song features. In adult birds, we found that HVC PNs, as a population, provide continuous and nearly uniform coverage of song. However, we also found that both HVC(X) neurons and interneurons exhibit a rhythmic modulation in firing rate coherent with an underlying ∼10-Hz rhythmicity in song syllable structure, a feature not predicted by either the GTE or uniform models. Further, analysis of HVC neurons recorded in juvenile birds suggested that such rhythmic modulation may be a remnant of a developmental process in which oscillatory HVC activity drives the rhythmic repetition of early prototype syllables (Okubo et al., 2015Okubo T.S. Mackevicius E.L. Payne H.L. Lynch G.F. Fee M.S. Growth and splitting of neural sequences in songbird vocal development.Nature. 2015; 528: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Tchernichovski et al., 2001Tchernichovski O. Mitra P.P. Lints T. Nottebohm F. Dynamics of the vocal imitation process: how a zebra finch learns its song.Science. 2001; 291: 2564-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). While the continuous-time models make no specific prediction about the distribution of bursts in the song, they require that there be no periods of inactivity in the population of PNs. To test this prediction, we analyzed a large dataset of 450 neurons recorded during singing, which included 595 burst times generated by 384 PNs. The distribution and continuity of PN bursts in the song motif were quantified by identifying bursts from a histogram of spike times (Figure 1F). Subtle rendition-to-rendition variations in song speed were accounted for by time-warping the spike trains relative to syllable onsets and offsets (Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S. Singing-related activity of identified HVC neurons in the zebra finch.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (see the Experimental Procedures). Visual inspection of the distribution of bursts in time (Figures 1A–1E and S1A–S1E) suggested that the bursts provide nearly complete coverage of the song motif. The fraction of the motif covered by bursts (covered fraction) was quantified by determining the patches in time covered by the bursts of each neuron (see the Experimental Procedures). The covered fraction was defined, over all neurons, as the fraction of the entire song motif covered by at least one patch. Across birds, the median covered fraction was 96%, suggesting a very high degree of burst coverage in most birds (Figure 2A). A significantly lower covered fraction of only 67% was observed in one bird in which the fewest neurons were recorded (bird 1). By simulating a large number (104) of surrogate datasets, we found that the observed covered fraction for all birds was consistent with random sampling from a uniform underlying distribution of burst times (uniform model; Figure 2A; p > 0.05 for all birds). Note that this does not imply that the bursts are truly uniformly distributed, only that the observed coverage metric is consistent with random burst placement.Figure 2Fraction of Song Motif Covered by BurstsShow full caption(A) Summary of the fraction of the song motif covered by PN bursts for all five birds (covered fraction; black circles).

Results for all birds (birds 1–5) and simulations to determine the relation between probability of total coverage and fold coverage are shown in Figure S2. We next examined how the covered fraction would be expected to vary with the number of neurons recorded. For each bird, we generated surrogate datasets by resampling and shuffling different numbers of bursts from our data (see the Experimental Procedures). The number of bursts was expressed as fold coverage (Figures 2B and S2A), defined as the ratio of total burst duration to motif duration. Across birds, the simulated covered fraction exhibited a rapidly saturating dependence on fold coverage. Indeed, a fold coverage of ten resulted in a very high probability (>95%) of achieving total coverage (100% covered fraction) by bursts in the surrogate datasets (Figure S2B). Finally, the observed covered fraction for the individual PN subtypes was well explained by this saturating dependence (blue curve, Figures 2B and S2A). Although the bursts of PNs in our dataset provided nearly complete coverage of the song, the bursts appeared to exhibit some degree of clumping in time (Figures 1A–1E). We wondered if this apparent clustering is simply due to random sampling of neurons or, alternatively, if it is more consistent with the alignment of many bursts at GTE times, as predicted by the GTE model. To address this question, burst times within the song motif were inferred from the histogram of time-warped spikes (see the Experimental Procedures). We examined the distribution of intervals between all burst times recorded in a single bird (population inter-burst interval, IBI), and we compared it to the uniform model (Figures 3A and S3A), in which burst times are described by a Poisson process with an exponential distribution of IBIs. For four of five individual birds, the measured IBI distributions were consistent with the uniform model (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p > 0.28 for four birds), while the remaining bird (bird 2) showed a small deviation from uniformity (K-S test, p = 0.014, not significant after Bonferroni correction for five comparisons). A similar pattern of results was found with other measures of the IBI distribution focusing on the longest and shortest intervals (Figures 3B, 3C, S3B, and S3C). Bursts also were analyzed using a sensitive metric of clustering (Ripley’s-L), and were found to be consistent with the uniform model in four of five birds (Figure 3D; p > 0.32). A small but significant self-clustering of bursts was detected by the Ripley’s-L metric in one bird (Figure S3D; bird 2; p = 4.0e−4; 10% excess burst density in a 20-ms window compared to random burst placement). Thus, while largely consistent with a uniform distribution of burst times, these results reveal a small degree of non-uniformity that will be addressed further. We next wondered how these measures of burst distribution compare to the predictions of the GTE model. For each bird, a large number (104) of surrogate datasets was generated, in which bursts were placed around measured GTEs with a Gaussian distribution. For each bird, the width of this Gaussian distribution was chosen to reproduce the burst-to-GTE variance reported by Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar (average SD of 8 ms). In comparison to the uniform model, the GTE model predicts that bursts would cover a significantly lower fraction of the song (Figures 2B and S2A). It also predicts a larger number of short IBIs in the IBI distribution (Figures 3A, 3B, S3A, and S3B), due to the clustering of many bursts around a small number of GTEs, and a longer maximum IBI, due to the lack of bursts between GTEs (Figures 3C and S3C). The high degree of burst clustering in the GTE model was readily detected by the Ripley’s-L metric (Figures 3D and S3D). For all birds, the measured values of each of these metrics were inconsistent with the predictions of the GTE model (covered fraction: p ≤ 2e−4 in all birds; IBI: p ≤ 4e−4 in birds 1, 2, 3, and 5 and p ≤ 0.013 in bird 4; Ripley’s-L: p ≤ 5e−3 in all birds). The analyses described above, and shown in the main figures, were carried out with GTEs identified using the method described by Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D. Elemental gesture dynamics are encoded by song premotor cortical neurons.Nature. 2013; 495: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar (Figures S1F–S1I). These analyses also were repeated using a recently published method for automatic identification of GTEs (Boari et al., 2015Boari S. Perl Y.S. Amador A. Margoliash D. Mindlin G.B. Automatic reconstruction of physiological gestures used in a model of birdsong production.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). While these methods produced somewhat different GTE times (Figures S1A–S1E, S1J, and S1K), the data were inconsistent with the predictions of the GTE model using either set of GTEs (Figure S3H). HVC interneurons play a significant role in several models of sequence generation and learning in HVC (Amador et al., 2013Amador A. Perl Y.S. Mindlin G.B. Margoliash D.

Although elemental content of bone, blood and teeth of human and some animal species have been characterized, data for many others are lacking, as well as species comparisons. Here we describe the distribution of elements in horn (Bovidae), antler (Cervidae), teeth and bone (humerus) across a number of species determined by handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to better understand differences and potential biological relevance. A difference in elemental profiles between horns and antlers was observed, possibly due to the outer layer of horns being comprised of keratin, whereas antlers are true bone. Species differences in tissue elemental content may be intrinsic, but also related to feeding habits that contribute to mineral accumulation, particularly for toxic heavy metals. One significant finding was a higher level of iron (Fe) in the humerus bone of elephants compared to other species. This may be an adaptation of the hematopoietic system by distributing Fe throughout the bone rather than the marrow, as elephant humerus lacks a marrow cavity. We also conducted discriminant analysis and found XRF was capable of distinguishing samples from different species, with humerus bone being the best source for species discrimination. For example, we found a 79.2% correct prediction and success rate of 80% for classification between human and non-human humerus bone. These findings show that handheld XRF can serve as an effective tool for the biological study of elemental composition in mineralized tissue samples and may have a forensic application."
https://openalex.org/W2408299904,"The microbiome of plants is diverse, and like that of animals, is important for overall health and nutrient acquisition. In legumes and actinorhizal plants, a portion of essential nitrogen (N) is obtained through symbiosis with nodule-inhabiting, N2-fixing microorganisms. However, a variety of non-nodulating plant species can also thrive in natural, low-N settings. Some of these species may rely on endophytes, microorganisms that live within plants, to fix N2 gas into usable forms. Here we report the first direct evidence of N2 fixation in the early successional wild tree, Populus trichocarpa, a non-leguminous tree, from its native riparian habitat. In order to measure N2 fixation, surface-sterilized cuttings of wild poplar were assayed using both 15N2 incorporation and the commonly used acetylene reduction assay. The 15N label was incorporated at high levels in a subset of cuttings, suggesting a high level of N-fixation. Similarly, acetylene was reduced to ethylene in some samples. The microbiota of the cuttings was highly variable, both in numbers of cultured bacteria and in genetic diversity. Our results indicated that associative N2-fixation occurred within wild poplar and that a non-uniformity in the distribution of endophytic bacteria may explain the variability in N-fixation activity. These results point to the need for molecular studies to decipher the required microbial consortia and conditions for effective endophytic N2-fixation in trees."

When given the option, the majority of consumers prefer that decisions about GM food be taken out of their hands and be made by experts. After answering a list of questions testing objective knowledge of GM food, subjective, self-reported knowledge declines somewhat, and beliefs about GM food safety increase slightly. Results suggest that consumers think they know more than they actually do about GM food, and queries about GM facts cause respondents to reassess how much they know.

https://openalex.org/W2406377045,"Quantifying historical fire regimes provides important information for managing contemporary forests. Historical fire frequency and severity can be estimated using several methods; each method has strengths and weaknesses and presents challenges for interpretation and verification. Recent efforts to quantify the timing of historical high-severity fire events in forests of western North America have assumed that the “stand age” variable from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program reflects the timing of historical high-severity (i.e. stand-replacing) fire in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests. To test this assumption, we re-analyze the dataset used in a previous analysis, and compare information from fire history records with information from co-located FIA plots. We demonstrate that 1) the FIA stand age variable does not reflect the large range of individual tree ages in the FIA plots: older trees comprised more than 10% of pre-stand age basal area in 58% of plots analyzed and more than 30% of pre-stand age basal area in 32% of plots, and 2) recruitment events are not necessarily related to high-severity fire occurrence. Because the FIA stand age variable is estimated from a sample of tree ages within the tree size class containing a plurality of canopy trees in the plot, it does not necessarily include the oldest trees, especially in uneven-aged stands. Thus, the FIA stand age variable does not indicate whether the trees in the predominant size class established in response to severe fire, or established during the absence of fire. FIA stand age was not designed to measure the time since a stand-replacing disturbance. Quantification of historical “mixed-severity” fire regimes must be explicit about the spatial scale of high-severity fire effects, which is not possible using FIA stand age data."
https://openalex.org/W2407398900,"Polymer nanoparticles are vehicles used for delivery of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs, like doxorubicin, paclitaxel or chemopreventors like quercetin (Q). The present study deals with the synthesis and characterisation of nano formulations (NFs) from Q loaded PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) nano particles (NPs) by surface modification. The surface of Q-loaded (NPs) is modified by coating with biopolymers like bovine serum albumin (BSA) or histones (His). Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs adriamycin (ADR) and mitoxantrone (MTX) are bound to BSA and His respectively before being coated on Q-loaded NPs to nano formulate NF1 and NF2 respectively. The sizes of these NFs are in the range 400-500 nm as ascertained by SEM and DLS measurements. Encapsulation of Q in polymer NPs is confirmed from shifts in FT-IR, TGA and DSC traces of Q-loaded NPs compared to native PLGA and Q. Surface modification in NFs is evidenced by three distinct regions in their TEM images; the core, polymer capsule and the coated surface. Negative zeta potential of Q-loaded NPs shifted to positive potential on surface modification in NF1 and NF2. In vitro release of Q from the NFs lasted up to twenty days with an early burst release. NF2 is better formulation than NF1 as loading of MTX is 85% compared to 23% loading of ADR. Such NFs are expected to overcome multi-drug resistance (MDR) by reaching and treating the target cancerous cells by virtue of size, charge and retention."

In this study, we re-examined Swedish semi-natural grasslands 12-20 years after the restoration, by comparing field inventories of vascular plant species diversity made in 2001 with follow-up inventories in 2012. We also analysed restoration effect in relation to six environmental factors and used continuously managed semi-natural grasslands as references of desired state after restoration. We found that total species richness increased over time but not to reference levels, while there were no significant changes in species density or number of grassland specialists. However, the overall species composition in the restored sites, as well as grassland specialist composition, now largely resembled reference conditions. Fertilisation and time between abandonment and restoration were the only environmental variables that affected total species composition change, while site area affected change in grassland specialist composition. Our results show that restoration of semi-natural grasslands can contribute to conservation of semi-natural habitats and their associated biodiversity. Yet, due to the vague restoration goals for these sites, it is difficult to evaluate the restoration success, which emphasise the general need for clear and measurable goals."

However, uptake of IPT by national TB programs is low, and IPT delivery is a challenge in many resource-limited high TB-burden settings. Routinely collected program data was analyzed to determine the coverage and outcome of implementation of IPT for eligible under-five year old children in 28 health facilities in two regions of Ethiopia. A total of 504 index smear-positive pulmonary TB (SS+) cases were reported between October 2013 and June 2014 in the 28 health facilities. There were 282 under-five children registered as household contacts of these SS+ TB index cases, accounting for 17.9% of all household contacts. Of these, 237 (84%) were screened for TB symptoms, and presumptive TB was identified in 16 (6.8%) children. TB was confirmed in 5 children, producing an overall yield of 2.11% (95% confidence interval, 0.76–4.08%). Of 221 children eligible for IPT, 64.3% (142) received IPT, 80.3% (114) of whom successfully completed six months of therapy. No child developed active TB while on IPT. Contact screening is a good entry point for delivery of IPT to at risk children and should be routine practice as recommended by the WHO despite the implementation challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2404878335,"Codon adaptation is codon usage bias that results from selective pressure to increase the translation efficiency of a gene. Codon adaptation has been studied across a wide range of genomes and some early analyses of plastids have shown evidence for codon adaptation in a limited set of highly expressed plastid genes. Here we study codon usage bias across all fully sequenced plastid genomes which includes representatives of the Rhodophyta, Alveolata, Cryptophyta, Euglenozoa, Glaucocystophyceae, Rhizaria, Stramenopiles and numerous lineages within the Viridiplantae, including Chlorophyta and Embryophyta. We show evidence that codon adaptation occurs in all genomes except for two, Theileria parva and Heicosporidium sp., both of which have highly reduced gene contents and no photosynthesis genes. We also show evidence that selection for codon adaptation increases the representation of the same set of codons, which we refer to as the adaptive codons, across this wide range of taxa, which is probably due to common features descended from the initial endosymbiont. We use various measures to estimate the relative strength of selection in the different lineages and show that it appears to be fairly strong in certain Stramenopiles and Chlorophyta lineages but relatively weak in many members of the Rhodophyta, Euglenozoa and Embryophyta. Given these results we propose that codon adaptation in plastids is widespread and displays the same general features as adaptation in eubacterial genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2406475764,"Global changes are thought to affect most Arctic species, yet some populations are more at risk. Today, the Barents Sea ecoregion is suffering the strongest sea ice retreat ever measured; and these changes are suspected to modify food access and thus diet of several species. Biochemical diet tracers enable investigation of diet in species such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus). We examined individual diet variation of female polar bears in Svalbard, Norway, and related it to year, season (spring and autumn), sampling area and breeding status (solitary, with cubs of the year or yearlings). Sampling areas were split according to their ice cover: North-West (less sea ice cover), South-East (larger amplitude in sea ice extent) and North-East/South-West (NESW) as bears from that zone are more mobile among all regions of Svalbard. We measured fatty acid (FA) composition in adipose tissue and carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotopes in plasma and red blood cells. Females feeding in the North-West area had lower δ15N values than those from the NESW. In South-East females, δ13C values were lower in autumn compared to spring and females seemed less selective in their diet as depicted by large variances in stable isotope values. Considering the differences in FA composition and stable isotope values, we suggest that females from the North-West and South-East could ingest a higher proportion of avian prey. With regard to breeding status, solitary females had higher δ15N values and smaller variance in their stable isotopic values than females with cubs, suggesting that solitary females were more selective and prey on higher trophic level species (i.e. seals). Overall, our results indicate that prey availability for Svalbard polar bears varies according to geographical area and prey selectivity differs according to breeding status. Our findings suggest that complex changes in sea ice and prey availability will interact to affect Svalbard polar bear feeding patterns and associated nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2401755520,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been applied in numerous industrial products and personal care products like sunscreens and cosmetics. The released ZnO NPs from consumer and household products into the environment might pose potential health issues for animals and humans. In this study the expression of microRNAs and the correlations of microRNAs and their targeted genes in ZnO NPs treated chicken ovarian granulosa cells were investigated. ZnSO4 was used as the sole Zn2+ provider to differentiate the effects of NPs from Zn2+. It was found that ZnO-NP-5 μg/ml specifically regulated the expression of microRNAs involved in embryonic development although ZnO-NP-5 μg/ml and ZnSO4-10 μg/ml treatments produced the same intracellular Zn concentrations and resulted in similar cell growth inhibition. And ZnO-NP-5 μg/ml also specifically regulated the correlations of microRNAs and their targeted genes. This is the first investigation that intact NPs in ZnO-NP-5 μg/ml treatment specifically regulated the expression of microRNAs, and the correlations of microRNAs and their targeted genes compared to that by Zn2+. This expands our knowledge for biological effects of ZnO NPs and at the same time it raises the health concerns that ZnO NPs might adversely affect our biological systems, even the reproductive systems through regulation of specific signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2407708717,"Mutations in PLA2G6 were identified in patients with a spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions, such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), atypical late-onset neuroaxonal dystrophy (ANAD) and dystonia parkinsonism complex (DPC). However, there is no report on the genetic analysis of families with members affected with INAD, ANAD and DPC from India. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to perform genetic analysis of 22 Indian families with INAD, ANAD and DPC. DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding region of PLA2G6 identified 13 different mutations, including five novel ones (p.Leu224Pro, p.Asp283Asn, p.Arg329Cys, p.Leu491Phe, and p.Arg649His), in 12/22 (54.55%) families with INAD and ANAD. Interestingly, one patient with INAD was homozygous for two different mutations, p.Leu491Phe and p.Ala516Val, and thus harboured four mutant alleles. With these mutations, the total number of mutations in this gene reaches 129. The absence of mutations in 10/22 (45.45%) families suggests that the mutations could be in deep intronic or promoter regions of this gene or these families could have mutations in a yet to be identified gene. The present study increases the mutation landscape of PLA2G6. The present finding will be useful for genetic diagnosis, carrier detection and genetic counselling to families included in this study and other families with similar disease condition."
https://openalex.org/W2402859367,"Background The β-catenin signaling is important in cell growth and differentiation and is frequently dysregulated in various cancers. The most well-known mechanism of endocrine resistance is cross-talk between the estrogen receptor (ER) and other growth factor signaling, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated whether β-catenin could be a potential target to overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Methods We established tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cell line via long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to gradually increasing concentrations of tamoxifen. The levels of protein expression and mRNA transcripts were determined using western blot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR. The transcriptional activity of β-catenin was measured using luciferase activity assay. Results TamR cells showed a mesenchymal phenotype, and exhibited a relatively decreased expression of ER and increased expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor. We confirmed that the expression and transcriptional activity of β-catenin were increased in TamR cells compared with control cells. The expression and transcriptional activity of β-catenin were inhibited by β-catenin small-molecule inhibitor, ICG-001 or β-catenin siRNA. The viability of TamR cells, which showed no change after treatment with tamoxifen, was reduced by ICG-001 or β-catenin siRNA. The combination of ICG-001 and mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, yielded an additive effect on the inhibition of viability in TamR cells. Conclusion These results suggest that β-catenin plays a role in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, and the inhibition of β-catenin may be a potential target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2408737908,"Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sleep disorder with high prevalence among patients on hemodialysis. It has been postulated that high phosphate and high parathyroid hormone may be implicated in its pathogenesis. Standard international criteria and face-to-face interview are not always applied.this was an interventional prospective study in which 19 patients (6 men, aged 48±11 years) with severe hyperparathyroidism were evaluated. RLS diagnosis and rating scale were accessed based on the International RLS Study Group pre- and post-parathyroidectomy. Patients also underwent standard polysomnography.At baseline, RLS was present in 10 patients (52.6%), and pain was the most reported symptom associated with the diagnosis. Patients with RLS had higher serum phosphate (p = 0.008) that remained independently associated with RLS in a logistic regression model, adjusted for hemoglobin, age and gender (HR = 7.28;CI = 1.14-46.3, p = 0.035). After parathyroidectomy, there was a reduction of serum parathyroid hormone, phosphate, calcium and alkaline phosphatase, and an increase of 25(OH)-vitamin D, and Fetuin-A. Parathyroidectomy alleviated RLS (from 52% to 21%; p = 0.04), which was accompanied by a decrease in severity scale, in association with relief of pain and pruritus. Polysomnography in these patients showed an improvement of sleep parameters as measured by sleep efficiency, sleep latency and percentage of REM sleep.RLS is associated with high levels of phosphate in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on hemodialysis. Pain is most reported complain in these patients. Parathyroidectomy provided an opportunity to relief RLS. Whether the reduction of serum phosphorus or parathyroid hormone contributed to this improvement merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2403024681,"Inhibitors of poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARPis) show promise for treatment of cancers which lack capacity for homologous recombination repair (HRR). However, new therapeutic strategies are required in order to overcome innate and acquired resistance to these drugs and thus expand the array of cancers that could benefit from them. We show that human cancer cell lines which respond poorly to ABT-888 (a PARPi), become sensitive to it when co-treated with vorinostat (a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)). Vorinostat also sensitized PARPis insensitive cancer cell lines to 6-thioguanine (6-TG)-a drug that targets PARPis sensitive cells. The sensitizing effect of vorinostat was associated with increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α which in and of itself increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ABT-888. Importantly, these drug combinations did not affect survival of normal fibroblasts and breast cells, and significantly increased the inhibition of xenograft tumor growth relative to each drug alone, without affecting the mice weight or their liver and kidney function. Our results show that combination of vorinostat and ABT-888 could potentially prove useful for treatment of cancer with innate resistance to PARPis due to active HRR machinery, while the combination of vorinostat and 6-TG could potentially overcome innate or acquired resistance to PARPis due to secondary or reversal BRCA mutations, to decreased PARP-1 level or to increased expression of multiple drug resistant proteins. Importantly, drugs which increase phosphorylation of eIF2α may mimic the sensitizing effect of vorinostat on cellular response to PARPis or to 6-TG, without activating all of its downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2401947239,"Various pathological conditions are accompanied by ATP release from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment. Extracellular ATP (eATP) functions as a signaling molecule by activating purinergic P2 purine receptors. The key P2 receptor involved in inflammation was identified as P2X7R. Recent studies have shown that P2X7R signaling is required to trigger the Th1/Th17 immune response, and oxidized ATP (oxATP) effectively blocks P2X7R activation. In this study we investigated the effect of oxATP on mouse experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Our results demonstrated that induced EAU in B6 mice was almost completely abolished by the administration of small doses of oxATP, and the Th17 response, but not the Th1 response, was significantly weakened in the treated mice. Mechanistic studies showed that the therapeutic effects involve the functional change of a number of immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and regulatory T cells. OxATP not only directly inhibits the T cell response; it also suppresses T cell activation by altering the function of DCs and Foxp3+ T cell. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of P2X7R activation effectively exempts excessive autoimmune inflammation, which may indicate a possible therapeutic use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2403555502,"Objectives The most efficient approach to monitoring and improving cleaning outcomes remains unresolved. We sought to extend the findings of a previous study by determining whether cleaning thoroughness (dye removal) correlates with cleaning efficacy (absence of molecular or cultivable biomaterial) and whether one brief educational intervention improves cleaning outcomes. Design Before-after trial. Setting Newly built community hospital. Intervention 90 minute training refresher with surface-specific performance results. Methods Dye removal, measured by fluorescence, and biomaterial removal and acquisition, measured with culture and culture-independent PCR-based assays, were clandestinely assessed for eight consecutive months. At this midpoint, results were presented to the cleaning staff (intervention) and assessments continued for another eight consecutive months. Results 1273 surfaces were sampled before and after terminal room cleaning. In the short-term, dye removal increased from 40.3% to 50.0% (not significant). For the entire study period, dye removal also improved but not significantly. After the intervention, the number of rooms testing positive for specific pathogenic species by culturing decreased from 55.6% to 36.6% (not significant), and those testing positive by PCR fell from 80.6% to 53.7% (P = 0.016). For nonspecific biomaterial on surfaces: a) removal of cultivable Gram-negatives (GN) trended toward improvement (P = 0.056); b) removal of any cultivable growth was unchanged but acquisition (detection of biomaterial on post-cleaned surfaces that were contaminant-free before cleaning) worsened (P = 0.017); c) removal of PCR-based detection of bacterial DNA improved (P = 0.046), but acquisition worsened (P = 0.003); d) cleaning thoroughness and efficacy were not correlated. Conclusion At this facility, a minor intervention or minimally more aggressive cleaning may reduce pathogen-specific contamination, but not without unintended consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2397782965,"The Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Q-fly), is a major horticultural pest in Eastern Australia. Effective monitoring, male annihilation technique (MAT) and mass trapping (MT) are all important for control and require strong lures to attract flies to traps or toxicants. Lure strength is thought to be related in part to volatility, but little vapour pressure data are available for most Q-fly lures. Raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone) and analogs that had esters (acetyl, difluoroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, formyl, propionyl) and ethers (methyl ether, trimethylsilyl ether) in replacement of the phenolic group, and in one case also had modification of the 2-butanone side chain, were measured for their vapour pressures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and their attractiveness to Q-fly was assessed in small cage environmentally controlled laboratory bioassays. Maximum response of one category of compounds, containing both 2-butanone side chain and ester group was found to be higher than that of the other group of compounds, of which either of 2-butanone or ester functionality was modified. However, linear relationship between vapour pressure and maximum response was not significant. The results of this study indicate that, while volatility may be a factor in lure effectiveness, molecular structure is the dominating factor for the series of molecules investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2406191502,"Skeletal muscle injury causes a local sterile inflammatory response. In parallel, a state of immunosuppression develops distal to the site of tissue damage. Granulocytes and monocytes that are rapidly recruited to the site of injury contribute to tissue regeneration. In this study we used a mouse model of traumatic skeletal muscle injury to investigate the previously unknown role of dendritic cells (DCs) that accumulate in injured tissue. We injected the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into the skeletal muscle of injured or sham-treated mice to address the ability of these DCs in antigen uptake, migration, and specific T cell activation in the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN). Immature DC-like cells appeared in the skeletal muscle by 4 days after injury and subsequently acquired a mature phenotype, as indicated by increased expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. After the injection of OVA into the muscle, OVA-loaded DCs migrated into the pLN. The migration of DC-like cells from the injured muscle was enhanced in the presence of the microbial stimulus lipopolysaccharide at the site of antigen uptake and triggered an increased OVA-specific T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response in the pLN. Naïve OVA-loaded DCs were superior in Th1-like priming in the pLN when adoptively transferred into the skeletal muscle of injured mice, a finding indicating the relevance of the microenvironment in the regenerating skeletal muscle for increased Th1-like priming. These findings suggest that DC-like cells that accumulate in the regenerating muscle initiate a protective immune response upon microbial challenge and thereby overcome injury-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2398300723,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as important regulators of cardiac development, hypertrophy and fibrosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that genetic variations which cause alterations in miRNA:target interactions can lead to disease. We hypothesized that genetic variations in miRNAs that regulate cardiac hypertrophy/fibrosis might be involved in generation of the cardiac phenotype in patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To investigate this question, we Sanger sequenced 18 miRNA genes previously implicated in myocyte hypertrophy/fibrosis and apoptosis, using genomic DNA isolated from the leukocytes of 199 HCM patients. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6971711, C57T SNP) at the 17th position of mature miR-590-3p (= 57th position of pre-miR-590) that is common in individuals of African ancestry. SNP frequency was higher in African American HCM patients (n = 55) than ethnically-matched controls (n = 100), but the difference was not statistically significant (8.2% vs. 6.5%; p = 0.5). Using a cell culture system, we discovered that presence of this SNP resulted in markedly lower levels of mature miR-590-5p (39 ± 16%, p<0.003) and miR-590-3p (20 ± 2%, p<0.003), when compared with wild-type (WT) miR-590, without affecting levels of pri-miR-590 and pre-miR-590. Consistent with this finding, the SNP resulted in reduced target suppression when compared to WT miR-590 (71% suppression by WT vs 60% suppression by SNP, p<0.03). Since miR-590 can regulate TGF-β, Activin A and Akt signaling, SNP-induced reduction in miR-590 biogenesis could influence cardiac phenotype by de-repression of these signaling pathways. Since the SNP is only present in African Americans, population studies in this patient population would be valuable to investigate effects of this SNP on myocyte function and cardiac physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2406697854,"Aims There have been few studies on the disparities within the population with disabilities, especially in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in some health conditions among people with different types of disabilities in Shanghai. Methods This study was conducted using data from the Shanghai Disabled Persons’ Rehabilitation Comprehensive Information Platform. The records of 31,082 persons with disabilities who had undergone professional health examination were analyzed, and the prevalence and number of five diseases and five risk factors were examined. Logistic regression was used to explore disparities from two perspectives: 1) basic differences, unadjusted for other factors, and 2) differences after adjusting for key demographic covariates. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Individuals with visual disability had a high rate of refractive error (60.0%), and averaged 1.75 diseases of interest, which was the highest value among all disability types. The mean number of risk factors we measured was greatest (1.96) in the population with mental disability. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) between the hearing and speech impairment group and the other groups with respect to most health outcomes, except chronic pharyngitis, hepatic cysts, and high blood pressure. Conclusion Significant differences of selected health outcomes between groups with different types of disabilities remained after controlling for key demographic indicators. Further research is needed to explore the relationships between health conditions and disability types."
https://openalex.org/W2407171947,"Persimmon fruit are unique in accumulating proanthocyanidins (tannins) during development, which cause astringency in mature fruit. In 'Mopanshi' persimmon, astringency can be removed by treatment with 95% CO2, which increases the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde by glycolysis, and precipitates the soluble tannin. A TGA transcription factor, DkTGA1, belonging to the bZIP super family, was isolated from an RNA-seq database and real-time quantitative PCR indicated that DkTGA1 was up-regulated by CO2 treatment, in concert with the removal of astringency from persimmon fruit. Dual-luciferase assay revealed that DkTGA1 had a small (less than 2-fold), but significant effect on the promoters of de-astringency-related genes DkADH1, DkPDC2 and DkPDC3, which encode enzymes catalyzing formation of acetaldehyde and ethanol. A combination of DkTGA1 and a second transcription factor, DkERF9, shown previously to be related to de-astringency, showed additive effects on the activation of the DkPDC2 promoter. Yeast one-hybrid assay showed that DkERF9, but not DkTGA1, could bind to the DkPDC2 promoter. Thus, although DkTGA1 expression is positively associated with persimmon fruit de-astringency, trans-activation analyses with DkPDC2 indicates it is likely to act by binding indirectly DkPDC2 promoter, might with helps of DkERF9."
https://openalex.org/W2396594752,"Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA, OMIM 121050), also known as Beals-Hecht syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue. CCA is characterized by arachnodactyly, dolichostenomelia, pectus deformities, kyphoscoliosis, congenital contractures and a crumpled appearance of the helix of the ear. The aim of this study is to identify the genetic cause of a 4-generation Chinese family of Tujia ethnicity with congenital contractural arachnodactyly by exome sequencing. The clinical features of patients in this family are consistent with CCA. A novel missense mutation, c.3769T>C (p.C1257R), in the fibrillin 2 gene (FBN2) was identified responsible for the genetic cause of our family with CCA. The p.C1257R mutation occurs in the 19th calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domain. The amino acid residue cysteine in this domain is conserved among different species. Our findings suggest that exome sequencing is a powerful tool to discover mutation(s) in CCA. Our results may also provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of CCA, and may have implications for genetic counseling and clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W2408147900,"Several genera belonging to the nematode family Diplogastridae show characteristic dimorphism in their feeding structures; specifically, they have microbial feeding stenostomatous and predatory eurystomatous morphs. A diplogastrid satellite model species, Pristionchus pacificus, and its close relatives have become a model system for studying this phenotypic plasticity, with intensive physiological and structural studies having been undertaken. However, the many other species that are morphologically and phylogenetically divergent from P. pacificus have not been examined to date. In the present study, the detailed stomatal structure and induction of dimorphism in Neodiplogaster acaloleptae were examined. N. acaloleptae has a fungal feeding stenostomatous morph and a predatory eurystomatous morph. The predatory morph was induced by starvation, high population density, and co-culturing with its potential prey, Caenorhabditis elegans. The feeding behavior of the stenostomatous and eurystomatous morphs of N. acaloleptae was confirmed, demonstrating that 1) the stomatal and pharyngeal movements of the two morphs were basically identical, and 2) the stomatal elements were protracted to cut open the hyphae and/or prey to feed when a N. acaloleptae flips its dorsal movable tooth dorsally and tilts its subventral stegostomatal cylinder ventrally, forming a pair of scissors to cut the food source. The stoma morphology of N. acaloleptae with a single movable tooth and a long stoma is markedly different from that of Pristionchus, which has two movable teeth and a short stoma. It is, however, similar to that of Mononchoides, tentatively a sister to Neodiplogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2394853251,"Background Improvement in survival of patients with colon cancer is reduced in elderly patients compared to younger patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the removal of ≥ 12 lymph nodes can explain differences in survival rates between elderly and younger patients diagnosed with colon cancer. Methods In a population-based cohort study, all patients (N = 41,074) diagnosed with colon cancer stage I to III from 2003 through 2010 from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were included. Age groups were defined as < 66, 66–75 and > 75 years of age. Main outcome measures were overall and relative survival, the latter as a proxy for disease specific survival. Results Over an eight years time period there was a 41.2% increase in patients with ≥ 12 lymph nodes removed, whereas the percentage of patients with the presence of lymph node metastases remained stable (35.7% to 37.5%). After adjustment for patient and tumour characteristics and adjuvant chemotherapy, it was found that for patients in which ≥ 12 lymph nodes were removed compared to patients with < 12 lymph nodes removed, there was a statistically significant higher overall survival (< 66: HR: 0.858 (95% CI, 0.789–0.933); 66–75: HR: 0.763 (95% CI, 0.714–0.814); > 75: HR: 0.734 (95% CI, 0.700–0.771)) and relative survival (< 66: RER: 0.783 (95% CI, 0.708–0.865); 66–75: RER: 0.672 (95% CI, 0.611–0.739); > 75: RER: 0.621 (95% CI, 0.567–0.681)) in all three age groups. Conclusions The removal of ≥ 12 lymph nodes is associated with an improvement in both overall and relative survival in all patients. This association was stronger in the elderly patient. The biology of this association needs further clarification."

The infiltration of resin in a ceramic network under high pressure and high temperature defines a new class of hybrid materials, namely polymer infiltrated ceramics network (PICN), for this purpose which requires to be evaluated biologically. We used oral stem cells (gingival and pulpal) as an in vitro experimental model. Methods Four biomaterials were grinded, immersed in a culture medium and deposed on stem cells from dental pulp (DPSC) and gingiva (GSC): Enamic (VITA®), Experimental Hybrid Material (EHM), EHM with initiator (EHMi) and polymerized Z100™ composite material (3M®). After 7 days of incubation; viability, apoptosis, proliferation, cytoskeleton, inflammatory response and morphology were evaluated in vitro. Results Proliferation was insignificantly delayed by all the tested materials. Significant cytotoxicity was observed in presence of resin based composites (MTT assay), however no detectable apoptosis and some dead cells were detected like in PICN materials. Cell morphology, major cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix components were not altered. An intimate contact appeared between the materials and cells. Clinical Significance The three new tested biomaterials did not exhibit adverse effects on oral stem cells in our experimental conditions and may be an interesting alternative to ceramics or composite based CAD—CAM blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2401948163,"Sox9 plays an important role in a large variety of developmental pathways in vertebrates. It is composed of three domains: high-mobility group box (HMG box), dimerization (DIM) and transactivation (TAD). One of the main processes for regulation and variability of the pathways involving Sox9 is the self-gene expression regulation of Sox9. However, the subsequent roles of the Sox9 domains can also generate regulatory modulations. Studies have shown that TADs can bind to different types of proteins and its function seems to be influenced by DIM. Therefore, we hypothesized that both domains are directly associated and can be responsible for the functional variability of Sox9. We applied a method based on a broad phylogenetic context, using sequences of the HMG box domain, to ensure the homology of all the Sox9 copies used herein. The data obtained included 4,921 sequences relative to 657 metazoan species. Based on coevolutionary and selective pressure analyses of the Sox9 sequences, we observed coevolutions involving DIM and TADs. These data, along with the experimental data from literature, indicate a functional relationship between these domains. Moreover, DIM and TADs may be responsible for the functional plasticity of Sox9 because they are more tolerant for molecular changes (higher Ka/Ks ratio than the HMG box domain). This tolerance could allow a differential regulation of target genes or promote novel targets during transcriptional activation. In conclusion, we suggest that DIM and TADs functional association may regulate differentially the target genes or even promote novel targets during transcription activation mediated by Sox9 paralogs, contributing to the subfunctionalization of Sox9a and Sox9b in teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W2396004522,"Morphology and divisional morphogenesis of the hypotrich ciliate Apoamphisiella vernalis are investigated based on two populations from Brazil. Typical specimens of A. vernalis replicates its ventral ciliature from six fronto-ventral-transverse (FVT) anlagen independently formed for proter and opisthe, plus one or more short anlagen located between IV and V, which form surplus transverse cirri. Dorsal morphogenesis occurs as in typical oxytrichid dorsomarginalians, viz., with formation of three anlagen and fragmentation of the rightmost one. Dorsomarginal kineties are formed near anterior end of right marginal cirral row anlagen. Various anomalous specimens exhibiting more than two long ventral rows were found, which are explained by increasing the number of FVT anlagen and/or the number of cirri produced by anlagen. Comparative ontogeny and phylogenetic analyses based on the 18S rDNA reveal that Apoamphisiella vernalis is closely affine to North American and European strains of the Paraurostyla weissei complex. Their reduced genetic distances and conspicuous morphological variability show that both genera can overlap, which implies the necessity of re-evaluating the contextual relevance of some morphological characters commonly used for genus-level separation within hypotrich taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2398486918,"Objective This study aimed to explore whether a common variant in the FTO gene moderates the relationship between parental restriction and child BMI. Methods This study reports on baseline data from 178 parent-child (ages 9–10 years) dyads. Parents completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire and reported on socio-demographic characteristics. Each child’s height, weight and FTO rs9939609 genotype was assessed. Ordinary least squares regression was used to fit the child’s BMI-percentile on parental restriction and the child’s FTO genotype, adjusted for covariates. A likelihood ratio test was used to compare a model with and without a multiplicative interaction term between restriction and genotype. Results Most participants (93.3%) were white, non-Hispanic. Twenty-three percent of children were overweight/obese and FTO genotype was associated with weight status. Mean parental restriction was statistically higher among overweight/obese vs. normal weight children: 3.3 (SD 0.8) vs. 2.8 (SD 1.0); t-test p-value = 0.002. Parental restriction was positively associated with child BMI-percentile and BMI-z only among children with two copies of the high-risk FTO allele (p for interaction = 0.02), where each one-point increase in parental restriction was associated with a 14.7 increase in the child’s BMI-percentile or a 0.56-point increase in the child’s BMI z-score. Conclusion For only the children with two high-risk alleles, parental restriction was positively associated with child BMI-percentile."
https://openalex.org/W2408130274,"Tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can be dedifferentiated by repetitive insults, which activate scar-producing cells generated from interstitial cells such as fibroblasts, leading to the accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix molecules. The dedifferentiated TECs play a crucial role in the development of renal fibrosis. Therefore, renal fibrosis may be attenuated if dedifferentiated TECs are converted back to their normal state (re-epithelialization). However, the mechanism underlying the re-epithelialization remains to be elucidated. In the present study, TGF-β1, a profibrotic cytokine, induced dedifferentiation of cultured TECs, and the dedifferentiated TECs were re-epithelialized by the removal of TGF-β1 stimulation. In the re-epithelialization process, transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, beta (HNF-1β) was identified as a candidate molecule involved in inducing re-epithelialization by means of DNA microarray and biological network analysis. In functional validation studies, the re-epithelialization by TGF-β1 removal was abolished by HNF-1β knockdown. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of HNF-1β in the dedifferentiated TECs induced the re-epithelialization without the inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling, even in the presence of TGF-β1 stimulation. In mouse renal fibrosis model, unilateral ureteral obstruction model, HNF-1β expression in the TECs of the kidney was suppressed with fibrosis progression. Furthermore, the HNF-1β downregulated TECs resulted in dedifferentiation, which was characterized by expression of nestin. In conclusion, HNF-1β suppression in TECs is a crucial event for the dedifferentiation of TECs, and the upregulation of HNF-1β in TECs has a potential to restore the dedifferentiated TECs into their normal state, leading to the attenuation of renal fibrosis."

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the immune response, and their use as a vaccine vehicle is a promising strategy for enhancing vaccine efficacy. We evaluated the potential of DC-mediated immunization with a DNA vaccine consisting of HIV-1-p55gag (gag, group-specific antigen) associated to lysosomal associated protein (LAMP) sequence (LAMP/gag vaccine). Immunization of mice with mouse DCs transfected with LAMP/gag (Lg-mDCs) stimulated more potent B- and T-cell responses than naked DNA or DCs pulsed with inactivated HIV. Anti-Gag antibody levels were sustained for at least 3 mo after immunization, and recall T-cell responses were also strongly detected at this time point. Human DCs transfected with LAMP/gag (Lg-hDCs) were also activated and able to stimulate greater T-cell response than native gag-transfected DCs. Coculture between Lg-hDCs and T lymphocytes obtained from patients with HIV resulted in upregulation of CD38, CD69, HLA-DR, and granzyme B by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α production. These results indicate that the use of LAMP/gag-DC may be an efficient strategy for enhancing immune function in patients with HIV.—Lucas, C. G. D. O., Matassoli, F. L., Peçanha, L. M.
