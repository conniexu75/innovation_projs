https://openalex.org/W2019387053,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the mediators of mRNA degradation in the process of RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we describe a human biochemical system that recapitulates siRNA-mediated target RNA degradation. By using affinity-tagged siRNAs, we demonstrate that a single-stranded siRNA resides in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) together with eIF2C1 and/or eIF2C2 (human GERp95) Argonaute proteins. RISC is rapidly formed in HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract supplemented with 21 nt siRNA duplexes, but also by adding single-stranded antisense RNAs, which range in size between 19 and 29 nucleotides. Single-stranded antisense siRNAs are also effectively silencing genes in HeLa cells, especially when 5′-phosphorylated, and expand the repertoire of RNA reagents suitable for gene targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2098438673,"How ligand binding alters integrin conformation in outside-in signaling, and how inside-out signals alter integrin affinity for ligand, have been mysterious. We address this with electron microscopy, physicochemical measurements, mutational introduction of disulfides, and ligand binding to alphaVbeta3 and alphaIIbbeta3 integrins. We show that a highly bent integrin conformation is physiological and has low affinity for biological ligands. Addition of a high affinity ligand mimetic peptide or Mn(2+) results in a switchblade-like opening to an extended structure. An outward swing of the hybrid domain at its junction with the I-like domain shows conformational change within the headpiece that is linked to ligand binding. Breakage of a C-terminal clasp between the alpha and beta subunits enhances Mn(2+)-induced unbending and ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2093417734,"In Listeria monocytogenes, virulence genes are maximally expressed at 37 degrees C, almost silent at 30 degrees C and controlled by PrfA, a transcriptional activator whose expression is thermoregulated. Here, we show that the untranslated mRNA (UTR) preceding prfA, forms a secondary structure, which masks the ribosome binding region. Mutations predicted to destabilize this structure led to virulence gene expression and invasion of mammalian cells at 30 degrees C. Chemical probing, native gel electrophoresis, in vitro translation, and ""compensatory"" and ""increased stability"" mutations demonstrated that the UTR switches between a structure active at high temperatures, and another inactive at low temperatures. Strikingly, when the DNA corresponding to the UTR was fused to gfp in E. coli, bacteria became fluorescent at 37 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C. This mechanism of posttranscriptional thermoregulation may have important applications."
https://openalex.org/W2002590458,"Activation of the ligand binding function of integrin heterodimers requires transmission of an ""inside-out"" signal from their small intracellular segments to their large extracellular domains. The structure of the cytoplasmic domain of a prototypic integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) has been solved by NMR and reveals multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts within the membrane-proximal helices of its alpha and the beta cytoplasmic tails. The interface interactions are disrupted by point mutations or the cytoskeletal protein talin that are known to activate the receptor. These results provide a structural mechanism by which a handshake between the alpha and the beta cytoplasmic tails restrains the integrin in a resting state and unclasping of this interaction triggers the inside-out conformational signal that leads to receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1991039871,"In mammalian cultured cells, the cystine/glutamate exchange transport mediated by system xc− is important to maintain intracellular GSH levels. System xc− consists of two protein components, xCT and the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen. The activity of system xc− is induced by various stimuli, including electrophilic agents like diethyl maleate. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of xCT mRNA by diethyl maleate. The xCT gene consisted of twelve exons and sequence analysis identified four electrophile response element (EpRE)-like sequences between −230 and −1 in the 5′-flanking region, designated EpRE-1 to EpRE-4. To identify sequences mediating the constitutive and induced expression of xCT, a series of 5′-deletion mutants created from the 5′-flanking region were cloned into a luciferase reproter vector and transfected into BHK21 cells. The 5′-deletion analysis revealed that the sequence between −116 and −82 is essential for the basal expression and the sequence between −226 and −116 containing EpRE-1 is essential in response to diethyl maleate. Mutational analysis demonstrated that EpRE-1 is critically involved in the response to diethyl maleate. Other stress agents like arsenite, cadmium, and hydroquinone seemed to induce system xc−activity via the same sequence. Furthermore, the experiments using the mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the Nrf2-deficient mice revealed that the induction of xCT gene by electrophilic agents is mediated by Nrf2. EpRE occurs in a broad spectrum of genes for the proteins that are involved in the defense against xenobiotics and regulates their expression. The present results have demonstrated that xCT is a novel member of this protein family.

The present results have demonstrated that xCT is a novel member of this protein family. GSH plays a prominent role in a cellular defense against reactive oxygen species and electrophiles. In mammalian cultured cells, we have previously characterized an anionic amino acid transport system, designated system xc−, which mediates cystine influx coupled with the efflux of intracellular glutamate (1Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Google Scholar, 2Watanabe H. Bannai S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 628-640Google Scholar). The intracellular GSH levels rapidly decrease by inhibiting the transport of cystine or depleting cystine from the culture medium (3Cho Y. Bannai S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2091-2097Google Scholar). Therefore, this cystine/glutamate exchange transporter contributes to the maintenance of intracellular GSH levels (4Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Google Scholar). The activity of system xc− is significantly induced by various stimuli, including diethyl maleate (DEM), 1The abbreviations used are: DEM, diethyl maleate; 4F2hc, 4F2 heavy chain; EpRE, electrophile response element; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; γ-GCS, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.1The abbreviations used are: DEM, diethyl maleate; 4F2hc, 4F2 heavy chain; EpRE, electrophile response element; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; γ-GCS, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. arsenite, cadmium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and TNF-α1 in mouse peritoneal macrophages (5Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 175-179Google Scholar, 6Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Google Scholar). Concomitantly, intracellular GSH levels are increased, suggesting that system xc− is fallen into the category of the stress proteins that are required for the metabolic response to oxidative stress. System xc− is composed of two proteins, xCT and the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) (7Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Google Scholar). 4F2hc is predicted to have a single transmembrane domain and has been recently demonstrated to be the common component of some amino acid transporters such as systems L and y+L for the functional membrane expression of the counterpart protein components (8Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kühn L.C. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 503-512Google Scholar). xCT has 12 putative transmembrane domains, suggesting that xCT itself mediates the transport activity.There is a family of enzymes called phase II detoxifying enzymes, which function as intracellular detoxication systems for mutagens, carcinogens, and other toxic compounds. The genes of these enzymes contain the cis-acting element, designated as electrophile response element (EpRE), also referred as antioxidant responsive element, responsible for the induction by electrophilic agents (9Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Google Scholar, 10Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Google Scholar, 11Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the presence of a core sequence of 5′-RTGACnnnGC-3′ was necessary for an EpRE to be functional (12Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickeet C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Google Scholar). Recently, Wasserman and Fahl (13Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Google Scholar) have identified the additional sequence necessary to define a sufficient and functional EpRE. The Nrf2 has been demonstrated to be an essential transcription factor for the expression of genes encoding the phase II enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase and glutathioneS-transferase, by the electrophilic agents (14Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Google Scholar). When cells are treated with electrophilic agents, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, binds to EpRE in the presence of small Maf, another transcription factor, and up-regulates EpRE-mediated transcription (15Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that in the macrophages derived from Nrf2-deficient mice the activity of system xc− was not induced by the electrophilic and oxidative stress agents, although promoter sequences for xCT were not known at that time (16Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Google Scholar). It is highly likely that the induction of xCT mRNA by electrophilic agents is mediated via EpRE. In the present study, the gene for xCT has been isolated, and the function of 5′-flanking region of the gene has been analyzed. The data indicate that several EpRE-like sequences exist in the 5′-flanking region of xCT gene and that various electrophilic agents induce the expression of xCT mRNA via one of these sequences.RESULTSWe investigated whether the activity of system xc− occurs in BHK21 cells and is induced by electrophilic agents. Untreated cells significantly took up cystine, and the activity of cystine transport was further increased by treating the cells with sodium arsenite, CdCl2, DEM, and hydroquinone (Fig. 1). These agents caused the maximum induction of the activity of cystine transport at the concentrations employed (data not shown). On the other hand, sodium arsenate and zinc chloride had no effects on the activity of system xc−. Although the activity of system xc− is induced by phorbol myristate acetate, lipopolysaccharide, and TNF-α in the mouse peritoneal macrophages (6Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Google Scholar), these reagents had no effect on the activity of cystine transport in BHK21 cells. The cystine transport was strongly inhibited by glutamate and homocysteate but to a lesser extent by aspartate (Fig.2). Arginine and leucine were not inhibitory at all. In the cells treated with DEM, the pattern of the inhibition of the cystine transport was similar to that in untreated cells. From these results, we have concluded that the transport activity with the characteristics of system xc− is expressed in BHK21 cells and that the activity of system xc− is induced by DEM in these cells. Fig. 3 shows the expression of xCT and 4F2hc mRNAs in the cells cultured with DEM. The expression of xCT mRNA was strongly induced by DEM, whereas 4F2hc mRNA was relatively constant regardless of the presence of DEM. Intracellular cysteine levels were measured in these cells cultured with the stress agents. As shown in Fig.4 A, intracellular cysteine levels were increased concomitantly with the increase in the cystine transport activity in the cells treated with the stress agents. In these cells, intracellular GSH levels were also increased (Fig.4 B).Figure 2Effects of various amino acids on the uptake of cystine in BHK21 cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h after plating. Then, the cells were further incubated with or without 100 μm DEM for 12 h.

Then, the cells were further incubated with 2.5 μm sodium arsenite (As), 10 μm CdCl2 (Cd), 100 μm DEM, and 25 μm hydroquinone (HQ) for 12 h, and intracellular cysteine and GSH levels were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the means ± S.D. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To characterize the genomic organization of the xCT gene, we screened the 129 SVJ mouse genome library by using digoxigenin-labeled mouse xCT cDNA as a probe, and 12 clones were isolated. Their inserts were further analyzed by restriction mapping, subcloning, and sequencing. The exon/intron organization of the mouse xCT gene is shown in Fig. 5 A. The gene was encoded by 12 exons that were distributed over a region of more than 40 kbp of genomic DNA. The transcription initiation site was determined by 5′-RACE and the primer extension method (Fig. 5 B). Four EpRE-like sequences were found and designated EpRE-1 to -4 (21Erickson A.M. Nevarea Z. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30730-30737Google Scholar). Thus, a series of 5′-deletion mutant/luciferase reporter fusion genes were generated by cloning various length of restriction fragments or PCR products into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic, to localize the regions controlling basal and DEM-inducible expression of the xCT gene (Fig. 5 B). These constructs were transiently transfected into BHK21 cells, and luciferase activity was determined in the presence and absence of DEM. The results of the 5′-deletion studies indicated that the sequence between −226 and −117 including EpRE-1 contained the regulatory element responsible for maximum DEM-inducible expression and the sequence between −116 and −82 regulated the basal expression (Fig. 6). To confirm that EpRE-1 influences response to DEM, the constructs containing mutations in this sequence were made and these constructs were transfected into BHK21 cells followed by treatment of DEM (Fig.7). Although the basal luciferase activity was detected in the cells transfected with the constructs containing the mutations, the effect of DEM was significantly decreased. The results indicate that EpRE-1 is mainly involved in the response to DEM. The effects of the EpREs on the induction of xCT by various stress agents were investigated. As shown in Fig.8, the luciferase activity was significantly increased in the cells trasnfected with the pGL3–0.7 followed by the treatment of arsenite, cadmium chloride, or hydroquinone.Figure 5Genomic organization of the mouse xCT gene. A, the location of exons was shown byclosed bars. The length of intron between exons 7 and 8 was not determined, although it was predicted to be more than 7 kbp.B, the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of xCT gene was shown.

The cells were then incubated with 2.5 μmsodium arsenite (As), 10 μm CdCl2(Cd), 100 μm DEM, and 25 μmhydroquinone (HQ) for 12 h, and the luciferase activities were measured. Values represent the means ± S.D. (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The electrophiles like DEM are known as the substrate of glutathioneS-transferase and thus may cause GSH depletion. To investigate the effect of GSH depletion on the induction of system xc−, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), was added to BHK21 cells. As shown in Fig.9 A, intracellular GSH level was drastically decreased in the cells treated with BSO. However, the activity of cystine transport remained unchanged compared with that in the control cell (Fig. 9 B). The luciferase activity also remained unchanged in the cells transfected with pGL3–0.7 followed by the treatment of BSO (Fig. 9 C). These results suggested that the decrease in the intracellular GSH does not cause the induction of the activity of cystine transport.Figure 9Effect of BSO on the activity of cystine transport, intracellular GSH, and luciferase activity in BHK21 cell. BHK21 cells were incubated for 24 h after plating, then the cells were further incubated for 12 h with 100 μm BSO or 100 μm DEM. The activities of cystine transport (A) and intracellular GSH (B) were measured. For measuring the luciferase activity (C), the cells were incubated for 24 h after plating, transfected with pGL3–0.23, and further incubated for 24 h. Then, 100 μm BSO or 100 μm DEM was added, and the luciferase activity was measured after 12 h. Values represent the means ± S.D. (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We have investigated whether Nrf2 is involved in the up-regulation of xCT gene expression by DEM. As shown in Fig.10 A, system xc− activity was not induced at all by DEM in the embryonic fibroblasts derived from Nrf2-deficinet mice. Then the expression of the reporter gene in these cells was examined. The cells were transfected with pGL3–0.23, treated with DEM, and the luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 10 B). In the control cells (wild type), the luciferase activity was increased by DEM treatment in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the luciferase activity in the Nrf2-deficient cells remained unchanged by DEM treatment at the concentration of up to 50 μm. In the Nrf2-deficient cells, treatment of DEM at the concentration of higher than 100 μm caused profound cell damage. The effect of DEM on nuclear distribution of Nrf2 has been investigated in the wild type cells. As shown in Fig. 10 C, Nrf2 in the nucleus was significantly increased by treating the cells with DEM, suggesting that Nrf2 moved into the nucleus to increase the expression of xCT gene in these cells. Next, the wild type cells were co-transfected with the Nrf2 expression plasmid and the pGL3 reporter plasmids, and luciferase activity was measured. The luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the Nrf2 expression plasmid and pGL3–0.23 was increased in proportion to the dose of the Nrf2 expression plasmid despite absence of DEM (Fig. 10 D). On the other hand, in the cells transfected with the Nrf2 expression plasmid and pGL3–0.12 or pGL3–0.08, the luciferase activity did not increase regardless of the dose of the Nrf2 expression plasmid. It is highly likely that overexpression of Nrf2 causes the movement of Nrf2 into the nucleus without the electrophilic agent. These results suggest that the movement of Nrf2 into the nucleus is crucial to the induction of xCT gene.Figure 10Involvement of Nrf2 in the transcriptional regulation of xCT gene. A, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice (Wild type) and Nrf2-deficient mice (KO) were incubated for 24 h after plating, and the cells were further incubated for 12 h with DEM at the concentrations indicated. Then, the activity of cystine transport was measured. B, the cells were incubated for 24 h after plating, transfected with pGL3–0.23, and further incubated for 24 h. Then, the cells were incubated for 12 h with DEM at the concentrations indicated, and luciferase activity was measured. C, the embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice were incubated for 24 h after plating and further incubated for 6 h with or without 100–200 μm DEM. The nuclear extract was prepared from the cells, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-Nrf2 antibody. D, the embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice were co-transfected with the Nrf2 expression plasmid of the amount indicated and pGL3–0.08 (●), pGL3–0.12 (▵), or pGL3–0.23 (○). After incubating for 24 h, the luciferase activity was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have found that the expression of xCT, but not 4F2hc, is strongly induced by DEM in BHK21 cells and that there are several EpRE-like sequences in the 5′-flanking region of xCT gene. We have demonstrated that the induction of xCT gene by DEM is mediated by these sequences. EpREs have been found in the promoter regions of various genes, e.g. those encoding glutathioneS-transferase, NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase, the heavy and light subunits of γ-GCS, ferritin L subunit, metallothionein-1, and thioredoxin (9Rushmore T.H.

Yamamoto M. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18399-18406Google Scholar). The common function of these proteins is for cell defense against xenobiotics and oxidants. System xc− mediates transport of cystine into the cells, and as shown here in BHK21 cells and in other cells previously, the intracellular GSH levels are regulated by the activity of this transport system (4Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Google Scholar). Since GSH is a key substance in antioxidant defense, the protein component of system xc−, xCT, is deemed to be a member in the cell defense system. Therefore, it is reasonable that the expression of xCT is regulated through EpRE.Recently, Erickson et al. (21Erickson A.M. Nevarea Z. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30730-30737Google Scholar) have investigated the promoter of the human γ-GCS modifier subunit gene in detail and proposed that the consensus sequence for the EpRE should be revised to 5′-RTKAYnnnGCR-3′. EpRE-1 has a single nucleotide mismatch at −142, compared with the consensus EpRE proposed by them. The enhancement of the luciferase activity by DEM was significantly decreased in the cells transfected with pGL3–0.12, which does not contain EpRE-1 (Fig. 6). In addition, the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the constructs containing mutations in EpRE-1 was significantly decreased (Fig. 7). EpRE-1 is completely conserved in the 5′-flanking region of the human xCT gene (26Sato H. Tamba M. Kuriyama-Matsumura Okuno S. Bannai S. Antioxid. Redox Signaling. 2000; 2: 665-671Google Scholar). Judging from these, the main region responsible for the DEM-inducible transcription is probably EpRE-1. EpRE-2 has two nucleotide mismatches at −120 and −116, compared with the consensus EpRE proposed by Erickson et al. (21Erickson A.M. Nevarea Z. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30730-30737Google Scholar). The luciferase activities in the cells transfected with the constructs containing the mutations in EpRE-1 were significantly decreased despite the treatment with DEM. In the 5′-flanking region of human xCT gene, EpRE-2 is deficient. It is unlikely that EpRE-2 contributes to DEM-inducible transcription of xCT gene by itself. EpRE-3 completely matches the consensus EpRE proposed by Erickson et al.(21Erickson A.M. Nevarea Z. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30730-30737Google Scholar), whereas EpRE-4 has two nucleotide mismatches. EpRE-3 is completely conserved in the 5′-flanking region of human xCT gene, whereas EpRE-4 is not completely conserved in the human xCT gene. However, the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pGL3–0.08, which contains EpRE-3 and -4, was negligible irrespective of the treatment with DEM. Thus, EpRE-3 and -4 by themselves do not contribute to the DEM-inducible transcription of xCT gene. The luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the constructs containing the mutations in EpRE-1 increased slightly but significantly by treatment with DEM. These results suggest that other EpREs, particularly EpRE-3, may contirubute to the enhancement of the DEM-inducible transcription in cooperation with EpRE-1.Recently, Itoh et al. (15Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Keap 1, the cytosolic protein, interacts with Nrf2 to form a complex in the cytosol and that DEM causes the dissociation of the complex and then Nrf2 moves into the nucleus to enhance the EpRE-mediated transcription of the genes in cooperation with small Maf protein. In the present study, Nrf2 has been demonstrated to mediate the induction of the transcriptional activity of xCT gene by DEM via the EpRE. DEM probably plays a role in dissociation of Nrf2-Keap 1 complex, because the overexpression of Nrf2 enhances the transcription of xCT gene even in the absence of DEM (Fig.10 D).In the present study, we have demonstrated that the intracellular cysteine levels are increased in BHK21 cells when they are treated with the stress agents. Most probably this increase is accounted for by the induction of system xc− activity as shown previously in other cells (27Bannai S. Ishii T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 265-272Google Scholar). The concentration of the cysteine in the cells untreated and treated with DEM can be estimated to be ∼0.1 and 0.3 mm, respectively, assuming that 1 mg of cell protein is equivalent to 5 μl of cell water (28Sato H. Watanabe H. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13015-13019Google Scholar). γ-GCS is known to catalyze the rate-limiting step in synthesis of GSH, and its apparentK m value for cysteine is reported to be 0.35 mm (29Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of GSH synthesis in BHK21 cells treated with DEM is much higher than that in the control cells even if γ-GCS per se remains unchanged. Mulcahy et al.(22Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Google Scholar, 23Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the EpREs in the 5′-flanking regions of the genes encoding γ-GCS heavy and light subunits regulate the expression of these genes in the cells treated with β-naphtoflavone, an electrophilic agent, which induces phase II enzymes. In the cells treated with DEM, both the increase in intracellular cysteine levels caused by the induction of the activity of system xc− and the induction of γ-GCS seem to contribute to the increase in GSH synthesis. GSH plays a prominent role in a cellular defense against reactive oxygen species and electrophiles. In mammalian cultured cells, we have previously characterized an anionic amino acid transport system, designated system xc−, which mediates cystine influx coupled with the efflux of intracellular glutamate (1Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Google Scholar, 2Watanabe H. Bannai S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 628-640Google Scholar). The intracellular GSH levels rapidly decrease by inhibiting the transport of cystine or depleting cystine from the culture medium (3Cho Y. Bannai S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2091-2097Google Scholar). Therefore, this cystine/glutamate exchange transporter contributes to the maintenance of intracellular GSH levels (4Bannai S. Tateishi N. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 89: 1-8Google Scholar). The activity of system xc− is significantly induced by various stimuli, including diethyl maleate (DEM), 1The abbreviations used are: DEM, diethyl maleate; 4F2hc, 4F2 heavy chain; EpRE, electrophile response element; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; γ-GCS, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.1The abbreviations used are: DEM, diethyl maleate; 4F2hc, 4F2 heavy chain; EpRE, electrophile response element; Nrf2, NF-E2-related factor 2; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; γ-GCS, γ"

In this study we show that the PpsR repressor from Rhodobacter sphaeroides binds to DNA in a redox-dependent manner through the formation/breakage of an intramolecular disulfide bond. We also demonstrate that PpsR is antagonized by the flavin-containing antirepressor, AppA, that is capable of breaking the disulfide bond in oxidized PpsR as well as forming a stable AppA-PpsR(2) antirepressor-repressor complex. Blue light excitation of AppA induces a photocycle that is characterized by a long-lived red-shifted absorbance of the flavin. Light-excited AppA was found to be incapable of forming the AppA-PpsR(2) antirepressor complex. These results establish AppA as a transcription factor that controls both redox and blue light repression of photosystem gene expression by mediating DNA binding activity of PpsR."
https://openalex.org/W47559429,"A major determinant of specific connectivity in the central nervous system is that synapses made by distinct afferent populations are restricted to particular laminae in their target area. We identify Sidekick (Sdk)-1 and -2, homologous transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules that mediate homophilic adhesion in vitro and direct laminar targeting of neurites in vivo. sdk-1 and -2 are expressed by nonoverlapping subsets of retinal neurons; each sdk is expressed by presynaptic (amacrine and bipolar) and postsynaptic (ganglion) cells that project to common inner plexiform (synaptic) sublaminae. Sdk proteins are concentrated at synaptic sites, and Sdk-positive synapses are restricted to the 2 (of > or =10) sublaminae to which sdk-expressing cells project. Ectopic expression of Sdk in Sdk-negative cells redirects their processes to a Sdk-positive sublamina. These results implicate Sdks as determinants of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1977059850,We report the observation of a phase of phospholipid that contains a structure similar to the commonly postulated interbilayer state that is crucial to membrane fusion. The widely accepted model for membrane fusion suggests that there is an intermediate state in which the two contacting monolayers become continuous via an hourglass-shaped structure called a stalk. Many efforts have been made to estimate the free energy for such a state in order to understand the functionality of membrane fusion proteins and to define key parameters in energy estimates. The observation of the stalk structure supports the stalk hypothesis for membrane fusion and enables the measurement of these parameters experimentally.
https://openalex.org/W1967387547,"Striated muscle-specific disruption of the dystroglycan (DAG1) gene results in loss of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in differentiated muscle and a remarkably mild muscular dystrophy with hypertrophy and without tissue fibrosis. We find that satellite cells, expressing dystroglycan, support continued efficient regeneration of skeletal muscle along with transient expression of dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers. We demonstrate a similar phenomenon of reexpression of functional dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers in a mild form of human muscular dystrophy caused by disruption of posttranslational dystroglycan processing. Thus, maintenance of regenerative capacity by satellite cells expressing dystroglycan is likely responsible for mild disease progression in mice and possibly humans. Therefore, inadequate repair of skeletal muscle by satellite cells represents an important mechanism affecting the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2084212780,"The mechanism by which disruption of reading frame can influence pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing is poorly understood. We assessed the role of factors essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS) with the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of rent1/hUpf1 expression abrogated both NMD and NAS of nonsense T cell receptor beta transcripts. In contrast, inhibition of rent2/hUpf2 expression did not disrupt NAS despite achieving comparable stabilization of nonsense transcripts. We also demonstrate that NAS and NMD are genetically separable functions of rent1/hUpf1. Additionally, rent1/hUpf1 enters the nucleus where it may directly influence early events in mRNA biogenesis. This provides compelling evidence that NAS relies on a component of the nonsense surveillance machinery but is not an indirect consequence of NMD."
https://openalex.org/W1990689709,"Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) is a key regulator of the Arp2/3 complex and the actin cytoskeleton in hematopoietic cells. WASp is capable of forming an auto-inhibited conformation, which can be disrupted by binding of Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, leading to its activation. Stimulation of the collagen receptor on platelets and crosslinking the B-cell receptor induce tyrosine phosphorylation of WASp. Here we show that the Src family kinase Hck induces phosphorylation of WASp-Tyr291 independently of Cdc42 and that this causes a shift in the mobility of WASp upon SDS-PAGE. A phospho-mimicking mutant, WASp-Y291E, exhibited an enhanced ability to stimulate actin polymerization in a cell-free system and when microinjected into primary macrophages induced extensive filopodium formation with greater efficiency than wild-type WASp or a Y291F mutant. We propose that phosphorylation of Tyr291directly regulates WASp function."
https://openalex.org/W2042113277,"The goals of this study were 2-fold: 1) to determine whether stimulation of Eph B4 receptors promotes microvascular endothelial cell migration and/or proliferation, and 2) to elucidate signaling pathways involved in these responses. The human endothelial cells used possessed abundant Eph B4 receptors with no endogenous ephrin B2 expression. Stimulation of these receptors with ephrin B2/Fc chimera resulted in dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. These responses were inhibited by LY294002 and ML-9, blockers of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, respectively. Eph B4 receptor activation increased proliferation by 38%, which was prevented by prior blockade with LY294002, ML-9, and inhibitors of protein kinase G (KT5823) and MEK (PD98059). Nitrite levels increased over 170% after Eph B4 stimulation, indicating increased nitric oxide production. Signaling of endothelial cell proliferation appears to be mediated by a PI3K/Akt/endothelial nitric-oxide synthase/protein kinase G/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Stimulation with ephrin B2 also increased migration by 63%versus controls. This effect was inhibited by blockade with PP2 (Src inhibitor), LY294002 or ML-9 but was unaffected by the PKG and MEK blockers. Eph B4 receptor stimulation increased activation of both matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. The results from these studies indicate that Eph B4 stimulates migration and proliferation and may play a role in angiogenesis.

Eph B4 receptor stimulation increased activation of both matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. The results from these studies indicate that Eph B4 stimulates migration and proliferation and may play a role in angiogenesis. Eph receptors are a family of 14 receptor tyrosine kinases, first noted in the nervous system (1Frisen J. Holmberg J. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). They all possess an N-terminal globular domain, which folds into a compact β-sandwich and is necessary for ligand binding (1Frisen J. Holmberg J. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ligands for the Eph receptors are arranged into two families based upon their attachment to the plasma membrane. Class A ephrins are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphoinositide anchor. Class B ephrins are transmembrane proteins. Whereas ephrin ligands are insoluble in their natural state, soluble chimeric ephrin B2 ligands are commercially available to use as a tool to probe downstream signaling pathways. A role for ephrins in vascular growth and remodeling was first noted when gene knockout studies of Eph B4 or its ligand ephrin B2 resulted in embryonic lethality due to cardiovascular defects (2Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,3Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). These malformations involved disrupted angiogenesis of the yolk sac manifested as an apparent block in capillary plexus remodeling. There was limited ingrowth of capillaries into the neural tube, as well as defective interactions between endothelial and supporting cells in mutant mice (3Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Additionally, work in Xenopus laevis using dominant negative Eph B4 receptors or missense expression of ephrin B1 or ephrin B2 demonstrated that interactions between Eph B4 and ephrin ligands are critical regulators of embryonic angiogenesis (4Helbling P.M. Saulnier D.M. Brandli A.W. Development. 2000; 127: 269-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the initial studies on knockout mice andXenopus, much work has been done to determine cellular interactions of ephrins with one another (2Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P., St John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar) and with other known signaling components (6Huynh-Do U. Stein E. Lane A.A. Liu H. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kalo M.S. Pasquale E.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 1-9Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of some Eph receptors promotes tube formation in renal endothelial cells but not in umbilical vein endothelial cells, suggesting that Eph receptor activation is specific for different types of endothelial cells (5Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P., St John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar). Although much work has been done to determine phosphorylation sites for the Eph receptors (8Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), downstream signaling events resulting from receptor activation have received less attention. In this study, we first determined whether Eph receptors were present on human mesentery vascular endothelial cells. Once we concluded that these cells possess abundant Eph B4 receptors, we hypothesized that stimulation of Eph B4 receptors with ephrin B2 would result in activation of either the migration or proliferation phase of angiogenesis. Finally, we sought to examine the signaling pathways regulating these angiogenic events. Human microvascular endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion of blood vessels taken from the mesentery of the small bowel and cloned by limiting dilution (designated MM1 cells). Endothelial cell identity was verified by positive staining for factor VIII-related antigen. Cells are grown in gelatin-coated dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 30 mm HEPES buffer, 25 IU/ml heparin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. After the cells reach 80–90% confluence, they are passaged with the use of 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Starvation medium contains all of the above ingredients except 0.1% bovine serum albumin instead of fetal bovine serum. The following pharmacological inhibitors were used to complete these studies: PP2, 1 μm, Src inhibitor, Calbiochem; KT5823, 1 μmprotein kinase G inhibitor, Calbiochem; LY294002, 3 μm, PI3K 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKG, protein kinase G; MMP. matrix metalloproteinase, MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PMT, photomultiplier tube; DAN, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene; NAT, 2,3-naphthotriazole; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DD-H2O, double-distilled water; n.s., not significant inhibitor, Calbiochem; ML-9, 100 μm, Akt inhibitor, Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); PD98059, 10 μm, MEK inhibitor, Calbiochem; MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor, 1 μm, Calbiochem; and farnesyltransferase III, 1 μm, Ras inhibitor,Calbiochem. Western blotting was conducted to determine whether MM1 cells (passage 12–18) expressed either Eph B4 receptor or ephrin B2 ligand or both. Cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed, and 50 μg of protein was separated on a 4–12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and membranes were blocked with Super Block (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, membranes were probed with primary antibodies (5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to either Eph B4 receptor or ephrin B2 ligand for 2 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat secondary antibodies, respectively, were applied at a 1:10,000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumniGlo, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) using Kodak BioMax ML film and scanned into the computer using reflectance scanning. Intensity of the bands was quantified using NIH Image. To determine the optimal concentration and time course for Eph B4 receptor activation, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments were performed. To conduct these experiments, 60-mm dishes (passage 12–16) were used after exposure to 0, 1, 25, 50, or 100 nm ephrin B2/Fc ligand (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 15 min. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; 1 mmNa3VO4; 1 mm NaF; 0.1% SDS) was applied. Cells were scraped from dishes and placed into Eppendorf tubes for sonication and centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the standard BCA protocol (Bio-Rad). Protein (150 μg), 20 μl of protein A/G Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and an appropriate volume of a solution containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were mixed to a final volume of 400 μl. The tubes were allowed to incubate with rocking for 1 h at 25 °C. The tubes were then spun down for 5 min at 14,000 ×g, and the supernatant was collected, and 5 μg of PKB/Akt antibody was added and allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature with rocking. Another 20 μl of protein A/G Plus was then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The following day, beads were spun down and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl). Beads were boiled in sample buffer, and released protein was loaded and separated on 4–12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked with SuperBlock with 0.05% Tween 20 (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Immunodetection of phosphorylated proteins was achieved by using phospho-PKB/Akt (serine 473, 5 μg/ml, Cell Signaling) antibody added to the membrane and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with rocking. After washing for 20 min with a wash solution (KPL Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, a rabbit anti-goat horseradish-peroxide conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, dilution of 1:10,000) was applied for 1 h at 25 °C with rocking, followed by washing for another 20 min. Immunoreactive bands were observed by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumniGlo, Cell Signaling). Images of the bands were scanned into the computer, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using NIH Image. Once the optimal dose was determined to be 50 nm ephrin B2/Fc chimera, this dose was used to determine the time course of receptor activation. Experiments were conducted at 0, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min using the same procedures as above. Western blots to evaluate phosphorylation states of MAP kinase (phospho-p42/44,1:1000, ERK1/2, Cell Signaling) or Src (phospho-Src-416,1:1000, Cell Signaling) were done as above with stimulation of 50 nm ephrin B2 for 0, 3, 5, 15, or 30 min. Some dishes also received KT5823 (protein kinase G inhibitor, Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to stimulation with 50 nm ephrin B2. These blots were probed for phospho-p42/44. Other blots received PP2 (Src inhibitor, Calbiochem) for 15 min prior to 50 nm ephrin B2 and were probed for phospho-Akt to determine whether Src lies upstream of PI3K and Akt. Changes in intracellular calcium were measured using a fluorescence ratio technique with the aid of a microscope photometry system (Photon Technology International), which consists of a PowerFilter high speed dual wavelength illuminator, a high grade quartz fiber optic bundle, a D-104B single channel microscope photometer, and a 710 photon-counting photomultiplier tube (PMT). The cell-permeable form of Fura 2 (Fura 2-AM, Molecular Probes) was used as the calcium indicator. MM1 cells were grown on 30-mm uncoated culture dishes with a coverslip on the bottom (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). These dishes were exposed to ultraviolet light for 12 h before cells were seeded onto the dishes. Cells were fed normal medium until reaching confluence. Once confluent, cells were placed in starvation medium for 12–18 h before experimentation. For the experiments, 3 μl of Fura 2-AM was loaded for 20–30 min. Cells were observed on the optical axis of a Zeiss Axiovert microscope that was connected to the PMT equipped with the photometry system. Emission fluorescence at 510 nm during excitation at 340 and 380 nm was detected by the PMT photon-counting system using FeliX software. In each experiment, the excitation wavelength alternated between 340 and 380 nm at a rate of 650/s, and the fluorescence intensities were recorded for 10 min at 5-s intervals. Correction for background fluorescence was automatically performed by the software program. After loading the fura-2 and getting base-line values, 50 nm ephrin B2 was added, and fluorescence intensities were recorded for 10 min. 1 μm bradykinin was used as a positive control to promote increased intracellular calcium concentrations. Nitrite, a stable end product of nitric oxide metabolism, was assessed in the medium by reaction with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) under acidic conditions to yield 2,3-naphthotriazole (NAT), a highly fluorescent product (9Li H. Meininger C.J. Wu G. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 746: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Reversed-phase HPLC separates NAT from DAN (and other fluorescent compounds present in biological samples) before fluorescence detection of NAT. Two days prior to the experiments, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4 mmglutamine. Ephrin B2/Fc (50 nm) was added to the MM1 cells to stimulate Eph B4 receptors and downstream pathways. Medium was collected after 48 h and filtered through 10-kDa cut-off ultrafilters to remove large molecular weight proteins. Filters were washed 4 times with deionized and double-distilled water (DD-H2O) prior to use. Nitrate was converted to nitrite using nitrate reductase as follows: 200 μl of diluted sample or nitrate standard (0–2 μm), 10 μl of 1 unit/ml nitrate reductase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 μl of 120 μm NADPH were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. This solution was then used directly for nitrite analysis. The conversion of nitrate to nitrite is 98% complete (9Li H. Meininger C.J. Wu G. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 746: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as determined with known amounts of both standards. One hundred μl of sample (diluted with DD-H2O), diluted blank medium, or sodium nitrite standard (0–2 μm) was mixed with 100 μl of DD-H2O and 20 μl of 316 μm DAN (in 0.62 m HCl). These reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of 10 μl of 2.8 m NaOH. After mixing, 15 μl of the derivatized nitrite/DAN solution was injected into a 5-μm C8 column guarded by a 40-μm C18 column for chromatographic separation of NAT. The mobile phase (1.3 ml/min) was 15 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50% methanol (1 liter of 30 mm Na2HPO4 and 125 ml of 30 mm NaH2PO4 mixed with 1.125 liter of 100% methanol) (0.0–3.0 min), followed sequentially by 100% HPLC-grade water (3.1–5.0 min), 100% methanol (5.1–8.0 min), 100% HPLC-grade water (8.1–10.0 min), and the initial 15 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 50% methanol solution (10.1–15.0 min). The use of 100% HPLC-grade water before and after 100% methanol was necessary to prevent abrupt marked increases in column pressure and was sufficient to regenerate the columns for automatic analysis of multiple samples. All chromatographic procedures were carried out at room temperature. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 375 nm and emission at 415 nm. The retention time for NAT was 4.4 min. Endothelial cell proliferation was assessed using an assay based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 to formazan by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Expansion in the number of viable cells results in an increase in the overall activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the sample. The augmentation in enzyme activity leads to an increase in the formazan dye formed. The formazan dye produced by viable cells can be quantified by a multiwell spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of the dye solution at 440 nm. To perform the experiments, an aliquot of 50,000 MM1 cells was added to each well of a 96-well tray in medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. After the cells attached to the new plate, the cells were washed, and the high serum medium was replaced with starvation medium overnight. The following morning, all wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Negative control wells received low serum only, and positive control wells received 50 nm ephrin B2/Fc only. PP2, farnesyltransferase III, LY294002, ML-9, KT5823, or PD98059 was added for 30 min before ephrin B2 to allow for complete blockade. Controls treated with inhibitor alone were also included to determine their effect on proliferation. Cells were allowed to incubate for 48 h. At this time, the WST-1 reagent dissolved in Electro Coupling Solution (Chemicon) was applied for 4 h to measure cell proliferation. The plates were read on a spectrophotometer, and data were presented as a percentage of negative control proliferation with p < 0.05 being significant. All migration assays were done using BD BioCoat Angiogenesis System-Endothelial Cell Invasion plates according to supplied protocols with little variation. Briefly, 100,000 MM1 cells were added to top chambers in 250 μl of medium. Starvation medium, ephrin B2 chimera (50 nm), or ephrin B2 chimera (50 nm) with an inhibitor was added to each of the lower chambers. LY294002, ML-9, KT5823, PD98059, MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor III, or PP2 were added for 30 min before ephrin B2/Fc to allow for complete pathway blockade. In some assays, inhibitors were given without ephrin B2 to determine the role of inhibition alone. No cells were added to the bottom chamber, so that background measurements could be obtained. Plates were allowed to incubate for 26–29 h at 37 °C to allow for migration through the Matrigel-coated membrane. Chambers were transferred to wells containing Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1.5 h and then read on a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, model FL600, gain of 100) at 485/530 nm. Migration for ephrin B2- and inhibitor-treated cells was expressed as a percentage of controls (receiving only starvation medium), after background fluorescence was subtracted. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and presented with significance at p < 0.05. MM1 cells in 60-mm dishes (passage 12–16) were starved for 40 h prior to experiments. Treated dishes received 50 nm ephrin B2/Fc chimera for 6 h. At the end of 6 h, the medium was collected, and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Pre-cast zymogram gels (Invitrogen) were loaded with 15 μl of the conditioned medium from the dish with the fewest cells and 4 μl of sample buffer (same as used for polyacrylamide gels). All other samples were compared with the medium with the fewest cells, and volumes of medium corresponding to the same number of cells were loaded onto the gels with 4 μl of sample buffer. Gels were run at 120 V for 1 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 in water for 20 min. Gels were then placed into a rotator at 45 rpm overnight at 35 °C in development buffer (Invitrogen) containing calcium chloride. The gels were then placed in a staining solution (10% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 1% Coomassie Blue, water) for ∼20 min or until bands were observed. Gels were then scanned using a reflectance scanner, and bands were measured using NIH image software. Activated MMP-2 was detected at a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa and activated MMP-9 at a molecular mass of 85 kDa. Western blot analysis of Eph B4 receptor and ephrin B2 ligand expression revealed that these cloned human microvascular endothelial cells possess an abundant amount of the Eph B4 receptor (Fig. 1 A), but no endogenous ephrin B2 (Fig. 1 B), making this a suitable model to investigate Eph B4 signal transduction in angiogenesis. Stimulation of Eph B4 receptors with ephrin B2/Fc produced a 38% increase in cell proliferation (p < 0.01 versus control, Fig.2). This increase in endothelial cell proliferation was not inhibited by administration of PP2 or farnesyltransferase III. The increased proliferation was, however, significantly decreased using LY294002 (p < 0.01versus B2, n.s. versus control, Fig. 2) and ML-9 (p < 0.001 versus B2, n.s.versus control, Fig. 2). Cell proliferation was also blocked by giving KT5823 (p < 0.01 versus B2, n.s.versus control, Fig. 2) and PD98059 (p < 0.001 versus B2, n.s. versus control, Fig. 2), indicating that nitric oxide and ERK1/2 may be involved in ephrin B2-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. Administration of ML-9 alone did significantly attenuate endothelial cell proliferation. It appears that ML-9 causes blockade of both myosin light chain kinase and Akt, which results in detachment of cells from the dish over time. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that stimulation of Eph B4 receptor with 50 nm ephrin B2/Fc chimera provided the optimal activation of the receptor and phosphorylation of Akt (p < 0.05 versus 0 nm and other doses except 5 nm where p < 0.01, Fig.3, A and B). Using the 50 nm dose, immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to determine the best time for activation of the receptor and phosphorylation of Akt. Ephrin B2/Fc chimera (50 nm) stimulation of Eph B4 receptor for 15 min produced substantial phosphorylation of Akt (p < 0.05 versus 0 min, Fig. 3, C and D). Stimulation of mesenteric microvascular endothelial cells with ephrin B2/Fc resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This response peaked at 5 min and tailed off by 30 min (p < 0.01 versus 0 min, Fig.4). This phosphorylation was blocked by administration of KT5823 prior to ephrin B2 stimulation (data not shown). The phosphorylation of Src was not as rapid as that of ERK1/2 and peaked at 15 min (p < 0.01 versus 0 min, Fig. 5). Src phosphorylation is likely upstream of PI3K and Akt, as blocking Src with PP2 prevented the phosphorylation of Akt (data not shown). These results indicate that stimulation of Eph B4 receptors does produce phosphorylation of both the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Src pathways.Figure 5Phosphorylation of Src 416 following Eph B4 receptor stimulation.

These cells responded to 1 μm bradykinin (positive control) with a large increase in intracellular calcium. Stimulation of MM1 cells with ephrin B2/Fc for 48 h increased nitrite production from 2.4 ± 0.1 to 4.1 ± 0.5 nmol/ml (p < 0.01 versus not stimulated, Fig. 6). Stimulation of Eph B4 receptors with 50 nmephrin B2/Fc chimera resulted in a 63% increase in migration over low serum controls (p < 0.01, Fig.7). This response could be blocked by prior administration of LY294002 (p < 0.01versus B2, n.s. versus control, Fig. 7), ML-9 (p < 0.001 versus B2, p < 0.01 versus control, Fig. 7), or PP2 (p < 0.05 versus B2, n.s. versus control, Fig. 7) in the presence of ephrin B2. This response was not blocked by KT5823 or PD98059 (Fig. 7). LY294002, ML-9, KT5823, PD98059, or PP2 did not affect migration when administered in the absence of ephrin B2 (data not shown). By using zymography, both MMP-2 and MMP-9 were activated in both non-treated and treated cells. Ephrin B2/Fc stimulation increased the amount of activation of both MMP-2 (p < 0.01, Fig.8 A) and MMP-9 (p < 0.05, Fig. 8 B). A possible role for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases in the cardiovascular system was suggested when it was noted that knockouts of either ephrin B2 or Eph B4 produced significant cardiovascular defects, including disruption of angiogenesis of the yolk sac (10Adams R.H. Wilkinson G.A. Weiss C. Diella F. Gale N.W. Deutsch U. Risau W. Klein R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). These authors noted that Eph receptors have the potential for modulating capillary sprouting and downstream signaling in vasculogenesis. Other authors noted that ephrin B2-Eph B4 interactions are required in vascular endothelial cells and their interaction may regulate angiogenesis (11Gerety S.S. Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Subsequent to suggestions for a role of Eph receptors in vasculogenesis, a number of investigations have focused on signaling partners, such as PI3K, Grb2, Grb10, Nck, RasGAP (1Frisen J. Holmberg J. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and Src (12Zisch A.H. Pasquale E.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), for the various Eph receptor types. Once angiogenic potential was established, the role of Eph receptors needed to be characterized in adult tissues. Investigators determined locations of Eph B4 receptors in cells and possible roles for Eph B4 in specific cellular functions (8Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Members of the Eph receptor family were noted to promote tube formation in renal vascular endothelium but not in endothelial cells from the umbilical vein (5Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P., St John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not entirely unexpected to discover that human mesenteric microvascular endothelial cells possessed abundant Eph B4 receptors. The other advantage, however, was that there was no endogenous ephrin B2 present in the MM1 cells. By using the knowledge of Eph B4 expression in human mesenteric microvascular endothelial cells, we sought to address whether Eph B4 receptor activation promotes the angiogenic events of migration and proliferation and the signaling pathways utilized to activate these processes. Receptor tyrosine kinases generally activate one or more of four main signaling pathways: Ras, PI3K, Src, and phospholipase Cγ. Therefore, we determined which of these pathways could be activated following stimulation with ephrin B2. Prevention of Ras translocation, and subsequent activation, using farnesyltransferase III had no effect on ephrin B2/Fc-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, we found no evidence of phospholipase C activation using cytosolic calcium as an indicator. Although Src appears to play a role in phosphorylation of PI3K and migration, the Src inhibitor PP2 had no effect on endothelial cell proliferation elicited by Eph B4 activation. By contrast, PI3K and Akt were both required to initiate proliferation and migration, suggesting that signaling of these two separate events diverged below Akt. Endothelial cell proliferation induced by ephrin B2/Fc was inhibited by blockers of PI3K, Akt, PKG, and MEK. Surprisingly, inhibition of Src had no effect on the proliferation response. PI3K is known to initiate a series of events that leads to Akt phosphorylation and translocation to the internal surface of the cell membrane, resulting in activation of Akt. Calcium-dependent stimulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase plays no role in Eph B4 signaling because we were unable to demonstrate a change in the fura-2 signal in mesenteric microvascular endothelial cells exposed to ephrin B2/Fc. Similar results were obtained from retinal endothelial cells, whereby stimulation with Eph B4 produces proliferation via phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt without changes in calcium signaling. 2J. L. Steinle, C. J. Meininger, G. Wu, and H. J. Granger, submitted for publication. Others had shown (13Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S., Wu, M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D.R. Hla T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that Akt can phosphorylate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase on serine 1177, causing an increase in the activity of the enzyme. In the present study, nitrite production increased almost 2-fold following ephrin B2 stimulation of Eph B4 receptors (Fig. 8). The resultant increase in downstream production of cyclic GMP via soluble guanylate cyclase accounts for the recruitment of PKG in the proliferation process. Activation of the MAP kinase cascade is probably not through Ras because the farnesyltransferase inhibitor farnesyltransferase III did not reduce ephrin B2/Fc-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Nitric oxide donors and cyclic GMP analogs are known to initiate the phosphorylation of c-raf by PKG, leading to activation of the MAP kinase cascade in a ras-independent manner (14Hood J. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23504-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We found that significantly more (63%) endothelial cells invaded the Matrigel-coated membrane when 50 nmephrin B2 was in the lower chamber than those in which only low serum was in the lower chamber. This indicates that ephrin B2 promotes endothelial cell migration in these microvascular endothelial cells. As with cell proliferation, both PI3K and Akt were required to support the migration response. By contrast, blockade of PKG and MEK had no effect on the ephrin B2/Fc-induced stimulation of transmembrane movement of endothelial cells. Thus, signaling of migration downstream of Akt diverges from the aforementioned PKG/MAP kinase connection apparently responsible for Eph B4 signaling of proliferation. The mechanism of the Akt-mediated cellular migration remains unknown. Cell motility involves changes in cytoskeletal dynamics, surface adhesion properties, and activity of extracellular proteases (15Kim D. Kim S. Koh H. Yoon S.O. Chung A.S. Cho K.S. Chung J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-9 degrade collagen within the basement membrane. Therefore, activation of these matrix metalloproteinases likely allows enhanced movement of the endothelial cells through the pores of the migration membrane. Akt has been linked to activation of MMP-2 (16Park B.K. Zeng X. Glazer R.I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7647-7653PubMed Google Scholar) and MMP-9 (15Kim D. Kim S. Koh H. Yoon S.O. Chung A.S. Cho K.S. Chung J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This is believed to occur as activated Akt increases transcriptional activation of NFκB (15Kim D. Kim S. Koh H. Yoon S.O. Chung A.S. Cho K.S. Chung J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). MMP-9 has an NFκB-binding site in its promoter. Other transcription factors have also been shown to activate MMP-2 and MMP-9. From our studies, it is clear that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are activated and are functioning in MM1 cell migration induced by ephrin B2/Fc. Work in human retinal endothelial cells indicates that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are also important for migration of these vascular endothelial cells.2 Furthermore, inhibition of these specific matrix metalloproteinases resulted in substantial declines in endothelial cell migration. In conclusion, activation of the PI3K pathway produces both endothelial cell migration and proliferation. The signaling pathways for each process are different; however, the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt are critical for both functions. Mitogenesis appears to signal through the PI3K/Akt/nitric oxide/PKG/MAP kinase pathway, whereas migration involves the PI3K/Akt/MMP pathway that does not require PKG or the MAP kinase cascade. The results of these studies indicate that Eph B4 receptors may play a role in adult angiogenesis through modulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2012703700,"The Notch and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathways both regulate proliferation and differentiation, and the cellular response to each is often influenced by the other. Here, we describe a mechanism that links them in a sequential fashion, in the developing compound eye of Drosophila. EGFR activation induces photoreceptor (R cell) differentiation and promotes their expression of Delta. This Notch ligand then induces neighboring cells to become nonneuronal cone cells. ebi and strawberry notch (sno) regulate EGFR-dependent Delta transcription by antagonizing a repressor function of Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)). Sno binds to Su(H), and Ebi, an F-box/WD40 protein, forms a complex with Su(H) and the corepressor SMRTER. EGFR-activated transcriptional derepression requires ebi and sno, is proteasome-dependent, and correlates with the translocation of SMRTER to the cytoplasm."

In this study we reveal that two other HCV proteins, NS3 (a protease/helicase) and NS4B (a hydrophobic protein of unknown function), physically and functionally interact with the NS5B polymerase. We describe a new procedure for generating highly pure NS4B, and use this protein in biochemical studies together with NS5B and NS3. To study the functional effects of the protein-protein interactions, we have developed an in vitro replication assay using the natural noncoding 3' regions of the respective positive ((+)-3'-untranslated region) and negative ((-)-3'-terminal region) RNA strands of the HCV genome. Our studies show that NS3 dramatically modulates template recognition by NS5B and changes the synthetic products generated by this enzyme. The use of an NTPase-deficient mutant form of NS3 demonstrates that the NTPase activity (and thus helicase activity) of this protein is specifically required for these effects. Moreover, NS4B is found to be a negative regulator of the NS3-NS5B replication complex. Overall, these results reveal that NS3, NS4B, and NS5B can interact to form a regulatory complex that could feature in the process of HCV replication."

We have previously shown that there are two full-length utrophin mRNA species: A and B. Here we describe the generation and characterization of antibodies specific to A- and B-utrophin.

We have analyzed the expression of A- and B-utrophin protein and RNA in dystrophin-deficient tissues. We conclude that (i) the previously described expression patterns of utrophin represent a composite of A- and B-utrophin, (ii) A- but not B-utrophin is up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient striated muscle, and (iii) this up-regulation occurs post-transcriptionally with an additional transcriptional component in skeletal muscle.

Interest in the biology of utrophin has been enhanced by a potential role for the protein in novel therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 1The abbreviations used are: DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; mAb, monoclonal antibody. (6Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1993; 3: 537-539Google Scholar). DMD is an important cause of disability and early death in young males; current treatments are poor. DMD is caused by genetic lesions that disrupt the DMD gene and abolish normal expression of dystrophin at the muscle sarcolemma, leading to progressive myocyte death (7Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Middlesworth W. Ochs H.D. Latt S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4778-4782Google Scholar, 8Monaco A.P. Neve R.L. Colletti-Feener C. Bertelson C.J. Kurnit D.M. Kunkel L.M.

Some treatment strategies seek to replace dystrophin in muscle by supplying a normal DMD gene using viral vectors or muscle cell precursors and must therefore overcome the difficulties of efficient delivery to the skeletal (and perhaps cardiac) muscles and of adverse immune responses (10Wang B. Li J. Xiao X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13714-13719Google Scholar, 11Partridge T. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 21: S939-S942Google Scholar, 12Ferrari G. Stornaiuolo A. Mavilio F. Nature. 2001; 411: 1014-1015Google Scholar). An alternative approach, avoiding these difficulties, may be to develop a pharmacological means to up-regulate utrophin in muscle in an attempt to take advantage of the functional redundancy between dystrophin and utrophin. Proof of concept for this notion derives from experiments using mdx mice (a dystrophin-deficient model for DMD) harboring a transgene that causes increased utrophin levels in muscle. These mice are spared the pathological consequences of dystrophin deficiency (13Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Phelps S.R. Fisher R. Trickett J.I. Davies K.E. Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Google Scholar, 14Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling the expression of utrophin therefore assume considerable importance. Analysis of the regulation of utrophin requires knowledge of the expression pattern of the protein. Utrophin is expressed ubiquitously but in a complex pattern within different adult tissues. In skeletal muscle, utrophin is found at the peripheral nerves, the vasculature, and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) but not the extrajunctional sarcolemma; in the brain it is present at the pia mater, the choroid plexus, and blood vessels; and in the kidney it is expressed at the podocytes of the glomerulus and at some tubules and blood vessels (15Helliwell T.R.

We have recently shown that the utrophin mRNA population contains two full-length species (named A- and B-utrophin); these are both quantitatively significant, have different initial exons, and are transcribed from different promoters (24Burton E.A.

The predicted protein sequences arising from these transcripts differ at their N termini (with unique sections of 31 and 26 amino acids, respectively). This raises the possibility that the expression pattern of utrophin represents a composite of A- and B-utrophin. Here we report the generation of antibodies specific to the unique epitopes predicted by the A- and B-utrophin sequences. We show that both transcripts are translated and that the expression patterns of A- and B-utrophin are different and change differentially in dystrophin-deficient muscle.

Western blot analysis showed that both antibodies recognized single bands with the same molecular weight as utrophin (Fig.1 a); these bands were absent from blots (Fig. 1, c and d) made with the tissues of utrn−/− mice (which lack both utrophin isoforms). Specificity of UtroA and UtroB for their cognate peptides was confirmed by dot blotting (Fig. 1 b); preincubation with the appropriate peptides abolished binding (Fig. 1, e andf). Taken together these data demonstrate that antibodies UtroA and UtroB are specific for A- and B-utrophin and that both A- and B-utrophin mRNAs are translated into full-length protein isoforms. Immunohistochemistry using the isoform-specific antibodies UtroA and UtroB demonstrated that the distributions of A- and B-utrophin in skeletal muscle are different (Figs. 2 and 3). A-utrophin localizes to the NMJs and peripheral nerves; weak staining of arterioles was also observed. In contrast, B-utrophin was observed only in endomysial capillaries and other blood vessels.Figure 3Distribution of A- and B-utrophin in skeletal muscle.

In the myocardium, kidney, and brain, B-utrophin was confined to blood vessels. As in skeletal muscle, the distribution of A-utrophin was largely complementary to B-utrophin; antibody UtroA bound to the glomerular tufts and tubules in the renal cortex and the choroid plexus and pia mater in the brain; weak staining was also seen in larger blood vessels in the heart and some small vessels in the brain. We have not observed any structures expressing utrophin (as revealed by binding of the nonspecific utrophin antibody URD40) that do not bind either UtroA or UtroB. To define more precisely which elements of blood vessels express B-utrophin, we examined arterioles using dual labeled confocal immunofluorescence with markers of vascular endothelium (CD31) and smooth muscle (α-actin) (Fig. 5b). B-utrophin expression was distinct from, and intimal to, the smooth muscle layer and co-localized with CD31 at the endothelium. B-utrophin also co-localized with the endothelial marker in capillaries (Fig.5 a). As vascular UtroA staining in the heart and skeletal muscles was seen only in larger blood vessels, we hypothesized that this signal derived from A-utrophin expression in vascular smooth muscle. Confocal imaging showed that A- but not B-utrophin co-localized with the smooth muscle marker in arteries (Fig. 5 c). We next asked whether the up-regulation of utrophin that occurs in dystrophin-deficient muscle affects both A- and B-utrophin. Previous reports have suggested that this phenomenon is restricted to muscle cells; we therefore hypothesized that A-, but not B-, utrophin would be up-regulated in mdx muscle. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the wild-type expression pattern of A-utrophin (Fig.6 a) was altered inmdx skeletal muscle in that the protein was widely distributed along the sarcolemma (Fig. 6 c), whereas the distribution of B-utrophin was unchanged with respect to the control (Fig. 6, b and d). In the heart, very little staining for A-utrophin was observed in controls, but this was greatly enhanced in mdx heart where A-utrophin was localized to the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6, e and g). In contrast, the endothelial distribution of B-utrophin in the heart was unchanged in mdx heart compared with controls (Fig. 6,f and h). Quantitative Western blot analysis confirmed that A-utrophin expression was increased (2- and 4-fold in mdx heart and skeletal muscle, respectively) with no corresponding change in B-utrophin (Fig.7).Figure 7Quantification of utrophin levels in wild-type (wt) and mdx striated muscle using Western blots, SYPRO Ruby blot stained membranes (to demonstrate equal loading), and densitometry. a and b, heart with UtroA (a) and UtroB (b). c and d, quadriceps with UtroA (c) and UtroB (d).

Solid arrowhead, 220-kDa marker; open arrowhead, 400-kDa band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess whether the increases in A-utrophin protein occurring in skeletal and cardiac muscle were accompanied by increases in A-utrophin mRNA, we performed quantitative ribonuclease protection analysis on total RNA isolated from control and mdxskeletal and cardiac muscles (Fig. 8). A-utrophin mRNA levels were 50% higher in mdxskeletal muscle than in controls, whereas levels of B-utrophin mRNA were unchanged. The levels of both A- and B-utrophin mRNA were unchanged between control and mdx heart. We generated utrophin isoform-specific antibodies, a crucial resource that allowed us to ask a number of important questions about the expression patterns of A- and B-utrophin in healthy and dystrophic tissues. The results presented here are important because of their implications both for the biological roles of utrophin and for further studies of utrophin regulation. Our data show that the previously described expression pattern of utrophin represents a composite of the very different expression profiles of A- and B-utrophin. B-utrophin expression is restricted to the vascular endothelium. In contrast, A-utrophin is expressed in a variety of structures, including the NMJ, peripheral nerves, and vascular smooth muscle. A-utrophin was not seen in association with capillaries except in the brain and that at low levels; this could derive from either the endothelium or the associated astrocyte foot processes, which have both been found to contain utrophin in previous studies (17Khurana T.S. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 357-366Google Scholar, 18Knuesel I. Bornhauser B.C. Zuellig R.A. Heller F. Schaub M.C. Fritschy J.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 422: 594-611Google Scholar). The localization of A-utrophin at the NMJ is in accordance with previous work suggesting that transcription from promoter A is enhanced at subjunctional nuclei underlying the postsynaptic membrane, consequent to activation by nerve-derived signals (32Gramolini A.O. Angus L.A. Schaeffer L. Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Changeux J.-P. Jasmin B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3223-3227Google Scholar). We previously noted that promoter B does not contain the relevant cis-acting sequences to mediate synaptically enhanced transcription and hypothesized that muscle B-utrophin might be localized to either (i) the extrajunctional region of the sarcolemma or (ii) other cell types in muscle (24Burton E.A. Tinsley J.M. Holzfeind P.J. Rodrigues N.R. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14025-14030Google Scholar). The present findings enable us to reject the first hypothesis and accept the second; B-utrophin is the vascular endothelial isoform of utrophin. The expression of utrophin in vascular endothelium has previously been recognized (33Matsumura K. Shasby D.M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 289-293Google Scholar); the finding that the B-isoform is specific for this structure suggests that it may have an important endothelial function. Mice lacking utrophin have abnormal NMJs; other gross pathology has not been identified, but it is possible that a subtle phenotype results from defects of endothelial function (29Deconinck A.E. Potter A.C. Tinsley J.M. Wood S.J. Vater R. Young C. Metzinger L. Vincent A. Slater C.R. Davies K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 883-894Google Scholar, 34Grady R.M. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 871-882Google Scholar). Key to the functions of utrophin and dystrophin are their interactions with actin and with the dystrophin/utrophin associated protein complex (35Blake D.J. Weir A. Newey S.E. Davies K.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 291-329Google Scholar). Members of this group present in at least some endothelial cells include dystroglycan, α-dystrobrevin, and the syntrophins, and these molecules are therefore candidate members for an endothelial B-utrophin associated protein complex (19Loh N.Y.

Walden P.D. Barald K. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 611-617Google Scholar). The interaction of utrophin with actin is mediated via the N terminus, which contains the region that differs in A- and B-utrophin. Indeed the A-utrophin unique region forms part of the actin binding site (4Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S.K. Bolton S.J. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Critchley D.R. Kendrick Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 63-71Google Scholar, 40Morris G.E. Nguyen T.M. Nguyen T.N. Pereboev A. Kendrick Jones J. Winder S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 119-123Google Scholar,41Moores C.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2000; 46: 116-128Google Scholar). It may be therefore that the interactions between actin and A- and B-utrophin are functionally different; this may have important consequences for the therapeutic up-regulation of utrophin in DMD skeletal muscle as the functional redundancy between dystrophin and utrophin was shown using an A-utrophin transgene. It will be necessary to demonstrate that B-utrophin can also replace dystrophin in skeletal muscle before any strategy seeking to up-regulate utrophin in muscle by stimulation of promoter B can be contemplated. The development of resources allowing the characterization and measurement of A- and B-utrophin at both the mRNA and protein levels enables us to clarify an important issue regarding the expression of utrophin in dystrophin-deficient muscle. Previous reports have not distinguished between the two full-length isoforms of utrophin and have suggested that up-regulation of utrophin in dystrophic muscle is unaccompanied by changes in steady-state mRNA levels (42Gramolini A. Karpati G. Jasmin B. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 235-244Google Scholar). Here we unequivocally demonstrate that dystrophin deficiency in the heart and skeletal muscles is associated with up-regulation and redistribution of A-utrophin only. This occurs in the presence of a small increase in A-utrophin mRNA in skeletal muscle but not in the heart. We hypothesize that the small increase in A-utrophin mRNA inmdx skeletal muscle is related to muscle regeneration; we have recently shown that A-utrophin is transcriptionally induced during early myogenesis through activation of promoter A by myogenic factors (31Perkins K.J. Burton E.A. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4843-4850Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to account for the magnitude of the change in protein expression seen in skeletal muscle, which is disproportionate to the small change in RNA level. Furthermore, regeneration occurs at very low levels in the heart and cannot therefore account for the increase in A-utrophin expression seen in the mdx mouse myocardium, which occurs in the absence of an increase in A-utrophin mRNA level. These data strongly suggest involvement of additional post-transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of A-utrophin expression in the heart and in muscle. We conclude that it is essential to distinguish between A- and B-utrophin in future studies examining the regulation and putative therapeutic applications of these proteins. Characterization of the factors governing the distinct expression patterns of the two full-length isoforms may permit definition of mechanisms that could be manipulated to effect up-regulation of utrophin and thereby help achieve a much-needed therapeutic option for patients with DMD.

Classical activators of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription comprise the Wnt family of proteins, which translocate β-catenin into the nucleus and allow the formation of transactivation-competent Lef/Tcf-β-catenin complexes. Here we show that in human endothelial cells fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) reduces GSK-3 activity and augments nuclear levels of β-catenin. FGF-2 induced Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription of a cyclin D1-luciferase construct. Gel shift assays revealed binding of Tcf-4 as the only Lef/Tcf family member and of β-catenin to the Lef/Tcf site in the cyclin D1 promoter. Cotransfection with a dominant negative Tcf-4 construct inhibited the FGF-2-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity. Overexpression of an uninhibitable GSK-3β mutant resulted in partial inhibition of FGF-2-mediated cyclin D1 induction. The importance for cyclin D1 in FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vivo is shown in cyclin D1−/− mice, where FGF-2-induced new vessel formation was significantly reduced compared with FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in cyclin D1+/+ mice. In conclusion, FGF-2 is a novel modulator of Lef/Tcf-β-catenin signaling in endothelial cells, suggesting that angiogenic properties of FGF-2 are at least in part mediated by Lef/Tcf-β-catenin activation.

Lef/Tcf (lymphoid enhancerfactor/T-cell factor) proteins belong to a family of architectural transcription factors, which are typically activated by the so-called Wnt signaling pathway. Members of the Wnt family bind to a seven-transmembrane receptor called frizzled, which results in the translocation of β-catenin from the cytosol into the nucleus (1Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). As a functional consequence, β-catenin associates with Lef/Tcf proteins and induces transcription of target genes, such as c-myc, cyclin D1, connexin 43, c-jun, fra-1, or the urokinase receptor (2He T.C.

Based on two observations that (i) FGF-2 (also called basic FGF) alters subcellular distribution of β-catenin in endothelial cells (33Halama T. Groger M. Pillinger M. Staffler G. Prager E.

Krebs E.G. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we explored FGF-2 effects on Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in endothelial cells. Here we report that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells FGF-2 reduces GSK-3 activity and enhances β-catenin translocation into the nucleus. This is followed by the up-regulation of a cyclin D1 promoter construct in an Lef/Tcf-dependent fashion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and cultured according to standard procedures as previously described (35Petzelbauer P. Bender J.R. Wilson J. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5062-5072PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used at passages 3–6. Before stimulation with FGF-2 (20 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Indianapolis) and heparin (5 units/ml), cells were serum-starved overnight in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (for GSK-3 assays, 1% fetal calf serum was added). Cells were incubated in 10 mmNaOH-Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 on ice followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets containing the intact nuclei were washed in 10 mm NaOH-Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl. Thereafter, nuclei were lysed in a hypertonic salt buffer containing 20 mm NaOH-Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA and incubated for 45 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing the nuclear extracts were collected, and protein concentrations were adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. Immunoblotting was performed with a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Sigma) as described elsewhere (33Halama T. Groger M. Pillinger M. Staffler G. Prager E. Stockinger H. Holnthoner W.

Briefly, HUVEC were collected with a cell scraper and homogenized in 30 μl of buffer containing 20 mm NaOH-Hepes (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin.

Four μl of the protein extract were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2 together with a GSK-3-specific peptide derived from the CREB transcription factor (final concentration 140 μm; New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, aliquots were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper (Merck), washed two times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and measured by scintillation counting. The difference between the kinase activity in the presence or absence of 40 mm LiCl was considered to represent the specific GSK-3 activity (36Ryves W.J. Fryer L. Dale T. Harwood A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To control for nonspecific phosphorylation, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were boiled with sample buffer and separated on a 17% polyacrylamide gel. Moreover, recombinant GSK-3 (0.5 units; New England Biolabs) was run in parallel. The gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C and autoradiographed. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaOH-Hepes (pH 7.8), 1.5 mmMgCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Nuclei were pelleted, and the cytoplasmic supernatants were used for mRNA extraction with oligo(dT) beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was done with a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers and cycling conditions for Lef/Tcf (37Murakami T. Toda S. Fujimoto M. Ohtsuki M. Byers H.R. Etoh T. Nakagawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Wnt (32Wright M. Aikawa M. Szeto W. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were described elsewhere. For PCR with Wnt primers, different cycle numbers were tested to ensure linearity of amplification. The cyclin D1 promoter constructs are based on the pA3-luc backbone and contain a 1745-bp fragment of the human cyclin D1 promoter (4Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). One promoter construct has a wild type Lef/Tcf site (−81GCTTTGATCTT−73), and the other has a mutated Lef/Tcf site (−81GCTTTGGCCTT−73). Dominant negative Tcf-4 in the pcDNA3.1zeo vector was a kind gift from Dr. Hans Clevers (University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). As a negative control, a hormone-inducible dominant negative Tcf-4 construct in the pEGRE5 vector was used (Invitrogen), which is not expressed without the addition of an ecdysone analogue. The uninhibitable A9GSK-3β construct in the pCR3.1 vector was a kind gift from Dr. Morris Birnbaum (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania (38Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D.

HUVEC were transfected in 10-cm Petri dishes with 15 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. 24 h later, cells were trypsinized, resuspended, and reseeded into 35-mm dishes. HUVEC were either starved in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5 units/ml heparin or in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 20 ng/ml FGF-2 and 5 units/ml heparin or, where indicated, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 10 ng/ml; Strathmann, Hamburg, Germany). 19 h later, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were measured with a kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bradford protein assay kit from Bio-Rad, and luciferase values were normalized to the obtained protein concentrations. In transfection experiments using the A9GSK-3 construct, normalization was done byRenilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, and luciferase assays were performed with the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeling of the oligonucleotide containing the cyclin D1 Lef/Tcf site (5′-tgttgttaagcaaagatcaaagcccggcagag-3′) was performed with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purification with Microspin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Thereafter, the complementary strand was annealed. For the binding reactions, 5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with 100,000 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide in a 15-μl reaction mix containing 20 mm NaOH-Hepes, pH 7.9, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, 1 μg of anti-Lef/Tcf antibodies (ExAlpha, Boston, MA) or anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA) were added to the nuclear extract 10 min prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.3× TBE buffer, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. To study blood vessel formation in vivo, we used the matrigel plug assay of angiogenesis (39Malinda K.M. Angiogenesis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 47-52Google Scholar). For this assay, growth factor-reduced matrigel (Becton Dickinson) was supplemented with FGF-2 (500 ng/plug) and injected subcutaneously into the abdominal midline of 6–8-week-old C57Bl6 mice. Mice were either wild type or null for cyclin D1 expression (40Albanese C. D'Amico M. Reutens A.T. Fu M. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Kitsis R.N. Henglein B. Avantaggiati M. Somasundaram K. Thimmapaya B.

Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Plugs were excised from mice after 2 weeks, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded. Sections of embedded plugs were stained with CD31, and vessels were quantitated by calculating the average number of vessels per field for each plug. In resting endothelial cells, β-catenin is predominantly located within the cytosol (33Halama T. Groger M. Pillinger M. Staffler G. Prager E. Stockinger H. Holnthoner W. Lechleitner S. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 110-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fig.1 a shows an immunoblot of nuclear extracts from HUVEC. Compared with the unstimulated controls, β-catenin levels in the nucleus increased by a mean of 2–3-fold after 1 h of stimulation with FGF-2 and decreased thereafter. A Coomassie gel was run in parallel to show equal protein loading. Since down-regulation of GSK-3 activity precedes nuclear translocation of β-catenin (42Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we stimulated HUVEC with FGF-2 and performed kinase assays. After 15 min, GSK-3 activity was significantly decreased by FGF-2 and slowly increased after 30 min (Fig. 1 b). As reported previously, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reduces GSK-3 activity (25Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 43Welsh G.I. Miyamoto S. Price N.T. Safer B. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11410-11413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, for control purposes, HUVEC were stimulated with PMA, which led to a reduction of GSK-3 activity comparable with that seen with FGF-2. To confirm specificity of the kinase assay, we analyzed the kinase reactions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The GSK-3-specific CREB peptide was phosphorylated and seen as a distinct band on SDS gels. Phosphorylation was inhibited by the noncompetitive GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl. As a control, we also analyzed recombinant GSK-3 on SDS gels (Fig. 1 c). So far, four human members of the Lef/Tcf family are known: Lef-1, Tcf-1, Tcf-3, and Tcf-4. To explore which of them are expressed in HUVEC, reverse transcription-PCR was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 a HUVEC express Lef-1, Tcf-1, Tcf-3, and Tcf-4 mRNA. Except for Tcf-3, all primers yielded one specific band of the expected size. PCR with Tcf-3-specific primers resulted in two bands. According to the expected size, the lower band is specific for Tcf-3, and the identity of the upper band remains to be determined. To exclude the possibility that nuclear translocation of β-catenin is mediated viade novo synthesis of Wnts, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Neither in unstimulated nor in FGF-2-treated HUVEC (6 h) could we detect Wnt-1 mRNA. Also, degenerate primers, which amplify several Wnt members (44Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), did not show an increase of mRNA expression by FGF-2. As a control, we analyzed Wnt-5a expression, which so far is the only known Wnt member expressed in endothelial cells but unable to activate the Wnt pathway (32Wright M. Aikawa M. Szeto W. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, Wnt-5a mRNA expression was not enhanced by FGF-2 in endothelial cells. Thus, FGF-2 effects on GSK-3 activity and on nuclear translocation of β-catenin were independent from de novosynthesis of Wnt proteins. To investigate whether the FGF-2-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin enhanced Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription, we used luciferase reporter plasmids containing a 1745-bp sequence of the human cyclin D1 promoter, which harbors the wild type or a mutated Lef/Tcf site (4Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Following transfection into HUVEC, we found a 4–6-fold induction of the wild type cyclin D1 promoter upon FGF-2 stimulation (Fig.3). In contrast, the promoter with the mutated Lef/Tcf site responded only insignificantly to FGF-2 (a mean of 1.2-fold). VEGF, used as a positive control, induced expression of both constructs about 3-fold. In a next set of experiments, we analyzed binding of Lef/Tcf members and β-catenin to the Lef/Tcf site in the cyclin D1 promoter. We performed gel shift analysis and found binding of Tcf-4 to the cyclin D1 Lef/Tcf site only (Fig.4 a). To our knowledge, no specific antibody against human Tcf-3 is commercially available; hence, we cannot exclude binding of Tcf-3. However, considering the nearly complete supershift with the anti-Tcf-4 antibody, Tcf-4 appears to be the major component in this complex (Fig. 4 a). Lef/Tcf transcription factors need β-catenin as co-activator to induce transcription. To verify binding of β-catenin to the Tcf-4-DNA complex in FGF-2-stimulated HUVEC, we added a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody into the binding reaction. Fig. 4 bshows the presence of β-catenin in this complex. As a positive control, we stimulated HUVEC with LiCl, which inhibits GSK-3 activity leading to nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Nuclear extracts of LiCl-stimulated (3 h, 20 mm) HUVEC supershifted with the anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 4 b). To further substantiate the important role of Tcf-4 in FGF-2-mediated cyclin D1 expression, we performed cotransfections with the wild type cyclin D1 promoter construct and a constitutively active ΔN-Tcf-4 (lacking part of the N terminus that is responsible for binding to β-catenin) or with a mock-transfected negative control (hormone-inducible ΔN-Tcf-4). As shown in Fig. 5, the FGF-2-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity was abolished by cotransfection with constitutively active ΔN-Tcf-4 but not by cotransfection with the control vector. In contrast, VEGF induction was only minimally affected by ΔN-Tcf-4. To investigate the role of GSK-3 in FGF-2 stimulation of Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription, HUVEC were transfected with the wild type cyclin D1 promoter and a plasmid coding for a constitutively active GSK-3β mutant, where the serine 9 phosphorylation site is mutated to an alanine. After transfection, cells were stimulated with FGF-2 for 19 h. Overexpression of the GSK-3β mutant reduced the effect of FGF-2 on the cyclin D1 promoter by a mean of 33%. We substantiated the role of cyclin D1 in FGF-2-induced angiogenesis by using the matrigel plug model (39Malinda K.M. Angiogenesis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 47-52Google Scholar). Growth factor-reduced matrigel supplemented with FGF-2 was injected subcutaneously into cyclin D1−/− mice or into wild type littermates as previously described (40Albanese C. D'Amico M. Reutens A.T. Fu M. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Kitsis R.N. Henglein B. Avantaggiati M. Somasundaram K. Thimmapaya B. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34186-34195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 41Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). New vessel formation was quantified after 2 weeks. As seen in Fig. 6, in cyclin D1+/+ mice, FGF-2 induced a robust new vessel formation within the gels (mean 42 ± 1.8 vessels per high power field). In contrast, in mice where the cyclin D1 gene has been deleted, angiogenesis in response to FGF-2 was significantly reduced (mean 16.8 ± 3.1 vessels). In the absence of FGF-2, angiogenesis was virtually absent. Thus, the up-regulation of cyclin D1 is an important component of the angiogenic process in response to FGF-2. Transcription factors of the Lef/Tcf family require the interaction with other proteins to be activated and to modulate gene transcription. β-Catenin is the best characterized protein that activates Lef/Tcf-mediated transcription. In unstimulated cells, β-catenin is mainly located in the cytoplasm. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin is thought to be mainly under the control of the Wnt signaling pathway. The initial observation that human endothelial cells have a functional Wnt signaling pathway came from Wright et al. (32Wright M. Aikawa M. Szeto W. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), who transfected endothelial cells with a Wnt-1 construct and found Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription and cell proliferation. However, endothelial cells in culture express Wnt-5a only, which is unable to activate Lef/Tcf-dependent genes. We have confirmed this observation and extended it by showing that even after FGF-2 stimulation, Wnt expression was not induced (RT-PCR with degenerated primers used by Wright et al.(32Wright M. Aikawa M. Szeto W. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). Here, we report that FGF-2 reduces GSK-3 activity and augments nuclear translocation of β-catenin in human endothelial cells. To analyze gene expression, we first used wild type and mutated Lef/Tcf reporter plasmids (TOPflash and FOPflash; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), but both constructs were inducible by FGF-2 (data not shown). This effect has thus to be interpreted as nonspecific and is probably due to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter in front of the luciferase gene. Instead, we used luciferase reporter constructs of cyclin D1, a known target gene of the β-catenin/Lef/Tcf pathway (4Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), and this construct was readily inducible by FGF-2. Importantly, the FGF-2-induced expression of the cyclin D1 promoter completely depended on the Lef/Tcf site, because FGF-2 could not induce expression of the cyclin D1 construct with a mutated Lef/Tcf site. Also, cotransfection with a dominant negative Tcf-4 inhibits the FGF-2 effect on the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 5). In contrast to FGF-2, VEGF induced expression of the wild type as well as the Lef/Tcf-mutated cyclin D1 constructs, which is in line with the findings that cyclin D1 expression can be induced via the cAMP-response element site and that VEGF induces binding of CREB to this site (45Mayo L.D.

Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and with our observation that in endothelial cells VEGF does not induce nuclear translocation of β-catenin. 2W. Holnthoner and P. Petzelbauer, unpublished observations. Consistent with the luciferase data, gel shift analysis revealed binding of β-catenin-Tcf-4 to the cyclin D1 Lef/Tcf site in response to FGF-2. In addition, despite the presence of Lef-1, Tcf-1, and Tcf-4 (at least on the mRNA level), only Tcf-4 bound to the cyclin D1 Lef/Tcf site. A crucial switchpoint in the signal transduction to Lef/Tcf is GSK-3. Here we show that FGF-2 down-regulates GSK-3 activity. However, the consequences of altered GSK-3 activity on Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription seem to be dependent on the cell type. In HepG2 hepatoma cells, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 reduce GSK-3 activity and induce Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (22Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Cherqui G. Perret C. Capeau J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, in 293 embryonic kidney cells, insulin-like growth factor-1 failed to induce Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription (47Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor reduces GSK-3 activity and induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription in mammary epithelial cells (48Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor reduces GSK-3 activity but does not induce β-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activity of Lef/Tcf in mammary epithelial cells (49Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). FGF-1 reduces in GSK-3 activity in neuronal cells, but consequences on β-catenin signaling are unknown (50Hashimoto M. Sagara Y. Langford D. Everall I.P. Mallory M. Everson A. Digicaylioglu M. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32985-32991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We defined the role of GSK-3 in endothelial cells by cotransfecting a mutant GSK-3β. We show that this constitutively active GSK-3β down-regulates FGF-2-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity. This confirms that GSK-3 is involved in the transduction of signals from FGF-2 to Lef/Tcf. However, inhibition by this dominant positive GSK-3β construct was only partial. A possible explanation is based on the finding that in addition to translocating β-catenin from the cytosolic and GSK-3-bound pool, FGF-2 also liberates junctional β-catenin (33Halama T. Groger M. Pillinger M. Staffler G. Prager E. Stockinger H. Holnthoner W. Lechleitner S. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 110-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One might speculate that the junctional-derived β-catenin can “bypass” the cytosolic GSK-3β-complex and directly translocate into the nucleus. It should be noted that in contrast to endothelium, in epithelial cells FGF-2 appears to have different effects; it does not liberate catenins from the membrane (51El Hariry I. Pignatelli M. Lemoine N.R. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,52El Hariry I. Pignatelli M. Lemoine N.R. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 84: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that a portion of β-catenin is linked to GSK-α and thus still accessible to FGF-2 signals, which is supported by the finding that GSK-3β−/− knockout mice show normal early embryonic development, suggesting that GSK-3α can at least partially compensate for GSK-3β (53Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). However, a direct interaction of GSK-3α with β-catenin has not been shown yet (48Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Finally, it should be noted that β-catenin stability can be influenced independently from GSK-3 (e.g. by the IKKα and IKKβ kinases (54Lamberti C. Lin K.M. Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Verma I.M. Byers S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42276-42286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)), but FGF-2 does not appear to regulate IKK. In conclusion, we describe a novel function for FGF-2 in endothelial cells. FGF-2 down-regulates GSK-3 activity, enhances nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and transactivates a cyclin D1 reporter construct in a Lef/Tcf-dependent manner. Moreover, we provide the first physiological evidence for the requirement for cyclin D1 in FGF-2-induced angiogenesis. Further evidence for the importance of Lef/Tcf in angiogenesis comes from recent publications that show roles for β-catenin/Tcf signaling in vascular remodeling (55Wang X. Xiao Y. Mou Y. Zhao Y. Blankesteijn W.M. Hall J.L. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and for Tcf-4 in the proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (56Venkiteswaran K. Xiao K. Summers S. Calkins C.C. Vincent P.A. Pumiglia K. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C811-C821Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, in analogy to Wnt proteins, which control developmental processes like patterning and organ shaping, FGF-2 may interfere with vasculo- or angiogenesis by controlling nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of β-catenin.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cross-linking/MS methods involve chemically or photochemically cross-linking a protein complex (35Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 1990; 1: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), followed by digestion of the cross-linked complex and MS analysis of the resulting peptide mixture (36Kuster B. Mann M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cross-linked peptides can be identified by parent ion mass and/or the fragmentation pattern produced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), thereby locating adjacent protein regions and enabling assembly of low-resolution models of proteins or protein complexes. Cross-linking/MS experiments are generally fast and do not require large quantities of protein (30Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For these reasons, cross-linking/MS methods have potential as a low-resolution counterpart to x-ray or NMR methods for rapid determination of interacting surfaces between proteins (29Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the topology of proteins within complexes (33Rappsilber J. Siniossoglou S. Hurt E.C. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Despite the advantages of cross-linking methods, namely high molecular weight capability, speed, and the small quantities of protein required, the large number of peptide species that are seen from the digestion of cross-linked proteins makes it difficult to identify relevant intermolecular cross-linked peptides from MS data. This problem has been partially addressed by “tagging” methodologies that allow rapid visual MS location of cross-linked species within complex peptide mixtures (34Sinz A. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Chen X. Chen Y.H. Anderson V.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P.

Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For example, the use of a 1:1 mixture of undeuterated and deuterated (d 0/d 4-labeled) cross-linking reagent readily allows mass spectrometric detection of all cross-linked species by the presence ofd 0/d 4-isotope tags (39Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M.O. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, for studying interactions between proteins, even these tagging methodologies fall short in that they fail to distinguishinter- and intra-cross-linked peptides. This results in cross-linked peptide species being tagged that do not yield useful information on intermolecular interactions, such as intramolecular cross-linked peptides or peptides modified by partially hydrolyzed cross-linking reagent (30Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 40Pearson K.M. Pannell L.K. Fales H.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, these tagging methodologies make cross-linking studies of oligomeric proteins, such as IL-6D, ambiguous because identical cross-linked peptides can in principle arise from inter- orintramolecular origins (38Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Here we present a method for visualizing intermolecular cross-linked peptides in the IL-6 homodimer that we have designated mixed isotope cross-linking (MIX). Applied to IL-6D, the MIX method requires preparation of uniformly 15N-labeled and unlabeled (14N) IL-6, combined as a 1:1 mixture and re-associated to form a population of 14N-, mixed14N/15N-, and 15N-labeled IL-6D. Cross-linking and mass spectrometric peptide mapping on this mixture allows intermolecular cross-linked peptides to be identified easily as they form distinctive triplet or quadruplet mass spectrum peaks because of the distribution of 14N- and15N-labeled peptides within these cross-linked peptides. In contrast, all intramolecular cross-linked and noncross-linked peptides are seen as doublet mass spectrum peaks. This ability to discriminate between inter- and intra- cross-linked species makes the MIX technique a uniquely useful new tool for studying intermolecular interactions. We describe the application of this technique to determine proximal intermolecular residues within the homodimeric form of IL-6 and to deduce the mode of three-dimensional domain swapping, based on the known structure of monomeric human interleukin-6 (22Xu G.Y.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 25Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) in which adjacent subunits have the IL-6 structure, but contain interchanged α-helical bundle domain elements. Here, we investigate the arrangement of domain-swapped IL-6 chains within IL-6D using a technique based on cross-linking and mass spectrometry. Although the established techniques of x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy yield high resolution data, often this takes months or years to obtain (26Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

Siniossoglou S. Hurt E.C. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34Sinz A. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cross-linking/MS methods involve chemically or photochemically cross-linking a protein complex (35Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 1990; 1: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), followed by digestion of the cross-linked complex and MS analysis of the resulting peptide mixture (36Kuster B. Mann M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cross-linked peptides can be identified by parent ion mass and/or the fragmentation pattern produced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), thereby locating adjacent protein regions and enabling assembly of low-resolution models of proteins or protein complexes. Cross-linking/MS experiments are generally fast and do not require large quantities of protein (30Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For these reasons, cross-linking/MS methods have potential as a low-resolution counterpart to x-ray or NMR methods for rapid determination of interacting surfaces between proteins (29Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the topology of proteins within complexes (33Rappsilber J. Siniossoglou S. Hurt E.C. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Despite the advantages of cross-linking methods, namely high molecular weight capability, speed, and the small quantities of protein required, the large number of peptide species that are seen from the digestion of cross-linked proteins makes it difficult to identify relevant intermolecular cross-linked peptides from MS data. This problem has been partially addressed by “tagging” methodologies that allow rapid visual MS location of cross-linked species within complex peptide mixtures (34Sinz A. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Chen X. Chen Y.H. Anderson V.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 39Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M.O. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For example, the use of a 1:1 mixture of undeuterated and deuterated (d 0/d 4-labeled) cross-linking reagent readily allows mass spectrometric detection of all cross-linked species by the presence ofd 0/d 4-isotope tags (39Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M.O. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, for studying interactions between proteins, even these tagging methodologies fall short in that they fail to distinguishinter- and intra-cross-linked peptides. This results in cross-linked peptide species being tagged that do not yield useful information on intermolecular interactions, such as intramolecular cross-linked peptides or peptides modified by partially hydrolyzed cross-linking reagent (30Young M.M. Tang N. Hempel J.C. Oshiro C.M. Taylor E.W. Kuntz I.D. Gibson B.W. Dollinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 40Pearson K.M. Pannell L.K. Fales H.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, these tagging methodologies make cross-linking studies of oligomeric proteins, such as IL-6D, ambiguous because identical cross-linked peptides can in principle arise from inter- orintramolecular origins (38Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we present a method for visualizing intermolecular cross-linked peptides in the IL-6 homodimer that we have designated mixed isotope cross-linking (MIX). Applied to IL-6D, the MIX method requires preparation of uniformly 15N-labeled and unlabeled (14N) IL-6, combined as a 1:1 mixture and re-associated to form a population of 14N-, mixed14N/15N-, and 15N-labeled IL-6D. Cross-linking and mass spectrometric peptide mapping on this mixture allows intermolecular cross-linked peptides to be identified easily as they form distinctive triplet or quadruplet mass spectrum peaks because of the distribution of 14N- and15N-labeled peptides within these cross-linked peptides. In contrast, all intramolecular cross-linked and noncross-linked peptides are seen as doublet mass spectrum peaks. This ability to discriminate between inter- and intra- cross-linked species makes the MIX technique a uniquely useful new tool for studying intermolecular interactions. We describe the application of this technique to determine proximal intermolecular residues within the homodimeric form of IL-6 and to deduce the mode of three-dimensional domain swapping, based on the known structure of monomeric human interleukin-6 (22Xu G.Y.

Recent reports suggest that they are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and transformation. However, their biological function has not yet been determined. Here we show that PRL-1 mRNA is overexpressed in a number of human tumor cell lines, including HeLa cells. Using immunofluorescence we studied the subcellular localization of endogenous PRL-1, and our results demonstrate that PRL-1 exhibits cell cycle-dependent localization; in non-mitotic HeLa cells, PRL-1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in a farnesylation-dependent manner. In mitotic cells PRL-1 relocalizes to the centrosomes and the spindle apparatus, proximal to the centrosomes, in a farnesylation-independent manner. Conditional expression of a catalytic domain mutant in HeLa cells results in a delay in the progression of cells through mitosis but has no effect on other phases of the cell cycle. Further, expression of a farnesylation site PRL-1 mutant results in mitotic defects, characterized by chromosomal bridges in anaphase and lagging chromosomes, without affecting spindle checkpoint function. Together, these results suggest that PRL-1 function is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and implicate PRL-1 in regulating progression through mitosis, possibly by modulating spindle dynamics.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used for: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DOX, doxycycline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 1The abbreviations used for: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DOX, doxycycline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. have been recognized as important modulators in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation and cell differentiation, as well as other cellular functions of eukaryotic cells (1Dixon J.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 405-415PubMed Google Scholar, 2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). PTPs can function as positive or negative regulators of signal transduction pathways, depending on the particular substrate and the effect of phosphorylation on its activity (3Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 4Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Like kinases, PTPs have been implicated in various malignancies, including cancer.The PTP superfamily can be divided into two classes based on sequence similarity and substrate specificity: “classic” PTPs, which dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues, and dual specificity phosphatases, which can also use phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues as substrates. In addition to the conserved catalytic domain, PTPs frequently contain additional domains or sequence motifs important for subcellular localization, substrate recognition, or regulation of their activities (2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 5Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).Over the past few years, a new subfamily of PTPs, PRL (also termed PTPCAAX), has been identified (6Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.

Commun. 1998; 244: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although PRL phosphatases contain the PTP signature motif (I/V(HCXAGXXR)S/T)G at the active site, their sequences are distinct from other PTPs. Overall, their catalytic domain is most similar to that of dual specificity phosphatases. Their closest relatives are CDC14, a mitotic regulator, and the tumor suppressor PTEN (8Zeng Q. Hong W. Tan Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To date, three family members (PRL-1, PRL-2, PRL-3) have been identified in mammals. PRL phosphatases are relatively small enzymes with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa and contain a C-terminal CAAX motif as the signal for protein farnesylation. All three family members can serve as substrates for farnesyltransferasesin vitro, and PRL-2 has been shown to be prenylated in vivo (7Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).The three enzymes share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with each other. For example, PRL-1 shares 87 and 75% sequence identity with PRL-2 and PRL-3, respectively (8Zeng Q. Hong W. Tan Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence similarity of the three family members is also reflected on the cDNA level within the coding region. However, their 5′ non-coding sequences are quite divergent, suggesting possible differences in the regulation of gene expression (8Zeng Q. Hong W. Tan Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).PRL-1 was first cloned as an immediate-early gene in rat liver following hepatectomy. More recently, it has been shown that the expression of human PRL-1 is regulated by Egr-1, a growth factor-activated transcription factor (11Peng Y. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4513-4520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of PRL-1 and PRL-2 in epithelial cells results in a transformed phenotype and the transfected cells are able to form tumors in nude mice (7Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Further, stable cell lines overexpressing PRL-1 have enhanced saturation density and a shorter doubling time relative to control cell lines (6Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). More recently PRL-2 was shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer (13Wang Q. Holmes D.I. Powell S.M. Lu Q.L. Waxman J. Cancer Lett. 2002; 175: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further, Saha et al.(14Saha S. Bardelli A. Buckhaults P. Velculescu V.E. Rago C. St.Croix B. Romans K.E. Choti M.A. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2001; 294: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the expression of PRL-3 is associated with liver metastasis of colon cancer. Together these data suggest that PRL-1 and PRL-2 may function in the regulation of cell proliferation and that all three members of this subfamily of PTPs may be involved in tumorigenesis. To date, however, little is known about their possible physiological function and how they might be involved in signal transduction processes. In addition, the mechanism of their regulation and the basis of their transforming activity are not understood.The subcellular localization of a particular protein can sometimes give clues to its physiological function. PRL-1 was originally described as a nuclear protein in transfected cells (6Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). More recently, Zenget al. (10Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) reported that PRL phosphatases are localized to the plasma membrane and early endosomes and that this localization pattern is dependent on their farnesylation. This study used an overexpression system, which could lead to non-physiological subcellular localization.By using affinity-purified antibodies against PRL-1, we report that the subcellular localization of endogenous PRL-1 is cell cycle-dependent. In non-mitotic cells PRL-1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas in mitotic cells it is associated with the centrosomes and the spindle apparatus. Further, cell cycle analysis of cells expressing a catalytic domain mutant of PRL-1 indicates that the PRL-1 phosphatase activity is required for progression of cells through mitosis. In addition, expression of a farnesylation site mutant of PRL-1 (PRL-1-C170S), which is enriched in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, results in mitotic defects without compromising spindle checkpoint function. Like wild type PRL-1, PRL-1-C170S localizes to the spindle apparatus in mitotic cells, demonstrating that farnesylation is required for ER but not for microtubule association. Our results demonstrate for the first time a role for PRL-1 in cell cycle regulation and suggest that PRL-1 activity may be required for proper spindle function or spindle dynamics.

This study used an overexpression system, which could lead to non-physiological subcellular localization. By using affinity-purified antibodies against PRL-1, we report that the subcellular localization of endogenous PRL-1 is cell cycle-dependent. In non-mitotic cells PRL-1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas in mitotic cells it is associated with the centrosomes and the spindle apparatus. Further, cell cycle analysis of cells expressing a catalytic domain mutant of PRL-1 indicates that the PRL-1 phosphatase activity is required for progression of cells through mitosis. In addition, expression of a farnesylation site mutant of PRL-1 (PRL-1-C170S), which is enriched in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, results in mitotic defects without compromising spindle checkpoint function. Like wild type PRL-1, PRL-1-C170S localizes to the spindle apparatus in mitotic cells, demonstrating that farnesylation is required for ER but not for microtubule association. Our results demonstrate for the first time a role for PRL-1 in cell cycle regulation and suggest that PRL-1 activity may be required for proper spindle function or spindle dynamics.

We initially identified caveolin-1 (cav-1) as a candidate STAT3-associated accessory protein due to its co-localization with STAT3 and PY-STAT3 in flotation raft fractions, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) due to its inclusion in cytosolic STAT3-containing 200–400-kDa complexes. Subsequent immunomagnetic bead pullout assays showed that STAT3, PY-STAT3, cav-1, and HSP90 interacted in plasma membrane and cytoplasmic complexes derived from uninduced and stimulated Hep3B cells. This was a general property of STAT3 in that these interactions were also observed in alveolar epithelial type II-like cells, lung fibroblasts, and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Exposure of Hep3B cells to the raft disrupter methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 1–10 min followed by IL-6 stimulation for 15 min preferentially inhibited the appearance of PY-STAT3 in the cav-1-enriched sedimentable cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that these complexes may represent a trafficking intermediate immediately downstream from the raft. Because IL-6 is known to function in the body in the context of fever, the possibility that HSP90 may help preserve IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling at elevated temperature was investigated. Geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor, markedly inhibited IL-6-stimulated STAT3 signaling in Hep3B hepatocytes cultured overnight at 39.5 °C as evaluated by DNA-shift assays, trafficking of PY-STAT3 to the nucleus, cross-precipitation of HSP90 by anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody, and reporter/luciferase construct experiments. Taken together, the data show that IL-6/raft/STAT3 signaling is a chaperoned pathway that involves cav-1 and HSP90 as accessory proteins and suggest a mechanism for the preservation of this signaling during fever.

We report the identification of caveolin-1 (cav-1) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as STAT3-associated proteins at the level of plasma membrane rafts and in high molecular mass cytoplasmic complexes, and we explore their role in cytokine signaling at normal and elevated temperatures. In previous cell fractionation studies of human hepatoma Hep3B cells, approximately 10% of the cellular STAT3 and STAT1 pools were observed to be associated with a detergent-resistant plasma membrane raft fraction which included the plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase (5′-ND), the integral raft proteins caveolin-1 (cav-1) and flotillin-1, the IL-6-receptor chain gp130, the interferon (IFN)-γ-receptor chain α, and the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 58 (GRP58) (12Sehgal P.B.

For IL-6 or IFN-γ treatment, cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, replenished with 5 ml of serum-free medium for 1–2 h, and then exposed to the recombinant cytokine (10 ng/ml; R & D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for the indicated times. In some experiments confluent Hep3B cultures were incubated at 39.5 °C overnight (12–14 h), and cytokine stimulation was also carried out at 39.5 °C.

All cell fractionation and gradient centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclei were removed from the cell homogenate by two rounds of low speed centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min in an IEC Centra GP8R centrifuge. The post-nuclear cytoplasm was further fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × gin an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min to yield the “P15 membrane fraction” (P15, pellet fraction of post-nuclear cytoplasm centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min) which contained mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane (13Guo G.G. Patel K. Kumar V. Shah M. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 555-563Google Scholar). This P15 membrane pellet was washed once with 0.5 ml of ELB, resedimented, and then resuspended in 50 μl of ELB. The supernatant from the initial 15,000 × g 15-min sedimentation was further fractionated into pellet P100 (P100, pellet fraction of post-membrane cytoplasm centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min) and cytosol S100 fractions (S100, supernatant of post-membrane cytoplasm centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h) in a TL-100 Beckman ultracentrifuge. After removal of the S100 cytosol from the centrifuge tube, the walls were wiped carefully, and then the P100 pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ELB. Nuclear extracts were prepared in high salt buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl as described before (18Rayanade R.J. Patel K. Ndubuisi M. Sharma S. Omura S. Etlinger J.D. Pine R. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol.

Additional Western blot markers included caveolin-1, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78/BiP), and nuclear pore-associated protein 62 (Nup62) (Organelle Marker kit; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Western blotting was carried out using 7.5, 10, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing denaturing conditions in accordance with procedures and protocols provided by Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) (14Ndubuisi M.I.

Routinely, multiple exposures of each blot were obtained so as to ensure that each of the signals was within the linear range; and in order to reduce quantitation errors, sample volumes in different fractions were adjusted to provide signals of equivalent strength each within the linear range of the assay. Western blot signals were quantitated using a Hoefer Scientific GS-300 scanning densitometer. STAT-specific DNA binding activity was assayed using the m67 mutant serum-inducible element (SIE) oligonucleotide derived from the c-fos promoter (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as described earlier (14Ndubuisi M.I.

The identification of the respective SIF-A, -B, and -C bands as STAT3 homodimer, STAT3/1 heterodimer, and STAT1 homodimer in our experiments was confirmed using respective antibody supershift assays (see Refs. 12Sehgal P.B. Guo G.G. Shah M. Kumar V. Patel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12067-12074Google Scholar, 13Guo G.G. Patel K. Kumar V. Shah M. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J.

Transfections into Hep3B cell cultures in 6-well plates were carried out using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Polyfect, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a reporter/luciferase construct (p950M4) containing four copies of the STAT3-binding DNA element from the human angiotensinogen promoter (5′ CGTTTCTGGGAACCT 3′) cloned into pBL2Luc (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) (a gift from Dr. Ashok Kumar, Department of Pathology, New York Medical College) was transfected into Hep3B cells (250–500 ng/well) together with the constitutive β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (50 ng/well) and appropriate amounts of pBR322 or Bluescript vector to give 1 μg of transfected DNA per well. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–12 h, the cultures were either kept at 37 °C or incubated overnight at 39.5 °C. IL-6 (10 ng/ml) induction was carried out for 6 h at the respective temperatures. The cells were harvested in 300 μl of lysis buffer (Promega Biotech), and 50-μl aliquots of the clarified extracts were used to assay luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using respective assay kits/reagents from Promega Biotech and Roche Diagnostics and the manufacturer's protocols. Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to STAT1, STAT3, and HSP90 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to STAT3, STAT5b, and caveolin-1, as well as a murine mAb to PY-STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PY-STAT1 and anti-PY-STAT3 pAbs were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit antiserum to recombinant human glucose-regulated protein 58 (GRP58/ER-60/ERp57) was a gift from Drs. Mohammed Bourdi and Lance Pohl (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Protein A magnetic beads were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Prior to use in immunopanning experiments, the beads were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS. Aliquots of the P15 membrane fraction (150 μl), the P100 pellet (150 μl), or the S100 cytosol (300 μl) were adjusted to 0.05% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (“binding buffer”) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with respective rabbit immunoglobulin (nonimmune rabbit serum (NRS) or anti-caveolin-1 pAb or anti-STAT3 pAb) and then for 1 h at 4 °C with the pre-blocked protein A magnetic beads. The magnetic beads were washed 5 times with binding buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and then twice with binding buffer adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100. Immunopanned protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under reducing denaturing conditions (14Ndubuisi M.I. Guo G.G. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25499-25509Google Scholar, 19Rayanade R.J. Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334Google Scholar). All electron microscopy reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA) and used in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, pellets of respective cellular fractions sedimented to the bottom of Eppendorf tubes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (Karnovsky's fixative) and then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS. The fixed pellets were embedded in LR White Hard resin, thin sectioned using a Sorvall Porter-Blum MT2–8 Ultra-microtome, and visualized using an Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels using a scalpel and digested in situ with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by Rosenfeld et al. (21Rosenfeld J. Capdeville J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar) except that the detergent Tween 20 was absent from the digestion buffers. The digest containing the gel bits was extracted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, concentrated using a SpeedVac to less than 10 μl, and desalted using a Zip-Tip (Millipore, Bedford, MA). An aliquot of the digest was mixed with an equal volume of matrix material (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) as a saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), and ion masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy (Kratos KOMPACT MALDI III). Data bases were searched at 0.08% mass accuracy with the MS-Fit algorithm (University of California at San Francisco web site) to identify digested protein. MCD and filipin III were purchased from Sigma. Geldanamycin (GA) was a gift from the Drug Synthesis & Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health. These were carried out using the SPSS 10.0 software package for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the Student's t test (for paired samples, two-tailed). STAT proteins associate with different subcellular fractions in Hep3B cells (11Sehgal P.B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 525-535Google Scholar, 12Sehgal P.B. Guo G.G. Shah M. Kumar V. Patel K. J. Biol.

Guo G.G. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25499-25509Google Scholar). In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 1, Hep3B cells were fractionated using hypotonic swelling, Dounce homogenization, and differential centrifugation methods into the plasma membrane-enriched P15 fraction, the post-membrane cytoplasmic P100 pellet and S100 cytosol fractions, and the nuclear extract (NE). Fig. 1 shows that the P15 fraction was highly enriched in the plasma membrane marker 5′-ND and contained the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker BiP, whereas the P100 cytoplasmic pellet was depleted in both 5′-ND as well as BiP. The nuclear marker Nup62 was detected only in the nuclear extract. These marker distributions were consistent with electron microscopic characterization of the P15 and P100 fractions, which confirmed that the former fraction contained cytoplasmic membranes, mitochondria, and ER, and, most important, the P100 pellet appeared to be largely membrane-free (data not shown). Fig. 1 further shows that, as expected, the bulk of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5b in Hep3B cells was present in the S100 cytosol (see quantitation in legend to Fig. 1). However ∼10% of each of the cellular STAT1 and STAT3 pools were observed in the P15 and P100 pellet fractions (see quantitation in legend to Fig. 1). Upon IL-6 treatment for 30 min, ∼15% of cellular STAT3, 5% of STAT1, 37% of PY-STAT3, and 56% of PY-STAT1 translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 1). Cytoplasmic PY-STAT3 was associated with both the P100 pellet fraction and the S100 cytosol (also see Fig. 6, below).Figure 6Effect of a brief exposure to MCD on IL-6-induced STAT3-specific DNA shift activity (A) and PY-STAT3 content (B) in different Hep3B subcellular fractions. A, effect of treating Hep3B cells with MCD before cytokine on DNA binding activity in different cellular compartments. Groups of Hep3B cultures (4 each) were treated with MCD (12.5 mm) for 10, 5, or 1 min before addition of IL-6 for another 15 min. The P15, P100, S100, and NE fractions were prepared, and aliquots (10 μl for P15 and P100, 20 μl for S100, and 2 μl for NE) assayed for DNA shift activity. The autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry. The compartmental distribution as % of total in the cell of SIF-A DNA shift activity in Hep3B cells treated only with IL-6 was ∼1, 16, 35, and 48% in the P15,"

Here we show that Pol4 preferentially catalyzes DNA synthesis on small gaps formed by the alignment of linear duplex DNA molecules with complementary ends, a DNA substrate specificity that is compatible with its predicted role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Pol4 also interacts directly with the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4-Lif1 complex via its N-terminal BRCT domain. This interaction stimulates the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 and, to a lesser extent, the DNA joining activity of Dnl4-Lif1. Notably, the joining of DNA substrates that require the combined action of Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 is much more efficient than the joining of similar DNA substrates that require only ligation. Thus, the physical and functional interactions between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 provide a molecular mechanism for both the recruitment of Pol4 to in vivo DNA double-strand breaks and the coupling of the gap filling DNA synthesis and DNA joining reactions that complete the microhomology-mediated pathway of nonhomologous end joining.

Mechanisms for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; BRCT, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 C terminus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; Pol, polymerase.1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; BRCT, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 C terminus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; Pol, polymerase. can be divided into two classes based on the requirement for DNA sequence homology. In the major homology-dependent pathway, repair involves an intact duplex that is homologous to the broken molecule. This is the major DSB repair pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is mediated by members of the RAD52 epistasis group that includesRAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54,RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, MRE11,XRS2, and RDH54/TID1 (1Sung P. Trujillo K. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Google Scholar). Alternatively, broken DNA ends are simply brought together, processed, and then ligated by repair mechanisms, known collectively as nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (2Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Google Scholar). Unlike the major recombinational repair pathway that faithfully restores the genetic information, nonhomologous end joining frequently causes genetic alterations that range from the loss or addition of a few nucleotides at the break site to gross rearrangements such as chromosomal translocations (2Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Google Scholar). Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have identified the products of the HDF1, HDF2, RAD50,MRE11, XRS2, DNL4, and LIF1genes as key players in the major NHEJ pathway (3–14). HDF1and HDF2 encode subunits of a heterodimeric DNA end-binding complex that is functionally homologous to the mammalian Ku70-Ku80 complex (3Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Congruent with genetic analysis in yeast, a recent biochemical study has reconstituted DNA end joining with the purified NHEJ factors Hdf1-Hdf2, Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2, and Dnl4-Lif1 and demonstrated functional interactions among these complexes (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). Recently, a novel yeast NHEJ gene, NEJ1, has been identified, but the exact role of this gene product in NHEJ remains to be determined (25Valencia M. Benetele M. Vaze M.B. Herrman G. Kraus E. Lee S.E. Schar P. Haber J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 666-669Google Scholar, 26Ooi S.L. Shoemaker D.D. Boeke J.D. Science. 2001; 294: 2552-2556Google Scholar, 27Kegel A. Sjostrand J.O. Astrom S.U. Curr.

Many of the genetic studies and the biochemical study with purified NHEJ factors have focused on the joining of linear DNA molecules with short complementary single strands at their termini (3Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Google Scholar, 4Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-5103Google Scholar, 7Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). However, the majority of DSBs generated by agents such as ionizing radiation will have ends that are neither complementary nor ligatable, indicating that end processing reactions will be critical for the repair of in vivo DSBs by NHEJ. In fact analysis of DNA molecules repaired by NHEJ has revealed that a favored mode of end processing involves short tracts of DNA sequence homology, so-called microhomologies, close to the break site that presumably facilitate alignment of the DNA ends (14Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2164-2173Google Scholar, 29Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Google Scholar, 30Kramer K.M. Brock J.A. Bloom K. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1293-1301Google Scholar). Following alignment, the processing of DNA ends by nucleases and DNA polymerases to remove noncomplementary nucleotides and fill-in gaps is likely to be required to generate ligatable termini (31Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Interestingly, biochemical studies with purified human Mre11 have shown that this nuclease can act on DNA ends to expose and align microhomologies that can then be ligated (33Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Google Scholar, 34Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of recircularization of linear plasmid DNA molecules with complementary single-strand ends in vivo is not affected by inactivation of yeast Mre11 nuclease activity (8Moreau S. Ferguson J.R. Symington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 556-566Google Scholar, 35Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6412-6425Google Scholar). This observation suggests that, although the nuclease activity of Mre11 may not be required for nonhomologous end joining, the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex has another critical role in this repair pathway. Indeed, recent biochemical studies have shown that the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex has end bridging activity and functionally interacts with the Dnl4-Lif1 complex (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have shown that pol4 andrad27 strains have no defect in the recircularization of linear plasmid DNA molecules with complementary single-strand ends but exhibit reduced joining of linearized plasmid DNA molecules with noncomplementary termini (31Wu X.

The S. cerevisiae POL4 open reading frame was amplified from BJ5464 genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. After the DNA sequence of the amplified product was verified, it was subcloned into theEscherichia coli expression plasmids pGSTag (46Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-868Google Scholar) and pET28b (Novagen) to generate the plasmids pGST-Pol4 and pET28b-Pol4, which express Pol4 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion and His-tagged polypeptide, respectively. Using a similar strategy we constructed the plasmids pGST-Pol4ΔBRCT and pET28b-Pol4ΔBRCT, which encode tagged versions of Pol4 lacking the N-terminal 112 amino acids encompassing the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 C terminus (BRCT) domain (see Fig. 1) that was originally identified in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 (47Koonin E.V.

Overnight cultures (100 ml) of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring either pET28b-Pol4 or pET28b-Pol4ΔBRCT were inoculated into 2 liters of LB medium containing kanamycin (0.025 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml) and grown at 37 °C. At an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth was continued at 25 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, the cleared lysate was supplemented with imidazole to a final concentration of 20 mm prior to incubation with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. His-tagged Pol4 polypeptides were eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and then further purified to near homogeneity by Resource Q and Resource S column chromatography. Approximately 40 μg of Pol4 and 30 μg of Pol4ΔBRCT were obtained from 2-liter cultures. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. An overnight culture (1 liter) of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring either pGST-Pol4 or pGST-Pol4ΔBRCT were inoculated into 10 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml) and grown at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth was continued at 25 °C for 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, GST fusion proteins were purified from the cleared lysate by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, gel filtration through a Superdex 75 column, and Resource S ion exchange chromatography. Approximately 30 μg of nearly homogenous GST-Pol4 was obtained from the 10-liter culture. A similar quantity of GST-Pol4ΔBRCT was obtained, but this preparation also contained two proteolytic fragments of the fusion protein. GST-BRCT and GST were purified to near homogeneity from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring either pGST-BRCT or pGSTag by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and gel filtration through a Superdex 75 column. His-tagged Lif1 and complexes containing either Dnl4 and Lif1 or His-tagged Lif1 and Dnl4 were purified from yeast cells as described previously (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). The lysates were prepared from the yeast strain BJ5464 and from the same strain harboring the plasmids pADH-Dnl4 and pYES-Lif1 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). The cells from 100-ml cultures were resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed by mechanical shearing with glass beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used immediately for pull-down assays. Labeled Dnl4 was synthesized from a pBKS-Dnl4 template using T7 RNA polymerase and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in the TNT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Dnl4 was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50Bardwell L. Cooper A.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3041-3049Google Scholar) and then resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (10 μl; Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with GST-Pol4, GST-Pol4ΔBRCT, GST-BRCT, or GST (10 μg of each) at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were used for the pull-down assays. To detect associations between Dnl4 and Pol4, beads with either GST-Pol4 or GST as the ligand were incubated with 1.5 ml of yeast lysate at 4 °C for 4 h. After collection by centrifugation, the beads were washed extensively with Buffer A and then incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences). The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). To detect a direct interaction between purified Dnl4-Lif1 complex and Pol4, beads (10 μl) with GST-Pol4, GST-Pol4ΔBRCT, or GST as the ligand were incubated with 0.5 μg of purified Dnl4-Lif1 complex (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar) in Buffer A containing 2% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl at 4 °C for 4 h. After collection by centrifugation, the beads were washed extensively with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and then incubated with [α-32P]ATP as described above. To further characterize the interaction between Dnl4 and Pol4, beads (10 μl) with the indicated ligand were incubated with labeled in vitro translated Dnl4 supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (22 μl) for 4 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed with Buffer A. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer to yield the eluate (E). After electrophoresis through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), labeled Dnl4 was detected using a PhosphorImager screen. Three oligonucleotides, 34M (5′-TCCTCAAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTG-3′, 34-mer), 5′32P-labeled 17M (5′-CAAGCTTGCATGCCTGC-3′, 17-mer), and 16M (5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAGGA-3′, 16-mer) were annealed by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 10 min, 40 °C for 10 min, 18 °C for 10 min, and then on ice for 5 min to generate a linear duplex with a single nucleotide gap. Linear duplexes with complementary single-strand ends were constructed by annealing the following pairs of oligonucleotides: 50M (5′-GTAACAAAGTTTGGATTGCTACTGACCGCTCTCGTGCTCGTCGCTGCGTT-3′, 50-mer) annealed to 41M (5′-GCGACGAGCACGAGAGCGGTCAGTAGCAATCCAAACTTTGT-3′, 41-mer) and 43M (5′-GCCTCGCGACGCATGACTCTAAAGGGTTCTAATAGTGAGACAG-3′, 43-mer) annealed to 5′ 32P-labeled 50MM (5′-GTCTGTCTCACTATTAGAACCCTTTAGAGTCATGCGTCGCGAGGCAACGC-3′, 50-mer). Alignment of the complementary single strands generates a nonligatable nick in the unlabeled strand and a single-nucleotide gap in the labeled strand (see Fig. 2 C). A similar strategy was used to construct pairs of duplexes with single-strand extensions that, when aligned, give differently sized gaps with and without single-strand flaps (see Fig. 3). Unless indicated, DNA concentrations are expressed as DNA molecules.Figure 3Effect of gap size and 5′ noncomplementary bases on DNA synthesis by Pol4. DNA duplexes with the labeled phosphate group indicated by an asterisk were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The structures of the labeled bottom strand generated by alignment of the complementary single strands are described. Pol4 (56 nm) was incubated with the indicated substrates (100 nm) at 25 °C for 2 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” After separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis, labeled oligonucleotides in the dried gel were detected by PhosphorImager analysis. Thearrows indicate the positions of substrates (S) and fill-in products of one, three, and five nucleotides (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Equal amounts of the labeled and unlabeled duplexes (100 nm) were incubated with Pol β, Pol4, Pol4ΔBRCT, and Dnl4-Lif1 as indicated in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm of each of the four dNTPs, and 1 mm ATP at 25 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 0.09% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.09% (w/v) xylene cyanol). After separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis, labeled DNA molecules in the dried gel were detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Linear duplexes with complementary single-strand ends were constructed by annealing the following pairs of oligonucleotides; 50M annealed to 5′-phosphorylated 41M and 5′-phosphorylated 43M annealed to 5′ 32P-labeled 51M (5′-GTCTGTCTCACTATTAGAACCCTTTAGAGTCATGCGTCGCGAGGCAACGCA-3′, 51-mer). Alignment of the complementary single strands generates a ligatable nick in both the unlabeled and labeled strand. Equal amounts of the labeled and unlabeled duplexes (100 nm) were incubated with Dnl4-Lif1 and, where indicated, Pol4 and Pol4ΔBRCT as described above. In assays to measure both DNA synthesis and ligation, the 5′ termini of unlabeled oligonucleotides were phosphorylated. Studies on the efficiency ofin vivo recircularization of linear plasmid DNA molecules with noncomplementary single-strand ends have implicated Pol4 in a subset of DNA joining events that involve end processing (32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated versions of Pol4 lacking the N-terminal BRCT domain (Fig. 1) were expressed as His-tagged polypeptides in E. coli and then purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). The DNA polymerase activity of Pol4 was compared with that of Pol β. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Pol4 and Pol β have similar gap filling activity on a DNA substrate containing a single-nucleotide gap. In contrast, Pol4 was at least 4-fold more effective at filling in a single-nucleotide gap generated by the alignment of linear duplex DNA molecules with complementary ends than Pol β (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 4 and5 with lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, it appears that this substrate specificity is an intrinsic property of the Pol4 catalytic domain because deletion of the BRCT domain had no significant effect on DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and5). Next we examined the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 on differently sized gaps generated by the alignment of linear duplex DNA molecules with complementary ends (Fig. 3). There was an inverse relationship between gap size and the amount of fully filled-in product (Fig. 3). The presence or absence of a phosphate group at the 5′ end of the gaps did not effect Pol4 DNA synthesis activity (data not shown). DNA synthesis by Pol4 was distributive, with the enzyme preferentially adding a single nucleotide, even with larger gaps. Although a ladder of products corresponding to incompletely filled gaps were detectable, the fully filled-in product was the most abundant species. With gaps sizes greater than a single nucleotide, strand displacement synthesis of one to two nucleotides occurred (Fig.3, compare lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, the presence of a short 5′ flap increased the amount of strand displacement DNA synthesis about 2-fold (Fig. 3, comparelane 3 with lanes 5 and 6). In summary, the DNA substrate specificity of Pol4 is compatible with itsin vivo role in DSB repair because small gaps, possibly with noncomplementary flaps, are predicted intermediates in the subpathway of NHEJ that involves microhomology-mediated alignment of DNA ends (31Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Google Scholar,32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). To detect associations between Pol4 and NHEJ factors, we expressed and purified Pol4 as a GST fusion protein (Fig.4 A, lane 2). In affinity chromatography experiments with extracts from a wild type yeast strain, no specific binding of the core NHEJ factors, Hdf1-Hdf2, Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2, and Dnl4-Lif1, to GST-Pol4 beads was observed (data not shown). We suspected that associations were not detected because of the low endogenous levels of NHEJ factors. Therefore, we performed a similar experiment with an extract from a strain overexpressing Dnl4-Lif1 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar) and observed the specific binding of Dnl4 to the GST-Pol4 resin (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether there is a direct interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1, glutathione beads with GST-tagged full-length Pol4 (Fig. 4 A,lane 2), GST-tagged Pol4 lacking the N-terminal BRCT domain (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), or GST (Fig. 4 A,lane 1) as the ligand were incubated with purified Dnl4-Lif1 that was then labeled by adenylation (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). The binding of Dnl4-Lif1 to the GST-Pol4 beads but not to either the GST-Pol4ΔBRCT or the GST beads (Fig. 4 C) demonstrates that these protein factors interact directly and suggests that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal BRCT domain of Pol4. In similar experiments, we did not observe specific binding of purified Lif1 to GST-Pol4 beads (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction is either mediated by Dnl4 or requires complex formation between Dnl4-Lif1. Because Lif1 is required for Dnl4 stability in yeast cells (9Herrmann G. Lindahl T. Schar P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4188-4198Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar), we examined the interaction of labeled in vitro translated Dnl4 with Pol4. Dnl4 bound to glutathione beads with either GST-Pol4 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) or a GST fusion protein with only the N-terminal BRCT domain of Pol4 (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) as the ligand but did not bind to glutathione beads with GST (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) as the ligand (Fig. 4 D). In similar experiments,in vitro translated Lif1 did not bind specifically to Pol4 beads (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that Pol4 interacts directly with the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4-Lif1 complex via its N-terminal BRCT motif. To elucidate the functional consequences of the interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1, we examined the effect of Dnl4-Lif1 on gap filling DNA synthesis catalyzed by Pol4. As shown in Fig.5 A, Dnl4-Lif1 greatly stimulates DNA synthesis by Pol4 on nonligatable gaps formed by the alignment of partial duplex oligonucleotides in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, Dnl4-Lif1 is much more effective at stimulating full-length Pol4 compared with either a truncated version of Pol4 lacking the BRCT motif (Fig. 5 A) or Pol β (data not shown). At a ratio of about 1:1, Dnl4-Lif1 increased Pol4-catalyzed DNA synthesis by 5–6-fold. When measured as a function of time, Dnl4-Lif1 increased both the rate and extent of Pol4-mediated DNA synthesis (Fig. 5 B). Again the effect on DNA synthesis was dependent on the BRCT domain of Pol4. These results demonstrate that the stimulation of Pol4 DNA synthesis activity is mediated, at least in part, by the protein-protein interaction between Dnl4-Lif1 and Pol4. Dnl4-Lif1 also stimulated gap filling DNA synthesis by Pol4 on a linear duplex containing a single nucleotide nonligatable gap in a BRCT domain-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). Because the stimulatory effect of Dnl4-Lif1 on DNA synthesis by Pol4 was similar whether the gap was within a linear DNA duplex or formed by the alignment of linear duplex DNA molecules with complementary ends (Fig. 5, A and C), it appears that the stimulation of Pol4 activity by Dnl4-Lif1 is mediated by mechanisms other than DNA end alignment. Finally, we examined whether the effect of Dnl4-Lif1 on the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 was influenced by either increased gap size or the presence of a 5′ flap. Dnl4-Lif1 stimulated the DNA synthesis activity of Pol4 on cohesive ended DNA molecules that when aligned form a three-nucleotide gap either without (Fig. 6 A) or with a three-nucleotide flap (Fig. 6 B) but did not significantly alter the distribution of reaction products.Figure 6The effect of Dnl4-Lif1 on Pol4 DNA synthesis at a three-nucleotide gap with and without 5′-noncomplementary nucleotides. A, effect of Dnl4-Lif1 concentration on DNA synthesis at a three-nucleotide gap. Pol4 (28 nm) and the indicated DNA duplexes (100 nm of each) that, when aligned, form a three-nucleotide gap in the labeled bottom strand were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with increasing amounts of Dnl4-Lif1 where indicated. B, effect of Dnl4-Lif1 concentration on DNA synthesis at a three-nucleotide gap with a 5′ flap. Pol4 (28 nm) and the indicated DNA duplexes (100 nm of each) that, when aligned, form a three-nucleotide gap with a three-nucleotide 5′ flap in the labeled bottom strand were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with increasing amounts of Dnl4-Lif1 where indicated. Lane 1, no protein; lane 2, no Dnl4-Lif1; lane 3, 1.25 nm Dnl4-Lif1; lane 4, 2.5 nm Dnl4-Lif1; lane 5, 5 nm Dnl4-Lif1; lane 6, 10 nmDnl4-Lif1; lane 7, 20 nm Dnl4-Lif1. After separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis, labeled oligonucleotides in dried gels were detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The arrows indicate the positions of the fill-in products (F, 51- and 53-mer) and substrate (S, 50-mer).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In assays with partial duplex oligonucleotides that when aligned form a ligatable structure, Dnl4-Lif1 exhibited a low activity that was stimulated by intact Pol4 (Fig.7 A) but not by the truncated version of Pol4 lacking the N-terminal BRCT domain. At a ratio of about 1:1, Pol4 increased Dnl4-Lif1-catalyzed DNA joining by about 2-fold. These results demonstrate that the stimulation of DNA joining by Dnl4-Lif1 is mediated, at least in part, by the protein-protein interaction between Dnl4-Lif1 and Pol4, but the magnitude of this effect is less than that of Dnl4-Lif1 on Pol4 DNA synthesis activity. These observations suggest that the interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 co-ordinates the gap filling DNA synthesis and ligation reactions that complete NHEJ. To provide support for this model, we compared the amount of ligated product produced by Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 in assays with oligonucleotide duplexes that when aligned either form a ligatable nick (Fig. 7 A) or a single nucleotide gap (Fig.7 B). As shown in Fig. 7 C, joining of the DNA substrate that requires both DNA synthesis and ligation (15 fmol) was significantly higher than the joining of the DNA substrate requiring only ligation (0.5–1 fmol). This synergistic effect indicates that the interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 not only enhances the catalytic activity of both these enzymes but co-ordinates their action, ensuring the efficient hand-over of pathway intermediates. The preferred pathway for the repair of in vivoDSBs by NHEJ appears to involve microhomologies that are presumably revealed by nucleolytic digestion (14Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2164-2173Google Scholar, 29Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Google Scholar, 30Kramer K.M. Brock J.A. Bloom K. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell.

After the alignment of short complementary sequences, it is likely that single-strand flaps are removed and gaps are filled in to generate ligatable structures (31Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Google Scholar, 32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies have revealed differences in the DNA substrate specificity of the catalytic domain of Pol4 compared with Pol β, the prototypic member of the Pol X DNA polymerase family (Fig. 1) (36Shimuzu K.

Biol. 2001; 68: 57-74Google Scholar) that are compatible with the predicted role of the POL4 gene product in end joining events that involve gap filling DNA synthesis (32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Specifically, Pol4 preferentially acts upon short gaps formed by the alignment of linear duplexes with complementary single-strand ends. Hdf1-Hdf2, Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2, and Dnl4-Lif1 complexes have been identified as critical factors in the major NHEJ pathway in yeast (3–14). Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 stimulates DNA joining both by aligning DNA ends and by recruiting Dnl4-Lif1 via a direct interaction between Xrs2 and Lif1 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA end joining mediated by these factors is dependent on Hdf1-Hdf2 at physiological salt concentrations, suggesting that Hdf1-Hdf2 binds to DNA ends and facilitates the subsequent recruitment of Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 and Dnl4-Lif1 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar). Although these in vitro studies involved DNA substrates with complementary single-strand ends, it seems likely that the same core factors will bring together noncomplementary DNA ends within a nucleoprotein complex and that the subsequent end-processing reactions to generate a ligatable structure will occur within the context of the nucleoprotein complex. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that the interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 not only increases the catalytic activity of both of these enzymes but also couples gap filling DNA synthesis with DNA joining. Because Dnl4-Lif1 stimulates Pol4 DNA synthesis on a gap within a linear duplex and the stimulatory effect of Pol4 on Dnl4-Lif1 is much lower than that of Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1 have robust end bridging activity. XRCC4, the human homolog of Lif1, preferentially binds to DNA ends and nicked DNA (52Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2017Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Lif1 binding to DNA nicks or gaps stabilizes the assembly of the DNA polymerase-DNA ligase complex in a manner analagous to the functional interaction between Pol β and XRCC1, the partner protein of DNA ligase IIIα, on nicked DNA (53Marintchev A. Mullen M. Maciejewski M.W. Pan B. Gryk M.R. Mullen G.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 884-893Google Scholar, 54Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljunquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Google Scholar). Analysis of the assembly of NHEJ factors at in vivo DSBs by chromatin immunoprecipitation has shown that the recruitment of Dnl4 to DSBs is dependent upon Hdf1-Hdf2 and Lif1 (55Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 165-168Google Scholar). Because inactivation of POL4 has no effect on the repair of DNA breaks with cohesive ends (32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar), it appears that the Hdf1-Hdf2, Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2, and Dnl4-Lif1 factors can form a functional nucleoprotein complex in the absence of Pol4. Thus, the recruitment of Pol4 to in vivo DSBs may be mediated via its interaction with Dnl4. Our biochemical studies demonstrating that the BRCT domain of Pol4 is critical for the interaction with Dnl4-Lif1 but not for Pol4 DNA synthesis activity provide a molecular explanation for genetic studies showing that N-terminal deletions inactivate Pol4 functionin vivo (32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Interestingly, several members of the Pol X family have an N-terminal BRCT domain (Fig. 1) (36Shimuzu K. Santocanale C. Ropp P.A.

In summary, Pol4 efficiently fills in short gaps formed by the alignment of complementary single strands at the ends of duplex DNA and is specifically stimulated by Dnl4-Lif1. It will be interesting to determine whether end bridging by Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 (24Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Google Scholar) will further stimulate the coupled DNA synthesis and ligation reaction mediated by Pol4 and Dnl4-Lif1. Moreover, genetic studies indicate that Pol4 participates in end joining events that require nucleolytic processing (32Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Google Scholar). Future studies are necessary to determine whether Pol4 specifically associates with and/or modulates the activity of nucleases such as Mre11 (33Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Google Scholar, 34Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Google Scholar) and Fen-1 (31Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

ClpS binds to ClpA, the regulatory component of the ClpAP complex. We report the crystal structure of ClpS in complex with the isolated N-terminal domain of ClpA in two different crystal forms at 2.3- and 3.3-Å resolution. The ClpS structure forms an α/β-sandwich and is topologically analogous to the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L7/L12. ClpS contacts two surfaces on the N-terminal domain in both crystal forms; the more extensive interface was shown to be favored in solution by protease protection experiments. The N-terminal 20 residues of ClpS are not visible in the crystal structures; the removal of the first 17 residues produces ClpSΔN, which binds to the ClpA N-domain but no longer inhibits ClpA activity. A zinc binding site involving two His and one Glu residue was identified crystallographically in the N-terminal domain of ClpA. In a model of ClpS bound to hexameric ClpA, ClpS is oriented with its N terminus directed toward the distal surface of ClpA, suggesting that the N-terminal region of ClpS may affect productive substrate interactions at the apical surface or substrate entry into the ClpA translocation channel.

AAA+ proteins are composed of modular functional domains (8Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar): one or two AAA+ modules that use binding and hydrolysis of ATP to couple conformational changes in the AAA+ protein to structural changes in associated macromolecular substrates and additional N- or C-terminal domains that appear to interact with substrates and to transduce the motion of the AAA+ protein into movements of or conformational changes in the substrate.AAA+ proteins also interact with adaptor proteins that mediate various functions.

Recently, a small adaptor-like protein, ClpS, has been shown to modulate activity ofE. coli ClpA (15Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). ClpS is a 106-residue protein encoded upstream of ClpA in most bacteria (16Gottesman S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7886-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpS protects ClpA from autodegradation and appears to redirect its activity away from soluble proteins and toward aggregated proteins (15Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol.

In particular, intracellular calcium levels increase during muscle activation and are thought to underlie fast-to-slow shifts in muscle gene expression. In the present work, we determined that increased intracellular calcium has a significant effect on the activity of the adult fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) promoters in the order of MyHC IIa ≫ IId/x > IIb. We have identified the pathways by which the calcium signal mediates increased activation of the MyHC IIa promoter. Inhibition of calcineurin or calcium-calmodulin kinase greatly attenuates ionophore-induced activation of the MyHC IIa promoter, whereas protein kinase C inhibitors have no effect. Inhibition and overexpression studies with members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family reveal roles for MEK1/MEK2 and MEKK1, but not p38 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Downstream mediators of these effects are the activities of the MEF-2 and NFAT transcription factors, whose binding sites in the MyHC IIa promoter are required for calcium-induced activation of the MyHC IIa promoter.

Mammalian skeletal muscle consists of a mosaic of different fiber types. Four distinct fiber types, one slow (type I) and three fast (IIa, IId/x, and IIb), are found in adult rodent skeletal muscle, and these differ with respect to their fatigability and their strength and speed of contraction. The functional, biochemical, and morphological differences between muscle fiber types arise as a result of different programs of fiber-specific gene expression that result in specific contractile, metabolic, cytoskeletal, and regulatory proteomes associated with each fiber type. Skeletal muscle fibers demonstrate remarkable plasticity, and shifts in fiber type can occur in response to a number of physiological and pathological conditions, including muscle adaptation, aging, and muscle disease (1Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Google Scholar). An increase in muscle activity such as endurance exercise training induces muscle fiber adaptations through qualitative and quantitative changes in fiber-specific contractile and metabolic gene expression that result in slower contracting, more oxidative muscle fibers (2Pette D. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 1984; 16: 517-528Google Scholar). The stimuli that induce these shifts in fiber-specific gene expression are currently not well defined. Likely candidates include many of the consequences of increased or prolonged muscle activation, including changes in the amount or pattern of muscle mechanical and electrical activity; changes in intracellular metabolites such as glycogen/glucose levels, hydrogen ions, or reactive oxygen species; and increased secretion of autocrine/paracrine factors. The amount and pattern of electrical activity induced in muscle fibers by the motoneuron have been postulated to play a prominent role in defining muscle gene expression and fiber type (3Buonanno A. Fields R.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 110-120Google Scholar). One of the most critical alterations in response to electrical activation of cells is an increase in intracellular calcium levels. Depolarization-induced increases in intracellular calcium and its effects on gene expression have been studied in a number of electrically active cell types, including cardiac myocytes, neurons, and pancreatic islet cells (4Miranti C.K.

These studies have also identified several signaling molecules involved in transducing the calcium signal, including serum response factor (SRF), 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; MEF-2, myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2; NFAT, nuclear factor/activator of T cells; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CaM kinase, calcium-calmodulin kinase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; MAP, mitogen activated protein; MEKK1, mitogen-extracellular kinase kinase-1. cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein, protein kinase C, and various members of the MAP kinase signaling family. Not surprisingly, several skeletal muscle genes are sensitive to electrical activity and/or intracellular calcium levels. Electrical stimulation of myotubes in culture up-regulates glycogen phosphorylase (9Vali S. Carlsen R. Pessah I. Gorin F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 184-199Google Scholar) but represses expression of the acetylcholine receptor (10Altiok N. Changeux J.-P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 333-338Google Scholar) and fast sarcoplasmic ATPase genes (11Thelen M.H.M. Simonides W.S. Hardeveld C. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 845-848Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular calcium up-regulate several skeletal muscle genes, including the myogenic regulatory factor Myf-5, the inward rectifying potassium channel, and the metabolic enzymes hexokinase II and cytochrome c(12Friday B.B.

With the exception of the K+ channel gene, this up-regulation appears to be induced primarily at the level of transcription (12Friday B.B. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 303-310Google Scholar, 13Shin K.S. Park J.-Y. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21227-21232Google Scholar, 14Freyssenet D. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. J. Biol.

In addition, recent evidence has implicated calcium signaling pathways in slow versus fast fiber gene expression. These studies have demonstrated that prolonged low amplitude increases in intracellular calcium, such as those produced by slow motoneurons, result in maximal activation of calcineurin, which in turn dephosphorylates members of the NFAT family of transcription factors, allowing them to activate the promoters of such slow-specific muscle genes as myoglobin and slow troponin I (16Chin E.R.

Transgenic mouse studies have also implicated calcineurin as well as CaM kinase and the MEF-2 family of transcription factors in the specification of slow/oxidative gene expression (17Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Google Scholar, 18Wu H. Kanatous S.B. Thurmond F.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4545-4548Google Scholar), although studies using plasmid DNA injection failed to find a role for calcineurin in the specification of slow or fast muscle gene expression in vivo(20Swoap S.J. Hunter R.B. Stevenson E.J. Mitchell-Felton H. Kansagra N.V. Lang J.M. Esser K.A. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C915-C924Google Scholar). Calcium-induced activation of calcineurin is also thought to underlie the fast-to-slow transitions in myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression, both in vitro and in vivo (21Kubis H.-P. Haller E.-A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Google Scholar, 22Meisner J.D. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. Scholz M. Kubis H.-P. J.

A. 2001; 98: 13108-13113Google Scholar). What is less clear is whether calcium signaling is involved in the transition between fast fiber subtypes. MyHC isoform transitions typically occur in a stereotypic pattern during muscle adaptation, moving sequentially from IIb to IId/x to IIa to type I (1Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Google Scholar). Is calcineurin involved only in the transition from fast to slow (i.e. from IIa to type I MyHC expression), or is calcineurin signaling required to move from IIb to IId/x and/or IId/x to IIa? The IIa MyHC isoform is expressed in fibers with a high oxidative enzyme profile more similar to that of type I MyHC-expressing fibers than IIb or IId/x MyHC-expressing fibers, making it attractive to hypothesize that IIa MyHC expression may share common elements with type I MyHC. We recently demonstrated that the upstream promoter region of the IIa MyHC gene was activated to a much greater extent by a constitutively active calcineurin construct than the IId/x or IIb MyHC promoters, suggesting that calcineurin signaling may play a role in transitions between fast subtypes and that IIa MyHC regulation may share common elements with type I MyHC expression (27Allen D.L. Sartorius C.A. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43524-43533Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether expression of the fast MyHC genes is also differentially sensitive to intracellular calcium or whether other signaling pathways are involved in transducing calcium-related signals into shifts in fast MyHC expression. We examined the responsiveness of isolated segments of the adult mouse skeletal MyHC promoters to calcium signaling in order to better understand the role of intracellular calcium in shifts in fast fiber-specific gene expression. We show that the adult skeletal MyHC upstream promoter regions are differentially sensitive to increased intracellular calcium, with IIa ≫ IId/x > IIb. We used overexpression constructs and pharmacological inhibitors to identify specific signaling pathways involved in calcium sensitivity of the IIa MyHC promoter. Our data suggest that changes in intracellular calcium may play a role in the shifts in fast MyHC expression occurring during increased muscle activation and identify several key intracellular pathways that may be involved in this augmentationin vivo. Generation of luciferase reporter constructs containing ∼1 kb of the mouse IIa, IId/x, and IIb MyHC promoter sequences was described previously (27Allen D.L. Sartorius C.A. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43524-43533Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 kb of the upstream promoter region for the IIa, IId/x, and IIb MyHC genes was subcloned into the firefly luciferase plasmid VR1255 (Vical). Site-directed mutagenesis of the MEF-2-binding AT-rich region 1, CArG-like box, and proximal NFAT site in the IIa MyHC promoter was accomplished using a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). “Sensor” constructs containing multimerized copies of the MEF-2 and NFAT binding sites were kindly provided by Dr. Eric Olson, whereas the multimerized SRE construct was obtained from Stratagene. Overexpression constructs for MEF-2C, NFAT, SRF, HDAC4, HDAC5, and MEF-2-interacting transcription repressor (MITR) were also provided by Dr. Eric Olson, whereas the CMV-MEKK1 construct was obtained from Stratagene. A differentiation-sensitive MEKK1 construct was created by Dr. Ulrika Widegren by placing the cDNA for constitutively active MEKK1 under the control of the IId/x MyHC promoter. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were grown on gelatin-coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were transfected at 70–80% confluence using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). In all experiments, the thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase construct pRLTK (Promega) was co-transfected to correct for transfection efficiency. Myoblasts were switched to differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% horse serum 1–2 days post-transfection. After 2 days of differentiation, myotubes were either treated with Me2SO vehicle alone or 0.4 μm of calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) for 1–2 days. A commercially available dual luciferase assay system was used (Promega). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer and 10 μl of the cell lysate was assayed for both firefly (MyHC promoter constructs and positive controls) andRenilla (internal control) luciferase activity using a standard luminometer. Values are reported as firefly luciferase divided by Renilla luciferase levels. C2C12 myotubes were treated with either vehicle or A23187 for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and then scraped in lysis buffer stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Equal protein concentrations were separated by gel electrophoresis using standard techniques. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a miniblot transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to the autophosphorylated form of CaM kinase II (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed several times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and then incubated for 2 h with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Promega). Binding was visualized using a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium kit (Vector Laboratories). Bands were densitometrically scanned using NIH Image. Nuclear extracts were isolated from differentiated control and A23187-treated C2C12myotubes using standard techniques (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 myoblasts were grown to confluence and allowed to differentiate for 2 days. The medium was removed, and cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A, respun, and resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A. Cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer A and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized with 3–5 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer type B. The resulting homogenate was stirred on ice for 30 min and then microcentrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) for 5 h. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The resulting nuclear extract was stored at −70 °C until use. Oligonucleotides containing the AT-rich-1 region or the proximal NFAT region of the IIa promoter were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used for mobility shift reactions. Briefly, 100,000 cpm of labeled probe was added to 10 μg of nuclear extract in a reaction containing 1 μg of dI-dC and binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% Ficoll) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction solution was then run on a 4% acrylamide gel at 300 V. The gel was then dried and placed on a PhosphorImager screen overnight. We tested the responsiveness of the three adult fast MyHC promoters to increased intracellular calcium in C2C12 myotubes. Ionophore treatment for 36 h induced much greater activation of both human and mouse IIa MyHC promoters (∼10–20-fold, respectively; Fig.1, A and B) than the mouse IId/x and IIb MyHC promoters (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the activity of the IIa MyHC promoter, which is associated with more oxidative fast fibers, was augmented to a greater extent by intracellular calcium than the IId/x and IIb MyHC promoters. We wished to examine whether IIa MyHC promoter activity could be increased in response to shorter periods of ionophore stimulation compared with the 36-h treatment used in Fig. 1. We used 1 and 4 h of ionophore stimulation and examined IIa MyHC promoter activity at several time points poststimulation. Ionophore stimulation of C2C12 myotubes for these shorter periods resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig. 1 D). With 1 h of ionophore stimulation, IIa promoter activity was not significantly activated at 0 or 1 h poststimulation but was significantly increased at 3 and 6 h poststimulation, increasing to about 2-fold over the unstimulated control (Fig. 1 D). By 12 h, IIa MyHC promoter activation was decreasing, and by 24 h post-stimulation IIa MyHC promoter activity had returned to base-line values (Fig. 1 D). With 4 h of ionophore stimulation, IIa MyHC promoter activity was significantly increased immediately upon cessation of ionophore stimulation and increased thereafter, reaching a peak of ∼4-fold stimulation over control at 6 h poststimulation (Fig. 1 D). After 12 h poststimulation, IIa MyHC promoter activity was decreasing but was still ∼2-fold elevated over control even at 24 h poststimulation. Thus, stimulation for 4 h produced a more rapid and higher peaking response compared with 1 h of ionophore stimulation and did not fully return to base line even 24 h after stimulation. Increased intracellular calcium activates at least three major signaling pathways: the calcineurin, CaM kinase, and protein kinase C pathways. We used pharmacological inhibitors for each of these pathways to determine their role in ionophore-induced activation of the IIa MyHC promoter. In addition, we tested the effects of calcineurin on endogenous MyHC IIa expression. Treatment with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, significantly attenuated ionophore activation of the IIa MyHC promoter in C2C12 myotubes (Fig.2 A), whereas overexpression of a constitutively activated form of calcineurin increased endogenous IIa MyHC protein expression (Fig. 2, B–D). Treatment of myotubes with KN62, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II, also significantly attenuated ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig.3 A). Following activation of CaM kinase II by calcium and calmodulin, the enzyme autophosphorylates, allowing it to remain active independent of calcium levels. Ionophore treatment also resulted in a moderate increase in the autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II at 1–3 h of ionophore treatment, but autophosphorylation was decreased at longer treatment durations (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, inhibitors of protein kinase C activity had no significant effect on ionophore-induced activation of the IIa MyHC promoter (Fig. 4). Staurosporine treatment tended to decrease ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activation, but the effect was highly variable and was not statistically significant; the largest effect was seen at the highest concentrations of staurosporine, which is less specific at high concentrations (Fig. 4 A). We therefore examined the effect of a more specific protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine, on ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activation. Treatment with chelerythrine had no effect on ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig. 4 B), confirming that protein kinase C is not involved in increasing IIa MyHC promoter activity in response to increased intracellular calcium. Together these data support a role for calcineurin and CaM kinase II but not protein kinase C in calcium-induced activation of the IIa MyHC promoter.Figure 3CaM kinase pathway and ionophore induction of IIa MyHC promoter activity.

Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with UO126 or PD098059, inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activators MEK1 and MEK1/2, respectively, significantly attenuated ionophore stimulation of IIa MyHC promoter activity, whereas SB230580, an inhibitor of p38, and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, did not (Fig.5 A). We also examined the effects of overexpression of MEKK1, an activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, on ionophore-induced IIa MyHC activation using both a viral (CMV) and a differentiation-specific (IId/x MyHC) promoter to drive MEKK1 expression. Co-transfection with CMV-MEKK1 almost completely abolished ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activation, whereas co-transfection with IId/x-MEKK1 augmented ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). Transfection of C2C12 myoblasts with the CMV-MEKK1 also resulted in a dramatic attenuation of myoblast differentiation into myotubes (Fig. 5 D), whereas IId/X-MEKK1 had no effect on differentiation (Fig. 5 E). Thus, the effect of MEKK1 on ionophore-induced promoter activity appeared to be differentiation-dependent; CMV-MEKK1 attenuated ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity indirectly by suppressing differentiation, whereas IId/x-MEKK1 did not affect myoblast differentiation and augmented IIa promoter activity, most likely through differentiation-independent mechanisms. We next examined the role of three transcription factor families implicated in calcium signaling pathways (MEF-2, NFAT, and SRF) on IIa MyHC promoter activation by ionophore treatment. Putative binding sites for all three factors are present in the IIa upstream promoter region (27Allen D.L. Sartorius C.A. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43524-43533Google Scholar). Co-transfection of MEF-2C or NFAT3 without ionophore treatment resulted in a small but consistent augmentation of IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig. 6,A and B), as reported previously (27Allen D.L. Sartorius C.A. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43524-43533Google Scholar), whereas co-transfection with SRF without ionophore treatment resulted in a 3-fold increase in IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig.6 C). When combined with ionophore treatment, co-transfection of MEF-2C or NFAT3 resulted in a significant enhancement compared with ionophore treatment alone (Fig 6, A and B). In contrast, co-transfection with SRF did not alter ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity when compared with treatment with ionophore alone (Fig. 6 C). Activation of MEF-2 transcription factors by CaM kinase is thought to be mediated through phosphorylation and removal of class II HDACs from the nucleus (29McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.-L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of HDAC co-transfection on ionophore activation of the IIa MyHC promoter. Co-transfection with HDAC4, HDAC5, or MITR resulted in a significant attenuation of ionophore-induced IIa MyHC activation (Fig.6 D). Together with the MEF-2 co-transfection data, these results support a role for MEF-2 as well as NFAT in ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activation. We examined whether the effect of MEF-2 and/or NFAT was a direct one due to binding of these transcription factors to the IIa MyHC promoter or was an indirect consequence of MEF-2 and/or NFAT activation of other genes. To answer this question, we used “sensor” constructs containing multimerized consensus binding sites for MEF-2, NFAT, and SRF. Consistent with the co-transfection data, activity of the MEF-2 and NFAT sensor constructs was significantly increased by ionophore treatment, but SRF sensor activity was not (Fig.7 A). Together, these data strongly support a role for MEF-2 and NFAT but not SRF in ionophore-induced activation of the IIa MyHC promoter. We used mutagenesis to alter the putative binding sites for these factors within the 677-bp IIa MyHC promoter and transfected C2C12 myoblasts with these constructs to determine their role in ionophore-induced activation. Mutation or internal deletion of the MEF-2-binding AT-rich site or mutation of the proximal NFAT site resulted in a significant attenuation of ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activation (Fig. 7 B). Deletion of the MEF-2 site and mutation of the NFAT site in the same construct did not further attenuate ionophore-induced IIa MyHC promoter activity (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that other sites contribute to this activation. Mutation of the CArG-like site had no effect on ionophore-induced activation of the IIa MyHC promoter (Fig.7 B). We examined whether ionophore treatment resulted in changes in the binding activity of MEF-2 and/or NFAT proteins to their respective binding sites on the IId promoter. Mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides containing the MEF-2-binding AT-rich-1 region of the IIa MyHC promoter demonstrated increased formation of three complexes with nuclear extract proteins isolated from ionophore-treated C2C12 myotubes compared with extract from control C2C12 myotubes (Fig.8 A). Based on previous research (30Lakich M.M. Diagana T.T. North D.L. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15217-15226Google Scholar), 2D. L. Allen and L. A. Leinwand, unpublished results. the upper binding activity is actually a doublet likely to represent binding of MEF-2 family members in the uppermost band, whereas the slightly lower band represents Oct-1 binding. The addition of a polyclonal antibody against MEF-2 results in a supershift of the uppermost band in the complex (Fig. 8 A, lane 4,Iono Ab). The third, lower complex probably represents a palindrome-binding protein (Pal-BP) previously identified by Lakich et al. (30Lakich M.M. Diagana T.T. North D.L. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15217-15226Google Scholar). Binding of all three protein complexes is greater in ionophore-treated myotube nuclear extract compared with untreated myotube nuclear extracts (Fig. 8 A). Mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides containing the proximal NFAT binding region showed much lower binding activity than the MEF-2 oligonucleotides; Fig.8 B is taken at a much higher exposure than Fig.8 A, suggesting that NFAT binding is much lower than MEF-2 binding in both control and ionophore-treated myotubes. Based on previously published studies on NFAT binding, it is likely that the uppermost binding activi"

The sequence of ST6Gal II encoded a protein of 529 amino acids, and it showed 48.9% amino acid sequence identity with human ST6Gal I. Recombinant ST6Gal II exhibited α2,6-sialyltransferase activity toward oligosaccharides that have the Galβ1,4GlcNAc sequence at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups, but it exhibited relatively low and no activities toward some glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively. It is concluded that ST6Gal II is an oligosaccharide-specific enzyme compared with ST6Gal I, which exhibits broad substrate specificities, and is mainly involved in the synthesis of sialyloligosaccharides. The expression of the ST6Gal II gene was significantly detected by reverse transcription PCR in small intestine, colon, and fetal brain, whereas the ST6Gal I gene was ubiquitously expressed, and its expression levels were much higher than those of the ST6Gal II gene. The ST6Gal I gene was also expressed in all tumors examined, but no expression was observed for the ST6Gal II gene in these tumors. The ST6Gal II gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q11.2-q12.1), and it spans over 85 kb of human genomic DNA consisting of at least eight exons and shares a similar genomic structure with the ST6Gal I gene.

Cell surface carbohydrate chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids are considered to play important roles in a variety of biological phenomena, such as cell-cell communication, cell-substrate interaction, adhesion, and protein targeting.

The sialylglycoconjugates of glycoproteins and glycolipids also vary according to the tissue and cell type and are subject to change during development and oncogenesis (1Paulson J.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of sialylglycoconjugates, a family of glycosyltransferases called sialyltransferases catalyzes the transfer of a sialic acid from CMP-Sia to an acceptor carbohydrate. All mammalian sialyltransferases characterized to date have type II transmembrane topology and contain highly conserved motifs called sialyl motifs L (long), S (short), and VS (very short) (2Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sialyl motif L is characterized by a 45–60-amino acid region in the center of the protein, and it has been shown to be involved in the binding of a donor substrate, CMP-Sia (5Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Sialyl motif S is located in the COOH-terminal region and consists of a 20–30-amino acid stretch. It has been shown to be involved in the binding of both the donor and acceptor substrates (6Datta A.K. Sinha A. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9608-9614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Sialyl motif VS is also located in the COOH-terminal region, within which one glutamic acid residue is always found separated by four amino acid residues from a highly conserved histidine residue. This motif is thought to be involved in the catalytic process (4Geremia R.A. Harduin-Lepers A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kabata S. Arita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the high sequence conservation of sialyl motifs L and S, PCR-based cloning of sialyltransferase cDNAs has been performed extensively (reviewed in Refs. 8Tsuji S. J.

So far, cDNA cloning of 19 members of the mammalian sialyltransferase family has been performed, and they have been grouped into four families according to the carbohydrate linkages they synthesize: β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal I-VI), β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I), GalNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc I-VI), and α2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia I-VI) (14Takashima S.

This structure is found mainly in N-linked glycans, but it has also been found in some O-glycans, glycosphingolipids, and sialyloligosaccharides. It has also been known as the ligand for the B cell-specific lectin, CD22/Siglec-2 (16Powell L.D. Sgroi D. Sjoberg E.R. Stamenkovic I. Varki A. J. Biol.

Investigation of ST6Gal I knock-out mice showed that they are viable but are deficient in cell surface Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc structures and exhibit hallmarks of severe immunosuppression (22Hennet T. Chui D. Paulson J.C. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4504-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These mice displayed reduced serum IgM levels, impaired B cell proliferation in response to IgM and CD40 cross-linking, and attenuated antibody production to T-independent and T-dependent antigens. Deficiency of ST6Gal I was further found to alter phosphotyrosine accumulation during signal transduction from the B lymphocyte antigen receptor. These data reveal that ST6Gal I and its corresponding product of the Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc structures are essential in promoting B lymphocyte activation and immune function. Although ST6Gal I knock-out mice lost ST6Gal activity to the background level, there remained a possibility that other ST6Gal enzymes exist that produce low levels of Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure or exhibit different substrate specificity from that of ST6Gal I. Recent progress of the human genome project enables us to detect another ST6Gal gene. We report here cloning and expression of the second type of human β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal II) that has preference for synthesizing sialyloligosaccharides. Fetuin, asialofetuin, bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM; type I-S), α1-acid glycoprotein, ovomucoid, lactosyl ceramide (LacCer), GA1, GM3, GM1a, CMP-NeuAc, Galβ1,3GalNAc, Galβ1,3GlcNAc, Galβ1,4GlcNAc, β-galactosidase (from bovine testes), and Triton CF-54 were purchased from Sigma. Paragloboside and lactose were from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). CMP-[14C]NeuAc (12.0 GBq/mmol, 925 kBq/ml) was from Amersham Biosciences. Lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-neotetraose, and sialidases (NANase I and II) were from Glyko Inc. (Novato, CA). [α-32P]dCTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Asialo-BSM, asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein, and asialo-ovomucoid were prepared as described previously (23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Human expressed sequence tags (EST; GenBankTM accession numbers BE612797,BE613250, and BF038052) and human genomic sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AC005040, AC016994, andAC108049) with similarity to human ST6Gal I were identified using the tBLASTn algorithm against the dbEST and high throughput genomic sequence databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, respectively. The EST clones were obtained from the Image Consortium. To obtain the entire coding region, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using primer sets, 5′-TTGGAATTCTCATCATGATGTCCATGTGC-3′ (nucleotides 1491–1519 in Fig. 1 A, the synthetic EcoRI site being underlined) and 5′-ACTTTGAGTACAACAGTAGTACC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1797–1819) and 5′-CAGATTCTGACCAACCCCAG-3′ (nucleotides 1214–1233) and 5′-CAAGAATTCCAATGAAACCAGAAGATGGTG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1473–1502, the syntheticEcoRI site being underlined), with the first strand cDNA of human colon (human multiple tissue cDNA panels; Clontech) as a template. The above PCRs were performed as follows: 94 °C for 60 s, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products and EST clones were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector and combined. The nucleotide sequence was convinced by the dideoxy termination method using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We constructed an expression vector encoding the soluble ST6Gal II. The XhoI site was introduced at the nucleotide position 268 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using a primer, 5′-TCATCTACTTCACCTCGAGCAACCCCGCTG-3. Then theXhoI fragment encoding a truncated form of ST6Gal II (lacking the first 32 amino acids of the coding region) was prepared and subcloned into the XhoI site of the expression vector pcDSA. The resulting plasmid, designated pcDSA-ST6Gal II, encodes a soluble fusion protein consisting of the IgM signal peptide, theStaphylococcus aureus protein A IgG-binding domain, and the truncated form of ST6Gal II. The expression vector of the soluble ST6Gal II (short form) was constructed as described above except using the cDNA encoding short form of ST6Gal II as a template for PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and was designated pcDSA-ST6Gal II/short. The expression vector of the soluble ST6Gal I was constructed as follows. The DNA fragment encoding the whole coding region of human ST6Gal I was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TTATGATTCACACCAACCTGAAG-3′ (nucleotides 309–331 of GenBankTM accession number NM_003032) and 5′-GCCTGTGCTTAGCAGTGAATG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1519–1539) with human liver cDNA as a template and cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector. Then the 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment encoding a truncated form of ST6Gal I (lacking the first 43 amino acids of the coding region) was prepared and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDSA, which was designated pcDSA-ST6Gal I. We also constructed an expression vector containing the whole coding region of ST6Gal II. The 1.8-kb HindIII fragment containing the whole coding region of ST6Gal II was prepared from the cloned cDNA and subcloned into the HindIII site of the expression vector pRc/CMV, which was designated pRc/CMV-ST6Gal II. For production of soluble forms of sialyltransferases, COS-7 cells were transfected with the above pcDSA vectors using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) and cultured as described previously (23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein A-fused sialyltransferases expressed in the medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose gel (Amersham Biosciences) and used as the enzyme source. Sialyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (25Kono M. Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29366-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Lee Y.-C. Kaufmann M. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kono M. Takashima S. Kurosawa N. Liu H. Pircher H.

In brief, enzyme activity was measured in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton CF-54, 100 μm CMP-[14C]NeuAc, an acceptor substrate, and an enzyme preparation in a total volume of 10 μl. As acceptor substrates, 10 μg of glycoproteins, 5 μg of glycolipids, or 10 μg of oligosaccharides were used. The enzyme reaction was performed at 37 °C for 3–20 h. For glycoproteins, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the reaction mixtures were subjected directly to SDS-PAGE. For glycolipids, the reaction mixtures were applied to a Sep-Pak Vac C18 column (100 mg; Waters, Milford, MA), and purified glycolipids were subjected to high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Silica-Gel 60; Merck) with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10). For oligosaccharides, the reaction mixtures were directly subjected to HPTLC with a solvent system of 1-propanol, aqueous ammonia, and water (6:1:2.5). The radioactive materials were visualized and quantified with a Fuji BAS2000 radioimage analyzer. The intensity of the radioactivity was converted into moles using the radioactivities of various amounts of CMP-[14C]NeuAc (12.0 GBq/mmol, 925 kBq/ml) as standards. Quantification was performed within the linear range of the standard radioactivity. For kinetic analysis, the reaction was performed as described above except using various concentrations of acceptor substrates. Under these conditions, the product formation from the individual acceptor substrates was linear up to 4 h. Kinetic parameters were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. For linkage analysis of sialic acids, [14C]NeuAc-incorporated Galβ1,4GlcNAc with ST6Gal I or II was digested with β-galactosidase (from bovine testes; Sigma) or linkage-specific exosialidase: NANase I (specific for α2,3-linked sialic acids; Glyko, Inc.) or NANase II (specific for α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids; Glyko, Inc.). After the above treatment, reaction mixtures were subjected to HPTLC with a solvent system of 1-propanol, aqueous ammonia, and water (6:1:2.5). The radioactive materials were visualized with the BAS2000 radioimage analyzer. Relative expression levels of ST6Gal I and II mRNAs were estimated by RT-PCR using human multiple tissue cDNA panels (Clontech) as templates. For the analysis of ST6Gal II gene expression, ST6Gal II-specific primers 5′-AGACGTCATTTTGGTGGCCTGGG-3′ (nucleotides 1264–1286) and 5′-TTAAGAGTGTGGAATGACTGG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1745–1765) were used. For the analysis of ST6Gal I gene expression, ST6Gal I-specific primers 5′-TTATGATTCACACCAACCTGAAG-3′ (nucleotides 309–331 of GenBankTM accession number NM_003032) and 5′-CTTTGTACTTGTTCATGCTTAGG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 658–680) were used. As a control, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) gene expression was also measured using G3PDH-specific primers 5′-GGATCCACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (27Takashima S. Tachida Y. Nakagawa T. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed as follows: 94 °C for 60 s, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for ST6Gal I and II genes and 25 cycles for G3PDH gene and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and then visualized under UV light. Using the human expressed sequence tag and high throughput genomic sequence databases, we found some sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers BE612797,BE613250, and BF038052 (EST clones) and AC005040, AC016994, andAC108049 (genomic sequences)) with similarity to human ST6Gal I. These sequences were distinct from those of the sialyltransferases cloned previously, suggesting that these clones encode a novel member of the sialyltransferase family. The above EST clones were obtained from the Image Consortium, but these clones did not contain the expected entire coding sequence of the novel sialyltransferase. As these EST clones were considered to lack the DNA sequence encoding the COOH-terminal region of the new sialyltransferase, we performed RT-PCR to obtain it with the human colon first strand cDNA as a template. However, we could not amplify the target sequence as a single DNA fragment at first, so we amplified it as two DNA fragments (nucleotides 1214–1502 and 1491–1819 in Fig. 1 A), and each fragment was cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) vector. Then these fragments were combined using a synthetic EcoRI site, which does not change encoded amino acids. It should be noted that later we could amplify the corresponding region as a single fragment by RT-PCR with another primer set (see Fig. 5), and this fragment encoded the same amino acid sequence with the above clone. From the plasmid containing the combined DNA fragment, the 0.5-kbAatII-XhoI fragment was prepared, and this was ligated into the AatII-XhoI sites of the plasmid containing the EST clone BE612797, and the DNA fragment encoding the new sialyltransferase having the expected amino acid sequence was obtained. The nucleotide sequence of the putative new sialyltransferase cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1 A. The predicted protein consists of 529 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 60,157 Da and with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The position of the initiation codon was estimated according to the Kozak consensus sequence (28Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17088) Google Scholar) indicated one prominent hydrophobic sequence of 19 amino acids in length in the NH2-terminal region, predicting that the protein has type II transmembrane topology characteristic of many other glycosyltransferases cloned to date (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with those of other human sialyltransferases showed significant sequence identity in two regions, sialyl motifs L (41.7–65.9%) and S (26.1–56.5%). The overall amino acid sequence of the predicted protein showed the highest sequence identity with ST6Gal I (48.9%) (Fig. 2). These results strongly suggest that the predicted protein belongs to the sialyltransferase family, especially the ST6Gal-family. Thus, we tentatively designated the new sialyltransferase as ST6Gal II. It is striking that the stem region of ST6Gal II, which is located between the transmembrane domain and the active domain, is very long like mouse, chicken, and human ST6GalNAc I (30Kurosawa N.

Tsuda T. Nishimura S. Tsuji S. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We also found by extensive database searches that ST6Gal II is related closely to KIAA1877 proteins (GenBankTM accession numbersAB058780 and XM_038616), whose cDNA clones were isolated as one of unidentified human genes by a sequencing project (33Nagase T. Nakayama M. Nakajima D. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The exon 1 of the AB058780 clone is different from that of the ST6Gal II gene (Fig.1 A). The start codon of the AB058780 clone is not identified, but this clone has essentially the same amino acid sequence with ST6Gal II except it has five additional amino acid residues in its NH2-terminal region. The XM_038616 clone has been reported as a protein consisting of 463 amino acids that shares the COOH-terminal 234 amino acids with ST6Gal II at first. The differences in the NH2-terminal region were caused by frame shifts of the coding region. However, this sequence was updated recently, and it was shown that the XM_038616 clone has the same amino acid sequence with ST6Gal II. In addition, there is a splicing variant of ST6Gal II that has short different amino acid sequence in the COOH-terminal region and lacks most of the sialyl motif S (GenBankTMaccession numbers BC008680 and BE613250; see Fig. 1 A,Short form). To facilitate determination of the enzymatic activity of the new sialyltransferase, we constructed the expression plasmid pcDSA-ST6Gal II, which allows expression of ST6Gal II lacking the transmembrane domain as a secretable protein fused with the IgG-binding domain ofS. aureus protein A. The plasmid was then transfected into COS-7 cells, and the protein A-fused ST6Gal II expressed in the medium was adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose resin, which was used as the enzyme source. For comparative analysis, the protein A-fused ST6Gal II short form and ST6Gal I were also prepared. As shown in TableI and Fig.3, ST6Gal II exhibited activity toward oligosaccharides Galβ1,4GlcNAc and lacto-N-neotetraose, both of which have Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. The apparent K m values of ST6Gal II for Galβ1,4GlcNAc and lacto-N-neotetraose were estimated to be 0.71 and 0.48 mm, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of ST6Gal I for Galβ1,4GlcNAc (2–10 mm) (34Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, Japan2001: 295-300Google Scholar). However, ST6Gal II did not exhibit activity toward oligosaccharides such as Galβ1,3GalNAc, Galβ1,3GlcNAc, lactose, and lacto-N-tetraose, all of which do not contain Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. ST6Gal II also exhibited relatively low activity toward some glycoproteins, which are considered to have Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure at the nonreducing end of their carbohydrate groups. However, ST6Gal II did not exhibit activity toward glycolipids examined in this study, including paragloboside, which has Galβ1,4GlcNAc structure at the nonreducing end of its carbohydrate group. We also examined the enzymatic activity of the short form of ST6Gal II lacking most of the sialyl motif S (Fig. 1 A), but it exhibited no sialyltransferase activity (Fig. 3).Table IAcceptor substrate specificity of human ST6Gal I and IIAcceptorsRepresentative structures of carbohydratesRelative rate (%)ST6Gal IIST6Gal IOligosaccharidesType IIGalβ1,4GlcNAc100*100**Type IGalβ1,3GlcNAc04.2Type IIIGalβ1,3GalNAc00LactoseGalβ1,4Glc08.7Lacto-N-tetraoseGalβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc031.1Lacto-N-neotetraoseGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc86.2101.6GlycoproteinsFetuinNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr013.0NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3(NeuAcα2,6)GalNAc-O-Ser/ThrNeuAcα2,6(3)Galβ1,4GlcNAc-RAsialofetuin3.995.0BSMNeuAcα2,6GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr00GlcNAcβ1,3(NeuAcα2,6)GalNAc-O-Ser/ThrAsialo-BSM00OvomucoidNeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R09.0Asialoovomucoid012.7αl-Acid glycoproteinNeuAcα2,6(3)Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R1.237.1Asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein1.293.0GlycolipidsLactosylceramideGalβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer00GA1Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer00GM1aGalβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer00GM3NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer00ParaglobosideGalβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1-Cer00.3Various acceptor substrates were incubated in the standard assay mixture using soluble sialyltransferase fused with protein A as an enzyme source.

However, the utility of RNAi as a method of gene knock-down in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons remained unknown. Here, we asked if RNAi might be utilized to allow the assessment of the biological function of a specific gene in the nervous system. We employed a U6 promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce hairpin RNA-triggered RNAi to characterize the role of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) in the neuronal activity-dependent survival of granule neurons of the developing rat cerebellum. We found that the expression of MEF2A hairpin RNAs leads to the efficient and specific inhibition of endogenous MEF2A protein expression in primary cerebellar granule neurons. We also found that RNAi of MEF2A reduces significantly MEF2 response element-mediated transcription in granule neurons and inhibits activity-dependent granule neuron survival. Taken together, our RNAi experiments have revealed that MEF2A plays a critical role in activity-dependent neuronal survival. In addition, our findings indicate that RNAi does operate in postmitotic mammalian neurons and thus offers a rapid genetic method of studying gene function in the development and function of the mammalian nervous system.

Since its discovery in Caenorhabditis elegans (1Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar), RNAi has become a powerful and widely used tool for the analysis of gene function in many systems, including fungi, plants, andDrosophila (2Cogoni C.

A. 1999; 96: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have revealed that cells contain an evolutionarily conserved RNAi machinery that triggers the cleavage of double-stranded RNAs into 21- or 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs then hybridize to their cognate mRNA, thereby inducing the specific degradation of the target mRNA.An ultimate goal of RNAi studies is to knock down mammalian gene expression in the intact organism in a tissue-specific manner. Recently, the introduction of synthetic siRNAs in mammalian cells has been demonstrated to induce specific gene silencing (4Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although RNAi has been used successfully in a number of cell lines (4Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J.

To begin to address this issue, it is essential to assess whether the RNAi machinery functions efficiently in postmitotic mammalian neurons.In this study, we addressed the question of the utility of RNAi in mammalian neurons by specifically disrupting the endogenous expression of a transcription factor in primary granule neurons cultured from the developing rat cerebellum. In previous studies employing dominant negative strategies, members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of proteins have been suggested to contribute to neuronal survival (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E.

A. 2000; 97: 7561-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, because a dominant interfering form of a transcription factor has the potential to block the activity of all proteins within the family of the transcription factor of interest, this approach does not allow the assessment of the function of a specific family member. The MEF2 transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D are expressed in the central nervous system (18Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,19Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the MEF2 proteins, MEF2A is highly expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and is regulated postranslationally in these neurons upon neuronal activity (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific role of MEF2A in activity-dependent granule neuron survival remained to be characterized.We sought to determine the role of MEF2A in activity-dependent granule neuron survival by the RNAi method. We employed a recently developed DNA vector-based technique (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) in which siRNAs are processed from a short RNA hairpin (hpRNA) transcribed under the control of the polymerase III U6 promoter. We found that the expression of MEF2A hpRNAs dramatically reduces the expression of endogenous MEF2A protein in primary cerebellar granule neurons and thereby inhibits MEF2-dependent transcription and granule neuron survival. Our findings support two conclusions. 1) RNAi can be employed to suppress gene expression and function in primary postmitotic neurons of the developing mammalian central nervous system. 2) Among the known MEF2 transcription factors, MEF2A is required for activity-dependent cerebellar granule neuron survival.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether RNAi might be induced in primary mammalian neurons, we used a DNA vector-based RNAi method to target the transcription factor MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. To assess whether vector-based RNAi can mediate specific gene silencing in primary neurons by way of comparison with RNAi of MEF2A, we also targeted the transcription factor NeuroD. Both MEF2A and NeuroD are highly expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and are therefore easily detected immunocytochemically (18Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Miyata T. Maeda T. Lee J.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 27Lee J.K. Cho J.H. Hwang W.S. Lee Y.D. Reu D.S. Suh-Kim H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The U6/mef2a and U6/nd1 constructs (Fig.1) were designed as described in Suiet al. (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and encode two hpRNAs that target the MEF2A and NeuroD mRNA, respectively. The 22-nucleotide-long target sequences were chosen because they have no significant homology with other known genes, including the other members of the MEF2 and NeuroD families (Fig. 1 C). We first examined whether transcribed hpRNAs specifically reduce the expression of the cognate gene when expressed in a neuronal cell line. Neuro2A cells were transfected with the control vector (U6), U6/mef2a, or the U6/nd1 construct together with an expression plasmid encoding MEF2A (Fig.2 A) or FLAG-tagged NeuroD (Fig. 2 B). The expression of MEF2A and NeuroD in transfected Neuro2A cells was measured 3 days after transfection by Western analysis using a rabbit antibody that recognizes MEF2A or a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-NeuroD. The expression of MEF2A hpRNA in Neuro2A cells led to a dramatic reduction in the level of coexpressed MEF2A protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) but had no effect on the expression of NeuroD (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). Similarly, the expression of NeuroD hpRNA in Neuro2A cells resulted in the reduction of NeuroD expression to background levels (Fig. 2 B, lane 6) but did not alter MEF2A expression (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). These results indicate that the MEF2A and NeuroD hpRNAs block, respectively, the expression of exogenous MEF2A and NeuroD, effectively and specifically.We then determined the utility of vector-based RNAi to knock-down endogenous gene expression in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from P6 rat pups and transfected at 2 DIV using a modified calcium phosphate transfection method (25Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with the U6, U6/mef2a, or U6/nd1 RNAi construct together with an expression plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Three days after transfection, cultures were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit antibody to MEF2A or a goat antibody to NeuroD and a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase immunoreactivity was used to identify transfected neurons. In untransfected granule neurons and neurons transfected with the U6/control vector, robust endogenous MEF2A or NeuroD immunoreactivity was detected in the nucleus (Fig.3, A and B). By contrast, in neurons transfected with the U6/mef2a construct, endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity was barely detected (Fig.3 A, white arrowhead). Similarly, transfection of granule neurons with the U6/nd1 construct suppressed effectively the expression of endogenous NeuroD (Fig. 3 B,white arrowhead).To assess the efficiency of vector-based RNAi silencing in the granule neurons, we quantitated the percentage of transfected neurons that contained a high level of expression of endogenous MEF2A or NeuroD. At least 150 neurons per condition were scored in three independent experiments (Fig. 3 C). Whereas 90% of vector-transfected granule neurons contained high endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity, only 30% of the MEF2A hpRNA-expressing granule neurons displayed high endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity. In the case of the NeuroD RNAi, the difference in endogenous NeuroD immunoreactivity between vector-transfected and NeuroD hpRNA-expressing granule neurons was even more dramatic (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, the expression of NeuroD hpRNA had no effect on endogenous MEF2A expression in granule neurons (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, the MEF2A hpRNA did not alter the expression of endogenous NeuroD in granule neurons (Fig.3 D). Together, these findings indicate that vector-based RNAi inhibits, efficiently and specifically, endogenous gene expression in cerebellar granule neurons.The finding that RNAi of MEF2A triggers the knock-down of MEF2A expression in granule neurons led us to examine the biological role of endogenous MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. Members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors mediate membrane depolarization-induced transcription in neurons via the MEF2-response element (MRE) that is found within the promoter of MEF2-responsive genes (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of MEF2-dependent transcription in membrane-depolarized granule neurons by dominant interfering forms of MEF2 triggers apoptosis, suggesting that members of the MEF2 family mediate activity-dependent survival of granule neurons (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the specific role of the family member MEF2A in activity-induced MRE-dependent transcription and neuronal survival remained to be elucidated.To characterize the biological role of MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons, we first determined the effect of MEF2A hpRNA on MRE-mediated transcription in granule neurons (Fig.4 A). Granule neuron cultures (P6 + 2 DIV) were transfected with a MEF2-specific reporter containing three MREs upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (3×MREfluc) together with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene to serve as a control for transfection efficiency. Cerebellar granule neuron cultures were then exposed to elevated levels of potassium chloride that induce membrane depolarization and the consequent activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (23Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the expression of the 3×MRE flucreporter gene was measured. The activity of the 3×MRE flucreporter gene was significantly reduced in neurons transfected with the MEF2A RNAi construct as compared with neurons transfected with the U6 vector (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the expression of the NeuroD hpRNA failed to reduce the activity of the MRE luciferase reporter gene. These results suggest that MEF2A mediates MRE-dependent transcription in membrane-depolarized cerebellar granule neurons.In a second set of experiments, we determined the effect of MEF2A RNAi on the survival of cerebellar granule neurons upon membrane depolarization. At 2 days after transfection with the RNAi constructs, at the time that luciferase assays were carried out, there was little if any difference in survival between vector control and U6/mef2a-transfected neurons (data not shown). However, we found that the expression of MEF2A hpRNA reduced significantly the survival of membrane-depolarized cerebellar granule neurons at 4 and 5 days after transfection (Fig. 4 B). To rule out the possibility of a nonspecific toxic effect of MEF2A hpRNA on cell survival secondary to the production of hpRNA, we tested the effect of hpRNA targeting the unrelated gene cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2). The cdk2 hpRNA were shown to specifically reduce the expression ofcdk2 (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). By contrast with MEF2A hpRNA, the expression of cdk2 hpRNA in granule neurons had no detectable effect on activity-dependent granule neuron survival. Taken together, these results suggest that MEF2A is required for activity-dependent cerebellar granule neuron survival.To sum up, we have found that the RNAi machinery functions efficiently in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons. As a result, the vector-based RNAi method allowed us to determine the specific function of the transcription factor MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. We found that knock-down of MEF2A suppresses activity-induced MRE-mediated transcription and granule neuron survival. Together, these results suggest that MEF2A plays a critical role in the development of cerebellar granule neurons. In future studies, knock-down of MEF2A in neurons should facilitate the identification of MEF2A-responsive genes that mediate activity-dependent neuronal survival.Our findings have several implications. Because of its relative simplicity, the vector-based RNAi method should provide a rapid means of analysis of gene function in primary cultures of mammalian neurons. Because of the specificity of RNAi in reducing the expression of a target gene, one can assess the biological role of a particular member of a given protein family, a task that is often difficult to achieve by standard dominant negative approaches. Finally, because RNAi operates in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons, RNAi is likely to be of utility in the study of the nervous system in the intact mammalian organism and thus precede or complement a gene knock-out strategy.

Since its discovery in Caenorhabditis elegans (1Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11567) Google Scholar), RNAi has become a powerful and widely used tool for the analysis of gene function in many systems, including fungi, plants, andDrosophila (2Cogoni C.

A. 1999; 96: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have revealed that cells contain an evolutionarily conserved RNAi machinery that triggers the cleavage of double-stranded RNAs into 21- or 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs then hybridize to their cognate mRNA, thereby inducing the specific degradation of the target mRNA. An ultimate goal of RNAi studies is to knock down mammalian gene expression in the intact organism in a tissue-specific manner. Recently, the introduction of synthetic siRNAs in mammalian cells has been demonstrated to induce specific gene silencing (4Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although RNAi has been used successfully in a number of cell lines (4Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J.

To begin to address this issue, it is essential to assess whether the RNAi machinery functions efficiently in postmitotic mammalian neurons. In this study, we addressed the question of the utility of RNAi in mammalian neurons by specifically disrupting the endogenous expression of a transcription factor in primary granule neurons cultured from the developing rat cerebellum. In previous studies employing dominant negative strategies, members of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of proteins have been suggested to contribute to neuronal survival (14Mao Z.

However, because a dominant interfering form of a transcription factor has the potential to block the activity of all proteins within the family of the transcription factor of interest, this approach does not allow the assessment of the function of a specific family member. The MEF2 transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D are expressed in the central nervous system (18Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,19Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the MEF2 proteins, MEF2A is highly expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and is regulated postranslationally in these neurons upon neuronal activity (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M.

We sought to determine the role of MEF2A in activity-dependent granule neuron survival by the RNAi method. We employed a recently developed DNA vector-based technique (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We found that the expression of MEF2A hpRNAs dramatically reduces the expression of endogenous MEF2A protein in primary cerebellar granule neurons and thereby inhibits MEF2-dependent transcription and granule neuron survival. Our findings support two conclusions. 1) RNAi can be employed to suppress gene expression and function in primary postmitotic neurons of the developing mammalian central nervous system. 2) Among the known MEF2 transcription factors, MEF2A is required for activity-dependent cerebellar granule neuron survival. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether RNAi might be induced in primary mammalian neurons, we used a DNA vector-based RNAi method to target the transcription factor MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. To assess whether vector-based RNAi can mediate specific gene silencing in primary neurons by way of comparison with RNAi of MEF2A, we also targeted the transcription factor NeuroD. Both MEF2A and NeuroD are highly expressed in cerebellar granule neurons and are therefore easily detected immunocytochemically (18Lin X. Shah S. Bulleit R.F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Lyons G.E. Micales B.K. Schwarz J. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. J.

Lee Y.D. Reu D.S. Suh-Kim H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The U6/mef2a and U6/nd1 constructs (Fig.1) were designed as described in Suiet al. (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and encode two hpRNAs that target the MEF2A and NeuroD mRNA, respectively. The 22-nucleotide-long target sequences were chosen because they have no significant homology with other known genes, including the other members of the MEF2 and NeuroD families (Fig. 1 C). We first examined whether transcribed hpRNAs specifically reduce the expression of the cognate gene when expressed in a neuronal cell line. Neuro2A cells were transfected with the control vector (U6), U6/mef2a, or the U6/nd1 construct together with an expression plasmid encoding MEF2A (Fig.2 A) or FLAG-tagged NeuroD (Fig. 2 B). The expression of MEF2A and NeuroD in transfected Neuro2A cells was measured 3 days after transfection by Western analysis using a rabbit antibody that recognizes MEF2A or a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-NeuroD. The expression of MEF2A hpRNA in Neuro2A cells led to a dramatic reduction in the level of coexpressed MEF2A protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) but had no effect on the expression of NeuroD (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). Similarly, the expression of NeuroD hpRNA in Neuro2A cells resulted in the reduction of NeuroD expression to background levels (Fig. 2 B, lane 6) but did not alter MEF2A expression (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). These results indicate that the MEF2A and NeuroD hpRNAs block, respectively, the expression of exogenous MEF2A and NeuroD, effectively and specifically.We then determined the utility of vector-based RNAi to knock-down endogenous gene expression in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from P6 rat pups and transfected at 2 DIV using a modified calcium phosphate transfection method (25Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with the U6, U6/mef2a, or U6/nd1 RNAi construct together with an expression plasmid encoding β-galactosidase. Three days after transfection, cultures were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit antibody to MEF2A or a goat antibody to NeuroD and a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase immunoreactivity was used to identify transfected neurons. In untransfected granule neurons and neurons transfected with the U6/control vector, robust endogenous MEF2A or NeuroD immunoreactivity was detected in the nucleus (Fig.3, A and B). By contrast, in neurons transfected with the U6/mef2a construct, endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity was barely detected (Fig.3 A, white arrowhead). Similarly, transfection of granule neurons with the U6/nd1 construct suppressed effectively the expression of endogenous NeuroD (Fig. 3 B,white arrowhead).To assess the efficiency of vector-based RNAi silencing in the granule neurons, we quantitated the percentage of transfected neurons that contained a high level of expression of endogenous MEF2A or NeuroD. At least 150 neurons per condition were scored in three independent experiments (Fig. 3 C). Whereas 90% of vector-transfected granule neurons contained high endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity, only 30% of the MEF2A hpRNA-expressing granule neurons displayed high endogenous MEF2A immunoreactivity. In the case of the NeuroD RNAi, the difference in endogenous NeuroD immunoreactivity between vector-transfected and NeuroD hpRNA-expressing granule neurons was even more dramatic (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, the expression of NeuroD hpRNA had no effect on endogenous MEF2A expression in granule neurons (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, the MEF2A hpRNA did not alter the expression of endogenous NeuroD in granule neurons (Fig.3 D). Together, these findings indicate that vector-based RNAi inhibits, efficiently and specifically, endogenous gene expression in cerebellar granule neurons.The finding that RNAi of MEF2A triggers the knock-down of MEF2A expression in granule neurons led us to examine the biological role of endogenous MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. Members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors mediate membrane depolarization-induced transcription in neurons via the MEF2-response element (MRE) that is found within the promoter of MEF2-responsive genes (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of MEF2-dependent transcription in membrane-depolarized granule neurons by dominant interfering forms of MEF2 triggers apoptosis, suggesting that members of the MEF2 family mediate activity-dependent survival of granule neurons (14Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,15Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the specific role of the family member MEF2A in activity-induced MRE-dependent transcription and neuronal survival remained to be elucidated.To characterize the biological role of MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons, we first determined the effect of MEF2A hpRNA on MRE-mediated transcription in granule neurons (Fig.4 A). Granule neuron cultures (P6 + 2 DIV) were transfected with a MEF2-specific reporter containing three MREs upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (3×MREfluc) together with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene to serve as a control for transfection efficiency. Cerebellar granule neuron cultures were then exposed to elevated levels of potassium chloride that induce membrane depolarization and the consequent activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (23Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the expression of the 3×MRE flucreporter gene was measured. The activity of the 3×MRE flucreporter gene was significantly reduced in neurons transfected with the MEF2A RNAi construct as compared with neurons transfected with the U6 vector (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the expression of the NeuroD hpRNA failed to reduce the activity of the MRE luciferase reporter gene. These results suggest that MEF2A mediates MRE-dependent transcription in membrane-depolarized cerebellar granule neurons.In a second set of experiments, we determined the effect of MEF2A RNAi on the survival of cerebellar granule neurons upon membrane depolarization. At 2 days after transfection with the RNAi constructs, at the time that luciferase assays were carried out, there was little if any difference in survival between vector control and U6/mef2a-transfected neurons (data not shown). However, we found that the expression of MEF2A hpRNA reduced significantly the survival of membrane-depolarized cerebellar granule neurons at 4 and 5 days after transfection (Fig. 4 B). To rule out the possibility of a nonspecific toxic effect of MEF2A hpRNA on cell survival secondary to the production of hpRNA, we tested the effect of hpRNA targeting the unrelated gene cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2). The cdk2 hpRNA were shown to specifically reduce the expression ofcdk2 (11Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). By contrast with MEF2A hpRNA, the expression of cdk2 hpRNA in granule neurons had no detectable effect on activity-dependent granule neuron survival. Taken together, these results suggest that MEF2A is required for activity-dependent cerebellar granule neuron survival.To sum up, we have found that the RNAi machinery functions efficiently in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons. As a result, the vector-based RNAi method allowed us to determine the specific function of the transcription factor MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. We found that knock-down of MEF2A suppresses activity-induced MRE-mediated transcription and granule neuron survival. Together, these results suggest that MEF2A plays a critical role in the development of cerebellar granule neurons. In future studies, knock-down of MEF2A in neurons should facilitate the identification of MEF2A-responsive genes that mediate activity-dependent neuronal survival.Our findings have several implications. Because of its relative simplicity, the vector-based RNAi method should provide a rapid means of analysis of gene function in primary cultures of mammalian neurons. Because of the specificity of RNAi in reducing the expression of a target gene, one can assess the biological role of a particular member of a given protein family, a task that is often difficult to achieve by standard dominant negative approaches. Finally, because RNAi operates in primary postmitotic mammalian neurons, RNAi is likely to be of utility in the study of the nervous system in the intact mammalian organism and thus precede or complement a gene knock-out strategy. To determine whether RNAi might be induced in primary mammalian neurons, we used a DNA vector-based RNAi method to target the transcription factor MEF2A in cerebellar granule neurons. To assess whether vector-based RNAi can mediate specific gene silencing in primary neurons by way of comparison with RNAi of MEF2A, we also targeted the transcription factor NeuroD.

https://openalex.org/W1972959673,"The recent characterization of an acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) from the fresh water snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, shows it to be a structural homolog of the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). To ascertain whether the AChBP exhibits the recognition properties and functional states of the nAChR, we have expressed the protein in milligram quantities from a synthetic cDNA transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The protein secreted into the medium shows a pentameric rosette structure with ligand stoichiometry approximating five sites per pentamer. Surprisingly, binding of acetylcholine, selective agonists, and antagonists ranging from small alkaloids to larger peptides results in substantial quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Using stopped-flow techniques, we demonstrate rapid rates of association and dissociation of agonists and slow rates for the α-neurotoxins. Since agonist binding occurs in millisecond time frames, and the α-neurotoxins may induce a distinct conformational state for the AChBP-toxin complex, the snail protein shows many of the properties expected for receptor recognition of interacting ligands. Thus, the marked tryptophan quenching not only documents the importance of aromatic residues in ligand recognition, but establishes that the AChBP will be a useful functional as well as structural surrogate of the nicotinic receptor.

Recently, an acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP)1 from the fresh water snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, has been characterized, crystallized, and its structure determined (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

The crystal structure shows virtually all of the features predicted from a host of affinity labeling, site-specific mutagenesis, and subunit assembly studies conducted on the nicotinic receptor for over 2 decades (1Karlin A.

Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), details on its ligand specificity, binding kinetics, and conformational changes remain unknown. These questions are critical to ascertaining whether the snail protein has the recognition properties and conformational states to serve as a functional as well as a structural surrogate of the extracellular domain of the nicotinic receptor. To this end, we have expressed the binding protein in a mammalian system from a chemically synthesized cDNA of 637 bp. The cDNA contains restriction sites at various locations to allow for substitution of encoding receptor segments into the cDNA template of the binding protein. Upon ligand binding, AChBP shows major changes in fluorescence emitted from five tryptophans on each subunit, providing an intrinsic detection system to monitor the stoichiometry and kinetics of ligand binding. We synthesized seven double-stranded oligonucleotides between 80 and 126 bp reflecting codon usage in mammalian cells and containing appropriate overhangs for ligation (6Itakura K. Hirose T. Crea R. Riggs A.D. Heyneker H.L. Bolivar F. Boyer H.W. Science. 1977; 198: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). These were assembled into three ligation products that were then inserted into construction vectors and their sequence confirmed by automated sequencing. After digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes followed by band isolation, the inserts were ligated into a p3×FLAG-CMV-9 expression vector (Sigma) containing a preprotrypsin leader peptide followed by a N-terminal 3×FLAG epitope. 2Supplemental information on the sequences employed is available at www.medicine.ucsd.edu/pharmaco/ptaylor.html. The expression plasmid also contained neomycin acetyltransferase for clonal selection. Transfection of the plasmid into human embryonic kidney cells produced an epitope-attached glycoprotein secreted primarily into the medium. Selection with G418 yielded a stable cell line secreting AChBP. Ultraculture medium (Bio Whittaker) was collected at 3-day intervals from multitier flasks for several weeks. Adsorption onto a FLAG antibody column followed by elution with the 3×FLAG peptide yielded purified protein in quantities between 1 and 2.5 mg/liter. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluoromax 2 fluorometer (Instruments S. A., Inc., Edison, NJ). AChBP was excited at 280 nm and emission intensity monitored for 0.1-s intervals at unitary wavelengths between 337 and 343 nm. Stopped-flow measurements were obtained using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV (Leatherhead, UK) stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. Excitation was at 280 nm, and a cut-off filter at 305 nm was used to collect the fluorescence signal. Measurements of binding of the dansyl choline analogues employed 280 nm excitation and measured the enhanced fluorescence using a 420-nm cut-off filter. Rates of association and dissociation were estimated from the slope and ordinate intercept of plots of overall rate of fluorescence change versus ligand concentration. Dissociation rates were also estimated in several cases by reacting the preformed complex with a large excess of gallamine in the stopped-flow instrument and observing the time course of the increase in fluorescence. Purification of AChBP secreted into the medium produced a single band on SDS gels migrating at ∼35 kDa (Fig.1 a). Treatment with PNGase to remove N-linked oligosaccharides enhances the migration rate considerably. N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry after deglycosylation yielded a sequence and mass consistent with cleavage of the leader peptide. Negative staining electron microscopy showed typical rosette structures expected of a pentameric subunit assembly (Fig. 1, b and c). Hydrodynamic analysis revealed a Stokes radius of 57 Å from gel filtration and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.9 S from sucrose density gradients; values were also consistent with pentamer formation. Stoichiometry of ligand binding was estimated from AChBP tryptophan quenching through titration by high affinity ligands (Fig.2). In separate preparations, this yielded values of 4.7–5.6 mol/mol of pentamer or 0.94 to 1.1 mol/mol of 26,551-dalton subunit based on quantitative amino acid analysis. These data show with epibatidine as a high affinity ligand ∼50% quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, a typical quenching value for most of the quaternary and tertiary amines used in this study. Since these ligands, with the exception of the dansyl choline derivatives, lack the spectral overlap with tryptophan emission necessary for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (7Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2 Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 185-210Crossref Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of quenching is unknown. However, at least two (Trp-53 and Trp-143) and perhaps a third (Trp-82) of the five tryptophans are found in proximity to the bound ligand (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V.

Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Upon binding of ligands lacking the capacity for FRET, tryptophan fluorescence quenching has also been observed for acetylcholinesterase (9Radić Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4622-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); its binding site is at the base of a narrow gorge whose base and walls are lined with aromatic residues (10Sussman J.L.

In the muscle and α7 nAChR, residue substitution of tryptophans homologous to residues 53 and 143 reduces ligand affinity, but does not eliminate binding (11Galzi J.L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiery A.

Systematic substitution of other aromatic residues for the five tryptophans should enable one to delineate further their individual contributions to quenching of fluorescence. Stopped-flow kinetic studies of ligand association are shown in Fig.3; data for several ligands, monitored by AChBP fluorescence quenching, are tabulated in TableI. Rates of association and dissociation approach the time resolution of the stopped-flow technique (∼1 ms). A comparison of agonists shows that the bimolecular rates of agonist binding approach the diffusion limitation and the rate constants found in single channel or voltage-current relaxation analyses for the muscle or neuronal nicotinic receptor (15Colquhoun D.

Rates of dissociation are slower than dissociation of ligand from the activatible receptor, but of nearly the same magnitude as dissociation from the open channel state, and more rapid than dissociation from the presumed desensitized state (15Colquhoun D. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 369: 501-557Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 16Figl A. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Cohen B.N. J. Gen.

Hence, agonists bind and dissociate with rates expected from electrophysiologic studies for an open channel state of the receptor. In fact, certain residues in the transmembrane span of the receptor have been shown to enhance dissociation of ligands from the activatible, closed channel state of the receptor (21Wang H.L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, the AChBP structure may resemble more closely the open channel conformation of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (22Unwin N. Miyazawa A., Li, J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol.

S.E. values reflect values from three or more measurements. Where S.E. values are not shown, values reflect an average of two measurements. Given the proposed role for AChBP in scavenging the neurotransmitter in synapses (4Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), an association rate for acetylcholine similar to that found for the receptor would be expected to achieve efficient function. Also, the kinetic constants for the antagonist,d-tubocurarine, are of comparable magnitude with those found electrophysiologically for the receptor (23Wenningmann I. Dilger J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 790-796PubMed Google Scholar). No evidence for appreciable cooperativity of binding was found in the kinetic profiles. Epibatidine and α-bungarotoxin have equilibrium dissociation constants for AChBP that differ by only an order of magnitude, yet the rate of association for the peptide antagonist is ∼200-fold slower than for the nicotinic agonist (Table I). If the association reactions for α-bungarotoxin are run at higher concentrations, two steps in the reaction are evident with the rapid step being bimolecular- and concentration-dependent. The unimolecular step (k 2 = 0.34 s−1) shows a small enhancement in fluorescence that diminishes, but does not eliminate, the overall fluorescence quenching. The slower α-neurotoxin kinetics of association, which also has been well documented in nicotinic receptors from several species (24Weiland G. Georgia B. Lappi S. Chignell C.F. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7648-7656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brockes J.P. Hall Z.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2092-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Wang G.K. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11156-11162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the linked unimolecular step seen here are suggestive of the α-bungarotoxin locking the AChBP into a distinctive conformational state. The single tryptophan in α-bungarotoxin has ∼2% of the fluorescence intensity of the five tryptophans in each AChBP subunit. The fluorescence change in the slow step could emerge from enhanced fluorescence of the single tryptophan of the toxin in the complex or a slight enhancement of the AChBP tryptophans after formation of the intial complex. Irrespective of the tryptophans contributing to the signal differences, the slower unimolecular isomerization points to differing positions of the tryptophans in the initial complex and the final equilibrium state. The tris-quaternary antagonist, gallamine, when associated with the receptor, results in an enhancement of the tryptophan fluorescence, suggesting that the stabilization of this ligand may differ from the other agonists and antagonists studied. The three triethylammonioethyl groups that emanate from the pyrogallol ring probably preclude full insertion of the ring into the aromatic pocket. Rather stabilization involving the quaternary ammonium ligands and anionic moieties at the subunit interface account for the different binding orientation of gallamine, resulting in fluorescence enhancement (Fig. 4). Since gallamine binding appears mutually exclusive with the other agonists and antagonists listed in Table I, reaction of the various ligand-AChBP complexes with gallamine by stopped-flow provided a valuable means of confirming the dissociation rates of the various antagonists (Table I), as well as measuring the stoichiometry of ligand binding for ligands that quench to a lesser extent than epibatidine (Fig. 2). Quite apart from establishing ligand specificity for the AChBP, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching affords a universal means of directly following ligand binding to the AChBP without the necessity of developing competition studies with radioactive or fluorescent ligands. Substitution of sequences unique to particular receptor subtypes may allow one to examine selectivity of various AChBP-receptor chimeric sequences fashioned after the neuronal or muscle subtypes of receptor. The ligand binding kinetics seen with the AChBP reveals similarities to kinetics anticipated for ligand binding to the many subtypes of nicotinic receptor. Physical measurements in solution should enable one to correlate conformation with kinetic parameters of ligand recognition, and add another dimension to investigating specificity of this unique binding protein in relation to the larger family of receptor-related offspring."

Results have shown that pyridoxal kinase, as an enzyme obeying random sequential kinetics in catalysis, does not possess a lid shape structure common to all kinases in the ribokinase superfamily. This finding has been shown to be in line with the condition that pyridoxal kinase binds substrates with variable sizes of chemical groups at position 4 of vitamin B6 and its derivatives. In addition, the enzyme contains a 12-residue peptide loop in the active site for the prevention of premature hydrolysis of ATP. Conserved amino acid residues Asp118 and Tyr127 in the peptide loop could be moved to a position covering the nucleotide after its binding so that its chance to hydrolyze in the aqueous environment of the active site was reduced. With respect to the evolutionary trend of kinase enzymes, the existence of this loop in pyridoxal kinase could be classified as an independent category in the ribokinase superfamily according to the structural feature found and mechanism followed in catalysis.

Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used for: PLP, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; THZ, 4-methy-5-β-hydroxyethylthiazole; HMPP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate. is a key cofactor in the metabolism of amino acid. It catalyzes a large array of reactions in the synthesis, catabolism, and interconversion of amino acids (1Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mammals cannot synthesize PLP de novo and require its precursors in the form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine) from their diet. In the presence of Zn2+ and ATP, pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the precursor vitamins in tissues (2McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 263: 2085-2088Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and plays a key role in the synthesis of the active coenzyme PLP (Fig.1). PLP synthesized in liver is transported to other tissues through the blood stream. It must be dephosphorylated before gaining entry to target cells and rephosphorylated again by intracellular pyridoxal kinase after diffusion through cell membranes. PLP can be trapped and accumulated in the target cells by this mechanism. Consequently, there is a requirement for ubiquitous expression of pyridoxal kinase in mammalian tissues (4Hanna M.C. Turner A.J. Kirkness E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10756-10760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Genes that encode pyridoxal kinase are also found in many other species including yeast and bacteria (5Yang Y. Zhao G. Winkler M.E. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1996; 141: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang Y. Tsui H.C. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLP plays an important role in the nervous systems of mammals, as many neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid are synthesized by PLP-dependent enzymes (7Dakshinamurti K. Paulose C.S. Viswanathan M. Siow Y.L. Sharma S.K. Bolster B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Changes in PLP concentration in cells influence the stability of the nervous system. The side effects of many drugs that act upon the nervous system may be the result of alterations in pyridoxal kinase, leading to the fluctuation of the normal PLP concentration. This fluctuation breaks the equilibrium of neurotransmitter concentration and induces neurological disorders (8Ubbink J.B. Vermaak W.J. Delport R. Serfontein W.J. Bartel P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 585: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,9Shetty K.T. Gaitonde B.B. Exp. Neurol. 1980; 70: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Drugs that inhibit pyridoxal kinase have been classified into three groups according to their different inhibitory mechanisms (10Laine-Cessac P. Cailleux A. Allain P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A model for transporter-enhanced delivery of bioactive compounds has been proposed based on the broad specificity of pyridoxal kinase. In this model, a drug or other intracellular effector bearing an amine functional group gains facilitated entry into cell after it forms a stable transportable compound with pyridoxal, and then it is liberated by the intracellular pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine-5′-phosphate (11Zhang Z.M. McCormick D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10407-10410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pyridoxal kinases have been purified from different tissues, and several genes that encode pyridoxal kinase have also been determined. Properties of the substrate-binding sites have been explored by using different inhibitors (12Kwok F. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 93: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12136-12140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some essential residues in the proximity of the enzyme active site have been determined with chemical modification methods (14Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6489-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Scholz G. Kwok F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4318-4321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dominici P. Scholz G. Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arrangement of substrates at the active site was also studied by means of fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy (17Kwok F. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Wolkers W.F. Gregory J.D. Churchich J.E. Serpersu E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20761-20766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although crystallization and preliminary crystallography studies in the trigonal form have been reported (19Arnone A. Rogers P. Scholz G. Kwok F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4322-4323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of pyridoxal kinase was not known. Pyridoxal kinase from sheep brain is a homodimer with each monomer containing 312 amino acid residues. The dimer can dissociate reversibly into catalytically active monomers (20Kwok F. Scholz G. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The inhibition kinetic patterns of the reaction catalyzed by pyridoxal kinase are consistent with a rapid equilibrium random BiBi mechanism (21Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 780-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this article, we describe the three-dimensional structures of both pyridoxal kinase and its enzyme-ATP complex. The crystal structure of pyridoxal kinase reveals that the enzyme is being classified as a member of the ribokinase superfamily (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Compared with other kinases in this superfamily, brain pyridoxal kinase has some unusual features. It does not contain a lid-shaped structure that is common in other kinases. This new feature is designed to accommodate many substrates, which include all three forms of vitamin B6(pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine) as well as other B6 analogues (2McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. J. Biol.

On the other hand, brain pyridoxal kinase follows an unusual random mechanism of substrate addition (21Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 780-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than the ordered one for which the structural basis had been elucidated in detail by early studies on ribokinase and adenosine kinase (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 298: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our current studies on a loop present in pyridoxal kinase provide the first structural explanation for the random mechanism in this superfamily. An evolutionary pathway has been suggested for the kinases in ribokinase superfamily based on the morphological difference of an active site lid (25Cheng G. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the structure and properties of pyridoxal kinase indicate a new category evolutionary development in this superfamily. Pyridoxal kinase was isolated and purified from sheep brain as described (1Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystals of pyridoxal kinase were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method as reported previously (26Li M.H. Kwok F. An X.M. Chang W.R. Lau C.K. Zhang J.P. Liu S.Q. Leung Y.C. Jiang T. Liang D.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1479-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was adjusted at 10 mg ml−1 in 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 5.8. The enzyme solution was mixed in equal volumes with 1.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.8, and equilibrated against this solution at 17 °C. After 1 month, crystals were grown until final dimensions were reached. The crystals belong to the space group P212121 witha = 59.8 Å, b = 94.4 Å,c = 128.2 Å. They were transferred to a mother liquid consisting of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mNa2SO4, and 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, and then heavy atom soaks were performed. The enzyme-ATP complex was obtained by soaking crystals overnight in a solution containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mm zinc acetate, 30% polyethylene glycol 6000, and 75 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4, pH 6.5. All data were collected at room temperature. The native data sets were collected with a Weissenberg camera on Beamline BL6B at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The data sets from heavy atom derivatives of pyridoxal kinase and the pyridoxal kinase-ATP complex were collected using the MAR345 image plate in the National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules (Beijing, China). All data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Issacs N. Bailey S. Sawyer L. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend.

Refinement was carried out using the program CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

A model was rebuilt manually according to a composite omit density map. After several cycles of refinement and rebuilding, as well as the addition of 211 water molecules, a final model with an R-factor of 0.195 and an R free of 0.224 was reached (Table I). Assessment of the final model using the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that 92.7% of the residues were in the most favorable region and no residue were in the disallowed region. The structure of the pyridoxal kinase-ATP complex was solved by the difference Fourier method using the native structure as the model. After rigid body refinement of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit, the calculated Fo − Fcmap clearly displayed the density of the ATP molecules (Fig. 5,a and b). The model was refined using the CNS program and rebuilt using an omit density map. The finalR-factor was 0.196, and the R free was 0.225 (Table I). The three-dimensional structure of pyridoxal kinase has revealed that there are two identical monomers related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2 a). Each monomer contains 9 α-helices, 10 β-strands, and 3 segments of 310 helices. The 10 β-strands form a central β-sheet flanked by α2, α3, α4, α5, α6 on one side and α1, α7, α8, α9 on the other side. This fold is similar to the core structure of the ribokinase superfamily (Fig. 2, b andc), which includes ribokinase (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L.

Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity, the amino acid identity between pyridoxal kinase and any of these kinases is low, and only part of the sequence can be aligned. The structure of pyridoxal kinase represents a new family in this superfamily. Superimposition of the three-dimensional structures results in only 191 of 312 residues of pyridoxal kinase being structurally equivalent to the residues in HMPP kinase with a root-mean-square distance of 2.2 Å for the Cα atoms. The dimeric structure of pyridoxal kinase is formed by the two monomers in asymmetrical unit through hydrogen bonding and salt bridges as well as hydrophobic interactions between the α1, α9, β1, and β3 of both monomers. The buried area of the two monomers is 3860 Å2, and each monomer contributes about 1930 Å2 corresponding to 13.6% of the total area of one monomer. Each monomeric unit of pyridoxal kinase contains an active site, which does not overlap in the interface of monomers (Fig.2 a). Biochemical studies on pyridoxal kinase also showed that the dissociating monomer of this enzyme retained activity (20Kwok F. Scholz G. Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The biological implications for dimerization of pyridoxal kinase is still not clear from the structural point of view. In addition, there is no evidence concerning possible cooperativity or allosteric control of this kinase between subunits. The structure of the pyridoxal kinase-ATP complex reveals that each monomer binds an ATP molecule. After binding to the protein, ATP is located in a shallow groove formed by the ends of β strands β6, β7, β8, and β9 and helices α7 and α8 on the enzyme surface (Fig. 4, c and d). The location of the shallow groove is consistent with a previous report on its shape as viewed by electronic microscopy (1Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Superimposition of the enzyme in the absence of ATP and the enzyme-ATP complex reveals that all of the main chain conformations except those residues from B117 to B128 of pyridoxal kinase show little change upon binding of ATP (Fig. 4 b). In the ATP-binding site, we observed that only the side chain of Met233 changes its position, to avoid close contact with ATP. The residues that interact with ATP are shown in Fig. 3 a. The adenine ring and ribose of ATP are partially buried in a pocket formed by the hydrophobic side chains of surrounding residues. There are two direct hydrogen bonds between the base of ATP (N-1 and N-6) and the protein (the main chain N and O atom in residue Thr226) and an indirect hydrogen bond between the N-7 of the base and the main chain N atom of Phe229 via a water molecule. The phosphate groups of ATP form hydrogen bonds with protein directly or through solvent molecules. Residues that interact with the phosphate groups are Ser187, Thr148, Asp113, Asn150, Asp118, Gly234, Tyr127, and Thr233. They are highly conserved in the primary sequences of pyridoxal kinase among different species. A Zn2+ ion and a K+ ion are found together with an ATP molecule in the active site. The Zn2+ ion binds to the oxygen atoms of both the β- and γ-phosphate groups of ATP, but it does not interact directly with the protein. In general, the Mg2+ ion is commonly used in reactions catalyzed by kinases. Brain pyridoxal kinase, however, exhibits strikingly higher activity in the presence of Zn2+ than Mg2+ (2McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12136-12140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As interaction between Zn2+ and the protein was not observed in the enzyme-ATP complex, this preference for Zn2+ may result from the succeeding steps of catalytic reactions. The coordination of the K+ ion is octahedral, and its ligands are atoms of the β-phosphate group, the surrounding residues (Thr186, Thr148, Asp113, and Glu153), and a water molecule. Those residues located in this site make it possible for the K+ ion to engage in the binding of ATP, which corresponds to the activation of K+ ion on pyridoxal kinase (37Laine-Cessac P. Allain P. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Figure 3Substrate-binding sites of pyridoxal kinase. a, stereoview of the interactions between ATP and residues of enzyme in the complex.

The positions of the pyridine ring of pyridoxal are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) According to structural analysis, the pyridoxal-binding site should be in close proximity to the γ-phosphate group of ATP. Nevertheless, in the absence of ATP, the pyridoxal-binding site of each monomer is occupied by a 12-residue loop (117–128) connecting β5 and α4 (Fig.4 a). Such a loop has never been observed in ribokinase, adenosine kinase, THZ kinase, and ADP-specificity glucokinase. In the similar location of HMPP kinase, a relatively shorter loop takes part in the formation of a nascent lid covering the substrate HMP (25Cheng G. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brain pyridoxal kinase, not only is the loop longer than the loop present in HMPP kinase but it also penetrates deeply to the inner core of the protein molecule and occupies the pyridoxal-binding site completely, leaving no space for the substrate. Because of the broad substrate specificity of pyridoxal kinase (2McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 263: 2085-2088Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 11Zhang Z.M. McCormick D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10407-10410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it is suggested that this loop cannot perform the same function as that in HMPP kinase. In the pyridoxal kinase-ATP complex, the loop of monomer A is restricted by the other symmetrical molecule in the crystal and remains unchanged from the native structure (Fig. 4, b and c). However, the loop in monomer B, which is in contact with the solvent region of the crystal without any lattice limitation, swayed completely to another direction, partially covering the ATP (Fig. 4,b and d) and leaving the pyridoxal-binding site exposed to the solution environment. Based on its random mechanism (21Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 780-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pyridoxal kinase can bind vitamin B6 before ATP. Therefore, it is expected that when vitamin B6 binds to the enzyme before ATP binds to the protein, this loop will display a conformation that neither occupies the pyridoxal-binding site nor covers the ATP-binding site. After binding ATP, loop-(117–128) of monomer B sways out of its original position and leaves the pyridoxal-binding site exposed, forming a cavity with negative charges next to the ATP-binding site on the surface of pyridoxal kinase (Figs. 3 b and 4 d). The high negative potential of this site is favorable to the binding of substrates because of the attraction created by the positive charge on the pyridine ring of vitamin B6. It is also suggested that the more positive charges a substrate has, the more readily it will bind to the enzyme. As concerns the three chemical forms of vitamin B6, the K m of pyridoxamine with two positive charges is 0.006 mm, which is lower than theK m of pyridoxal (0.04 mm) and pyridoxine (0.026 mm) (1Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, a pyridoxal-binding model for pyridoxal kinase is hypothesized (Fig. 3 b). In this model, Tyr84 is on one side of the pyridine ring of pyridoxal and makes an π-interaction with the pyridine ring, whereas Val231 and Val19 are on the other side interacting hydrophobically with pyridoxal. This hypothesis is supported by previous chemical modification studies in which a Tyr residue was shown to be essential for the binding of pyridoxal to the kinase (15Scholz G. Kwok F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4318-4321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-1, O-3, and O-5 atoms of pyridoxal form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser12, Thr47, and Asp235, respectively. Furthermore, residues Val41, Phe43, Val14, Val56, Trp52, and Val115 all contribute to form a hydrophobic environment for the binding of pyridoxal to the active site. All of these residues, especially Tyr84, Asp235, and Ser12, share the function of determining substrate specificity and are highly conserved among pyridoxal kinases. Another role of Asp235is to attract the proton of the 5′-hydroxyl group of pyridoxal; the negatively charged oxygen atom makes a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate group of ATP in the catalytic reaction. Biochemical studies have shown that pyridoxal kinase can tolerate considerable variation with respect to the size and chemical nature of a group at position 4 of a pyridoxal derivative (2McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McCormick D.B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 263: 2085-2088Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The size of a chemical group at this position may vary from being an hydroxyl as shown in pyridoxine to pyridoxyl derivatized with benzylamine and tryptamine (11Zhang Z.M. McCormick D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10407-10410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). According to the pyridoxal-binding model, based on our finding, the 4′-substitute group of the pyridoxal derivatives appears not to interact with any residue of the protein and points to the solvent region. The tolerance for the variation of this chemical group would not allow any peptide chain to cover the binding site as a lid structure to create hindrance to the binding process. In this respect, pyridoxal kinase is shown to be significantly different from the other kinases as compared with those enzymes in the ribokinase superfamily. All of the other kinases contain a lid structure covering the bound substrates. In ribokinase (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), adenosine kinase (24Schumacher M.A. Scott D.M. Mathews I.I. Ealick S.E. Roos D.S. Ullman B.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15607-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and ADP-dependent glucokinase (36Ito S. Fushinobu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a small domain of the enzyme structure forms this lid structure. However, in the trimeric structure of THZ kinase, each monomer plays the role of the lid for the adjacent monomer (35Campobasso N. Mathews I.I. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7868-7877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and in HMPP kinase, a nascent lid formed by a flexible loop and two β-strands exists (25Cheng G. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Structural studies on adenosine kinase, ribokinase, and their complexes with substrates or ATP analogues have given an explanation of the function of their lids (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Schumacher M.A. Scott D.M. Mathews I.I. Ealick S.E. Roos D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Initially, the lids (a small domain) are in the opening state of the enzyme, enabling the entrance of ribose or adenosine to their binding sites. Before ATP binding to the kinase, the binding of the first substrate induces a conformational change of the protein structure by rotating the lid toward a site where the first substrate has been bound. This movement results in the covering and tight trapping of the first substrate in the correct position for catalysis. Furthermore, the rotating movement of the lids together with other local conformational adjustments makes these kinases more favorable to binding ATP. Typically, the lid of adenosine kinase rotates about 30° upon the binding of adenosine, and a positively charged residue, Arg136, is translocated for a distance of 13.6 Å to the binding site of ATP. This translocation promotes the correct positioning and stabilization of the negatively charged phosphate group on ATP (24Schumacher M.A. Scott D.M. Mathews I.I. Ealick S.E. Roos D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purpose of such a mechanism in substrate binding has been suggested as the prevention of premature ATP hydrolysis (22Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The absence of such a lid in the structure of brain pyridoxal kinase indicates that pyridoxal kinase binds its substrates differently than ribokinase and adenosine kinase. Kinetic data for brain pyridoxal kinase were consistent with a random binding of substrates (21Churchich J.E. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 780-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which ATP is able to bind to pyridoxal kinase before binding vitamin B6, which is also confirmed by the crystallization of ATP-kinase complex in the absence of vitamin B6. In addition, it is found that the pyridoxal-binding site is exposed after ATP binds to the enzyme. When ATP binds to the kinase in the absence of pyridoxal, securing the nonexistence of premature hydrolysis of ATP may become a crucial element for the random sequential kinetic mechanism. It has been found that in the structure of pyridoxal kinase-ATP complex, the electron density of ATP bound in monomer A at the γ-phosphate group is weaker than at α- and β-phosphate groups (Fig.5 a). This suggests that this ATP has been hydrolyzed in considerable proportion. In monomer B, the three phosphate groups of ATP all fit the density well (Fig.5 b). The observation that there is little difference between the two monomers in the active sites except the conformation of loop-(117–128) reveals that one function of this loop may be to prevent premature ATP hydrolysis before binding of vitamin B6. A common catalytic mechanism has been suggested for the ribokinase superfamily (24Schumacher M.A. Scott D.M. Mathews I.I. Ealick S.E. Roos D.S. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the hydroxyl group of the phosphate accepter is activated by a basic group in the active site, and then its oxygen atom makes a direct nucleophilic attack to the γ-phosphate group of ATP in an in-line mechanism and breaks it off. In the structures of adenosine kinase-adenosine-AMPPCP complex and ribokinase-ribose-AMPPCP complex, the arrangement of the substrates allows the hydroxyl oxygen atoms to attack the γ-phosphate group in the proper ways (Fig. 5 c). In pyridoxal kinase, there is a water molecule between the γ-phosphate of ATP and the carboxyl group of Asp235, the basic catalytic group. However, this water is located close to the plane of the three oxygen atoms of the γ-phosphate group (Fig. 5 c), from where the water cannot make a nucleophilic attack in the manner mentioned above. The occurrence of hydrolysis requires conformational changes on ATP to make the γ-phosphate group move toward the water. However, when monomer B binds ATP, the conformation of loop-(117–128), as discussed above, allows the hydroxyl group of Tyr127 to form a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate group of ATP. At the same time the side chain of Asp118 makes a hydrogen bond with the β-phosphate group. The two additional hydrogen bonds restrict the conformation of ATP, which keeps the γ-phosphate in a conformation from which ATP hydrolysis is prevented. The loop of monomer A was fixed by crystal packing, and its conformation did not allow these two residues to interact with ATP. Thus, ATP hydrolysis was not prevented. In summary, the conformational variation of loop-(117–128) and the restriction on ATP exerted by Asp118 and Tyr127 are essential to prevent premature ATP hydrolysis in the random binding mechanism of catalysis. Sequences alignment of 29 pyridoxal kinases has shown that Asp118 and Tyr127 are conserved in 21 sequences (data not shown), which also shows their importance. Interestingly, in 6 of the remaining 8 sequences, these two residues change to His and Val/Ile simultaneously, suggesting that there is another type of pyridoxal kinase as a result of the difference of the loop. Two pyridoxal kinase genes (pdxK (5Yang Y. Zhao G. Winkler M.E. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1996; 141: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pdxY (6Yang Y. Tsui H.C. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have been found in Escherichia coli. These two residues inpdxK are Asp and Tyr, the same as found in brain pyridoxal kinase. Enzyme expressed from this gene can use all pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine as substrates (5Yang Y. Zhao G. Winkler M.E. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 1996; 141: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other gene,pdxY, with His and Ile at the two sites, has a far lower activity level when using pyridoxine rather than pyridoxal as a substrate (6Yang Y. Tsui H.C. Man T.K. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this enzyme interacts with the 4′-substituted substrate group and limits its chemical nature. This evidence demonstrates that the loops in the two types of pyridoxal kinases have different functions during reactions. The Asp-Tyr loop plays a role similar to that of the loop in brain pyridoxal kinase, which interacts with ATP and prevents ATP hydrolysis; whereas the His-Val/Ile loop plays a role similar to that of the loop in HMPP kinase at the comparable position, which acts as a lid and covers the bound non-ATP substrate. An evolutionary pathway has been proposed for known structures in ribokinase superfamily according to the morphological differences in the lid structures (25Cheng G. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Brain pyridoxal kinase does not have such a lid. Furthermore, compared with the loop in HMPP kinase, which forms a nascent lid with the other two β-strands together, the loop in pyridoxal kinase possesses two significantly conserved residues that interact with ATP, which endows the loop with a new function (preventing ATP hydrolysis), and adapts pyridoxal kinase to a new mechanism (random sequential kinetic mechanism). This suggests another evolutionary direction for the proteins in the ribokinase superfamily and also provides a typical case for how the enzyme adapts to a mechanism by local structural changes while retaining the core structure of the protein macromolecule.

The possible role of ATP in coordinating the function of the cellular complement of molecular chaperones is discussed. In the cellular environment, the de novo folding of short, single-domain proteins is thought to proceed rapidly and efficiently whereas that of large, multidomain proteins and slow folding polypeptides often requires the assistance of molecular chaperones. In Escherichia coli, nascent and newly synthesized chains that rely on chaperones to reach a proper conformation are engaged by either trigger factor or the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system (and in some cases are transferred to the GroEL-GroES team) before being released in a native form. Chaperones interact with their client proteins by binding to solvent-exposed hydrophobic stretches that would normally be buried within the substrate core. By shielding interactive surfaces that give rise to misfolded and aggregated species, chaperones promote on-pathway folding without accelerating folding rates or becoming part of the final structure (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Bukau B.

Another role of molecular chaperones is to repair host proteins that have misfolded as a result of temperature increase or other forms of stress. The main players in this process are the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and GroEL-GroES teams that actively refold partially folded proteins using conformational changes powered by ATP hydrolysis and the ATPase ClpB that disaggregates thermally aggregated proteins before transferring them to DnaK-DnaJ for refolding (1Bukau B.

Because temperature increases stimulate cellular protein misfolding, most, but not all (trigger factor and SecB are notable exceptions) chaperones are heat shock proteins (Hsps), 1The abbreviations used for: Hsp, heat shock protein; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used for: Hsp, heat shock protein; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.the synthesis of which is transiently up-regulated after heat shock.

Here we show that one of these genes, yedU, encodes a homodimeric protein that defines a new family of cytoplasmic molecular chaperone. In a process that is negatively modulated by ATP binding, Hsp31 appears to use temperature-induced exposure of structured hydrophobic domains to capture early unfolding intermediates and rapidly release them in an active form once stress has abated. The yedU open reading frame was amplified by colony PCR of E. coliMC4100 by using the primer set 5′-CAATAAGGAATACCATATGACTGTTCA-3′ and 5′-CGGCCTCGAGTGATTATGCGCTTACATTCA-3′.

The NdeI-XhoI fragment was subcloned into the same sites of pET-22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) to placeyedU under T7 transcriptional control. The resulting plasmid was named pKV111. BL21(DE3) transformants grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA 600 ≈0.4. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mmNaCl and lysed by two cycles of French pressing at 10,000 p.s.i. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × gand glycerol added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). Samples were diluted 2-fold with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 50 ml of material was applied to a 15.2 × 1.1-cm column packed with 14.4 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed at 2.4 ml/min with a 1 m NaCl gradient. Hsp31-rich fractions eluting between 125 and 250 mm NaCl were diluted 2-fold with 5 mm sodium phosphate and loaded onto a 1.6 × 21.9-cm column packed with 44 ml of Macro-prep hydroxyapatite Type 1 (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 2.5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0. The column was developed at 3.3 ml/min and Hsp31-rich flow-through fractions were recovered and concentrated (Centricon-10, Millipore, Bedford, MA). This material was applied to a 1.6 × 46.8-cm column packed with 94.1 ml of Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl at 0.7 ml/min. Hsp31 (>98% pure) was concentrated, supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −80 °C at 1 mg/ml. The molar extinction coefficient of Hsp31 at 280 nm is 3,463 m−1cm−1. Monomer concentrations of porcine heart CS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and equine liver ADH (Sigma) were determined by using molar extinction coefficients of 3.59 × 104m−1cm−1 (9Cannon D.J. Mikay R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and 7.75 × 104m−1 cm−1 (10Singh M. Brooks G.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4636-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Hsp31 at the indicated molar excess ratios (all based on monomers) and ADH at 1.6 μm final concentration were added successively to 150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, prewarmed to 41.5 °C. Samples (1 ml) were transferred to the thermostated cell of a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer and held at 41.5 °C. Right angle light scattering was recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 500 nm and slit widths at 2.5 nm. BSA (Sigma) at a 6-fold molar excess over ADH was substituted to Hsp31 in control experiments. CS (0.4 μm final concentration) thermal aggregation experiments were conducted as described previously except that all incubation steps were at 45 °C and the buffer was 40 mmHEPES pH 7.8, 20 mm KOH, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 2 mm CH3COOK. Experiments involving adenosine nucleotides were performed as described previously except that the buffers were further supplemented with 2 mm Mg-ATP or ADP and 5 mm MgCl2. For thermal reactivation experiments, ADH, CS, or porcine heart MDH (Sigma) were mixed at 0.4 μmfinal concentration with no additive or the indicated molar excess of Hsp31 in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (ADH and MDH), or 150 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and 2 mm EDTA (CS) held at 45 °C. Samples (1 ml) were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min, transferred to 23 °C, and assayed after 30 min (see Fig. 2) or at the indicated times (see Fig. 4). In control experiments, Hsp31 was added at the end of the high temperature incubation step or 30 min after the mixture had cooled to room temperature. ADH, MDH, and CS activity was determined as described (11Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2157-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vallee B. Hoch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1955; 41: 327-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized to that of samples maintained at 23 °C for 60 min with no additive. On heat treatment and in the absence of Hsp31 no CS activity could be detected, whereas 0.1–0.7% of the MDH remained active. For experiments involving adenosine nucleotides, reaction buffers were further supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and either 2 mm Mg-ATP or ADP (Sigma) during the 45 °C temperature incubation step. In some cases, nucleotides were added 90 min after transfer to 23 °C. For chemical reactivation experiments, MDH was incubated for 30 min in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and 6m GdnHCl at 23 °C. Aliquots were placed in the cap of microcentrifuge tubes and rapidly diluted 100-fold to a 0.4 μm final concentration into 1 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2 lacking or containing a 6-fold molar excess of Hsp31, and 2 mm Mg-ATP or ADP at 23 °C.Figure 4Bis-ANS photoincorporation inhibits Hsp31 chaperone function. Hsp31 was pretreated (+) or not (−) at 45 °C for 15 min in the presence (+) or absence (−) of bis-ANS and subjected (+) or not (−) to UV irradiation for 30 min at the same temperature. All samples were subjected to dialysis and transferred to ice. MDH was incubated for 30 min at 45 °C in the presence or absence of the various Hsp31 preparations, and enzymatic activities were assayed after 30 min at 23 °C. The control was held for 60 min at 23 °C without additive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Temperature-induced exposure of hydrophobic domains was analyzed by mixing 0.8 μm Hsp31 and 12 μm bis-ANS (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 30 μl of 150 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 23, 30, 37, or 45 °C for 30 min, and the dye was photoincorporated by 30 min of irradiation at 254 nm by using a handheld UV lamp (Spectroline ENF 240C). Labeled products were fractionated at 1 ml/min on a Biosep S2000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) developed in 150 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Fluorescence intensity of the effluent was measured at 477 nm by using an online fluorescence detector (Shimadzu RF-10Axl) with excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored with a diode array detector. The effect of adenine nucleotides was investigated by mixing 0.8 μm Hsp31 or BSA with 12 μmbis-ANS in 1 ml of 150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 45 °C in the presence or absence of 2 mm Mg-ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP. Fluorescence intensities were measured on a Hitachi F4500 fluorimeter at 45 °C with excitation wavelength of 340 nm and slit widths of 2.5 nm immediately after mixing and 15 and 30 min thereafter. For the experiment of Fig. 4, 0.8 μm Hsp31 was supplemented with 12 μm bis-ANS or an identical amount of buffer in 100 μl (final volume) of phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Four samples were incubated at 45 °C for 15 min to trigger the exposure of hydrophobic domains, and two of those were irradiated at 254 nm for 30 min at 45 °C. Unirradiated controls were held at 45 °C for 30 min. All samples were dialyzed against phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 1 h by using a Microdialyzer system 100 (Pierce) fitted with a 12-kDa cutoff membrane and continuous buffer change. Samples were transferred to ice and used for triplicate activity assays conducted with a 3:1 molar excess ratio of Hsp31 to MDH as described above. CD spectra of Hsp31 (0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) were recorded on a thermostated Aviv 62A DS spectropolarimeter by using a 1-mm pathlength cuvette. For sizing experiments 1.2 μg of Hsp31 was injected on a thermostated Biosep S2000 column developed in 150 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The column was calibrated by using the low weight calibration kit from Amersham Biosciences. Dynamic light-scattering measurements were performed at 20 °C with 1 mg/ml Hsp31 in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5 by using a DynaPro99 instrument (Protein Solutions, Lakewood, NJ) illuminated at 832.8 nm with a 25-milliwatt solid state laser. Data analysis was performed by using the instrument software. Inverse Laplace transform analysis was used to find the mean and standard deviation (polydispersity) of the protein hydrodynamic radius distribution. For intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments, 0.8 μm Hsp31 in 1 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 5 mmMgCl2 was incubated at the indicated temperatures for 30 min. ATP, AMP-PNP, or ADP was added at 2 mm final concentration. Intrinsic fluorescence was measured in a thermostated Hitachi F4500 spectrophotometer 15 min after nucleotide addition by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and slit widths at 2.5 nm. Spectra were fitted with a fifth-degree polynomial function to obtain maximum fluorescence intensities and emission wavelengths. ATPase assays were performed essentially as described (13Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of Hsp31 (1 mg/ml) was mixed at 23 or 45 °C with 148 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm KCl) and 10 μl of ATP mixture consisting of 4.8 μl of 2.5 mm ATP, 8 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 67.2 μl of assay buffer. Samples (25 μl) were collected immediately after mixing and every 10 min thereafter and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and molybdate extraction (13Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In some experiments, MDH was added at a 3:1 molar excess over Hsp31. Purified GroEL was used as a positive control. In an effort to assign a function to the putative product of the heat-inducible (14Richmond C.S. Glasner J.D. Mau R. Jin H. Blattner F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3821-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and H-NS-regulated (15Yoshida T. Ueguchi C. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)yedU gene, we amplified the yedU open reading frame and placed it under transcriptional control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. Induced BL21(DE3) transformants accumulated large amounts of a soluble 31-kDa protein that matched the expected molecular weight of 31,194. The protein was designated Hsp31 and purified to near homogeneity by three chromatography steps (Fig.1 A). Hsp31 was found to assemble as a homodimer by size exclusion chromatography (Fig.1 B). Quaternary structure assignment was confirmed by dynamic light-scattering measurements conducted in triplicate. At 1 mg/ml, the hydrodynamic radius of Hsp31 was 3.28 ± 0.10 nm and the polydispersity was ∼10%. This corresponds to a molecular mass of 62 ± 5.6 kDa that is fully consistent with a dimeric structure. No appreciable variation was found in elution position when sizing experiments were repeated between 23 and 50 °C or in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol (data not shown), suggesting that changes in temperature do not affect Hsp31 quaternary structure and that Cys185 and Cys207are unlikely to form an intermonomer disulfide bridge. Far-UV CD analysis showed that Hsp31 contains a significant amount of α-helical structure (54%) and is about 25% β-pleated. The protein exhibited little change in secondary structure between 25 and 55 °C (Fig. 1 C) and appeared remarkably thermostable because the molar ellipticity at 220 nm remained constant at temperatures as high as 90 °C (data not shown). Most cytoplasmic Hsps characterized to date function either as molecular chaperones or heat shock proteases. Because one of the hallmarks of molecular chaperone function is an ability to suppress the aggregation of unfolding intermediates, we tested whether Hsp31 would prevent the heat-induced misfolding of two model substrates, CS (Fig.2 A) and ADH (Fig.2 B). In both cases, a concentration-dependent decrease in light scattering was observed, and Hsp31 was quite efficient at suppressing CS and ADH aggregation when provided at a 6-fold molar excess (based on monomers) over substrate proteins. We next investigated whether Hsp31 would promote the reactivation (or prevent the inactivation) of thermally unfolded proteins following stress abatement. For these experiments, ADH, CS, or MDH was incubated at 45 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of Hsp31, and enzymatic activity was measured after 30 min of incubation at 23 °C. In all cases, Hsp31 increased the recovery of active proteins relative to controls when present at a 3:1 molar excess, and the yields were further improved when the chaperone was used at a 6:1 molar ratio (Fig.2 C). Addition of Hsp31 at a 3:1 molar excess ratio immediately after the 45 °C incubation step or 30 min after the solution cooled to 23 °C did not increase the activity of either CS or ADH compared with chaperone-free controls (data not shown). These data suggest that Hsp31 alone is unable to promote the reactivation of preformed thermal aggregates and that it is likely to interact with unfolding intermediates. On the basis of stoichiometric considerations, Hsp31 is approximately as effective a chaperone as Hsp33 (16Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Because molecular chaperones typically associate with partially folded proteins through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, we investigated the possibility that temperature modulates the degree of Hsp31 surface hydrophobicity. For these experiments, Hsp31 was incubated at four different temperatures and photolabeled with bis-ANS, a molecule that exhibits little intrinsic fluorescence in its free form but becomes highly fluorescent when bound to solvent-exposed structured hydrophobic patches. Although high temperatures do not influence the efficiency of bis-ANS photoincorporation (17Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), the quantum yield of the dye exhibits significant temperature dependence. The change in Hsp31 hydrophobicity was therefore quantified by injecting the labeled products on a gel filtration column developed at 23 °C and by simultaneously monitoring the fluorescence emission of the effluent at 477 nm and its absorbance at 280 nm. Bis-ANS photoincorporation led to slight alterations in the elution profile of Hsp31 at 280 nm (Fig.3, inset). Although broadening was expected at the leading edge (bis-ANS-Hsp31 covalent complexes have a higher molecular weight than unlabeled Hsp31), the progressive change at the tail of the peak suggests that photoincorporation at high temperatures affects the conformation of a small fraction of Hsp31. Asymmetric fluorescence peaks were observed over ∼2 ml, and both peak area and maximum fluorescence intensity increased with the photolabeling temperature (Fig. 3). Samples prepared above 30 °C exhibited shoulders at low elution volumes that were found to correspond to small amounts of high molecular weight and high fluorescence cross-linked species via SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). At the elution position of Hsp31 (≈7.2 ml), fluorescence intensity increased 160% between 23 and 30 °C, 80% between 30 and 37 °C, and 60% between 37 and 45 °C. To assess the mechanistic relevance of these data, bis-ANS was photoincorporated into Hsp31 by UV irradiation at 45 °C for 30 min, and the free probe was removed by dialysis. The MDH activity experiment of Fig. 2 was then repeated with the chemically modified chaperone. Fig. 4 shows that pretreatment of Hsp31 at 45 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of UV irradiation had no effect on chaperone function because the recovery levels of active MDH were comparable to the control. However, activity yields were reduced by ∼10-fold when the assay was conducted with Hsp31 covalently coupled to bis-ANS. When UV irradiation was omitted, the yields of MDH activity were slightly reduced, presumably because a small amount of bis-ANS is not removed on dialysis and remains noncovalently associated with Hsp31. We conclude that the structured hydrophobic domains exposed by Hsp31 at high temperatures and bound by bis-ANS are in close proximity and most likely correspond to the substrate binding site(s) of the chaperone. Taken together, the above results suggest that Hsp31 makes use of temperature-driven exposure of structured hydrophobic domains to capture, and possibly release, non-native protein substrates. Molecular chaperones that actively refold or remodel proteins (e.g.GroEL, DnaK, and the Clp ATPases) use conformational changes driven by ATP hydrolysis to perform their function (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

In the case of Hsp31, we did not detect ATPase activity at 23 or 45 °C using [γ-32P]ATP with or without MDH (at a 1:3 ratio to Hsp31) in the assay mix (data not shown). Thus, Hsp31 has very weak or no ATPase activity. However, when the experiments of Fig. 2 were repeated in the presence of 2 mm ATP, the recovery of active CS or MDH was reduced by approximately half (data not shown). To gain further information on the role of adenosine nucleotides and the nature of the (un)folding intermediates bound by Hsp31, we monitored the time course of MDH activity recovery after chemical or thermal denaturation. When the refolding of GdnHCl-unfolded MDH was initiated by rapid dilution at 23 °C, approximately 10% of the original activity was spontaneously recovered after 180 min of incubation (Fig. 5 A, ●). Addition of Hsp31 to the refolding buffer increased reactivation yields to ≈20% without significantly influencing refolding rates (○) but ATP had no impact on either process (Fig. 5 A, ▪ and ■). The yield improvement in the presence of Hsp31 likely reflects the transient stabilization of MDH folding intermediates via interactions with the substrate binding site of Hsp31 (the so-called buffering effect). When MDH was incubated for 30 min at 45 °C, only traces of enzymatic activity were detected on transfer to 23 °C (Fig. 5 B, ●). However, if thermal inactivation was carried out in the presence of Hsp31, 20% of the original MDH activity was recovered immediately after temperature downshift and only a small activity gain was observed thereafter (Fig. 5 B, ○). Identical results were obtained with CS (data not shown). Addition of ATP to the MDH inactivation mixture reduced the beneficial effect of Hsp31 by 50% (Fig.5 B, ■), whereas ADP had essentially no influence on recovery yields (▵). High temperature conditioning of Hsp31 by ATP was essential to achieve inhibition of chaperone activity because addition of either ATP or ADP 90 min after transfer to 23 °C did not affect the yields of enzymatic activity (Fig. 5 B, ▪ and ▴). To confirm the above results, aggregation suppression experiments were repeated in the presence of 2 mm ATP or ADP. In agreement with the activity data, addition of ATP to the reaction buffer inhibited the ability of Hsp31 to suppress the heat-induced aggregation of CS by about 50% (Fig. 6 A,trace 3) and that of ADH by ∼35% (Fig. 6 B,trace 3). ADP had a smaller but discernible effect (Fig. 6,trace 4). Overall, these results suggest 1) that Hsp31 binds to and stabilizes early unfolding intermediates of MDH and CS at high temperatures and rapidly releases them in an active form upon stress abatement, and 2) that ATP inhibits the chaperone activity of Hsp31 under heat shock conditions by interfering with its ability to interact with partially folded substrate proteins. The simplest explanation for the results of Figs. 5 B and 6 is that the binding of ATP to Hsp31 at high temperatures reduces the availability of binding sites for non-native protein substrates. To test this hypothesis, Hsp31 was incubated with bis-ANS at 45 °C in the absence or presence of various nucleotides, and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at various time points after excitation at 340 nm. Fig.7 A shows that whereas little difference existed between the bis-ANS emission spectra recorded in the absence or presence of ADP (Fig. 7, traces 1 and2), ATP reduced the maximum bis-ANS fluorescence intensity by about 30% (Fig. 7, trace 4) with no appreciable time dependence (Fig. 7 B). This effect was only apparent at high temperatures, and no statistically significant effect of ATP addition on bis-ANS fluorescence between 23 and 37 °C was seen (data not shown). The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP had an intermediate effect with an about 20% reduction in maximum fluorescence intensity (Fig. 7, trace 3). In contrast, ATP and ADP had no effect on the bis-ANS emission spectrum of the control protein BSA (Fig.7 C). To determine whether the ATP-mediated quenching of bis-ANS fluorescence at 45 °C was the result of a structural rearrangement in Hsp31, we took advantage of the presence of three tryptophan residues at positions 107, 173, and 229 to monitor Hsp31 conformation at various temperatures in the presence or absence of adenosine nucleotides. Fig.8 shows that the λmax of Hsp31 tryptophans was about 9 nm lower than that of free tryptophan (reflective of the fact that they experience a hydrophobic environment) and remained essentially unchanged at up to 37 °C under all experimental conditions. A small blue shift (≈4 nm) that was unaffected by the presence of nucleotides was observed at 45 °C and most likely corresponds to a temperature-induced, fine conformational rearrangement in Hsp31. On the other hand, both nucleotides reduced tryptophan maximum fluorescence intensity, with ATP being approximately three times more effective than ADP at all temperatures (Fig. 8, ■ and ▵). Although these results should be considered with care because Hsp31 dimers contain six tryptophans, they are consistent with the idea that, at high temperatures, the binding of adenosine nucleotides (and particularly that of ATP) induces a conformational change in Hsp31. Because the relative magnitude of intrinsic fluorescence intensity quenching by ATP is comparable at 23 and 45 °C but Hsp31 activity is not affected by ATP at the former temperature (Fig. 5 A), ATP is likely to function by interfering with the temperature-driven opening of the substrate binding site. In summary, the binding of ATP nucleotides to Hsp31 appears to exert an antagonistic effect on the heat-induced exposure of structured hydrophobic domains by the chaperone and thereby modulates Hsp31 activity.

This type of site has been found and structurally characterized also in hemocyanins, which act as oxygen carriers in arthropods and mollusks (2Volbeda A. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 249-279Google Scholar, 3Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Google Scholar, 4Cuff M.E. Miller K.I. van Holde K.E. Hendrickson W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 855-870Google Scholar), and in catechol oxidases, which perform the oxidation of o-diphenols to quinones (5Gerdemann C. Eicken C. Krebs B. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 183-191Google Scholar). The reasons why these proteins perform different functions, although their catalytic sites appear to be similar both in structure and oxygen binding ability, remains to be clarified (6Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Google Scholar). During activity, the type 3 site of Ty can exist in three main redox forms: (a) Tydeoxy [Cu(I) Cu(I)], the reduced species which binds oxygen to give (b) Tyoxy[Cu(II)-O22−-Cu(II)], in which molecular oxygen is bound as peroxide in a μ-η2:η2side-on bridging mode, and (c) Tymet[Cu(II)-Cu(II)], the resting form of the enzyme, where the Cu2+ ions are normally bridged by a small ligand (7Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar, 8Tepper A.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar).

Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar, 13Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar, 14Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G.

Fleck R.W. Yong G. Strothkamp K.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 27-32Google Scholar) on inhibitors also provided structural information. The importance of the latter studies is related to the considerable interest of Tys from the medical, agricultural, and industrial point of view. For instance, Ty inhibitors are of great concern in the cosmetic industry (17Cabanes J. Chazarra S. Garcia-Carmona F. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 982-985Google Scholar) and in food technology as anti-browning agents (18Chen J.S. Wei C. Marshall M.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1991; 39: 1897-1901Google Scholar, 19Chen J.S. Rolle R.S. Otwell W.S.O.B.M. Marshall M.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1991; 39: 1396-1401Google Scholar). Moreover, the tyrosinases present in soil have been found recently to be involved in the formation of humus through random coupling of different aromatic compounds. These findings have attracted interest in the activity of Ty as a potential detoxifying agent for xenobiotic compounds with phenolic structure (20Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 405-410Google Scholar, 21Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1999; 33: 2028-2034Google Scholar). In this paper we report a mechanistic and kinetic study on the activity of Ty from Streptomyces antibioticus toward the three isomeric fluorophenols, an important class of xenobiotic substances. The number of fluorine-containing environmental contaminants has strongly increased during the past decade (22Key B.D. Howell R.D. Criddle C.S. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1997; 31: 2445-2454Google Scholar), and the polymerization processes mediated by Tys can therefore contribute to soil clean up and water treatment. The enzyme was prepared from the growth medium liquid cultures of S. antibioticus, harboring the pIJ703 expression plasmid, and purified according to published procedures (13Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined optically using a value of 82 mm−1 cm−1 for the extinction coefficient at 280 nm (23Jackman M.P. Hajnal A. Lerch K. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 707-713Google Scholar). Commercial 2-fluorophenol, 3-fluorophenol, and 4-fluorophenol, obtained from Sigma, were freshly purified by HPLC as reported below. All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received unless otherwise noted. Electrospray ionization MS spectra were acquired using a Finnigan MAT system equipped with an ion trap detector. The solution was introduced into the electrospray source at 10 μl min−1 using a syringe pump instrument. The ESI source was operated at 3.5 kV; the capillary temperature was set at 180 °C and its voltage at 10 V; and the experiments were recorded both in positive and negative ion mode. HPLC analysis and purifications were performed loading 1 ml of samples onto Supelco LC18 semipreparative column (250 × 10 mm). Elution was carried out at 5 ml/min starting with pure water and continuing elution with water for 4 min, followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile in 20 min. Spectrophotometric detection of HPLC elution profile in the range 200–650 nm was performed with a Jasco MD-1510 diode array. 19F NMR measurements were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at proton Larmor frequency of 400.13 MHz. The temperature was set at 25 °C. The spectral width was between 20,000 and 50,000 Hz depending on the sample of interest. The number of data points was 64,000 for a typical 128 scans experiment. Fluorine chemical shifts are reported relative to CFCl3. The reactions were performed with 0.4 μm Ty (final concentration after 4 additions) and 1 mm fluorophenol in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 25 °C. The mixtures were magnetically stirred in open vessels in order to maintain the solution saturated with atmospheric oxygen. In the semipreparative experiments carried out for 6 h, the enzyme was always activated by 0.4 μm l-dopa, which was added in four portions in combination with Ty. In the experiments carried out under reducing conditions, 1 mm ascorbic acid was added. After 6 h of reaction time, the mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min, and either trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 mm), for 19F NMR measurements, or p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (1 mm), for HPLC analysis, was added as internal standard to the solutions. Samples used for NMR contained 5% D2O for locking the magnetic field. The data are discussed in terms of the percentage of substrate transformed (%Tr) and percentage of fluorine released from the aromatic ring (%F). %Tr was determined by HPLC analysis, in which the unreacted phenols were quantified by comparison to the internal standard. %F was estimated by 19F NMR analysis, by integration of the detected peaks with respect to the internal standard. For detection of the polymerization intermediates, the same reaction conditions were maintained, but Ty concentration was reduced to 0.1 μm. Samples of the reaction mixtures (1 ml) were withdrawn after 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h and were directly injected into the HPLC column. The standard incubation volume of 1 ml was increased to 10 ml to enable the isolation of sufficient material for spectral characterization of the coupling products. The reactions were stopped after 30 min, for the first intermediates (I orIII), or after 1 h, for the second intermediate (II or IV), in the reactions of p-FP and m-FP, respectively, by cooling the sample in ice and extracting the solutions 4 times with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were rotary-evaporated to dryness, and the resulting purple solid material was dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile/water, 80:20 (v/v). The solution was further purified by HPLC, and the fractions containing the intermediate of interest were collected, dried, and analyzed. Kinetic studies on the catalytic oxidation of fluorophenols were performed in 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8, saturated with air, using a magnetically stirred and thermostated cell with 1-cm optical path length, at 25 ± 0.1 °C. In the experiments where the oxidation rate was studied as a function of FP concentrations, Ty was kept at 0.04 μm, whereas the concentration of the substrates was varied between 1 and 90 mm for p-FP and 0.5 and 60 mm for m-FP. Different sets of experiments were performed in order to establish the dependence of the initial lag of the reaction by l-dopa concentration. Thus, the concentration of l-dopa was varied between 0 and 1 μm, for which the lag phase was completely depleted. Formation of the quinone moieties (I and III) was monitored through the development of their characteristic optical band at 420 nm (ε ≅ 2000 m−1cm−1). The noise during the measurements was reduced by reading the difference in absorbance between 420 and 800 nm (at the latter wavelength absorbance change during the reaction was only due to noise). The initial rates (v 0) were obtained by fitting linearly, normally between 100- and 300-s reaction time, the ΔA versus time plots. In the inhibition studies, the concentration of o-PF was kept fixed (at 0, 10, 20, 35, and 60 mm) and that of l-dopa was varied between 1 and 10 mm, whereas Ty concentration was always kept at 0.04 μm. Dopachrome formation was monitored through the development of its characteristic optical band at 475 nm (ε = 3600 m−1cm−1). Tymet samples for NMR studies (∼0.6 mm in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.80) were prepared as described before (7Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar). o-FP was added to the protein samples from concentrated stock solutions prepared by using the same buffer. Protein 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz using a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer and the super-WEFT pulse sequence (24Bertini I. Luchinat C. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1996; 150: 243-264Google Scholar). Depending on the required signal to noise ratio, 4,000 to 32,000 FIDs were recorded, Fourier-transformed using a 60-Hz exponential window function (LB), and base line-corrected using the Bruker provided software. S. antibioticus Ty produces different effects when reacted with the three isomeric mono-fluorophenols in solution. Whereas a rapid browning can be observed for 3-fluorophenol (m-FP) and 4-fluorophenol (p-FP), 2-fluorophenol (o-FP) did not undergo any apparent reaction. The reaction of m-FP and p-FP in the presence of Ty for a few hours produced a large amount of dark brown solid product, which appeared to be insoluble in common organic solvents like Me2SO, CH2Cl2, and ethyl acetate. The HPLC and19F NMR analyses performed on the supernatant solution, after centrifugation of the insoluble polymer, displayed different product patterns for different substrates. In the case ofp-FP, the 19F NMR spectrum shown in Fig.1 a exhibits only the presence of inorganic fluorine (−123.9 ppm), which can be estimated to be about 50% of the starting phenol. The nearly complete consumption ofp-FP was confirmed by HPLC analysis, where only 2% of the starting fluorophenol was detected after 6 h of Ty reaction. In the same reaction conditions, almost 30% m-FP remained unreacted. This is shown in the 19F NMR spectrum in Fig.1 b, where two peaks, at −116.54 ppm and −123.86 ppm, are present. The former peak, with a multiplet structure shape, corresponds to 30% unreacted m-FP, whereas the second peak corresponds to inorganic fluorine and accounts for 35% of the initial phenol concentration. Solutions of o-FP are very little affected by incubations with Ty. Only about 5% of starting phenol was consumed after a long reaction with the enzyme, and only traces of inorganic fluorine were detected in the 19F NMR spectrum (Fig. 1 c). When the enzymatic reactions of m-FP and p-FP were carried out in the presence of ascorbic acid, the browning effect was completely quenched. The HPLCs of the reaction mixtures reveal the formation of new species common to both the substrates (Fig.2, a and b). No other products were identified even on extending the reaction times up to 8 h. The 19F NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures show, besides the peak of the starting phenol, the presence of a resonance at −126.67 ppm (Fig. 1, d and e), unequivocally assigned to the same o-catechol derivative in both cases according to the data reported in the literature (25Boersma M.G. Solyanikova I.P. Van Berkel W.J. Vervoort J. Golovlev E.L. Rietjens I.M. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 26: 22-34Google Scholar). The negative ion ESI-MS analysis of both reaction mixtures fromm-FP and p-FP exhibit two clusters of peaks at 127.3 m/z and 149.0 m/z, which can be attributed to the [F-catechol − H+]− and [F-catechol − 2H+ + Na+]−species, respectively. The lack of reactivity of o-FP mentioned above was confirmed by the experiment carried out in the presence of ascorbic acid. In order to characterize the products formed in the early steps of the polymerization reaction undergone by m-FP andp-FP, the browning process was followed by HPLC analysis at different reaction times. Taking into account that significant scattering of the solution, which indicates the occurrence of polymer precipitation, normally starts after 2 h of enzymatic reaction, three samples of the reaction mixture were analyzed for bothm-FP and p-FP reactions after 30-, 60-, and 120-min reaction times. The optical detection of the products in the wavelength range between 200 and 600 nm revealed the formation and time evolution of three major species, which share a broad absorption band at 420 nm. These products were successfully separated, and their HPLC traces detected at 420 nm, reported in Fig. 2, c andd, refer to the products obtained from p-FP, whereas e and f refer to those resulting fromm-FP. Initially, the enzymatic reaction rapidly gives rise to the product with a retention time of 18.5 min (I) for thep-FP reaction and 18.6 min (III) for them-FP reaction. These products evolved in times of the order of 1 h into two different species, which were still characterized by an optical absorption band at 420 nm but had different retention times as follows: 21.0 min (II) for the p-FP reaction and 21.3 min (IV) for the m-FP reaction, respectively. After 2 h of reaction time, polymer precipitation involved the products associated with peaks II andIV; these peaks decreased in intensity until they completely disappeared. The browning processes, related to the formation of compounds I–IV, were not observed without the enzyme. In order to define the structure of the four intermediates detected by HPLC as described above, semipreparative scale reactions were performed. Samples of the reaction mixtures were quenched at different times, corresponding to maximum formation of intermediates Iand II (for the p-FP reaction) and IIIand IV (for the m-FP reaction) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were further purified by HPLC and the products analyzed by ESI-MS, 1H NMR, and 19F NMR spectroscopy; the data are shown in the TableI. The low concentration in whichIV is produced prevented its NMR characterization.Table ICharacterization data for the intermediates isolated in the enzymatic oxidation of p-FP and m-FPHPLC elution timeESI-mass1H NMR19F NMR (ppm)minm/zppm(ppm)I18.5[219.1]+7.03 (m), 6.88 (m), 6.73 (d), 6.46 (d), 6.31 (dd)−124.72 (m)II21[329.7]+, [351.7]+7.45 (m), 7.15 (m), 6.5 (s)−125.35 (m)III18.6[219.1]+7.31 (m), 6.71 (m), 6.42 (d), 6.28 (dd)−112.31 (m)IV21.3[329.7]+, [351.7]+NMNMThe abbreviations used are: m, multiplet;d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets;s, singlet; NM, not measured. Open table in a new tab The abbreviations used are: m, multiplet;d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets;s, singlet; NM, not measured. The dimeric compounds I and III maintain the quinone structure and exhibit a moderately intense absorption band at 420 nm (ε ≈ 2000 m−1cm−1). The mass peaks at m/z 219.1 observed for these species represent the [I/III + H]+ ions, and their 1H NMR spectra contain an ABX pattern that is consistent with the structure shown in Scheme FS1. The trimeric intermediates II and IV exhibit optical properties similar to those of I and IIIbut with a maximum shifted to 415 nm. The structure shown in Scheme FS1is consistent with their spectral data (Table I), where the MS peaks atm/z 329.7 and 351.7 refer to the ions [II/IV + H]+ and [II/IV + Na]+, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of II, besides the aromatic envelope, shows a characteristic singlet, which could be attributed to the equivalent protons of the symmetric quinone moiety. Kinetic measurements of the Ty activity toward the reactive fluorophenols m-FP and p-FP were carried out at 420 nm as a function of substrate concentration. The absorbanceversus time curves showed an induction period that can last more than 600 s and decreases with the increase of substrate concentration. The resulting plots of initial rates versussubstrate concentration exhibited a sigmoidal shape because of the prominent induction period at low concentration of fluorophenols (Fig.3). When the kinetic analysis was performed in the presence of at least 25-fold excess l-dopa, with respect to the enzyme concentration, the observed behavior changed completely. The lag phase previously observed in the enzymatic reactions withoutl-dopa markedly reduced to less than 100 s. The resulting plots of initial rates after the induction periodversus substrate concentrations showed for bothp-FP and m-FP a simple substrate saturation dependence. The kinetic parameters obtained in these conditions for the enzymatic reactions are shown in Reactions 1 and 2,p­FP,kcat=10.5±0.3s−1Km=2.9±0.4mMReaction 1 m­FP,kcat=3.0±0.2s−1Km=6.9±0.9mMReaction 2 As discussed above, o-FP does not react appreciably with Ty and actually it acts as an inhibitor of l-dopa enzymatic oxidation. The inhibition behavior of o-FP, studied by changing both the l-dopa and o-FP concentrations, is reported in Fig. 4. This analysis allowed us to establish that the inhibition mechanism is competitive and to estimate the inhibition constant (K I) as 20.0 mm. It is also noteworthy that increasing the o-FP concentration above 40 mm produces reproducible deviation from linearity of the slope versus [o-FP] plot. Although we did not study this effect in detail, it is possible that more than one molecule ofo-FP interacts with the enzyme in these conditions. Fig. 6 shows the effect of saturating concentration of o-FP on the 1H NMR spectrum of the resting Tymetform. Although the Cu(II)-Cu(II) ground state of the enzyme is diamagnetic (S = 0), the paramagnetic (S = 1) triplet state is appreciably populated at room temperature and provides enough paramagnetic shift to the nuclei in the dicopper environment (26Clementi V. Luchinat C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 351-361Google Scholar). As reported previously (7Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar, 8Tepper A.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar, 13Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar), these signals originate from the nuclei of the coordinated His residues. Therefore, the region between 15 and 50 ppm represents a detailed fingerprint of the type 3 copper site environment which appears to be very sensitive to changes in both copper geometry and ligand binding (7Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar, 8Tepper A.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar, 13Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). Binding of the exogenouso-FP ligand to the dicopper(II) enzyme is suggested by the shifts observed for some of the paramagnetic signals. S. antibioticus tyrosinase reacts differently with the three isomeric mono-fluorophenols, whereas m-FP andp-FP undergo extensive browning and precipitation reactions,o-FP does not react appreciably with the enzyme. The reaction occurring with the former substrates starts with an initial hydroxylation and a successive oxidation to form the intermediates indicated as a and b in Scheme FS1. The quinone initially formed is extremely reactive and undergoes fast (nonenzymatic) coupling reactions with the phenols present in the solution. Through this reaction one molecule of inorganic fluorine is produced. The dimeric compounds I, from p-FP, andIII, from m-FP, represent the major product species in solution at intermediate reaction times (about 30 min). The early enzymatic steps preceding formation of I andIII can be followed only in the presence of a reducing agent like ascorbic acid. The isolation and the spectroscopic characterization of a common catechol intermediate, a, in the reactions of p-FP and m-FP indicates that Ty performs a stereospecific hydroxylation of m-FP inpara position to the fluorine substituent. The fluorine dipolar field effect plays a major role in selecting the position of electrophilic attack, making the other available site electronically poor. Moreover, detection of compound a indirectly but unequivocally proves that quinone b acts as the initiator of the polymerization process. The dimeric compounds I andIII are still reactive on their turn. They accumulate in sizable amount during the initial reaction time, after which they are partially consumed by the second phenol insertion reaction. This Michael-type reaction (27Peter M.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1989; 28: 555-570Google Scholar) involves another molecule of startingp-FP or m-FP and occurs without loss of halogen atom. The polymerization process becomes detectable after a 2-h reaction. It involves directly the intermediates II andIV that progressively disappear from the reaction mixture. Comparing the reaction pattern of m-FP and p-FP after 6 h of reaction time elicits interesting differences in terms of defluorination (%F) and transformation ratio (%Tr). Despitem-FP remaining partially unreacted in these conditions, the ratio (%Tr)/(%F) amounts to 2 in both cases. This confirms that the polymerization mechanism proceeds through the same intermediates and appears to be similar to that reported previously (20Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 405-410Google Scholar, 21Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1999; 33: 2028-2034Google Scholar) for the enzymatic oxidation of chlorophenols by mushroom tyrosinase. In order to maintain the same ratio of (%Tr)/(%F), the polymerization ofII and IV must continue through a mechanism involving successive incorporation of molecules of the starting fluorophenols. The different rate of enzymatic transformation of m-FP andp-FP is confirmed by the kinetic measurements. The kinetic profiles of formation of compound I/III in the absence ofl-dopa show a characteristic lag, which has been systematically encountered in the Ty-catalyzed oxidation of several other phenolic substrates. The initial lag has been accounted for by considering that enzyme activation is needed when it is used in the Met form (9Sanchez-Ferrer A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Garcia-Canovas F. Garcia-Carmona F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 1-11Google Scholar, 28Espin J.C. Garcia-Ruiz P.A. Tudela J. Garcia-Canovas F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 547-551Google Scholar, 29Cooksey C.J. Garratt P.J. Land E.J. Pavel S. Ramsden C.A. Riley P.A. Smit N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26226-26235Google Scholar). This activation is accomplished usingl-dopa because it reduces Tymet to Tydeoxy, which on binding dioxygen can react with substrate (Scheme FS2). When a portion of the enzyme is already in the oxy form and/or when reducing impurities, for instance traces of catechols, are present in the substrate the phenol transformation can proceed even in absence ofl-dopa. The latter effect accounts for the sigmoid curve shown in Fig. 3, because the impurities increase on increasing the substrate concentration. The activity enhancement by humic constituents such as catechol, which was reported previously (20Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Arch. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 405-410Google Scholar, 21Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1999; 33: 2028-2034Google Scholar), can also be associated with these effects. The inhibitory effect of the phenols (Scheme FS2), which blocks the enzyme in the Met form, increases the amount of l-dopa necessary for complete depletion of the lag phase. A 25-fold excess of l-dopa with respect to the enzyme, but still about 1/1000 the minimum substrate concentration used, makes the initial activation fast enough to eliminate the lag phase throughout the concentration range of m-FP andp-FP employed, until saturation is reached. The kinetic parameters obtained, according to a Michaelis-Menten treatment, show that k cat is three times larger forp-FP than for m-FP. The comparison of thek cat values for m-FP andp-FP offers some additional insight into the widely accepted mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves an electrophilic attack of the phenol moiety by the Tyoxy form (14Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Konrad L. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015-4027Google Scholar,30Decker H. Dillinger R. Tuczek F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1591-1595Google Scholar). The identity of the catechols formed in the oxidation of the two phenols implies that insertion of the oxygen atom into the phenol nucleus occurs in the meta position (to fluorine) forp-FP and in the para position (to fluorine) form-FP. Thus, the fluorine dipolar effect should be much more effective for the oxygenation in meta position,i.e. it should decrease the rate of the reaction ofp-FP more than for o-FP. The observedk cat values show, in fact, an opposite trend. This indicates that in the rate-determining step some steric effect rules the reactivity. This effect favors thepara-substituted phenol, carrying the same substitution pattern as the natural substrates. The ortho-substituted phenol is unreactive, but it binds to the active site, because it competitively inhibits the enzyme reaction (Fig. 4). To understand whether the binding mode of o-FP to the enzyme is similar to that of the reactive substrates, the K m values obtained for m-FP and p-FP and theK I value for o-FP have been plotted against a modified ς scale that should rationalize the fluorine substituent effect in the phenolic derivatives in terms of their relative acidity (Fig. 5) (31Kabalpurwala K. Milburn R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3224-3227Google Scholar, 32Leffler J.E. Grunwald E. Rates and Equilibria of Organic Reactions. Wiley Interscience, New York1963Google Scholar). The observed trend suggests that the binding mode of the fluorophenols to the Ty active site is similar, and their reactivity depends on the electronic effect modulated by the substituent position. Binding of the phenols to the enzyme is likely stabilized by interactions with protein residues. Collectively, these interactions result in weaker binding as the electron density on the phenol is reduced. Binding of o-FP results in a relatively modest change in the paramagnetic 1H NMR spectrum of Tymet (Fig.6) compared, for instance, with the effects produced by halide ions and kojic acid (7Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Google Scholar, 8Tepper A.W. Bubacco L. Canters G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30436-30444Google Scholar, 13Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Google Scholar). In particular, only a limited number of signals of Tymet are slightly shifted, and no sharpening of the resonances occurs. Furthermore, no new peaks likely to belong to the bonded inhibitor protons appear outside the protein envelope, even if only a complete assignment of the NMR spectrum, which is still in progress, will only provide a definitive answer. Apparently, this electron-poor phenol does not significantly modify the electronic structure of the copper site and the steric hindrance of the ortho substituent could even prevent an effective binding. Therefore, the specific interaction matrix provided by the protein envelope around the copper site could assist and enforce the binding mode, providing a rationale for the different inhibitor behavior of kojic acid and o-FP."

The inducers of NF-κB are well characterized, but the molecular mechanisms underlying multiplein vivo NF-κB activation processes are poorly understood. The injection of lipopolysaccharide resulted in a biphasic activation of NF-κB during the 18-h observation period in various organs of mice. The early and late phases of NF-κB activation occurred at 0.5–2 h and 8–12 h, respectively. Platelet-activating factor, which is released in response to lipopolysaccharide injection, was responsible for the activation of the early phase of NF-κB. The early NF-κB activity led to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin (IL)-1β, which are known to be efficient inducers of NF-κB. Using the TNF knockout and IL-1 receptor knockout mice, we found that TNF and IL-1β had a role in the second phase activation of NF-κB. These cytokines did promote the synthesis of platelet-activating factor, which in turn induced the secondary activation of NF-κB.

NF-κB regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, enzymes that generate mediators of inflammation, immune receptors, and adhesion molecules, all of which play a key part in the initiation of inflammatory reactions (2Baeuerle P.A.

The precise biological role of biphasic activation of NF-κB in inflammatory processes is, however, poorly understood.Regarding the molecular events leading to this process, we have previously shown that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is responsible for the early activation of NF-κB in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (9Im S.Y.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 5139-5144Google Scholar), leading to the gene expression and protein synthesis of NF-κB-dependent cytokines (e.g. TNF). Thus, PAF may be the most proximal mediator involved in triggering inflammatory cascades via its capacity to activate NF-κB.In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the biphasic activation of NF-κB in response to LPS. We have found that PAF, which is released in response to LPS injection, activates the early phase of NF-κB activation. This NF-κB activity leads to induction of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1β) expression, which leads to another stimulus for the synthesis of PAF, resulting in the second phase of NF-κB activation. The precise molecular events leading to biphasic activation of NF-κB in inflammatory processes are, however, poorly understood.DISCUSSIONThe transcription factor NF-κB is important for initiating and sustaining inflammatory reactions. The sustained or biphasic activation of NF-κB may be responsible for the prolonged inflammatory processes known to occur in various pathological situations (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar, 5Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9394-9399Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-κB activation in inflammatory reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated an autoregulatory pathway of biphasic activation of NF-κB in response to the inflammatory stimulus LPS. Injection of mice with LPS resulted in biphasic NF-κB activation in various organs. We demonstrated that PAF is involved in the early phase activation of NF-κB based on the findings that (i) the major early peak of plasma PAF was seen 10–15 min after LPS injection and (ii) pretreatment with BN 50739 or CV 6209 prior to LPS injection resulted in abrogation of the early peak of NF-κB. The presence of an early phase of NF-κB activity in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice suggests that TNF or IL-1 is not involved in the first wave of NF-κB activation. It is well known that PAF is an inducer of NF-κB activation in vitro (22Smith C.S. Shearer W.T. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 292-303Google Scholar, 23Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Google Scholar). Regarding the in vivo role of PAF in NF-κB activation, our observations also suggest that PAF is a critical mediator in the early activation of NF-κB (10Han S.J. Choi J.H. Ko H.M. Choi I.W. Lee H.K.

Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Google Scholar) in a reactive oxygen intermediator-dependent manner (14Choi J.H. Chung W.J. Han S.J. Lee H.B. Choi I.W. Lee H.K. Jang K.Y. Lee D.G. Han S.S. Park K.H. Im S.Y. Inflammation. 2000; 24: 385-398Google Scholar). This early NF-κB activity induced by PAF results in the expression of a variety of early response genes. Thus, we believe that PAF acts as a triggering molecule in initiating a variety of early inflammatory reactions by activating early NF-κB.Importantly, we have also demonstrated that either TNF or IL-1 alone, which is induced by the PAF-dependent early NF-κB activity, is indirectly responsible for the second phase of NF-κB activation via the synthesis of PAF. Considering the potential role for TNF and IL-1 in NF-κB activation (3Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Google Scholar, 15Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Google Scholar), we initially expected that TNF or IL-1β might play a direct role in the LPS-induced second phase of NF-κB activation. However, the TNF and IL-1 inhibition studies using TNF−/− and IL-1R−/− mice revealed that little impairment of biphasic activation of NF-κB in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice and inhibition of the second phase of NF-κB activation was achieved by inhibition of both TNF and IL-1β action in vivo as well as in vitro, indicating that these cytokines individually play a significant role in the late phase of NF-κB activation. There was no significant impairment in late plasma PAF levels after LPS injection in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice relative to the control wild type mice (data not shown). These findings indicate that either TNF or IL-1 alone is sufficient to produce PAF.PAF is not stored in the cells but is present in the form of an inactive precursor (alkylacyl-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) in the membrane (24Touqui L. Jacquemin C. Dumarey C. Vargaftig B.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 111-118Google Scholar). Upon an inflammatory stimulus, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) becomes activated and cleaves the phospholipid at the 2(R) position, leading to the formation of the lysophospholipid derivative, lyso-PAF (25Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Google Scholar). Lyso-PAF is in turn acetylated by acetyl-transferase into PAF (26Gomez-Cambronero J. Nieto M.L. Mato J.M. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 511-515Google Scholar). Recent studies (27Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402Google Scholar, 28Xing M. Firestein B.L. Shen G.H. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 805-814Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MAP kinase is associated with PAF release through PLA2 activation by phosphorylation. However, the upstream pathway leading to MAP kinase activation is poorly understood. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism, play a critical role in innate immunity. TLRs and members of the IL-1 receptor family share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll/IL-1R/plant R gene homology (TIR) domains (29O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Google Scholar, 30Kimbrell D.A. Beutler B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 256-267Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediated by TIRs are similar, with MyD88 (31Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar, 32Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar) and TRAF6 (33Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar, 34Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C.

Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Google Scholar) having critical roles. The serine-threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are known to involve the signal transduction between MyD88 and TRAF6 (35Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar, 36Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar). Importantly, a marked impairment of MAP kinase activity has recently been reported in MyD88- or IRAK-4-deficient animals (32Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar, 37Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Google Scholar), suggesting that MyD88 and IRAK may be upstream mediators requiring MAP kinase activation for phosphorylation of PLA2. Further studies are required to address these issues.The PAF produced in response to TNF and IL-1 in turn is responsible for the secondary wave of NF-κB activation. Such a conclusion is supported by the following observations. (i) The plasma PAF levels paralleled those of NF-κB activation following LPS injection. (ii) BN 50739 or CV 6209 prevented the LPS-induced second phase of NF-κB activation in vivo as well as in vitro. (iii) TNF- or IL-1-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited by the PAF antagonist BN 50739 or CV 6209. These findings clearly indicate that together TNF and IL-1 play an important indirect role in the secondary activation of NF-κB via the synthesis of PAF. PAF and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, stimulate the release of each other by a positive feedback loop. In fact, many in vivo biological functions of TNF and IL-1 are mediated through the synthesis of PAF (13Im S.Y. Ko H.M. Kim J.W. Lee H.K. Ha T.Y. Lee H.B. Oh S.J. Bai S. Chung K.C. Lee Y.B. Kang H.S. Chun S.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2662-2665Google Scholar, 20Montrucchio G. Lupia E. Battaglia E. Passerini G. Bussolino F. Emanuelli G. Camussi G. J. Exp.

Thus, we provide another example of a positive feedback loop between PAF and TNF/IL-1 resulting in a second phase of NF-κB activation.The mechanism underlying TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation through PAF has not been fully understood. According to the literature published so far, TNF or IL-1 appear to activate NF-κB through two separate pathways, PLA2-independent and -dependent pathways. The former involves the recruitment of at least three proteins (TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2) to the type 1 TNF receptor tail, leading to the sequential activation of the downstream NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IκB-specific kinases (IKKα and IKKβ), resulting in the phosphorylation of the two N-terminal regulatory serines within IκBα (38Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 39Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59: i6-i16Google Scholar). However, recent in vivo studies with the alymphoplasia (aly) mouse, a natural strain with a mutated NIK (40Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Google Scholar), and NIK-deficient mice (41Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Google Scholar) have revealed that NIK is not a critical element in the TNF signaling pathway to NF-κB activation, indicating that the role of NIK in NF-κB activation through TNF receptor signaling requires further investigation. Apart from this pathway, TNF and IL-1 are also capable of activating PLA2, resulting in biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and PAF (42Godfrey R.W. Johnson W.J. Newman T. Hoffstein S.T. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 107-114Google Scholar, 43Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several reports have demonstrated that PLA2 inhibitors block TNF-induced NF-κB activation (46Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gasvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebol L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Laegreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430Google Scholar, 47van Puijenbroek A.A. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. Peppelenbosch M.P. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 104-110Google Scholar). Given this information, our data suggests an inhibition of TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation by PAF antagonists may induce the late phase of NF-κB activation via the pathway involving PLA2-induced PAF synthesis. However, it is not clear whether these two pathways operate separately or in cooperation to activate NF-κB.Although biphasic activation of NF-κB is supposed to be associated with sustained inflammatory processes, the precise biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Recently, Lawrence et al. (48Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Google Scholar) reported that the late phase activation of NF-κB is associated with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2-derived anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1. Thus, inhibition of the late phase activation of NF-κB protracts inflammatory responses. This suggests that NF-κB has an anti-inflammatory role involving the regulation of inflammatory resolution. If that is the case, given the critical role for PAF in the induction of the late phase activation of NF-κB in this study, clinical studies showing no beneficial effect of PAF antagonists in patients with sepsis (49Vincent J.L. Spapen H. Bakker J. Webster N.R. Curtis L. Crit. Care. Med. 2000; 28: 638-642Google Scholar, 50Suputtamongkol Y. Intaranongpai S. Smith M.D. Angus B. Chaowagul W. Permpikul C. Simpson J.A. Leelarasamee A. Curtis L. White N.J. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2000; 44: 693-696Google Scholar) supports the anti-inflammatory role of NF-κB.Whatever the biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation, this study is the first to provide the precise molecular mechanisms for biphasic activation of NF-κB, which occurs in many inflammatory conditions. Such a biphasic or prolonged activation of NF-κB may develop in pathological situations in which the early release of PAF is abnormally enhanced.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 5139-5144Google Scholar), leading to the gene expression and protein synthesis of NF-κB-dependent cytokines (e.g. TNF). Thus, PAF may be the most proximal mediator involved in triggering inflammatory cascades via its capacity to activate NF-κB. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the biphasic activation of NF-κB in response to LPS. We have found that PAF, which is released in response to LPS injection, activates the early phase of NF-κB activation. This NF-κB activity leads to induction of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1β) expression, which leads to another stimulus for the synthesis of PAF, resulting in the second phase of NF-κB activation. The precise molecular events leading to biphasic activation of NF-κB in inflammatory processes are, however, poorly understood. DISCUSSIONThe transcription factor NF-κB is important for initiating and sustaining inflammatory reactions. The sustained or biphasic activation of NF-κB may be responsible for the prolonged inflammatory processes known to occur in various pathological situations (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Google Scholar, 5Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9394-9399Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NF-κB activation in inflammatory reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated an autoregulatory pathway of biphasic activation of NF-κB in response to the inflammatory stimulus LPS. Injection of mice with LPS resulted in biphasic NF-κB activation in various organs. We demonstrated that PAF is involved in the early phase activation of NF-κB based on the findings that (i) the major early peak of plasma PAF was seen 10–15 min after LPS injection and (ii) pretreatment with BN 50739 or CV 6209 prior to LPS injection resulted in abrogation of the early peak of NF-κB. The presence of an early phase of NF-κB activity in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice suggests that TNF or IL-1 is not involved in the first wave of NF-κB activation. It is well known that PAF is an inducer of NF-κB activation in vitro (22Smith C.S. Shearer W.T. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 292-303Google Scholar, 23Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Google Scholar). Regarding the in vivo role of PAF in NF-κB activation, our observations also suggest that PAF is a critical mediator in the early activation of NF-κB (10Han S.J. Choi J.H. Ko H.M. Choi I.W. Lee H.K. Lee O.H. Im S.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1334-1341Google Scholar, 11Choi J.H. Ko H.M. Kim J.W. Lee H.K. Han S.S. Chun S.B. Im S.Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5139-5144Google Scholar, 15Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Google Scholar) in a reactive oxygen intermediator-dependent manner (14Choi J.H. Chung W.J. Han S.J. Lee H.B. Choi I.W. Lee H.K. Jang K.Y. Lee D.G. Han S.S. Park K.H. Im S.Y. Inflammation. 2000; 24: 385-398Google Scholar). This early NF-κB activity induced by PAF results in the expression of a variety of early response genes. Thus, we believe that PAF acts as a triggering molecule in initiating a variety of early inflammatory reactions by activating early NF-κB.Importantly, we have also demonstrated that either TNF or IL-1 alone, which is induced by the PAF-dependent early NF-κB activity, is indirectly responsible for the second phase of NF-κB activation via the synthesis of PAF. Considering the potential role for TNF and IL-1 in NF-κB activation (3Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Google Scholar, 15Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Google Scholar), we initially expected that TNF or IL-1β might play a direct role in the LPS-induced second phase of NF-κB activation. However, the TNF and IL-1 inhibition studies using TNF−/− and IL-1R−/− mice revealed that little impairment of biphasic activation of NF-κB in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice and inhibition of the second phase of NF-κB activation was achieved by inhibition of both TNF and IL-1β action in vivo as well as in vitro, indicating that these cytokines individually play a significant role in the late phase of NF-κB activation. There was no significant impairment in late plasma PAF levels after LPS injection in TNF−/− or IL-1R−/− mice relative to the control wild type mice (data not shown). These findings indicate that either TNF or IL-1 alone is sufficient to produce PAF.PAF is not stored in the cells but is present in the form of an inactive precursor (alkylacyl-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) in the membrane (24Touqui L. Jacquemin C. Dumarey C. Vargaftig B.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 111-118Google Scholar). Upon an inflammatory stimulus, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) becomes activated and cleaves the phospholipid at the 2(R) position, leading to the formation of the lysophospholipid derivative, lyso-PAF (25Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Google Scholar). Lyso-PAF is in turn acetylated by acetyl-transferase into PAF (26Gomez-Cambronero J. Nieto M.L. Mato J.M. Sanchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 511-515Google Scholar). Recent studies (27Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402Google Scholar, 28Xing M. Firestein B.L. Shen G.H. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 805-814Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MAP kinase is associated with PAF release through PLA2 activation by phosphorylation. However, the upstream pathway leading to MAP kinase activation is poorly understood. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism, play a critical role in innate immunity. TLRs and members of the IL-1 receptor family share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll/IL-1R/plant R gene homology (TIR) domains (29O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Google Scholar, 30Kimbrell D.A. Beutler B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 256-267Google Scholar). Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediated by TIRs are similar, with MyD88 (31Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar, 32Kawai T. Adachi O.

Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Google Scholar) having critical roles. The serine-threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are known to involve the signal transduction between MyD88 and TRAF6 (35Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar, 36Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar). Importantly, a marked impairment of MAP kinase activity has recently been reported in MyD88- or IRAK-4-deficient animals (32Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar, 37Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Google Scholar), suggesting that MyD88 and IRAK may be upstream mediators requiring MAP kinase activation for phosphorylation of PLA2. Further studies are required to address these issues.The PAF produced in response to TNF and IL-1 in turn is responsible for the secondary wave of NF-κB activation. Such a conclusion is supported by the following observations. (i) The plasma PAF levels paralleled those of NF-κB activation following LPS injection. (ii) BN 50739 or CV 6209 prevented the LPS-induced second phase of NF-κB activation in vivo as well as in vitro. (iii) TNF- or IL-1-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited by the PAF antagonist BN 50739 or CV 6209. These findings clearly indicate that together TNF and IL-1 play an important indirect role in the secondary activation of NF-κB via the synthesis of PAF. PAF and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, stimulate the release of each other by a positive feedback loop. In fact, many in vivo biological functions of TNF and IL-1 are mediated through the synthesis of PAF (13Im S.Y. Ko H.M. Kim J.W. Lee H.K. Ha T.Y. Lee H.B. Oh S.J. Bai S. Chung K.C. Lee Y.B. Kang H.S.

Thus, we provide another example of a positive feedback loop between PAF and TNF/IL-1 resulting in a second phase of NF-κB activation.The mechanism underlying TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation through PAF has not been fully understood. According to the literature published so far, TNF or IL-1 appear to activate NF-κB through two separate pathways, PLA2-independent and -dependent pathways. The former involves the recruitment of at least three proteins (TRADD, RIP, and TRAF2) to the type 1 TNF receptor tail, leading to the sequential activation of the downstream NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IκB-specific kinases (IKKα and IKKβ), resulting in the phosphorylation of the two N-terminal regulatory serines within IκBα (38Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 39Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59: i6-i16Google Scholar). However, recent in vivo studies with the alymphoplasia (aly) mouse, a natural strain with a mutated NIK (40Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Google Scholar), and NIK-deficient mice (41Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Google Scholar) have revealed that NIK is not a critical element in the TNF signaling pathway to NF-κB activation, indicating that the role of NIK in NF-κB activation through TNF receptor signaling requires further investigation. Apart from this pathway, TNF and IL-1 are also capable of activating PLA2, resulting in biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and PAF (42Godfrey R.W. Johnson W.J. Newman T. Hoffstein S.T. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 107-114Google Scholar, 43Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4475-4479Google Scholar, 44Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2524-2532Google Scholar, 45Liu S.J. McHowat J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1462-H1472Google Scholar). Several reports have demonstrated that PLA2 inhibitors block TNF-induced NF-κB activation (46Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gasvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebol L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Laegreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430Google Scholar, 47van Puijenbroek A.A. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. Peppelenbosch M.P. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 104-110Google Scholar). Given this information, our data suggests an inhibition of TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation by PAF antagonists may induce the late phase of NF-κB activation via the pathway involving PLA2-induced PAF synthesis. However, it is not clear whether these two pathways operate separately or in cooperation to activate NF-κB.Although biphasic activation of NF-κB is supposed to be associated with sustained inflammatory processes, the precise biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Recently, Lawrence et al. (48Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Google Scholar) reported that the late phase activation of NF-κB is associated with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2-derived anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1. Thus, inhibition of the late phase activation of NF-κB protracts inflammatory responses. This suggests that NF-κB has an anti-inflammatory role involving the regulation of inflammatory resolution. If that is the case, given the critical role for PAF in the induction of the late phase activation of NF-κB in this study, clinical studies showing no beneficial effect of PAF antagonists in patients with sepsis (49Vincent J.L. Spapen H. Bakker J. Webster N.R. Curtis L. Crit. Care. Med. 2000; 28: 638-642Google Scholar, 50Suputtamongkol Y. Intaranongpai S. Smith M.D. Angus B. Chaowagul W. Permpikul C. Simpson J.A. Leelarasamee A. Curtis L. White N.J. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2000; 44: 693-696Google Scholar) supports the anti-inflammatory role of NF-κB.Whatever the biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation, this study is the first to provide the precise molecular mechanisms for biphasic activation of NF-κB, which occurs in many inflammatory conditions. Such a biphasic or prolonged activation of NF-κB may develop in pathological situations in which the early release of PAF is abnormally enhanced. The transcription factor NF-κB is important for initiating and sustaining inflammatory reactions. The sustained or biphasic activation of NF-κB may be responsible for the prolonged inflammatory processes known to occur in various pathological situations (4Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar, 39Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59: i6-i16Google Scholar). However, recent in vivo studies with the alymphoplasia (aly) mouse, a natural strain with a mutated NIK (40Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Google Scholar), and NIK-deficient mice (41Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Google Scholar) have revealed that NIK is not a critical element in the TNF signaling pathway to NF-κB activation, indicating that the role of NIK in NF-κB activation through TNF receptor signaling requires further investigation. Apart from this pathway, TNF and IL-1 are also capable of activating PLA2, resulting in biosynthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and PAF (42Godfrey R.W. Johnson W.J. Newman T. Hoffstein S.T. Prostaglandins. 1988; 35: 107-114Google Scholar, 43Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several reports have demonstrated that PLA2 inhibitors block TNF-induced NF-κB activation (46Thommesen L. Sjursen W. Gasvik K. Hanssen W. Brekke O.L. Skattebol L. Holmeide A.K. Espevik T. Johansen B. Laegreid A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3421-3430Google Scholar, 47van Puijenbroek A.A. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. Peppelenbosch M.P. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 104-110Google Scholar). Given this information, our data suggests an inhibition of TNF- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation by PAF antagonists may induce the late phase of NF-κB activation via the pathway involving PLA2-induced PAF synthesis. However, it is not clear whether these two pathways operate separately or in cooperation to activate NF-κB. Although biphasic activation of NF-κB is supposed to be associated with sustained inflammatory processes, the precise biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Recently, Lawrence et al. (48Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Google Scholar) reported that the late phase activation of NF-κB is associated with the expression of cyclooxygenase 2-derived anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1. Thus, inhibition of the late phase activation of NF-κB protracts inflammatory responses. This suggests that NF-κB has an anti-inflammatory role involving the regulation of inflammatory resolution. If that is the case, given the critical role for PAF in the induction of the late phase activation of NF-κB in this study, clinical studies showing no beneficial effect of PAF antagonists in patients with sepsis (49Vincent J.L. Spapen H. Bakker J. Webster N.R. Curtis L. Crit. Care. Med. 2000; 28: 638-642Google Scholar, 50Suputtamongkol Y. Intaranongpai S. Smith M.D. Angus B. Chaowagul W. Permpikul C. Simpson J.A. Leelarasamee A. Curtis L. White N.J. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2000; 44: 693-696Google Scholar) supports the anti-inflammatory role of NF-κB. Whatever the biological significance of prolonged NF-κB activation, this study is the first to provide the precise molecular mechanisms for biphasic activation of NF-κB, which occurs in many inflammatory conditions. Such a biphasic or prolonged activation of NF-κB may develop in pathological situations in which the early release of PAF is abnormally enhanced. We thank Dr. Jon. D. Hennebold for his critical review and reading of the manuscript."

CYP enzymes are involved both in essential endogenous biosynthetic functions, e.g.steroids, hormones, and fatty acids, and in the metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals, e.g. drugs, carcinogens, and pollutants (1Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Google Scholar, 2Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13469-13472Google Scholar, 3Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R.

The biodiversity of cytochrome P450 genes has been revealed in dramatic fashion by genome sequencing projects, and so much so that many thousands of different forms have been or will be identified shortly. Within bacteria, some species such asEscherichia coli lack cytochrome P450 genes, whereas others contain many, such as the 20 forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J.

Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Google Scholar). Recently, genomic information on the methane-utilizing bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus has become available (www.tigr.org). This bacterium is one of the first and best elucidated of any prokaryotes for the production of sterols (5Bird C.W. Lynch J.M. Pirt F.J. Reid W.W. Brooks C.J.W. Middleditch B.S. Nature. 1971; 230: 473-474Google Scholar, 6Bouvier P. Rohmer M. Benveniste P. Ourisson G. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 267-271Google Scholar), a feature generally associated with eukaryotes. These investigations used minimal sterol-free media for growth, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry plus NMR for identification of 4-dimethyl, 4-methyl, and 4-demethyl sterols. This information indicated that a sterol 14-α demethylase was present in the organism that is encoded by a cytochrome P450, CYP51. The CYP-catalyzed reaction involves the molecular splitting of atmospheric oxygen to produce a molecule of water and a monooxygenated substrate (7Lewis D.F.V. Guide to Cytochromes P450: Structure and Function. Taylor & Francis, Andover, United Kingdom2002: 51-75Google Scholar). Two reducing equivalents are essential for this reaction. They are supplied by NADH or NADPH, depending on the origin of the CYP, and are transferred in two stages through either one or two redox partners. Different CYPs of eukaryotes and prokaryotes differ in their reductase partners as well as in co-factor requirements for catalytic activity (for review, see Ref. 8Degtyarenko K.N. Archakov A.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 1-8Google Scholar). In prokaryotes and mitochondrial CYPs (the general class I system), an iron-sulfur ferredoxin and a ferredoxin reductase are essential for electron transfer to the CYP. Class II eukaryotic membrane-bound CYPs of the endoplasmic reticulum require a FAD/FMN flavoprotein, namely NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase for activity. A similar class III system has also been found. It consists of a fused arrangement of CYP with a cytochrome P450 reductase-like FAD/FMN flavoprotein reductase domain. This has been observed and extensively studied in the case of CYP102A1 (BM3) from Bacillus megaterium (9Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Google Scholar, 10Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Haseman C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Google Scholar), and similar proteins are evident in Bacillus subtilis (11Gustafsson M.C.U. Palmer C.N.A. Wolf C.R. von Wachenfeldt C. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 459-464Google Scholar) and Fusarium oxysporum (12Nakayama N. Takemae A. Shoun H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 435-440Google Scholar). Because of interest in the catalytic cycle and protein-protein interactions, many examples of artificial class II fusion protein systems have been constructed (13Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa H. DNA Cell Biol. 1987; 6: 189-197Google Scholar, 14Fisher C.W. Shet M.S. Caudle D.L. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Estabrook R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10817-10821Google Scholar, 15Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Holmans P.L. Estabrook R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11748-11752Google Scholar) and, for CYP101, a bacterial class I enzyme, the production and activity of a triple fusion of CYP101 to ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase has been reported (16Sibbesen O. De Voss J.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22462-22469Google Scholar). By linking the ferredoxin reductase and the ferredoxin to CYP101 in an amino- to carboxyl-terminal arrangement, a self-sufficient protein with catalytic activity was obtained. This suggested the optimal arrangement for subunit interaction in the class I CYP complex. The importance of sterols in nature is well known, but not their role in bacteria. Because of our interest in such compounds in bacterial systems, the genome data for the Gram-negative bacterium M. capsulatus was examined for the presence of a sterol 14α-demethylase. A single CYP was detected with strong homology to CYP51, particularly to a form in M. tuberculosis (17Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Google Scholar). Definitive evidence of sterol production in this latter organism in sterol-free minimal medium is still to be demonstrated. Interestingly, this M. capsulatus CYP51 protein represented a new class of CYP consisting of the CYP domain fused to a ferredoxin domain at the C terminus via an alanine-rich linker. This new CYP class is related to class I CYPs and suggests an optimal or at least a functional arrangement selected through evolution, as reflected by this order of protein domains. Herein, we describe the discovery of this new CYP form and the biochemical evaluation of the novel protein. TheMethylococcus capsulatus type strain ATCC 19069 was obtained from the National Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB Ltd., Aberdeen, Scotland). Cells were cultured in 250 ml of minimal salts medium (18Dalton H. Whittenbury R. Arch. Microbiol. 1976; 109: 147-151Google Scholar) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of methane/air, 1:1 (v/v). After 3 days of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once in 10 ml of 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Sequence data for the genome of Methylococcus capsulatus was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website at www.tigr.org. A BLASTX (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) homology search of the translated M. capsulatusgenome was made using the protein sequence of the M. tuberculosis (Mtb) cytochrome P450 sterol 14 α-demethylase protein (CYP51) (20Aoyama Y. Horiuchi T. Gotoh O. Noshiro M. Yoshida Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 694-696Google Scholar). Fifty milligrams of cells were resuspended in 500 μl of sterile, double-distilled water and boiled for 10 min. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was aspirated and snap-cooled on ice. Primers MC51F (5′-AGCTCATATGAGCCATCCCCCTTC-3′) and MC51R (5′-GCATAAGCTT¯¯CAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATCCTCGCCCGAGGC-3′) were designed to amplify the M. capsulatus cyp51fxORF. The primers incorporate unique NdeI (underlined) andHindIII (double underlined) cloning sites and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag (bold) for downstream purification of the expressed protein. The PCR reaction was assembled using 40 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 24 μl of magnesium chloride (25 mm), 6 μl of dNTPs (25 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP), 6 μl of each primer (10 pmol), 253 μl of PCR-grade water, 28 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma), 10 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 32 μl of DNA template (all PCR reagents and restriction enzymes supplied by Promega). The PCR mix was divided into four 100-μl aliquots. Amplification was carried out by denaturation at 95 °C for 120 s and then 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 120 s. A terminal extension of 10 min at 72 °C completed the reaction. The PCR product was purified from an agarose gel and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The insert was excised by double-digestion withNdeI and HindIII restriction enzymes (Promega), cloned into the pET17-b expression vector (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli BL21-pLYS cells (Invitrogen). For protein expression, transformed cells were grown in Terrific broth (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4 ml/liter glycerol, 2.3 g/liter KH2PO4, and 12.5 g/liter K2HPO4) for 5 h at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a 1 mmfinal concentration. δ-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (Fluka) was added to 2 mm to optimize production of cytochrome P450, and incubation continued at 24 °C for 20 h. Eight liters of MCCYP51FX culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 × g and resuspended in 200 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were broken following two passages through a C5 homogenizer (Avestin) using an operating pressure of 15,000 p.s.i. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The cytosolic fraction was separated from the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. MCCYP51FX was isolated using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate and 20% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). The column was washed with Buffer A containing 50 mm glycine and 0.5 m sodium chloride, and MCCYP51FX was eluted with buffer A containing 100 mmimidazole. MCCYP51FX was dialyzed overnight against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. Activities of class I CYP enzymes require the support of a ferredoxin and a ferredoxin reductase for catalysis. Although the MCCYP51FX contained the CYP and the ferredoxin domains fused, the third essential component of a functional endogenous ferredoxin reductase for MCCYP51FX activity was unknown. The capacity of spinach ferredoxin reductase (Sigma) to drive MCCYP51FX-mediated sterol 14α-demethylation was determined. Furthermore, the addition of saturating amounts of spinach ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase were assessed in their contribution to stimulate MCCYP51FX activity and hence determine inter- or intramolecular electron transfer within the MCCYP51FX fusion complex. Reaction mixtures contained 1 nmol/ml purified MCCYP51FX and 1 nmol of spinach ferredoxin reductase. Lanosterol dispersed in Triton WR-1339 was resuspended in MOPS buffer. The reaction volume was adjusted to 950 μl, and NADPH was added to a 1 mm final concentration to start the reaction. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 ml of methanol, and sterols were extracted by incubation with 90% (w/v) ethanolic potassium hydroxide at 80 °C for 1 h in a preheated water bath. Following silylation for 1 h at 60 °C with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) (50 μl) in 50 μl of toluene, sterol substrates and metabolites were clearly separated and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (VG 12–250; VG Biotech). The activity (nanomole of demethylated product formed per minute per nanomole of P450) was calculated using the amount of substrate added and the conversion ratio (calculated from the areas of the two peaks representing methylated and demethylated sterol). EPR spectra were recorded with an updated Bruker ER200D-SRC spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cooling system, an NMR gauss meter, and a microwave frequency counter. Spectra were recorded at 5 K with a microwave power of 0.5 milliwatts at 9.6 GHz using 1.0-millitelsa field modulation at 100 kHz. Gel filtration was performed using a Sephacryl S-400HR column (42 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15m sodium chloride, and 0.1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 10 ml/h at 4 °C. The column was calibrated using the protein standards cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa). The void volume was determined by chromatography of blue dextran (2000 kDa). MCCYP51FX (1 ml of 1 mg/ml) was subjected to chromatography on Sephacryl S-400HR under the same conditions. Reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra for quantification of cytochrome P450 content were measured and calculated according to the method described by Omura and Sato (21Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Google Scholar). Substrate-induced spectral changes were examined according to Jefcoate (22Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). The content of iron was estimated according to published methods (23Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were supplied by Sigma. BLASTX searching using the protein sequence of theM. tuberculosis cytochrome P450 sterol 14 α-demethylase protein (CYP51) (20Aoyama Y. Horiuchi T. Gotoh O. Noshiro M. Yoshida Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 694-696Google Scholar) as a query against the M. capsulatus genome identified a single CYP with homology to CYP51s from a range of organisms (Figs.1 A and 5 A). Using the Pfam motif of CYP (heme-binding domain FXXGXRXCXX) in a BLASTX search of the genome, this putative CYP51 was shown to be the only CYP present in the genome of this organism. The M. capsulatus CYP51 protein is 551 amino acids in length and shows the strongest homology to CYP51 from M. tuberculosis (17Bellamine A. Mangla A.T. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8937-8942Google Scholar) (49% identical, 219/444; 64% similar, 289/444). The closest eukaryotic homologue is CYP51 from Sorghum bicolor (24Bak S. Kahn R.A. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 191-201Google Scholar) (38% identical, 172/449). However, the putative M. capsulatus CYP51 is 100 residues longer than its closest CYP51 homologue from M. tuberculosis. This additional downstream sequence was proposed to comprise a fused putative ferredoxin, with the best homology to a ferredoxin immediately downstream of CYP51 fromM. tuberculosis (Mtb Rv0763c, 42% identical, 26/61), but this 100-amino acid extension included a linker region and a C-terminal domain not found in Mtb Rv0763c. An alanine rich region (7 of 14 residues) is found between the end of the CYP domain and the beginning of the ferredoxin domain, and we propose that this region may act as a flexible hinge allowing interaction between CYP and ferredoxin (Fig.1 B). Such structural architecture is unique to the MCCYP51FX and is not seen in other CYP fusion proteins described to date such as CYP102A1, the most extensively studied CYP fusion. However, an alanine-rich linker region has been described in other bacterial fusion proteins, notably in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from E. coli (25Turner S.L. Russell G.C. Williamson M.P. Guest J.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 101-108Google Scholar). A purine rich region is located 10 bp upstream from the start codon and is a potential Shine-Delgarno sequence.Figure 5Sequence alignments of the CYP51 and ferredoxin domains of MCCYP51FX.

MCCYP51FX was produced as a recombinant protein in E. coli with levels of expression exceeding >2000 nmol of hemoprotein per liter of culture as quantified from the reduced carbon monoxide cytochrome P450 difference spectrum. Cell fractionation revealed MCCYP51FX to be a soluble protein, being located in the cytosolic fraction following ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g. No CYP was detected in the isolated E. colimembranes. After two consecutive Ni2+-affinity chromatography purification steps, the specific content of MCCYP51FX was calculated to be 17.2 nmol of hemoprotein per milligram of protein. A single homogeneous band was observed on SDS-PAGE at ∼62kDa (Fig.2), being comparable with the predicted molecular mass of the fusion protein (62.4kDa). Other experiments using a tetrahistidine tag instead of the decahistidine tag at the C terminus of MCCYP51FX showed poor affinity in similar purification attempts, although this is successful for most other soluble bacterial CYP proteins. Purified MCCYP51FX has a typical CYP-reduced CO spectrum, with the spectral maximum located at 448 nm (Fig. 3 A). The absolute spectrum revealed the Soret maximum to be located at 419 nm with the α- and β-bands for the oxidized form located at 565 and 534 nm, respectively, which is typical for a low-spin cytochrome P450 (Fig.3 A). Quantification of the iron content of MCCYP51FX (3.92 ± 0.14 molecules of iron per molecule of MCCYP51FX)indicated that there were four molecules of iron per molecule of MCCYP51FX. This confirms a 3Fe-4S ferredoxin component to the fusion protein with one molecule of iron associated with the heme of the P450. Sephacryl S-400HR column chromatography was used to estimate the oligomeric status of the protein. Compared with molecular mass standards, it gave an apparent molecular mass of 706 kDa. (data not shown). Therefore, MCCYP51FX had a molecular mass in excess of 443 kDa and was probably a 12-mer.Figure 3Absolute, carbon monoxide difference spectrum, and substrate binding spectra of purified MCCYP51FX.

Equal concentrations of purified MCCYP51FX (500 μl, 1 nmol) were placed in one sample and one reference chamber of two split cuvettes, and an equal volume of buffer was placed in the other chambers. Lanosterol was added to the P450 chamber of the sample cuvette and to the buffer chamber of the reference cuvette (0.1–10 μM). Lanosterol was dispersed in Triton WR-1339 for use in these studies, and the detergent did not produce a spectral change at equivalent concentrations to those used here or in separate experiments with purified M. tuberculosis CYP51 wherein a Type I spectrum with lanosterol was observed. The sterol binding spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 1 nm/s. All spectra were corrected for the absorbance contribution of the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the absence of substrates, most CYP enzymes are low-spin with a water molecule hexacoordinated to the CYP heme iron. Substrate addition shifts the heme to the high-spin state, which gives rise to a substrate-induced difference spectrum (22Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Google Scholar). In the case of many CYPs, the addition of a substrate leads to a peak at 390 nm and a trough at 420 nm. The addition of lanosterol to MCCYP51FX was characterized with a spectral maximum at 438 nm and a trough at 420 nm (Fig. 3 B). This is indicative of a type II spectrum, which is usually characterized by molecules interacting with the heme iron as a sixth ligand. However, complementary control experiments utilizing purified M. tuberculosis CYP51 showed that lanosterol induced a type I spectrum (peak at 390 nm, trough at 420 nm). In the case of the results obtained here for MCCYP51FX, the CYP conformational change on association with substrate may be altered because of the ferredoxin domain, giving rise to a substrate-bound, low-spin complex and the corresponding Type II spectrum, but this remains speculation. This result was unusual, and further work will be needed to establish the events causing it. Fig. 4shows the EPR spectrum of purified MCCYP51FX in the oxidized form. The clearest features are at g values 2.43, 2.26, and 1.91 in the spectrum of MCCYP51FX; these are very similar to those reported for low-spin ferric iron in various cytochrome P450 genes and, in particular, are essentially identical to the g values of 2.45, 2.27, and 1.92 from the purified lanosterol 14α-demethylating enzymes isolated fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans(26Yoshida Y. Aoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1655-1660Google Scholar, 27Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Schunck W.H. Shyadehi A.Z. Akhtar M. Lowe D.J. Baldwin B.C. Kelly S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5682-5688Google Scholar). The spectrum also shows a derivative signal at g = 2.0, which is presumably from a sum of free radical and 3Fe/S centers. Because EPR is a sensitive probe of the electronic structure of paramagnetic centers, the low-spin ferric EPR spectrum of Fig. 4 shows that fusion of the CYP51 domain with the ferredoxin domain has no major effect on the CYP heme environment through gross conformational change in the protein architecture. Reconstitution of recombinant MCCYP51FX with spinach ferredoxin reductase was carried out using lanosterol as substrate. After 20 min incubation, the reconstitution reaction mixture was extracted using ethanolic potassium hydroxide, and the sterols were partitioned into hexane, silylated, and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Following reconstitution with lanosterol, the extracted reaction mixture contained two principal sterols (TableI). The compound with a retention time of 92 min was silylated lanosterol with a molecular ion at 498m/z. A compound, the formation of which was dependent upon the presence of MCCYP51FX, had a retention time of 87 min and a molecular ion at 484 m/z. This compound was identified as the silylated 14α-demethylated 4α-methyl-5α-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien-3β-ol. In control experiments, the fragmentation pattern of the molecular ion of the silylated product catalyzed by MCCYP51FX is identical to the mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern observed for the 14α-demethylated product from lanosterol generated in a purified, reconstituted C. albicans CYP51/NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase enzyme system (28Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 263-265Google Scholar). The activity was calculated to be 0.24 nmol of demethylated product formed per minute per nanomole of MCCYP51FX, with no metabolism detected in the absence of MCCYP51FX or NADPH. Furthermore, MCCYP51FX activity was wholly dependent upon the presence of spinach ferredoxin reductase with no sterol demethylase activity being observed when ferredoxin reductase was omitted from the reaction mixture. The addition of 18 nmol of spinach ferredoxin to the reaction in the presence of 1 nmol of MCCYP51FX and 1 nmol of spinach ferredoxin reductase had no significant effect on demethylase activity, with a turnover of 0.26 nmol of demethylated product formed per minute per nanomole of MCCYP51FX being obtained. Observations, particularly within eukaryotic CYP systems (29Peterson J.A. Ebel R.E. O'Keefe D.H. Matsubara T. Estabrook R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4010-4016Google Scholar, 30Venkateswarlu K.

Biophys. 2001; 396: 16-24Google Scholar), indicate that one reductase molecule is able to transfer reducing equivalents to multiple CYP molecules, and the situation for MCCYP51FX is complicated by the oligomeric nature of the purified protein. It may transfer electrons directly to the CYP to which it is attached, or it may equally reduce the CYP attached to a separate molecule. Further work is required to separate the possibilities as for other examples of fusion proteins.Table IComparison of MCCYP51FX supported lanosterol 14α-demethylase activitiesProtein combinationLanosterol 14α-demethylase activityaLanosterol 14α-demethylase activity is expressed as a nanomole of product produced per minute per nanomole of MCCYP51FX fusion protein.MCCYP51FX aloneN.D.bN.D., no detectable activity.MCCYP51FX + NADPHN.D.bN.D., no detectable activity.MCCYP51FX + ferredoxin reductase − NADPHN.D.bN.D., no detectable activity.MCCYP51FX + ferredoxin reductase + NADPH0.24MCCYP51FX + ferredoxin + ferredoxin reductase + NADPH0.26Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and lanosterol and metabolites were clearly separated and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.a Lanosterol 14α-demethylase activity is expressed as a nanomole of product produced per minute per nanomole of MCCYP51FX fusion protein.b N.D., no detectable activity. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and lanosterol and metabolites were clearly separated and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Herein, we describe a new class of cytochrome P450 comprising a fusion of the hemoprotein at the C terminus to a ferredoxin via an alanine-rich linker. The role of this CYP in sterol biosynthesis was confirmed, and activity was measured showing the functional role of the ferredoxin in MCCYP51FX. The measurement of the hemoprotein by UV-visible and EPR confirmed the characteristics of the purified hemoprotein domain as a low-spin type CYP, and the ferredoxin was considered to be a 3Fe-4S type of ferredoxin. The requirement of sterol biosynthesis in the bacterium and the evolutionary origin of this CYP, normally associated with eukaryotes, is open to much conjecture. The similarity to plant sequences and to the Mtb Rv0764c CYP open reading frame followed by ferredoxin Mtb Rv0763 are areas open to conjecture (Fig. 5, A andB). Possibly, the bacterial genes arose by horizontal transfer; but this transfer, together with other genes that are not genetically linked, seems difficult to understand. Currently, the presence of such genes in bacteria is extremely rare. The relationship of MCCYP51FX to Mtb Rv0764c and Rv0763c is interesting, because inM. tuberculosis CYP51 is part of a putative operon and is followed by a ferredoxin open reading frame. The possibility exists that MCCYP51Fx arose from the mutation of a CYP51 nonsense codon allowing subsequent translational read-through to an adjacent ferredoxin, and mutation and selection may have given rise to this new class of CYP protein. The flanking genes for MCCYP51Fx are, upstream, a potential thiC-type gene, which in B. subtilis is involved in thiamine biosynthesis (32Zhang Y. Taylor S.V. Chiu H.J. Begley T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3030-3035Google Scholar), and, downstream, an orphan ORF. Neither flanking genes are found adjacent to Mtb Rv0764c in the genome of M. tuberculosis. Further work toward understanding the evolution of CYP51 is important also for understanding the origins of the superfamily, and this novel fusion protein adds additional interest to these ongoing considerations."

With its C-S lyase activity, alliinase is able to cleave the Cβ-Sγ bond of sulfoxide derivatives of cysteine to produce allicin (Fig.1 B).

https://openalex.org/W2081004177,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprocesses N-linked glycans in the Golgi apparatus in two different ways. Whereas most of the proteins of internal membranes receive a simple core-type structure, a long branched polymer termed mannan is attached to the glycans of many of the proteins destined for the cell wall. The first step in mannan synthesis is the initiation and extension of an α-1,6-linked polymannose backbone. This requires the sequential action of two enzyme complexes, mannan polymerases (M-Pol) I and II. M-Pol I contains the proteins Mnn9p and Van1p, although the stoichiometry and individual contributions to enzyme action are unclear. We report here that the two proteins are each present as a single copy in the complex. Both proteins contain a DXD motif found in the active site of many glycosyltransferases, and mutations in this motif in Mnn9p or Van1p reveal that both proteins contribute to mannose polymerization. However, the effects of these mutations on both the in vivo and in vitroactivity are distinct, suggesting that the two proteins may have different roles in the complex. Finally, we show that a simple glycoprotein based on hen egg lysozyme can be used as a substrate for modification by purified M-Pol I in vitro.

Finally, we show that a simple glycoprotein based on hen egg lysozyme can be used as a substrate for modification by purified M-Pol I in vitro. N-linked glycans are attached to many of the secreted and membrane proteins made by eukaryotic cells. The structures ofN-linked glycans vary greatly between species and between individual proteins produced by a single species or cell type. This diversity is generated by differential processing of an invariant GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 structure that is attached during insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; endo H, endoglycosidase H; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. This is initially trimmed by ER-localized glucosidases and mannosidases in a manner that is not protein-specific but rather is linked to protein folding (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Google Scholar). However, when the trimmed GlcNAc2Man8–9 N-glycan arrives in the Golgi it can be trimmed further by mannosidases and then modified by many different glycosyltransferases to generate the observed diversity of glycan structures (2Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Google Scholar, 3Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 412-421Google Scholar). Golgi glycosyltransferases vary greatly between different species and cell types and can also show substrate selectivity between the glycoprotein substrates expressed by a given cell type. This results in the variation of glycosylation seen between different species and also between the glycoproteins produced by an individual cell. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven useful for identifying features of glycosyltransferase structure, function, and targeting that are well conserved in higher eukaryotes. Yeast generate just two main N-glycan structures, a small core-type structure found on many glycoproteins of internal compartments and a large mannan structure found on proteins of the cell wall and the periplasm (4Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Google Scholar, 5Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Google Scholar). The mannan structure contains ∼100–300 mannoses per N-glycan and constitutes 40% of the dry weight of the yeast cell wall. Nonetheless mannan is not essential for viability (6Nakanishishindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Google Scholar,7Ballou L. Cohen R.E. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5986-5991Google Scholar). Presumably because of their harsh natural environment yeast have the ability to respond to cell wall damage or perturbation by increasing the synthesis of cell wall components. Thus cells lacking mannan are dependent for their viability on intact stress response pathways, and have elevated levels of chitin and cell wall proteins (8Osmond B.C. Specht C.A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11206-11210Google Scholar, 9Neiman A.M. Mhaiskar V. Manus V. Galibert F. Dean N. Genetics. 1997; 145: 637-645Google Scholar, 10de Nobel H. van Den Ende H.

Isono K. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1493-1503Google Scholar). This viability has facilitated the genetic analysis of the steps of mannan synthesis, and combined with the altered chemical sensitivities of glycosylation mutants (13Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Google Scholar, 14Dean N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1287-1291Google Scholar, 15Ram A.F.J. Wolters A. Tenhoopen R. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1019-1030Google Scholar), has allowed the cloning of the relevant Golgi glycosyltransferases. The first step of Golgi processing is the addition of a single α-1,6-linked mannose to all N-glycans by the mannosyltransferase Och1p (16Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Google Scholar). The next step is protein-specific (Fig. 1 A). For proteins that receive a core-type structure an as yet unidentified enzyme adds an α-1,2-linked mannose to the mannose added by Och1p, followed by terminal α-1,3-linked mannoses from Mnn1p (17Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8255-8261Google Scholar, 18Trimble R.B. Atkinson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9815-9824Google Scholar). In contrast, on mannoproteins an α-1,6-linked mannose is attached to the mannose added by Och1p, and this is then extended to generate a long α-1,6-linked backbone which is then branched by the addition of α-1,2-linked and then α-1,3-linked mannoses (19Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Google Scholar, 20Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Google Scholar). The mannan backbone is generated by two multiprotein complexes called mannan polymerase (M-Pol) I and II (21Kojima H. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biosci Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1970-1976Google Scholar, 22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar). At present it is not clear why some proteins receive mannan and others do not. This issue is of relevance not only to the general biological question of how glycan diversity is generated in the Golgi, but also to the use of yeast as an expression system for the production of recombinant glycoproteins. The M-Pol I complex is responsible for the first committed step in the generation of mannan structure, and so might be expected to play a role in substrate selection. Indeed, in cells lacking the components of the complex, mannoproteins receive a core-type structure (13Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Google Scholar, 24Hernandez L.M. Ballou L. Alvarado E. Gillece-Castro B.L. Burlingame A.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11849-11856Google Scholar). The M-Pol I complex contains two related proteins, Van1p and Mnn9p (22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar). Both of these appear to be canonical Golgi glycosyltransferases in that they are type II membrane proteins with an N-terminal transmembrane domain (25Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 898-909Google Scholar). Moreover, they both have a well conserved DXD motif that is also found to be conserved in many families of nucleoside diphosphate sugar using glycosyltransferases (28Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Google Scholar, 29Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Google Scholar, 30Saxena I.M. Brown R.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 523-531Google Scholar). Structural studies on a number of enzymes have shown that these aspartate residues coordinate the Mn2+ ion that plays a central role in catalysis (31Unligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Google Scholar, 32Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Google Scholar, 33Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O.

Moreover, the aspartates have been shown to necessary for the activity of a wide range of glycosyltransferases (29Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this paper we determine the stoichiometry of Mnn9p and Van1p in M-Pol I, and use mutations in their DXD motifs to investigate in vivo and in vitro the contribution the two proteins make to the activity of the complex. S. cerevisiae SEY6210 (MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2Δ9) and SEY6211 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his-3Δ200 trp1-Δ901 ade2–101 suc2Δ9) were used as wild-type strains (39Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Google Scholar). Gene disruptions or C-terminal fusions to Van1p or Mnn9p were generated by PCR-mediated homologous recombination using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene (40Wach A. Brachat A. AlbertiSegui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Google Scholar). Strains were checked by PCR or Western blotting. MNN1was deleted using plasmid pDRMNN1, which contains 432 bp of theMNN1 promoter and 542 bp of MNN1 terminator sequences flanking the LEU2 gene in pUC19. Strain DT111 (MATa och1::LEU2 mns1 mnn1 ura3, Ref. 41Tessier D.C. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Daniel Tessier (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal), and used for large scale purification of lysozyme-G49N. The Δoch1Δmnn1 strain was generated by sporulation of a cross of XCY42-30D (MATura3 trp1 lys2 ade2–101 α leu2–3,112 mnn1::LEU2, Ref. 25Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2723-2727Google Scholar) with a Δoch1 strain (SEY6210och1::HIS5Sp). The multiple protease-deficient strain c13-ABYS 86 (MATα pra1–1 prb1–1 prc1–1 cps1–3 ura3Δ5 leu2–3,112 his3; Ref. 42Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Google Scholar) was used for expression of Och1p-ZZ. A cDNA encoding hen egg lysozyme was mutagenized to change the codon for glycine 49 to asparagine (QuickChange, Stratagene). The cDNA was cloned into yeast vectors pVT100-U (43Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Google Scholar) for Western blot analysis, and pTG10241 (44Nacken V. Achstetter T. Degryse E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 253-260Google Scholar) for preparative purification of lysozyme-G49N. For co-expression of Mnn9p and Van1p, VAN1-ZZ was cloned by gap repair from an integrative transformant (23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar) and inserted into pRS424. TheMNN9 gene, isolated from a genomic clone as aBstYI fragment containing 950 bp of promoter and 614 bp of terminator sequences, was then ligated into the BamHI site of the resulting plasmid. AXD versions of MNN9and VAN1-ZZ were generated by using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). Och1p was expressed in S. cerevisiae from plasmid pVT100-U as a cytoplasmic protein, starting with the amino acid sequence MLPTSS (where Leu (L) is amino acid 53 in the wild-type protein) and a protein A tag at the C terminus (Och1p-ZZ). To generate gene transplacements AXD versions ofVAN1 and MNN9 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenic primers also encoded restriction sites to allow for easy identification of mutants. The resultingmnn9-AXD and van1-AXD forms were inserted into YIplac211 (45Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmids linearized at restriction sites within the genes for integration at the wild-type locus. After selection for Ura+ transformants, the strains were grown twice for 24 h in non-selective medium, and plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for loss of the URA3 gene. Mutants that had retained the AXD allele were identified by restriction digestion of PCR amplification products. Total membranes were isolated after breaking yeast cells with glass beads in 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA in the presence of protease inhibitors. After removal of cell debris (3000 × g, 5 min), membranes were pelleted (100,000 × g, 30 min), and 1 mg of membrane protein was solubilized with 500 μl of 1% dodecylmaltoside in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) the supernatant was incubated with anti-HA monoclonal 12CA5 for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubation overnight. The beads were collected by filtration, washed six times with 500 μl of the solubilization buffer now containing 0.1% dodecylmaltoside and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and bound proteins released with SDS sample buffer at 50 °C. A fragment of MNN9 encoding the C-terminal part of the protein starting with amino acids39LLGLNGQSISQH was ligated into the His6-tagging expression vector pTrcHis A (Invitrogen) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) as an insoluble protein. After purification on nickel-nitrilotriaceticic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, the protein was used for immunizations of rabbits. The antiserum against hen egg lysozyme (Sigma) was a gift from Mike Lewis, MRC-LMB. Antisera against lysozyme, Mnn9p and Van1p (23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar) were affinity purified on antigen coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For protein blotting analysis of secreted lysozyme-G49N, yeast strains transformed with the plasmid pVT100-U-HELG49N were grown for 3 days. Protein from 1.8 ml of culture supernatant was precipitated at 4 °C with 10% (w/v) of trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with cold acetone, dried, and boiled in SDS sample buffer for electrophoresis. A hybridoma supernatant containing the anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was used for blotting at a 1:10 dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of protein A-tagged M-Pol I complexes was performed from 1 g (wet weight) of cells and followed published procedures except the detergent used was 1% dodecylmaltoside for solubilization and 0.1% dodecylmaltoside for washes (22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar). Mannosyltransferase assays contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside, 10 mm α-1,6 d-mannobiose (Dextra Laboratories), 0.6 mm GDP-mannose, 62 nCi of GDP-d-[U-14C]mannose (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) analysis of reaction products was done essentially as described (23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar, 46Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Google Scholar). For mannosidase digestions α-1,6-mannosidase (New England Biolabs) and α-1,2-mannosidase (Aspergillus satoi, Glyko) were used in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5. Strain DT111, transformed with pTG10241-HELG49N, was grown in minimal medium lacking uracil for 3 days. The medium was diluted 5-fold with 12.5 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, and 5 ml of settled SP Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added per liter of medium. After stirring for at least 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were allowed to settle and transferred to a column. After washing with 100 mm NaCl in 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, the protein was eluted with 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer, dialyzed against water, concentrated by freeze-drying, dialyzed into PBS, and aliquoted for storage at −20 °C. To generate a form of lysozyme suitable for modification by M-Pol I, the protein purified from strain DT111 was first mannosylated in vitro with Och1p. A soluble, protein A-tagged form of Och1p expressed in yeast from the plasmid Och1p-ZZ described above, was isolated with IgG-Sepharose from 0.1 g (wet weight) of cells, and the beads were incubated with 8 μg of lysozyme-G49N as acceptor protein in 60 μl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton-X 100, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.6 mm unlabeled GDP-mannose for 7.5 h at 30 °C. Reaction products were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline to remove unused GDP-mannose and then incubated with M-Pol I complexes immobilized on IgG-Sepharose beads. Reactions contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2, 125 nCi of GDP-d-[U-14C]mannose, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside and 50 μl of beads containing M-Pol I complexes prepared from 0.5 g (wet weight) of cells. Incubation was performed for 7.5 h at 30 °C, followed by a brief centrifugation to remove the beads. The supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and boiled in SDS sample buffer for separation on a 15% gel. After Coomassie Blue staining and drying, the gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Typhoon, Molecular Dynamics). The Golgi-luminal domain of Mnn9p was expressed in E. coli, and a polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against the recombinant protein. After affinity purification the serum recognized a protein of 45 kDa in protein blots of total extracts from wild-type cells (Fig.1 B), close to the predicted molecular size of 45.8 kDa for Mnn9p, which has no sites forN-linked glycosylation. This species is drastically increased in abundance when the MNN9 is present on a multicopy plasmid, is absent when MNN9 is deleted, and has reduced mobility when a triple HA epitope tag is inserted at the C terminus of the MNN9 open reading frame. We conclude that the serum specifically recognizes Mnn9p. To investigate the stoichiometry of Mnn9p and Van1p in M-Pol I, a diploid strain was constructed in which one allele of the VAN1 gene was tagged at the C terminus with a triple HA epitope tag. We have previously found that when Van1p is tagged at the C terminus it retains its activity and its association with Mnn9p (22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar, 23Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Google Scholar), and in the diploid cells, the tagged and untagged proteins were present at comparable levels when analyzed with a Van1p-specific serum (Fig. 1 C). The membranes from the tagged strain were solubilized with detergent, and the lysate incubated with beads coated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Fig. 1 C shows that only Van1p-HA bound to the beads, while the untagged Van1p remained in the supernatant. A proportion of Mnn9p was also bound to the beads indicating that the M-Pol I complexes remained intact during isolation. The free Mnn9p is presumably associated with the untagged Van1p, and moreover Mnn9p, unlike Van1p, is also present in the M-Pol II complex. Antisera against Anp1p, a component of M-Pol lI, showed that as expected this complex does not associate with Van1p-HA (Fig. 1 C). The absence of association between Van1p-HA and Van1p indicates that the M-Pol I complex contains only a single copy of Van1p. A similar strategy was used to analyze the stoichiometry of Mnn9p in M-Pol I. Detergent lysates were prepared from a diploid strain in which one copy of MNN9 was tagged with the triple HA epitope. Since Mnn9p is present in both M-Pol I and M-Pol II, the latter complex was initially depleted from the lysate using an anti-Anp1p serum. This treatment removed all of the Anp1p (Fig. 1 C) and more than half of the Mnn9p from the lysate (data not shown). When the lysate was then incubated with anti-HA monoclonal and protein A beads, all remaining Mnn9p-HA was precipitated. In contrast, the untagged Mnn9p remained in the supernatant. About half of the Van1p present after removal of M-Pol II coprecipitated with Mnn9p-HA, indicating that the M-Pol I complex had remained intact during the isolation procedure. Taken together these results indicate that M-Pol I is a heterodimeric complex consisting of one copy of Van1p and one copy of Mnn9p. Interestingly, the situation with M-Pol II appears to be different. If this complex was not removed with anti-Anp1p prior to precipitation of Mnn9p-HA, then untagged Mnn9p is coisolated with Mnn9p-HA (Fig.1 D). A similar immunoprecipitation was performed on a diploid strain carrying one tagged allele of ANP1. After precipitation with 12CA5 and protein A beads, untagged Anp1p co-precipitated with Anp1p-HA, indicating that Anp1p is also present at more than one copy in the M-Pol II complex (Fig. 1 D). Together, these results show that the overall architecture of M-Pol I is simpler than the structure of M-Pol II, which involves five subunits, at least two of which are present in multiple copies. The primary function of M-Pol I is to initiate and extend the α-1,6-linked backbone of the mannan structure, and the complex has mannosyltransferase activity in vitro (22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar). This raises the question of what contribution the two proteins in the complex make to the synthesis of the α-1,6-linked polymer. This cannot be addressed by simply deleting the individual genes, as it has been found that deletion of MNN9 results in greatly reduced levels of both Van1p and Anp1p, presumably due to destabilization in the absence of their normal binding partner (21Kojima H. Hashimoto H. Yoda K. Biosci Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1970-1976Google Scholar, 22Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Google Scholar). We therefore made use of the DXD motifs in Mnn9p and Van1p, which have been shown in other glycosyltransferases to be present in the catalytic site and essential for activity, but in those cases examined not required for normal folding and assembly (28Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Google Scholar, 29Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Google Scholar). Thus mutant versions ofMNN9 and VAN1 were generated in which the DXD motif was altered to AXD (mnn9-AXD (D236A); andvan1-AXD (D361A)). The mutant alleles were used to substitute the wild-type allele by gene transplacement (47Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4951-4955Google Scholar), and protein blotting indicated that the mutant proteins were present at similar levels to those found in wild-type cells (data not shown). Defects in mannan synthesis are known to result in a resistance to vanadate (13Ballou L. Hitzeman R.A. Lewis M.S. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3209-3212Google Scholar), and Fig. 2 Ashows that the mnn9-AXD andvan1-AXD strains behave like the Δmnn9 and Δvan1 deletion strains in that they are capable of growing on 10 mm sodium vanadate. To investigate whether the AXD mutations affect the ability of the proteins to associate, the wild-type and mutant forms of the two genes were co-expressed from plasmids in all four possible combinations. In each case Van1p was tagged with protein A (Van1p-ZZ), and IgG-Sepharose was used to isolated the proteins from cell lysates. Fig. 2 B shows that Mnn9p coprecipitates with Van1p-ZZ on IgG-Sepharose beads regardless of whether there is an AXD mutation in MNN9 or VAN1 or both. Thusmnn9-AXD and van1-AXD alleles encode stable proteins that are capable of normal interactions but appear to have defective activity. To analyze directly the effect of the AXD mutations in MNN9 and VAN1 on mannan synthesis we used as a reporter protein a glycosylated mutant of hen egg lysozyme. The signal sequence of the avian protein is functional in S. cerevisiae and the protein is secreted into the medium from which it can be readily purified by cation-exchange chromatography. When the protein is N-glycosylated on a single sequon introduced by mutagenesis (G49N), it receives an extensive mannan structure in the Golgi (48Nakamura S. Takasaki H. Kobayashi K. Kato A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12706-12712Google Scholar). This reporter has the advantage that it is a small protein and so most of its mass is contributed by the saccharide, increasing the ease of detecting changes in glycan addition. Moreover the presence of only a single glycan means that changes in the gel mobility should directly reflect changes in the length of the glycan added. A similar glycosylated mutant of human lysozyme has proven informative as a reporter of glycosylation in mammalian cells (49Horst M. Harth N. Hasilik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13914-13919Google Scholar, 50Hummel M. Hedrich H.C. Hasilik A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 428-433Google Scholar). When expressed in yeast, wild-type lysozyme protein migrates as a 14 kDa protein, and, as previously reported, the G49N form has a greatly reduced mobility, running as a smear of 150–200 kDa on an SDS gel (Fig. 3 A and Ref. 48Nakamura S. Takasaki H. Kobayashi K. Kato A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12706-12712Google Scholar). We did not observe any reporter protein secreted with no N-linked sugars or with only core structures attached, indicating that modification and maturation are very efficient. Treatment with endoglycosidase H (endo H) to release N-linked glycans, restored the mobility of lysozyme-G49N to close to that of the unmodified protein. More lysozyme is detected on the blot after digestion, presumably because the highly glycosylated form of lysozyme is only partially transferred from the gel during blotting. Having established that lysozyme-G49N behaved as expected in the wild-type stain, we next examined how its mobility was affected by deletion of particular Golgi glycosyltransferases. Fig. 3 Bshows that loss of the M-Pol II subunit Anp1p resulted in intermediate mobility while cell lacking Och1p and Mnn1p, and hence incapable of any Golgi mannose addition to the ER-derived N-glycan structure, produced a rapidly migrating form (16 kDa). We next examined the effect on glycosylation of the AXD mutations of Mnn9p and Van1p.mnn9-AXD and Δmnn9 cells both produce lysozyme-G49N with the same mobility, close to that of the protein produced in Δoch1 cells, indicating a severe defect in mannan synthesis. Combination of these mutations with a deletion of MNN1 reduces the apparent molecular weight of the lysozyme-G49N. Mnn1p is known to add 2–3 α-1,3-linked mannoses to the core-type structure (6Nakanishishindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Google Scholar, 18Trimble R.B. Atkinson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9815-9824Google Scholar, 51Alvarado E. Ballou L. Hernandez L.M. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2471-2482Google Scholar), indicating that the loss of a small number of mannoses leads to a detectable increase in gel mobility. The van1-AXD mutation also results in severe defect in mannan synthesis, with the lysozyme-G49N having a mobility similar to that seen in Δvan1 cells. However, the lysozyme-G49N consistently migrated slightly slower than that produced from Δmnn9 or mnn9-AXD cells, both in the absence of MNN1 (Fig. 3 B) and in its presence (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that both Mnn9p and Van1p participate directly in the extension of the mannan backbone by the M-Pol I complex. Moreover, it appears that when Mnn9p is still active, more mannose can be attached than occurs when only Van1p is"

The function of Hsp90 has been shown to be dependent on its ability to hydrolyze ATP, and in vitro studies suggest that the dimeric nature of Hsp90 is critical for this activity. ATP binding occurs at the N-terminal domains of the Hsp90 dimer, whereas the main dimerization site resides in the very C-terminal domain. ATP hydrolysis is performed in a series of conformational changes. These include the association of the two N-terminal domains, which has been shown to stimulate the hydrolysis reaction. In this study, we set out to identify regions in the N-terminal domain that are important for this interaction. We show that N-terminal deletion variants of Hsp90 are severely impaired in their ability to hydrolyze ATP. However, nucleotide binding of these constructs is similar to that of the wild type protein. Heterodimers of the Hsp90 deletion mutants with wild type protein showed that the first 24 amino acids play a crucial role during the ATPase reaction, because their deletion abolishes the trans-activation between the two N-terminal domains. We propose that the turnover rate of Hsp90 is decisively controlled by intermolecular interactions between the N-terminal domains.

It may stabilize an otherwise unfavored conformation of its substrate molecules such as the open binding site for steroid hormone in the case of steroid hormone receptors (3Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1109-1116Google Scholar). For the essential function of Hsp90 in vivo, ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp90 are a prerequisite (4Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavlevitch N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Google Scholar, 5Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies with steroid hormone receptors revealed that ATP is necessary to form a stable complex between Hsp90 and its substrate (6Smith D.F. Schowalter D.B. Kost S.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Google Scholar). The ATPase of Hsp90 is very slow in vitro with values of one ATP hydrolyzed/min for the yeast Hsp90 homologue (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar, 8Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis has been proposed to drive a cycle of conformational changes in Hsp90 that involve the entire Hsp90 dimer, although ATP binding occurs only at the N-terminal domains (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar, 9Scheibel T. Neuhofen S. Weikl T. Mayr C. Reinstein J. Vogel P.D. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18608-18613Google Scholar, 10Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brian R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Google Scholar). The ATP molecules, although bound weakly, are trapped during these conformational changes inside the Hsp90 dimer, and it was shown that these changes require the presence of the middle domain of Hsp90 and at least in part the presence of the C-terminal dimerization domain (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar). During the ATPase cycle, the N-terminal domains of the dimer associate. This seems to be the prerequisite for an efficient hydrolysis reaction. This N-terminal association is weak. Therefore, dimerization of the C-terminal Hsp90 is required to increase the local concentration of the N-terminal domains (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar, 12Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Google Scholar). Experiments with heterodimers consisting of C-terminal Hsp90 fragments and WT protein support the view that the C-terminal dimerization is the requirement for an efficient N-terminal dimerization. The complexity of the ATPase cycle led us to further investigate the mechanism of the N-terminal dimerization. As for Hsp90, no conclusive structural data were available for the N-terminal dimerized conformation. We used the structures of two weakly homologues proteins (GyraseB and MutL) as starting points to design several mutants of Hsp90 that might influence the dimerization. In these proteins, approximately 30 amino acids interact between the N-terminal subunits to form a dimer (13Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Google Scholar, 14Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Google Scholar, 15Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These amino acids correspond to the first 24 amino acids of Hsp90, representing the first β-strand and the following α-helix. Based on the known structure for the N-terminal domain (8Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar, 16Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), we decided to delete 8, 16, or 24 amino acids from the N terminus in Hsp90 and compare the ATPase activities of these proteins with that of the WT Hsp90. The results obtained shed light on the mechanism of stimulation in the ATPase cycle of Hsp90. We found that this region is involved in the intermolecular interactions of the N-terminal domains. In addition, we conclude that these interactions control the turnover of the overall ATPase cycle. Radicicol was purchased from Sigma. Geldanamycin was a kind gift of the Experimental Drug Division (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Deletion mutants of yeast Hsp90 were constructed using the plasmid pET28-Hsp82 containing the full-lengthHsp82 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiaewith an N-terminal His tag as a template. All of the PCR fragments were cloned into the pET28b vector, resulting in the constructs pET28b-Δ8-Hsp82, pET28b-Δ16-Hsp82, and pET28b-Δ24-Hsp82. The other fragments mentioned in the text are as described in Richteret al. (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). Mutagenesis, leading to the E33A mutation and the D79N mutation of full-length Hsp90, was done by overlap extension PCR in N210-Hsp82 using two primers containing the mutation and subsequent insertion of this fragment into the full-length gene in the vector pQE30 using an N-terminal BamHI restriction site and the internal XbaI site. The identity of all of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. His-Hsp90 and its deletion mutants were expressed in the strain BL21 (DE3) cop+ (Stratagene, La Jolla) at 37 °C in LBkanamycinand induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed using a cell disruption system (Constant Systems, Warwick, United Kingdom). Protein purification was done according to the protocol described in Richter et al. (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). Following nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, an anion exchange chromatography (Resource Q, Amersham Biosciences) and a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 HiLoad, Amersham Biosciences) were used. Proteins were stored in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl at concentrations of 1.5–9 mg/ml at −80 °C. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to verify the integrity and purity of the proteins. Far-ultraviolet CD spectroscopy was used to confirm the secondary structure of the fragments. The measurements were performed in 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at protein concentrations of 200 μg/ml in 1-mm cuvettes at 20 °C. CD spectra were collected between 195 and 250 nm in a J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Groβ-Umstadt, Germany). GdmCl transitions were performed with 20 μg/ml protein and GdmCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 5m in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mmKCl. Changes in tertiary structure were detected by fluorescence measurements in a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer (Spex, Edison) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm, whereas the emission spectra were collected from 300 to 400 nm. The midpoint of the GdmCl transition (Cm) was obtained from a plot of the fluorescence signal at 328 nm against the GdmCl concentration. Nucleotide binding to the isolated N-terminal domains was monitored using the change in fluorescence signal. The protein was excited at a wavelength of 295 nm, and the emission was detected at 328 nm using a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer. The temperature was set to 20 °C. Protein concentrations were 20 μg/ml for the three proteins tested. The buffer used was 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2. ADP was added, and the change in fluorescence was recorded. The obtained values were corrected for dilution and inner filter effect. Both were small compared with the signal change at the conditions used. Dissociation constants were derived from the corrected binding curve by non-linear least square fitting with the program SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago). Stopped-Flow measurements were performed with a HiTech SF-61 DX2 instrument in 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2. The excitation slit was set to 0.5 nm, the excitation wavelength was set to 334 nm for direct excitation of (Pγ)MABA-ATP or 296 nm for tryptophan/MABA energy transfer, and emission was detected through a cut-off filter of 418 nm. The temperature was set to 25 °C unless indicated otherwise. The concentrations indicated refer to the concentrations in the mixing chamber. Dissociation rate constants were measured directly by the displacement of a preformed Hsp90·(Pγ)MABA-ATP complex with excess unlabeled ligand. They followed single exponential equations. Association rate constants were derived from a series of experiments where either the concentrations of fluorescent ligand or the enzyme were varied. The individual time traces were analyzed with single exponential equations. Replots of these series of experiments with the observed rate constant (k obs) as a function of ligand concentration followed straight lines, which is consistent with a simple one-step binding mechanisms. The rate constant for dissociation (k off) could be derived from the intercept and checked for consistency with the directly measured rate constant, whereas k on is represented by the slope. A replot of the observed amplitudes of the individual time traces versus concentration directly gives the dissociation constant (K d), which can be compared with the one derived from the kinetic constants (k off/k on). ATPase activities were measured using a regenerating ATPase assay as described by Ali et al. (17Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Google Scholar). The assays were performed in 120-μl cuvettes, and the reduction of NADH concentration was detected by the decrease of adsorbance at 340 nm using a Pharmacia 40/60 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). The temperature was set to 37 °C. Assays were performed in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP. Typical protein concentrations were 2.5 μm for Hsp90 and up to 50 μm for the less active deletion mutants. To determine contaminating ATPase activities that could co-purify with Hsp90, Radicicol, a specific inhibitor of the Hsp90 ATPase, was used at severalfold excess. The remaining ATPase activity in the presence of Radicicol was interpreted to be background and was subtracted from the total activity. For competition experiments, Hsp90 concentrations were 2.5 μm, whereas the concentrations of fragments were varied between 1 and 16 μm. To allow equilibration between homodimers and heterodimers, the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, which was sufficient to reach equilibrium before ATP was added. Again, Radicicol was added later on to ensure that the detected ATPase activity is attributed to ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The data analysis has been performed as described in Richter et al. (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). An analysis of the dimerization properties of the full-length proteins was carried out by size exclusion chromatography. A Superdex 200HR column (AmershamBiosciences) was used on a Jasco HPLC system with fluorescence detection. The buffers used were either 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl or 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP. Different protein concentrations ranging from 30 μm to 10 nm were injected, and the elution time was monitored by fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm to minimize inner filter effects resulting from the ATP, and the emission wavelength was 328 nm. The analysis of the SEC data allowed us to determine the apparent dimerization constants for the different constructs as described in Richter et al.(11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of the N-terminal amino acids for the function of yeast Hsp90 in vitro, we constructed several mutants based on the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1). These mutants lack the first 8 amino acids (Δ8-Hsp90), the first 16 amino aids (Δ16-Hsp90), or the first 24 amino acids (Δ24-Hsp90) of Hsp90. In addition to creating the truncated full-length proteins, we constructed the respectively shortened N-terminal domains (amino acids 1–210) to analyze the influence of the mutations on structure and stability in the isolated domain. CD spectroscopy was used to monitor the secondary and tertiary structure of Δ16-N210, Δ24-N210, and WT N210. CD spectra of the N-terminal domains in the far-ultraviolet range (Fig.2) showed that the three proteins are structured. The spectra are similar for the three proteins, and the evaluation of the minimum at 208 nm shows that their α-helical content does not differ by >10%. These results show that the truncations do not affect the overall structure of the domain, although small structural changes can not be ruled out.Figure 2CD spectroscopy of N-terminal domains. A, to analyze the secondary structure of the truncated N-terminal domains, far-ultraviolet CD spectra were recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures” for N210-Hsp90 (———), Δ16-N210 (- - -), and Δ24-N210 (. . . . . .). For each spectrum, 10 accumulations were recorded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined the stability of the three N-terminal domains against GdmCl-induced unfolding. The transitions for the deletion mutants are nearly identical to that of the wild type N-terminal domain (Fig. 3), leading to the conclusion that the deletion of the helix does not destabilize the N-terminal domain. The midpoints of the transitions or Cm are shown in TableI.Table IStability and nucleotide binding properties of Hsp90 and N-terminal deletion constructsCm of the unfolding transition of the N-terminal domainK p for ADPk onk offK p(k off/k on)mμms−1μm−1s−1μmHsp901.15 ± 0.111 ± 20.13 ± 0.052.0 ± 0.615Δ8-Hsp90n.d.n.d.0.19 ± 0.070.6 ± 0.23.2Δ16-Hsp901.2 ± 0.110 ± 30.24 ± 0.072.1 ± 0.68.8Δ24-Hsp901.25 ± 0.18 ± 20.26 ± 0.072.9 ± 0.611.1 Open table in a new tab Although the truncated helix is not expected to be next to the nucleotide binding site (Fig. 1), we wanted to determine whether the nucleotide binding properties of the mutated proteins were directly affected. For this purpose, we used changes in tryptophan fluorescence upon ADP addition. For all three proteins, a decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed upon the binding of ADP to the protein. The binding curve for N210 is shown in Fig.4 A, and the values obtained for the different deletion constructs are shown in Table I. The dissociation constants of ADP were found to be in the range of 10 μm. Overall, the binding parameters for the three proteins did not differ significantly, indicating that the truncations did not affect equilibria for nucleotide binding significantly. To test whether the mutations change the dynamic properties of nucleotide binding and release, we performed kinetic studies employing rapid mixing techniques and fluorescent labeled ATP analogues as described previously (see “Experimental Procedures” (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar). Dissociation rate constants of (Pγ)MABA-ATP were measured directly by displacing (Pγ)MABA-ATP with an excess of ADP (data not shown). To further evaluate the binding kinetics of the labeled ATP to various constructs, we performed experiments in which we followed the interaction at variable protein or nucleotide concentrations. These experiments were carried out with the full-length proteins as the tryptophan/MABA energy transfer signal observed upon binding of the (Pγ)MABA-ATP was sufficiently strong. The tryptophan/MABA energy transfer signal of a series of experiments with varying protein concentrations (Δ16-Hsp90) is shown in Fig. 4 B. A replot of the observed rate constants versus protein concentration resulted in a straight line. This indicates a simple one-step binding mechanism and allows the extraction of a rate constant for association (k on) and dissociation (k off). These experiments revealed that the on and off rates of all variants were not influenced significantly by the mutations (Table I). The kinetic values for the isolated N-terminal domains did not differ by more than a factor of two from the values obtained for the full-length proteins (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that in general the nucleotide binding properties of Hsp90 do not change significantly if N-terminal amino acids are deleted. One notable exception appears to be Δ8-Hsp90, which binds nucleotide approximately four times tighter because of a reduced k off value. We next analyzed the ATPase activities of the full-length proteins. Δ8-Hsp90 showed an ATPase activity, which was ∼1.5 times higher than that of WT Hsp90 (Fig.5 A). Surprisingly, the other deletion mutants showed severely reduced ATP hydrolysis. Neither for Δ16-Hsp90 nor for Δ24-Hsp90 could ATPase activity be observed. These experiments demonstrate that the deleted regions are important for the ATPase activity of Hsp90, although they are neither involved in ATP binding nor are they part of the active center. This seems to be especially true for amino acids 8–16, as their deletion already results in a greatly reduced ATPase activity. Because dimerization of the N-terminal domains during the ATPase cycle is an important step for efficient hydrolysis, we were interested to determine whether the N-terminal deletions were defective in this respect. It has been observed previously that Hsp90 can form heterodimers (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). Heterodimers consisting of one WT protein and one fragment lacking the N-terminal domain exhibit severely reduced ATPase activities. However, a point mutant unable to bind ATP was shown to be able to form active heterodimers with WT Hsp90 (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). We used this observation to determine whether the deletion constructs were still effective in stimulating the WT protein in a heterodimer. We added increasing concentrations of Δ16-Hsp90 or Δ24-Hsp90 to constant concentrations of WT Hsp90 and determined the ATPase activities. Interestingly, the activity was unchanged or even slightly increased in the case of Δ16-Hsp90, whereas it was reduced in the case of Δ24-Hsp90 (Fig. 5 B). The observed decrease in the case of Δ24-Hsp90 is similar to the effect that has been observed for a fragment lacking the entire N-terminal domain (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar), indicating that the Δ24-Hsp90 mutant is unable to activate the intact N-terminal domain. Therefore, we conclude that regions required for efficient N-terminal dimerization include the first 24 amino acids. In contrast, the deletion of only 16 amino acids does not result in a disruption of the N-terminal dimerization properties, because activation of WT Hsp90 is still possible here. In the case of homodimers, however, neither Δ16-Hsp90 nor Δ24-Hsp90 is active. To explain the function of Δ16-Hsp90 in the heterodimer, two possibilities exist. The inactive domain (Δ16-Hsp90) could become activated in the heterodimer as a result of the contact with WT Hsp90, or the hydrolysis in the wild type domain is stimulated upon contact with Δ16-Hsp90. To discriminate between these possibilities, we formed heterodimers of deletion constructs and specific point mutants of Hsp90. We used the mutants D79N-Hsp90, which does not bind ATP, and E33A-Hsp90, which binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (4Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavlevitch N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Google Scholar, 5Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Google Scholar). For D79N-Hsp90, it had been reported that it is able to sustain the ATPase activity of the WT protein in a heterodimer (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). For E33A-Hsp90, we observed in this study an increase in activity in heterodimers, leading to the suggestion that this mutant is fully active in the stimulation of an ATPase-active partner. However, when we assayed heterodimers consisting of Δ16-Hsp90 and these point mutants, we did not observe any increase in activity (TableII). Thus, we conclude that Δ16-Hsp90 can not be activated in heterodimers with full-length protein, which suggests that ATP hydrolysis observed in heterodimeric complexes with WT protein only occurs in the WT protein.Table IIATPase activity of WT Hsp90 and different heterodimersHsp90Δ8-Hsp90Δ16-Hsp90E33A-Hsp90μm ATP/(min·μm Hsp90)μm ATP/(min·μm Hsp90)μm ATP/(min·μm Hsp90)μm ATP/(min·μm Hsp90)Activity1.051.8<0.01<0.01D79N-Hsp9096%102%<0.01<0.01E33A-Hsp90153%250%<0.01<0.01Δ16-Hsp90105%85%<0.01<0.01Δ24-Hsp9025%62%n.d.n.d.262C-Hsp9037%65%n.d.n.d.530C-Hsp9035%66%n.d.n.d.Values for the active constructs are shown in percent of the activity of the respective homodimer.

Open table in a new tab Values for the active constructs are shown in percent of the activity of the respective homodimer. Values for the inactive constructs are depicted in absolute numbers. n.d. not determined. In summary, the heterodimer assays showed that the activity of the hydrolyzing subunit can be either stimulated (with E33A-Hsp90) or inhibited (with Δ24-Hsp90) by mutant partner domains, suggesting that the interaction between the two domains is of crucial importance for the turnover of ATP by Hsp90. To gain more insight into the origin for the increased activity of Δ8-Hsp90, we tested Δ8-Hsp90 as the active protein in combination with a 3-fold excess of several inactive dimerization partners (Table II). The results of these experiments show consistently that the Δ8-mutant has a higher activity than the WT protein, irrespective of its dimerization partner. For example, in the case of E33A-Hsp90, the activity of Δ8-Hsp90 is increased in the heterodimer by a factor of 2.5. This increase in the case of WT Hsp90 has been only a factor of 1.5. For stimulation-inactive subunits like Δ24-Hsp90, 262C-Hsp90, or 527C-Hsp90, the effect on the Δ8-mutant is much less pronounced than the effect on the WT protein. Using higher concentrations of the inactive subunits, it was observed that the efficiency of heterodimer formation is reduced in the case of Δ8-Hsp90 (Fig. 6). The formation of homodimers of Δ8-Hsp90 may be favored over the formation of heterodimers with fragments indicating that the dimerization of Δ8-Hsp90 is stronger than that of the other fragments and even that of WT protein. To address this directly, we employed SEC-HPLC to compare the dimerization constant of Δ8-Hsp90 and WT Hsp90 in the absence and presence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, both proteins dissociate at low protein concentrations and can be found in a monomer-dimer equilibrium on the SEC column. Their dissociation constants are both in the range of 80–100 nm. In the presence of ATP, the dissociation behavior of WT Hsp90 is not affected (Fig.7 A). However, with ATP, dissociation of Δ8-Hsp90 is no longer observed, even at very low protein concentrations (Fig. 7 B). These data show that in particular in the presence of ATP the dimerization of Δ8-Hsp90 is stronger than that of WT Hsp90. ATP binding and hydrolysis were shown to be essential for thein vivo function of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (4Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavlevitch N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Google Scholar, 5Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that the ATPase cycle includes significant conformational changes that involve the entire Hsp90 molecule (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar). These movements lead to a conformation in which the two N-terminal domains approach each other (10Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brian R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Google Scholar) and the ATP molecule is trapped (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that N-terminal dimerization is important for the stimulation of the hydrolysis reaction, because it was found that heterodimers between N-terminally truncated Hsp90 and WT Hsp90 show reduced ATPase activity (11Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Google Scholar). Here, we attempted to identify the region in the N-terminal domain that is important for the intermolecular activation of Hsp90. We found that the activity of heterodimers was lost when the first 24 amino acids were deleted, indicating that their presence in the protein is required to either form dimers or to trigger the activation mechanism in the WT subunit. When only the first sixteen amino acids were deleted, in contrast, ATPase activity can be observed in heterodimers, indicating that Δ16-Hsp90 can form productive dimers with the WT subunit. The inactivity of heterodimers between Δ16-Hsp90 and E33A-Hsp90 clearly shows that the Δ16-Hsp90 subunit in the heterodimer with WT Hsp90 is only able to stimulate ATP hydrolysis in the WT subunit but does not hydrolyze ATP on its own. Therefore, the first 16 amino acids are obviously required for a domain to become an activable subunit. The deletion of the first eight amino acids leads to an active protein that hydrolyzes ATP with a turnover rate of 1.5 times that of WT Hsp90. This implies that the first eight amino acids are not required for the stimulation reaction. In contrast to amino acids 8–16, the first eight amino acids in the WT protein seem to have a slightly inhibitory effect on the ATPase cycle. For a structural interpretation, it is interesting to correlate our results with the known structures of GyraseB and MutL. Here, the corresponding N-terminal regions are involved in the N-terminal dimerization reaction. In both cases, the first β-strand and the first α-helix are swapped with the other subunit in the dimeric protein upon dimerization of the N-terminal domains (13Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Google Scholar, 14Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Google Scholar, 15Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Based on our data, we would like to extend this model to Hsp90. Assuming strand swapping, the loss in dimerization properties of Δ16-Hsp90 and Δ24-Hsp90 can be explained as more and more of the dimerization site is lost. The observed increase in homodimerization and ATPase activity upon deletion of the first eight amino acids could be also explained by the proposed mechanism of strand swapping. This requires that the interactions are broken in one domain, because the exchanged amino acids normally are a stronger bound part of the N-terminal domain (8Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar,16Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation energy is first to be invested to disrupt these interactions before new ones can be formed with the other subunit. The deletion of amino acids 1–8 could lead to a weaker intramolecularly bound N-terminal peptide, facilitating the exchange process and subsequently the activation. Interestingly, the increase in the overall dimerization properties of Δ8-Hsp90 is dependent on ATP, consistent with the higher affinity of Δ8-Hsp90 for nucleotides and the increased ATPase activity compared with other Hsp90 constructs. Strand swapping also explains how Δ16-Hsp90 can be used to stimulate the WT protein in the heterodimer. It is reasonable to assume that the exchange of the strands, which occurs in the heterodimer only for the WT subunit, is required for the stimulation reaction, implying that the swapped strand is used to stimulate the activity in its domain. In addition, our results give insight into the basis for the extremely slow turnover number for the ATP hydrolysis. The activity of yeast Hsp90 was found to be one ATP hydrolyzed/min, whereas human Hsp90 turns over one ATP every 16 min (18McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 315: 787-798Google Scholar), which prompts the question about the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. Given the strong influence that can be observed once active monomer is bound to different inactive monomers, we propose that the step controlling the turnover must involve both subunits of the dimeric protein. This would be either the N-terminal dimerization reaction itself as the rate-limiting step or a subsequent step that involves an N-terminal dimerized form. Our results show that this step is greatly influenced by interactions within the first 24 amino acids. In previous studies, C-terminal mutations and truncations were found to influence the ATPase activity, which suggests the involvement of C-terminal regions in the ATPase cycle (7Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Google Scholar, 8Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Google Scholar, 19Owen B.A. Sullivan W.P. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7086-7091Google Scholar). This involves the dimerization site in the C-terminal part and regions in the middle domain, which are required for the trapping of the ATP molecule. The analysis of heterodimers between WT and mutant subunits demonstrated the importance of the communication between the two subunits in the dimer and during the ATPase cycle. Thus, we would like to propose that the catalytic efficiency of Hsp90 is tightly regulated by intermolecular interactions mediated by N-terminal amino acids. We thank Sandra Moser, Christiane Hitz, and Martin Prestele for excellent practical assistance and Paul Muschler for sharing the E33A and the D79N mutants of Hsp90. In addition, we thank Petra Herde for help with the stopped-flow experiments, Martin Haslbeck and Helmut Krause for mass spectrometry, and Thomas Scheibel and Stefan Walter for critically reading the paper."
https://openalex.org/W2031732123,"Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes physiological heme degradation consisting of three sequential oxidation steps that use dioxygen molecules and reducing equivalents. We determined the crystal structure of rat HO-1 in complex with heme and azide (HO-heme-N 3−) at 1.9-Å resolution. The azide, whose terminal nitrogen atom is coordinated to the ferric heme iron, is situated nearly parallel to the heme plane, and its other end is directed toward the α-meso position of the heme. Based on resonance Raman spectroscopic analysis of HO-heme bound to dioxygen, this parallel coordination mode suggests that the azide is an analog of dioxygen. The azide is surrounded by residues of the distal F-helix with only the direction to the α-mesocarbon being open. This indicates that regiospecific oxygenation of the heme is primarily caused by the steric constraint between the dioxygen bound to heme and the F-helix. The azide interacts with Asp-140, Arg-136, and Thr-135 through a hydrogen bond network involving five water molecules on the distal side of the heme. This network, also present in HO-heme, may function in dioxygen activation in the first hydroxylation step. From the orientation of azide in HO-heme-N 3−, the dioxygen or hydroperoxide bound to HO-heme, the active oxygen species of the first reaction, is inferred to have a similar orientation suitable for a direct attack on the α-meso carbon.

Heme oxygenase, a microsomal enzyme, catalyzes regiospecific cleavage of the closed tetrapyrrol ring of heme at the α-meso carbon, producing biliverdin IXα, iron, and carbon monoxide. In higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, HO 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; HO-heme, HO in complex with heme; HO-heme-N 3−, HO-heme bound to azide.1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; HO-heme, HO in complex with heme; HO-heme-N 3−, HO-heme bound to azide. functions in the biosynthesis of the open chain tetrapyrrols, phytochrome and phycobiline (1Beale S.I. CIBA Found. Symp. 1994; 180: 156-171Google Scholar). In some pathogenic bacteria, HO is used to acquire iron from the heme derived from the host (2Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Google Scholar). In contrast, in mammals, HO is a key enzyme in physiological heme metabolism (3Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Google Scholar). Three isoforms, HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3, are known in mammals. HO-1 (32 kDa) is highly expressed in the spleen and liver and is inducible by various substances, including heme itself. This isoform has been considered mainly to be in charge of heme catabolism, but recently it has been suggested that HO-1 is involved in the response to oxidative stress (4Prabhakar N.R. Respir. Physiol. 1998; 114: 57-64Google Scholar). In contrast, HO-2 (36 kDa) is expressed constitutively in the brain, testis, and vascular systems. Its principal role is speculated to be the production of carbon monoxide as a neurotransmitter (4Prabhakar N.R. Respir. Physiol. 1998; 114: 57-64Google Scholar, 5Prabhakar N.R. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 161-168Google Scholar), but the role of CO as a signal agent is controversial (6Cary S.P. Marletta M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1071-1073Google Scholar). HO-3 also catalyzes heme degradation, but its function in vivo has yet to be determined (7McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Google Scholar). The HO reaction pathway consists of three sequential oxidation steps utilizing dioxygen molecules and reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (8Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Google Scholar, 9Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 659-664Google Scholar). Heme bound to the enzyme is first hydroxylated at the α-meso carbon, yielding α-hydroxyheme. The second step is conversion of α-hydroxyheme to verdoheme with the concomitant release of the α-mesocarbon as CO (10Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9345-9348Google Scholar). Whether or not the ferric α-hydroxyheme in complex with HO requires an additional electron before reacting with dioxygen to yield verdoheme remains controversial (11Migita C.T. Fujii H. Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Zhou H. Yoshida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 203-213Google Scholar, 12Sakamoto H. Omata Y. Palmer G. Noguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18196-18200Google Scholar, 13Liu Y.

Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Google Scholar). Lastly, the oxygen bridge of verdoheme is cleaved, producing iron and biliverdin. In these reaction steps, heme acts both as substrate and cofactor. Crystal structures of human and rat HO-1-heme complexes and theNeisseria meningitidis HO-heme complex show that all those HOs have similar overall structures, consisting mainly of α-helices (15Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar, 16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

The heme in rat HO-1-heme is sandwiched between the proximal helix (A-helix: Leu-13–Glu-29) and distal kinked helix (F-helix: Leu-129–Met-155). The amino acid sequence in the F-helix is well conserved in all the HOs. Various spectroscopic findings (18Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Google Scholar, 19Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Google Scholar, 20Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K.

Dawson J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7601-7608Google Scholar) suggest that the chemical environment around the heme of HO is similar to that of myoglobin, but the fold of HO is not the globin fold and, unlike myoglobin, there is no distal histidine (15Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar, 16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

In the first hydroxylation step, the dioxygen coordinated to the ferrous heme iron is believed to direct its distal oxygen atom toward the α-meso carbon of the heme, and electrophilic addition of the protonated distal oxygen onto the α-meso carbon proceeds (23Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Google Scholar). This scheme requires stereochemical conditions under which the dioxygen coordinated is parallel to the heme plane and directed toward the α-meso carbon of the heme. Chemical studies using various peroxides as substrates of HO-heme show that the activated oxygen species is not oxo-ferryl (Fe4+ = O), as in the cytochrome P450 reactions, but ferric-hydroperoxide (23Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Google Scholar, 24Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectroscopic analysis has given an angle of nearly 110° for Fe2+···O–O (25Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Google Scholar), but the direction of the O–O bond about the Fe2+···O axis has not been determined. Azide is known to inhibit HO catalysis (26Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Google Scholar). On the addition of azide to HO-heme, low spin shift of the Soret band in the optical spectrum occurs (19Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Google Scholar, 27Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Google Scholar), indicative that azide coordinates to the ferric heme iron. In the case of myoglobin, azide is bound parallel to the heme plane as dioxygen (28Maurus R. Bogumil R. Nguyen N.T. Mauk A.G. Brayer G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 67-74Google Scholar). The binding mode of azide provides a model of dioxygen (hydroperoxide) binding to HO-heme. The direction of the dioxygen bound to HO-heme is essential for understanding the regiospecific oxygenation catalyzed by HO. We therefore determined the crystal structure of HO-heme-N 3−. Truncated rat HO-1 (Met-1–Pro-267) was expressed, and the soluble fraction from the cell lysate was prepared as described previously (29Hidaka T. Omata Y. Noguchi M. Kurume Med. J. 1996; 43: 313-324Google Scholar, 30Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Google Scholar). Purification steps were modified, to some extent, based on methods reported elsewhere (29Hidaka T. Omata Y. Noguchi M. Kurume Med. J. 1996; 43: 313-324Google Scholar, 30Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Google Scholar). All manipulations were done at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Liquid chromatography was done with theÄKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). Anion-exchange chromatography using a HiLoad 26/10 Q Sepharose HP (AmershamBiosciences) column was performed after ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel-filtration chromatography using a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR (Amersham Biosciences) column was performed after hydroxyapatite chromatography. The column used in hydroxyapatite chromatography was changed to a Bio-Scale CHT10-I (Bio-Rad) column. Heme binding to HO was done as described previously (29Hidaka T. Omata Y. Noguchi M. Kurume Med. J. 1996; 43: 313-324Google Scholar, 30Omata Y. Asada S. Sakamoto H. Fukuyama K. Noguchi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1017-1019Google Scholar). HO-heme-N 3− was prepared by adding sodium azide to HO-heme at the final concentration of 5 mm. The crystallization condition of HO-heme-N 3− was screened with Crystal Screen (Hampton Research) by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of each reservoir solution and equilibrated. Crystals of HO-heme-N 3− were obtained at 293 K when the reservoir solution contained 4 m sodium formate. The protein concentration for crystallization was 18 mg·ml−1in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm sodium azide. Hexagonal rod-shaped crystals appeared after 3 days and grew to maximum size in a few weeks. The HO-heme-N 3− crystal soaked for a few seconds in a crystallization solution containing 50 mmsodium azide immediately changed to bright red. The crystal was then handled with a cryo-loop and flash-cooled with a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.000 Å) at the beamline BL40B2 of SPring-8 and an ADSC Quantum4R detector. The distance between the crystal and charge-coupled device was 130 mm. The crystal was oscillated by 1.5° per frame with an exposure time of 120 s and a total measurement angle of 120°. Diffraction data were processed, merged, and scaled with HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of HO-heme-N 3− was determined by the molecular replacement method with CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), in which the protein moiety of the rat HO-1 heme complex (Protein Data Bank code, 1DVE) was the search model. The cross-rotation function gave a unique solution. A subsequent translation search with the above solution located the HO-heme-N 3− molecule in an asymmetric unit. Rigid body, simulated annealing, and temperature factor refinements were applied to the solution based on 20.0–2.5-Å resolution data. The structure was revised by alternately adjusting the model with XtalView (33McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Google Scholar) and simulated annealing and temperature factor refinements for 20.0–2.2-Å resolution data. The heme was clearly seen in the electron density map and was included in the subsequent refinement. A few cycles of water picking and conjugate gradient minimization refinements were done on the 20.0–1.9-Å resolution data. Two azide ions were located in the F o −F c map; one is bound to the ferric heme iron, and the other is bound to Arg-27 located on the molecular surface. Lastly, they were included in the conjugate gradient minimization refinement, in which the geometry of the azide ions was restrained but neither the Fe3+···N–N angle nor Fe3+···N distance was restrained. All refinements were done with CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The stereochemical check of the model was made with PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in Table I. The structure of HO-heme-N 3− was refined by use of the 1.9-Å resolution data to an R factor of 0.189 and free R factor of 0.219. Ser-10 and Glu-223 are additionally disordered as compared with HO-heme. The structure of HO-heme-N 3−consists mainly of α-helices and is very similar to that of HO-heme (Fig. 1), the overall root mean square deviation for Cα atoms being 0.32 Å. Deviation of the heme iron in HO-heme-N 3− and HO-heme is 0.21 Å. Although parts of the FG (Ala-156–Glu-162) and GH (Glu-190–Val-195) loops differ in the conformations between HO-heme-N 3− and HO-heme, the differences should be due to the crystal packing force because these loops are located on the molecular surface and are in contact with other molecules in the crystal. The A-, B-, and F-helices, which form the heme pocket of HO-heme-N 3−, have the same conformations as in HO-heme, and this heme also does not change position on azide binding. The structure of HO-heme-N 3− was analyzed at a higher resolution than that of the structure of rat HO-heme (16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Google Scholar), permitting a more detailed description of the manner of heme binding to HO-1. Close examination of the electron density of the heme indicated that it binds to rat HO-1 in two different orientations, which are related by 180° rotation about the α-γ axis of the heme, which agrees with an NMR report (35Hernández G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Google Scholar). In addition, residual electron density was present near one of the two propionate groups, exposed to the solvent, indicative of double conformers. Double conformers for one propionate group in heme have been reported in N. meningitides HO-heme (17Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Google Scholar). The two orientations of the heme and two conformations of the propionate group would not affect the regiospecificity of HO catalysis because the α-meso carbons in both orientations are at the same position. The present refinement includes only the major orientation of the heme and conformation of the propionate group because it is still difficult at the present resolution to determine the ratios of the two alternative orientations and conformers. An electron density map around the heme pocket of HO-heme-N 3− is given in Fig.2 a. The F o− F c map shows elongated density on the distal side of the heme, assignable to the azide coordinated to the ferric heme iron. The distance between the azide and iron is 2.2 Å. The azide is nearly parallel to the heme plane (Fe3+–N(3)–N(1) angle = 116°) and directed toward the α-meso carbon of the heme. Residues in the heme pocket of HO-heme-N 3− are positioned very similarly to those of HO-heme, in which a hydroxide is bound to the ferric heme iron. The N(3) atom of the azide is in a van der Waals interaction with Gly-139 O (2.7 Å) and is hydrogen-bonded to Gly-143 N (2.8 Å), as in the hydroxide coordinated to the HO-heme iron. In addition, the terminal nitrogen atom, N(1), is in contact with Gly-144 N (3.1 Å). It should be noted that the five water molecules involved in the hydrogen-bonding network at the distal pocket of HO-heme-N 3− are located in almost identical positions as those in HO-heme, the root mean square deviation being less than 0.6 Å. The azide interacts with the carboxyl group of Asp-140 via W1 and W2 and with the carbonyl groups of Thr-135 and Arg-136 via W1 and W3 (Fig. 2 b). The detailed structure of the protein part of HO-heme-N 3− around its heme pocket is identical to that of HO-heme (pH 8.5) despite different crystal packings and crystallization pHs. We reported that there is a structural difference around the heme pocket in rat and human (pH 7.5) HO-heme complexes; in rat HO-heme, Gly-143 N is close to the heme when compared with human HO-heme and is hydrogen-bonded to the distal ligand. We concluded that this structural difference reflects the spin state of the heme iron (16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies of HO-heme-N 3− at pH 7.0 and HO-heme at pH 8.5 show that both of their heme irons are in the low spin state (27Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Google Scholar). 2Rat HO-heme-N 3−gave a typical low spin ESR signal with g values of 2.89, 2.21, and 1.67 at 10 K, which puts it within the H-family (the sixth ligand is an anionic N atom) as categorized by Blumberg and Peisach (41Blumberg W.D. Peisach J. BioInorganic Chemistry: Advances in Chemistry Series. 100. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1971: 271-291Google Scholar). This agrees with the likeness in structural identity of HO-heme and HO-heme-N 3− and is consistent with our previous findings on the structural difference between the rat and human HO-heme complexes. The structure of HO-heme-N 3− shows that azide binds to the ferric heme iron in a bent form. The angle is 116°, consistent with a previous resonance Raman analysis finding for an oxy form of the heme-HO complex, showing a highly bent structure for the coordinated dioxygen of ∼110° (25Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Google Scholar). The direction of the dioxygen has not been determined. The present crystal structure provides the first evidence that a heme ligand is actually directed toward the α-meso carbon of the heme bound to HO. Both the highly bent coordination and the α-meso orientation of the heme ligand are required for the first hydroxylation step of the HO reaction because chemical studies of heme analogs in a complex with HO suggest that the active oxygen species, hydroperoxide, directly attacks the α-meso carbon of heme in the first step (23Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Google Scholar, 24Wilks A. Torpey J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29553-29556Google Scholar). The HO-heme-N 3− structure therefore should provide a suitable model for studying the regiospecifity of the HO reaction. Several interactions between the azide and HO-heme are involved in determining the direction of the azide about the iron ligand axis. The major interactions are van der Waals interactions with Gly-139 and Ser-142 and hydrogen bond interaction with Gly-143 N. Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) modeling of the residues surrounding the azide and heme (Fig. 3) does in fact show that the azide is forced to direct its terminal nitrogen, N(1), toward the α-meso carbon. Another important finding in our study is that the hydrogen-bonding network at the distal pocket in the HO-heme is highly conserved even in the azide binding state. Similar hydrophilic interactions occur at distal pockets in heme complexes with human HO-1 (15Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Google Scholar) andN. meningitidis HO (17Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stojiljkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Google Scholar), in which water or a hydroxy ligand exists. The hydrogen-bonding network reported here should help stabilize accommodation of the azide ligand, a hydrogen bond acceptor, located 2.7 Å from W1 (Fig. 2). The explanation of hydrogen-bonding interactions is shown schematically in Fig.4. The carboxylate anion of Asp-140 forms a salt bridge to the side chain of Arg-136 and interacts with the hydroxy group of Tyr-58, making W1 anionic through a hydrogen-bonding relay intermediated by W2. In addition, the hydrogen-donating ability of W1 is enhanced by the carbonyl groups of Thr-135 and Arg-136 via W3. W1 therefore is a potent hydrogen donor to the coordinated azide, and the terminal nitrogen atom, N(1), becomes positively charged. Moreover, the positive charge on N(1) is increased by the negative charge of the iron-bound nitrogen atom, N(3), which is hydrogen-bonded to the amide group of Gly-143. Taking this molecular polarization into account, an asymmetric resonance structure is dominant for the azide bound to HO-heme, as proposed previously for the myoglobin complex with azide (28Maurus R. Bogumil R. Nguyen N.T. Mauk A.G. Brayer G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 67-74Google Scholar). Tyr-58, Arg-136, and Asp-140 are all conserved in mammalian HO-1 and HO-2 and in Corynebacterium diphtheriae HO, indicative of their importance in the hydrogen-bonding network. Conceivably, the hydrogen-bonding network facilitates formation of ferric hydroperoxide by providing a proton to the peroxide produced by reduction of the dioxygen bound to the ferrous heme iron in the first HO reaction step. Like the azide, hydroperoxide is probably directed toward the α-meso carbon in a way that minimizes van der Waals repulsion with the distal residues. Although peroxide is shorter than azide, hydrogen-bonding between the peroxide and W1 should occur by minimal rearrangement of the bridging water molecules. Indeed, the distance between W1 and the hydroxy ligand in the HO-heme is 4.0 Å (16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Google Scholar), and the O–O distance of hydrogen peroxide is estimated as 1.46 Å. Accordingly, the distal oxygen of hydroperoxide acquires a positive charge through the hydrogen-bonding network as well as through the amide group of Gly-143, resulting in stabilization of the negatively charged proximal oxygen. Increased electrophilicity of the distal oxygen should be favorable for oxygenation of the α-mesocarbon of the heme (16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Google Scholar). Recent findings of site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the polar residues around the distal pocket of HO-heme show that the D140A mutant completely lost heme degradation activity (37Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10612-10619Google Scholar, 38Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Google Scholar) and that in the R136A mutant, heme degradation was much slower than in the wild type HO (38Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Google Scholar). An electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron nuclear double-resonance (ENDOR) study by Davydov et al. (39Davydov R.M. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Google Scholar) showed that one-electron radiolytic cryoreduction of the oxy-ferrous form of the heme-HO complex at 77 K yields a hydroperoxoferri-HO species, evidence of prompt proton transfer from the distal hydrogen-bonding network to reduced dioxygen. More recently, they reported that the annealing of this species to 200 K resulted in the formation of an active hydroperoxo intermediate with a second well defined 1H ENDOR signal (40Davydov R. Kofman V. Fujii H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1798-1808Google Scholar). This intermediate directly formed an α-hydroxyheme product. They speculated that the second proton might have been part of a hydrogen bond that functions in the activation of the O–O bond for cleavage. It is noteworthy that the second proton detected in the ENDOR spectroscopy may be the amide proton of Gly-143, and it is expected to interact with the proximal oxygen of the hydroperoxide based on the hydroxide-bound HO-heme (16Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Google Scholar) and current HO-heme-N 3− structures. Based on these findings, a possible mechanism of protonation and activation of the peroxide bound to heme is proposed (Fig.5). We thank Drs. Keiko Miura, Hisanobu Sakai, and Masahide Kawamoto of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) for valuable help with data collection using the synchrotron radiation of BL40B2, SPring-8 and Dr. Yoshimitsu Kakuta, Kyushu University, for advice on the biochemical and crystallographic work.

The human papilloma viruses are causally linked to more than 90% of the cases of cervical cancer (1zur Hausen H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 690-698Google Scholar, 2zur Hausen H. Eur. J.

These oncogenes are invariably expressed in HPV-associated carcinomas and cell lines derived from these cancers (3Schwarz E. Freese U.K. Gissmann L. Mayer W. Roggenbuck B. Stremlau A. zur Hausen H. Nature. 1985; 314: 111-114Google Scholar, 4Baker C.C. Phelps W.C. Lindgren V. Braun M.J. Gonda M.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 962-971Google Scholar). Intact E6 and E7 open reading frames are required for in vitroimmortalization of human epithelial cells by the HPV genome, and E6 and/or E7 genes are sufficient to immortalize these cells (5Band V. De Caprio J.A. Delmolino L. Kulesa V. Sager R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6671-6676Google Scholar, 6Hawley-Nelson P. Vousden K.H. Hubbert N.L. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3687-3691Google Scholar). A crucial aspect of the oncogenic mechanism of E6 and E7 involves their ability to inactivate two key cell cycle checkpoint proteins, p53 and retinoblastoma protein, respectively (9Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Google Scholar, 10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Google Scholar). While E6-induced loss of p53 strongly correlates with E6-induced cellular transformation, recent studies have identified additional cellular targets of E6 that are likely to play important roles in HPV oncogenesis (11Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Google Scholar, 12Ratsch S.B. Gao Q. Srinivasan S. Wazer D.E. Band V. Radiat. Res. 2001; 155: 143-150Google Scholar). Defining the roles of these novel E6 targets is of substantial importance to fully understand the mechanisms of HPV-mediated oncogenesis. Using the yeast two-hybrid interaction system, we recently identified hADA3 as a novel E6-binding protein (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). hADA3 is the human homologue of yeast transcriptional co-activator yADA3 (alteration/deficiency in activation 3). We have demonstrated that hADA3 binds to the high-risk (cancer-associated) but not to the low-risk HPV E6 proteins, and to immortalization-competent but not to immortalization-defective HPV16 E6 mutants, implying a role for E6-induced hADA3 inactivation in oncogenic transformation. Genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated that ADA3 functions as a critical component of coactivator complexes that link transcriptional activators, bound to specific promoters, to histone acetylation, and basal transcriptional machinery (14Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1203-1209Google Scholar, 15Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Google Scholar, 16Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Google Scholar). The core components of this complex include the adapter proteins ADA3 and ADA2 and a histone acetylase GCN5 (general control non-repressed 5) (17Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Google Scholar). Importantly, hADA3 exists as a component of a yeast ADA-like complex that includes hADA2 and hGCN5, indicating that the functional roles of ADA complex are evolutionarily conserved (18Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Google Scholar). Studies of mammalian retinoic X receptor (RXR) and growth hormone receptor when expressed in yeast have shown a requirement for the components of yeast ADA complex including the yADA3 gene product (19vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Google Scholar, 20Henriksson A. Almlof T. Ford J. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3065-3073Google Scholar). However, a functional role of hADA3 in nuclear hormone receptor transactivation in mammalian cells has not yet been defined. Given the important role of the inactivation of p53 transactivation in E6-induced oncogenesis, our earlier studies focused on the novel role of hADA3 as a p53 coactivator (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). Another group has also reported a coactivator function of hADA3 for p53 (21Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Google Scholar). Our studies also established that the interaction of hADA3 with E6 led to its ubiquitin-mediated degradation (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). In view of the strong yeast genetic data for a potential role of hADA3 as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors, our isolation of hADA3 as an E6-binding protein raised the possibility that E6 may inactivate the mammalian nuclear hormone receptor function by targeting hADA3. In this study, we examined if hADA3 associates with and functions as a coactivator for human retinoic X receptors RXRα and retinoic acid receptor α (RARα)-mediated transactivation, and whether E6 abrogates this function of ADA3. We report here that hADA3 directly binds to RXRα but not to RARα, allowing its in vitro and in vivo association with RXR homodimers as well as RXR-RAR heterodimers. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we demonstrate that hADA3 is a component of the RXRα-activator complexes bound to native promoter of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Furthermore, hADA3 enhances the RXRα-mediated transactivation of target genes, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRBPII) and p21. Most significantly, we show that HPV16 E6 inhibits RXRα-dependent transactivation. Our results identify RXRα as a novel HPV E6 oncoprotein target and implicate the deregulation of retinoid receptor function in HPV oncogenesis. Generation of the expression constructs of full-length hADA3 and FLAG-hADA3 in the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) has been described previously (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). The pGEX-4T-1-hADA3 construct encoding the GST-hADA3 fusion protein and pCR3.1-encoding the HPV16 E6, have also been described (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). The retinoid responsive luciferase reporter constructs CRBPII-RARE-Luc and p21-RARE-Luc were generated by cloning the retinoic acid response element (RARE) from theCRBPII promoter (GCTGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTTCA) or two copies of the RARE from the p21 promoter (GGCAAAGGTGAAGTCCAGGGGAGGTCA) in pLuc vector (Stratgene). The pEF-16E6-MYC construct, encoding the Myc-tagged HPV16 E6, was kindly provided by Dr. M. Ishibashi (Aichi Cancer Center, Japan). The pSG5-RXR, and pSG5-RAR expression constructs encoding the human RXRα and RARα, respectively, were obtained from Dr. P. Chambon (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire). The pCR3.1-RXR(LBD), encoding the ligand-binding domain of the human RXRα, was generated by PCR-based cloning. Saos2, a p53-negative osteosarcoma cell line (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Google Scholar) was grown in α-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). 76R-30, a p53-negative radiation-transformed human mammary epithelial cell line, was grown in DFCI-1 medium, as described previously (23Wazer D.E. Chu Q. Liu X.L. Gao Q. Safaii H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2468-2478Google Scholar). The pSG5-RXR and pSG5-RAR expression constructs were used as templates in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based (TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system; Promega, WI) or an Escherichia coli S-30 extract-based (PROTEIN-scriptTM-PRO: Ambion, TX) coupled in vitro transcription-translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine to generate35S-labeled human RXR and RAR proteins. A GST fusion protein of hADA3 was purified using the glutathione-Sepharose affinity beads from lysates of E. coli transformed with pGEX-4T-1-hADA3. Aliquots of 35S-labeled proteins were incubated at 4 °C with 1 μg of GST or GST-hADA3 noncovalently bound to glutathione beads in 300 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P40) for 2 h, in the absence or presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). The beads were washed with lysis buffer and bound proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and visualized by fluorography. 5 × 105 Saos2 cells were plated in phenol red-free α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the cells were transfected with the pCR3.1-hADA3 plasmid with or without pSG5 constructs encoding the human RXRα or RARα, using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, cells were either mock-treated or treated with 100 nm 9-cis-RA. Following a 24-h treatment, cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 2-mg aliquots of lysate protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RXR or anti-RARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) for detection of associated hADA3. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Subconfluent 76R-30 cells grown in DFCI-1 medium were treated with different concentration of 9-cis-RA for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The32P-labeled p21 and 36B4 cDNA probes were used for Northern blotting using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar). Subconfluent 76R-30 cells grown in DFCI-1 medium were treated with 100 nm 9-cis-RA for 24 h, and native protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by treatment with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The ChIP assay was carried out as reported earlier (25Christova R. Oelgeschlager T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Google Scholar). Briefly, equal aliquots of isolated chromatin were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-hADA3 antibody (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar), or polyclonal antibodies against human RXR or RARα. The DNA associated with specific immunoprecipitates or with negative control preimmune serum was isolated and used as a template for the PCR to amplify the p21 promoter sequences containing the retinoid response element. The primers used were: 5′-primer, 5′-GAGGTCAGCTGCGTTAGAGG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GCTCCCATCTACCTCACACC-3′. As a specificity control, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was amplified from the same templates using the following primers: 5′-primer, AAAAGCGGGGAGAAAGTAGG; 3′-primer, CTAGCCTCCCGGGTTTCTCT. 5 × 105 Saos2 or 76R-30 cells were plated per 100-mm dish in phenol red-free α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (Saos2 cells) or in DFCI-1 medium (76R-30 cells) for 48 h and transfected with the expression plasmids, as indicated in the figure legends. Each dish also received 20 ng of SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter (pRL-SV40) to correct for differences in transfection. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding the vector DNA. After 24 h, the transfected cells were either mock-treated or treated with 100 nm 9-cis-RA for an additional 24 h. The luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase kit (Promega, WI). Equal aliquots of cell lysates (normalized based on Renillaluciferase activity) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-RXR, anti-RARα, or anti-ADA3 antibodies to assess protein expression. There is an emerging consensus that cellular transformation by viral oncoproteins disrupts multiple cellular pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and other critical cellular traits. Identification and characterization of cellular targets of human cancer-associated viral oncoproteins is therefore of great interest in cancer research as well as in basic cell biology. We previously identified human ADA3, homologue of the yeast ADA3 transcriptional coactivator, as a novel HPV E6 target (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar). Genetic analyses have shown a requirement for yeast ADA3 for transcriptional activation by human RXR and other nuclear hormone receptors when these were expressed in yeast (19vom Baur E. Harbers M. Um S.J. Benecke A. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1278-1289Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine if hADA3 functions as a coactivator for retinoid receptors in human cells and whether E6 interaction with hADA3 would allow it to perturb the retinoid receptor function. As a first step, we examined if hADA3 indeed interacts with and coactivates the retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation in mammalian cells. The ligand binding domain (residues 266–455) of RXRα, which is known to mediate binding to coactivators (26Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Google Scholar), was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates orE. coli lysates, and its binding to GST-ADA3 was assessed in the absence or presence of the RXRα ligand 9-cis-RA. Whereas RXRα failed to bind to GST, as expected, a substantial level of binding to GST-hADA3 was observed. When RXRα was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, substantial binding to GST-hADA3 was seen in the absence of retinoic acid; however, this binding was further enhanced by adding the ligand (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3 and 4, upper panel). Notably, the E. coli lysate-translated RXRα protein bound to GST-ADA3 only in the presence of the ligand (Fig. 1 A,upper panel, compare lanes 3 and 4with lanes 7 and 8). It remains possible that these differences are due to the presence of retinoids or some modification of the RXRα receptors in the rabbit reticulocyte lysates. These experiments established that hADA3 can directly interact with the RXRα protein in a ligand-dependent manner. Next, we examined if hADA3 can also interact with the RARα protein as such or in the presence of RXRα. As RXRα and RARα proteins are of a similar size to be able to unambiguously visualize RARα and RXRα proteins in the same gel, we used the ligand-binding domain of RXRα in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 B, RARα did not show a detectable level of direct interaction with hADA3 (Fig.1 B, lane 4, upper panel). However, when the ligand-binding domain of RXRα was included in the binding reaction, both RARα and RXRα could be pulled down with GST-hADA3 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5, upper panel). Similar binding was observed when full-length RXRα was used (data not shown). Coomassie Blue staining of gels confirmed the presence of respective GST fusion proteins in the binding reactions (Fig. 1,A and B, lower panels). These results indicate that while RARα does not directly interact with hADA3, it can do so when present as a RXR/RAR heterodimer. In view of the in vitro binding, we used co-immunoprecipitation analyses of transfected proteins to assess whether hADA3 interacts with RXRα and RARα in Saos2 cells. Anti-RXR immunoprecipitates from transfected cell lysates were subjected to anti-FLAG immunoblotting to detect co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged hADA3. No hADA3 was detected in anti-RXR immunoprecipitates if cells had been transfected only with hADA3 or RXRα constructs or when hADA3 plus RXRα-transfected cells had not been treated with 9-cis-RA (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3,right panel). In contrast, hADA3 was readily detectable in anti-RXR immunoprecipitates from hADA3 plus RXRα-transfected cells treated with 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2 A, right panel,lane 6). Anti-RXR immunoblotting of anti-RXR immunoprecipitates demonstrated the immunoprecipitation of RXR in the appropriate lanes (Fig. 2 A, right lower panel), and anti-FLAG and anti-RXR blotting of whole cell lysates confirmed the expected expression of hADA3 and RXR (Fig. 2 A, left panels). Given the indirect, RXRα-mediated binding of RARα to hADA3 in vitro, we also examined if RARα can associate with hADA3 in the presence of RXRα, the strategy used similar to that used for RXRα, except that immunoprecipitates were carried out using an anti-RARα antibody. A substantial association between RARα and hADA3 was observed if RXR was co-expressed, and cells were treated with 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2 B, lane 8, right upper panel). Immunoblotting of anti-RARα immunoprecipitates (right lower panel) showed the RARα protein in the appropriate lanes, and the expected expression of hADA3 or RARα was confirmed by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (left panels). The above results were confirmed in 293T cells (data not shown). Taken together, our results demonstrate a direct interaction of hADA3 with RXRα, which allows it to associate with RXRα homodimers as well as RXR/RAR heterodimers. A crucial aspect of coactivator function involves their ability to assemble into complexes with transcriptional activators bound to specific promoters (27Emerson B.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 267-270Google Scholar). To directly assess if hADA3 is assembled into transcriptional activator complexes bound to a native retinoid response element, we used the ChIP analysis of the retinoid-responsive p21 promoter. As p21 is p53-responsive (28Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Google Scholar) and hADA3 can function as a p53 coactivator (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar, 21Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Google Scholar), we utilized 76R-30 cells, which lack p53 and fail to show a DNA damage-induced increase in the transcription of p21, unlike their normal parental cells (23Wazer D.E. Chu Q. Liu X.L. Gao Q. Safaii H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2468-2478Google Scholar). Initial experiments established that 9-cis-RA treatment of these cells led to an increase in p21 mRNA when cells were grown in regular DFCI-1 medium, without a need for retinoid deprivation (data not shown). A detectable level of p21 mRNA is seen in 76R-30 cells in the absence of stimulation (Fig.3 A, lane 1); however, 9-cis-RA treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in p21 mRNA (lanes 2–4), consistent with the presence of endogenous RXRα and RARα mRNA and protein in these cells (data not shown). For ChIP analysis, 76R-30 cells were either mock-treated or treated with 100 nm 9-cis-RA for 24 h and then fixed with formaldehyde to cross-link the native chromatin-associated protein complexes with the DNA. The chromatin immunoprecipitation were carried out with preimmune (negative control) or anti-ADA3 antibodies (and anti-RARα and RXR antibodies as positive controls), and the co-immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template for the PCR to amplify the p21 promoter sequences that incorporate RARE (28Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 B, a clear PCR amplification product was observed in chromatin immunoprecipitation carried out with anti-ADA3 antibodies but not the preimmune serum (compare lane 7 with lane 9); the intensity of this band was significantly higher in the chromatin immunoprecipitation of 9-cis-RA-treated cells (lane 8), indicating that ADA3 was in association with the native p21 promoter and that this association was enhanced in the presence of the RXRα ligand. As expected, PCR products were amplified in chromatin immunoprecipitation carried out with anti-RXR and anti-RARα antibodies; however, no further increase was seen upon ligand treatment of cells (lanes 3–6). These results are consistent with a ligand-independent binding of RXR and RXR/RAR to the p21 promoter, as observed with other retinoid responsive promoters by gel retardation assay (29Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 73-85Google Scholar). Amplification of promoter sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is not a target of retinoids demonstrated the specificity of our results. Overall, these results demonstrate that hADA3 becomes part of the activator complexes bound to a retinoid response element in its native chromatin configuration upon RXRα ligand stimulation. Given the ability of hADA3 to interact with RXRα and with RXRα/RARα heterodimers and the previously defined role of ADA3 as a component of the ADA coactivator complex (17Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Google Scholar), we examined if hADA3 functions as a coactivator of transcription mediated by the RXRα homodimer or the RXRα/RARα heterodimer. To assess the coactivator function of hADA3 for RXRα, we transiently transfected Saos2 cells with a luciferase reporter linked to the retinoid response element derived from theCRBPII promoter; CRBPII is known to be transactivated by RXRα but not by RARα (30Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Google Scholar). Little CRBPII-luciferase activity was detected in mock-treated cells (Fig.4 A, lane 1). In contrast, 9-cis-RA treatment of cells transfected with RXRα resulted in about a 100-fold induction of the luciferase activity (lane 2). Importantly, co-transfection of hADA3 with RXRα led to a substantial, hADA3 dose-dependent increase in ligand-induced luciferase reporter activity (lanes 4,6, and 8). The reporter activity was not induced if hADA3 was transfected without RXRα (data not shown). Western blot of cell lysates showed the expected expression of hADA3 and RXR proteins (Fig. 4 B). These results provided evidence that hADA3 can function as a coactivator for RXRα-mediated transcription in mammalian cells. Next, we examined the transactivation of a retinoid-responsive promoter that could be transactivated by RXRα/RARα heterodimers. For this purpose, we employed a luciferase reporter incorporating two copies of the retinoid response element from the p21 promoter (28Liu M. Iavarone A. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31723-31728Google Scholar). When the p21-luciferase reporter was transfected in Saos2 (Fig. 4, Cand D) or 76R-30 (Fig. 4, E and F) cells together with RXRα and RARα, a substantial ligand-inducible increase (about 30-fold in Saos2 cells (Fig. 4 C, comparelane 1 with lane 2) and 100-fold in 76R-30 cells (Fig. 4 E, compare lane 1 with lane 2) in luciferase activity was observed. Importantly, cotransfection of ADA3 together with RXRα and RARα resulted in a dramatic, ADA3 dose-dependent, increase in 9-cis-RA-induced luciferase activity in both Saos2 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4,6, and 8) and 76R-30 cells (Fig. 4 E,lanes 4, 6, and 8). Immunoblotting of cell lysates showed the expected expression of transfected proteins (Fig. 4, D and F). Interestingly, although the levels of ADA3 in 76R-30 cells were much lower than Saos2 cells (probably due to lower transfection efficiency of 76R-30 cells as compared with Saos2), the coactivator function of ADA3 is comparable in both cells (Fig. 4, compare C and D withE and F). Although the reason for this difference is currently unknown, it could reflect differences of cellular origin (epithelial versus fibroblasts). Taken together, these results demonstrated that hADA3 can function as a coactivator for RXRα as well as the RXRα/RARα heterodimer in mammalian cells. Given the ability of HPV16 E6 to interact with and induce the degradation of hADA3 (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar), we examined the effect of co-expressing E6 on hADA3-induced increase in RXRα-mediated transactivation of CRBPII-RARE-Luc reporter. For this purpose, Saos2 cells were transfected with RXRα and hADA3 together with either wild-type E6 or a hADA3-non-binding E6 mutant Δ9–13. While hADA3 expectedly enhanced the 9-cis-RA-induced, CRBPII luciferase reporter activity in RXRα-transfected cells (Fig.5 A, compare lane 2with lane 4), neither E6 nor its mutant by itself had any effect on the RXRα-dependent reporter activity (Fig.5 A, lanes 11–16). Significantly, co-transfection of wild-type E6 dose-dependently inhibited the hADA3-induced increase in RXRα-mediated CRBPII luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6 and 8); in contrast, the hADA3 non-binding Δ9–13 E6 mutant had no effect (Fig.5 A, lane 10). As anticipated (Kumar et al., Ref. 13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar), the expression of wild-type E6 but not its ADA3 non-binding mutant was accompanied by a reduction in hADA3 levels (Fig.5 B, compare lanes 2–5). Immunoblotting of cell lysates confirmed the expected expression of hADA3 and RXR proteins (Fig. 5 B, lower panel, shown only for 9-cis-RA-treated cell lysates). To further confirm the ability of E6 to inhibit the coactivator function of ADA3 for retinoid receptor-mediated transactivation, we utilized the p21 promoter-luciferase reporter; the cells were co-transfected with RXRα and RARα. As with CRBPII reporter, the p21 luciferase reporter activity was dose-dependently inhibited by the expression of wild-type E6 but not its Δ9–13 mutant (Fig.5 C, lanes 6, 8, and 10). Immunoblotting of cell lysates confirmed the expression of hADA3, RXR, and RARα (Fig. 5 D). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that HPV16 E6 abrogates the coactivator function of hADA3 toward retinoid receptors RXRα and RXRα/RARα in human cells. The results presented here have significant implications for the potential role of ADA3-containing coactivator complexes in physiological pathways and in oncogenesis. While yeast ADA3 as a component of ADA and other coactivator complexes has been clearly demonstrated to be important, little was known about hADA3 function in mammalian systems except for its ability to function as a p53 coactivator, which others and we have recently uncovered (13Kumar A. Zhao Y. Meng G. Zeng M. Srinivasan S. Delmolino L.M. Gao Q. Dimri G. Weber G.F. Wazer D.E. Band H. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5801-5812Google Scholar, 21Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Google Scholar). Our results that hADA3 functions as a coactivator for retinoid receptors in mammalian cells, together with the ability of yeast ADA3 to function as a coactivator of multiple mammalian nuclear hormone receptors when these were expressed in yeast, strongly suggest that ADA3-containing complexes may participate as coactivators for multiple nuclear hormone receptors. While a recent study failed to detect mouse ADA3 association with estrogen receptor (31Benecke A. Gaudon C. Garnier J.M. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2508-2514Google Scholar), yeast ADA3 has been shown to coactivate estrogen receptor (ER) function, and we have detected a direct interaction between hADA3 and ER. 2G. Meng, M. Zeng, Y. Zhao, D. Wazer, H. Band, and V. Band, unpublished data. The presence of hGCN5 as well as a hGCN5-related gene product P/CAF in hADA3-containing complexes (18Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Google Scholar), direct interaction of P/CAF with p300/CBP (32Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Google Scholar), and the interaction of hADA3 itself with p300 (21Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Deiry W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Google Scholar) suggest that hADA3 may form multiple, distinct coactivator complexes, as also is the case in yeast (17Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that additional transcriptional activators will emerge as targets of ADA3 coactivator function. Our findings that HPV16 E6 abrogates the coactivator function of hADA3 have obvious implications for the potential role of the hADA3-mediated biochemical pathways in oncogenesis. The role of presently known ADA3 targets (p53 and retinoid receptors) in cell growth and differentiation is well established, and these pathways are frequently affected during oncogenesis. Thus, if E6 indeed targets the various hADA3-containing complexes and influences transcriptional pathways in which these complexes play a role, this could represent a significant mechanism for the role of E6 in HPV-mediated oncogenesis. Our findings support the emerging concept that viral oncoproteins, such as HPV E6, have attained an ability to perturb the function of multiple transcriptional coactivators apparently by multiple mechanisms. Notably, E6 oncoprotein has been demonstrated to associates with p300, which serves as a coactivator for a number of transactivators, including nuclear hormone receptors (33Zimmermann H. Degenkolbe R. Bernard H.U. O'Connor M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6209-6219Google Scholar, 34Patel D. Huang S.M. Baglia L.A. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Google Scholar). While the effect of HPV E6 binding to p300 on nuclear receptor-mediated transcription has not been examined, E6 is known to abrogate the coactivator function for p300 toward p53 (33Zimmermann H. Degenkolbe R. Bernard H.U. O'Connor M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6209-6219Google Scholar, 34Patel D. Huang S.M. Baglia L.A. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Google Scholar). Recently, another E6-binding protein AMF1 (also called G-protein pathway suppressor 2 or GPS2), was shown to be a coactivator for p53 (35Degenhardt Y.Y. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 151-160Google Scholar, 36Peng Y.C. Kuo F. Breiding D.E. Wang Y.F. Mansur C.P. Androphy E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5913-5924Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the idea that E6 has attained an ability to perturb multiple coactivators. How might the E6 perturbation of coactivator function promote oncogenic transformation ? We envision that E6 interaction with hADA3 would disrupt the hADA3-containing HAT complexes, prevent the recruitment of HAT activity to promoter elements, and inhibit the expression of genes that mediate tumor suppressor functions. The role of histone acetylation as a tumor suppressor mechanism is supported by the propensity of CBP ± heterozygous mice to develop hematopoietic malignancies (37Kung A.L. Rebel V.I. Bronson R.T. Ch'ng L.E. Sieff C.A. Livingston D.M. Yao T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 272-277Google Scholar), and the ability of RARα fusion oncogenes, which recruits histone deacetylases to RAREs (38Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Google Scholar), to induce promyelocytic leukemia by inhibiting cell differentiation. Indeed, histone deacetylase inhibitors together with retinoid are now being assessed for treatment of such patients (38Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Google Scholar, 39Minucci S. Nervi C. Lo Coco F. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3110-3115Google Scholar, 40He L.Z. Tolentino T. Grayson P. Zhong S. Warrell Jr., R.P. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Pandolfi P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1321-1330Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that ADA3, as a component of HAT-containing coactivator complexes, plays a role in transcription of genes. A large body of evidence supports an important role of retinoids in cell differentiation and cell growth inhibition (41Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar, 42Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1987s-1990sGoogle Scholar, 43Smith M.A. Parkinson D.R. Cheson B.D. Friedman M.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 10: 839-864Google Scholar, 44Zhang D. Holmes W.F. Wu S. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 1-20Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence that retinoids down-regulate the telomerase in a pathway distinct from cell differentiation, implicating the role of retinoids in replicative senescence (45Yamada O. Takanashi M. Ujihara M. Mizoguchi H. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 711-717Google Scholar, 46Pendino F. Flexor M. Delhommeau F. Buet D. Lanotte M. Segal-Bendirdjian E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6662-6667Google Scholar). Complementaryin vivo studies have demonstrated the ability of retinoids to inhibit tumor formation in carcinogenesis models, typically at the step of tumor promotion (47Hill D.L. Grubbs C.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 161-181Google Scholar, 48O'Dwyer P.J. Ravikumar T.S. McCabe D.P. Steele Jr., G. J. Surg. Res. 1987; 43: 550-557Google Scholar). Importantly, these studies have led to clinical trials of retinoids in chemoprevention of a number of epithelial and non-epithelial cancers (49Kurie J.M. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 497-502Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown hADA3 directly interacts with RXRα and functions as a coactivator for RXRα and RARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation. In addition, we show that HPV16 E6 by targeting hADA3 for degradation, abrogate the RXRα-mediated transactivation, implicating disruption of retinoid receptor function in E6 oncogenesis. Given the evolutionary conservation of hADA3, it is likely that viral oncoprotein-mediated inactivation of its function plays an important role in oncogenesis. We thank Drs. P. Chambon for RXR and RAR expression constructs and M. Ishibashi for the Myc-tagged E6 construct. We also thank Dr. Y. Zhao for technical help in certain experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1969250063,"The stromal processing peptidase (SPP) cleaves a large diversity of chloroplast precursor proteins, removing an N-terminal transit peptide. We predicted previously that this key step of the import pathway is mediated by features of the transit peptide that determine precursor binding and cleavage followed by transit peptide conversion to a degradable substrate. Here we performed competition experiments using synthesized oligopeptides of the transit peptide of ferredoxin precursor to investigate the mechanism of these processes. We found that binding and processing of ferredoxin precursor depend on specific interactions of SPP with the region consisting of the C-terminal 12 residues of the transit peptide. Analysis of four other precursors suggests that processing depends on the same region, although their transit peptides are highly divergent in primary sequence and length. Upon processing, SPP terminates its interaction with the transit peptide by a second cleavage, converting it to a subfragment form. From the competition experiments we deduce that SPP releases a subfragment consisting of the transit peptide without its original C terminus. Interestingly, examination of the ATP-dependent metallopeptidase activity responsible for degradation of transit peptide subfragments suggests that it may recognize other unrelated peptides and, hence, act separately from SPP as a novel stromal oligopeptidase.

Chloroplasts are structurally and functionally complex organelles found in green plants and algae. They not only carry out photosynthesis but also perform other essential metabolic reactions required for plant growth and development. The vast majority of chloroplast proteins, however, is encoded by the nuclear genome. These proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursors containing an N-terminal chloroplast targeting signal, the transit peptide, that mediates post-translational import into the chloroplast. It is predicted from the genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana that up to 14% of nuclear genes encode precursor proteins with a transit peptide (1The Arabidopsis Genome, I. Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7091) Google Scholar,2Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar). Thus, ∼3500 different precursor proteins may be targeted to the chloroplast. The import pathway for these precursors depends on direct interactions between the transit peptide and import receptors of the outer envelope, translocation across the two envelope membranes, and removal of the transit peptide in the stromal compartment of the organelle (3Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 4Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Chen K. Chen X.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cleavage of transit peptides during import is likely to be essential for chloroplast biogenesis and function. Given the central role of the chloroplast in plant development and the enormous amount of protein that must be imported, proteolytic processing of precursor proteins is one of the most important post-translational modifications that occur in a plant cell. Moreover, it was shown for the precursors of some highly abundant chloroplast proteins, e.g.ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit, ferredoxin, and plastocyanin, that the processing step is a prerequisite to adopt their active conformation (7Archer E.K. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Li H.M. Theg S.M. Bauerle C.M. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Statistical analysis of the properties of transit peptides reveals that they form a highly divergent group of targeting sequences. They vary in length from 31 to 142 amino acids, lack consensus sequences, and are devoid of secondary structure motifs, making it difficult to predict the features that determine cleavage (for a review see Ref. 10Bruce B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of transit peptide removal, we undertook experiments to study the components involved. We initially demonstrated that a soluble metallopeptidase is responsible for processing of the precursor of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, and it was implicated in the maturation of the precursors of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit and the acyl carrier protein as well (11Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We subsequently established that a recombinant form of the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli cleaved 10 other precursors destined for different compartments and biosynthetic pathways within the organelle, indicating that it is a general stromal processing peptidase (SPP) 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, stromal processing peptidase; TP-DE, transit peptide subfragment-degrading enzyme; TNFα(46–65), human tumor necrosis factor-α fragment 46–65; preFD, precursor of ferredoxin; preRBCA, precursor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; preLHCP, precursor of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein; preOEE1, precursor of oxygen-evolving enhancer 1; preSPP, precursor of stromal processing peptidase; RBCA, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; Clp, caseinolytic protease; MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, stromal processing peptidase; TP-DE, transit peptide subfragment-degrading enzyme; TNFα(46–65), human tumor necrosis factor-α fragment 46–65; preFD, precursor of ferredoxin; preRBCA, precursor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; preLHCP, precursor of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein; preOEE1, precursor of oxygen-evolving enhancer 1; preSPP, precursor of stromal processing peptidase; RBCA, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase; Clp, caseinolytic protease; MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine(12Richter S.

We complemented these experiments by an in vivo study where SPP was down-regulated via antisense gene expression in tobacco. Chloroplast biogenesis was disrupted in the transgenic plants, resulting in retarded shoot and root growth. Chloroplasts isolated from these transgenic plants did not efficiently import precursors during in vitro assays indicating a critical role for SPP as a component of the import machinery (14Wan J. Bringloe D. Lamppa G.K. Plant J. 1998; 15: 459-468Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Experiments using recombinant SPP, along with in vitrostudies using chloroplast extracts, revealed that transit peptide removal and degradation depend on a succession of regulated events that can be separately analyzed (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). First, SPP recognizes the precursor by binding to the transit peptide, for which it has a strong affinity, but it does not interact with the mature protein. Second, SPP cleaves the precursor in a single endoproteolytic step to liberate the mature protein, whereas the interaction between SPP and the transit peptide is maintained. Third, we discovered that SPP carries out an additional reaction; it converts the transit peptide to a subfragment form that triggers its release from the enzyme. Hence, SPP is regenerated for additional rounds of precursor processing. Fourth, in a reaction independent of SPP, the transit peptide subfragment is subsequently degraded by a newly identified ATP-dependent metallopeptidase localized in the stroma, the transit peptide subfragment-degrading enzyme (TP-DE). Here we performed competition experiments using oligopeptides of the transit peptide of the ferredoxin precursor to investigate the determinants in the structure of the transit peptide required for its removal and degradation as described above. We demonstrate that the C terminus of a transit peptide contains the determinants necessary to mediate the first three steps carried out by SPP, i.e.binding, cleavage, and conversion. The TP-DE activity responsible for the degradation step was inhibited by both the N- and C-terminal regions of the transit peptide, as well as an unrelated oligopeptide, human tumor necrosis factor-α fragment 46–65, TNFα(46–65). The cDNA constructs for in vitro expression of the precursors of ferredoxin (preFD) from Silene pratensis (16Smeekens S. van Binsbergen J. Weisbeek P.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and SPP (preSPP) from Pisum sativum (12Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were used for in vitro transcription by either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The RNA preparations were used to synthesize precursors radiolabeled with [35S]Cys (preFD) or [35S]Met (preFD, preRBCA, preLHCP, preOEE1, and preSPP) by in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The [35S]Met preFD transit peptide and its subfragment were produced by processing of [35S]Met preFD using immobilized SPP and prepared as described previously (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The oligopeptides T(1–24), T(25–48), T(25–36), and T(37–48) were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University (New Haven, CT). The oligopeptide TNFα(46–65) was purchased from Sigma. A cDNA encoding SPP from pea (P. sativum) was cloned into an expression vector forE. coli. Recombinant SPP fused to a peptide tag, which is naturally biotinylated in E. coli cells, was expressed for preparation of soluble cell extracts as outlined previously (12Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Extracts were either directly used in processing or incubated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) for immobilization of SPP, which was used in binding, processing, and conversion assays. For each reaction with immobilized enzyme, SPP from 100 μl of E. coli extract was bound to 50 μg of magnetic beads. To assess the amount of bound SPP protein, the matrix fraction was resuspended in gel-loading buffer and boiled to release bound protein. Magnetic beads were removed, and the supernatant and marker proteins of known concentration were separated by SDS-PAGE using 0.05% SDS in the running buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with the fluorescent dye SYPRO Red (Amersham Biosciences) in 7.5% acetic acid for 1 h and destained in 7.5% acetic acid for 15 min. The scanner STORM 860 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for gel analysis coupled with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 90 ng of SPP was used in a binding, processing, or conversion reaction. Chloroplast-soluble extracts were prepared from 12-day-old seedlings of pea (P. sativum) Progress Number 9 as described previously (21Abad M.S. Clark S.E. Lamppa G.K. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 117-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used in processing and degradation assays. Conditions of the binding assay described previously (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were modified. Briefly, 90 ng of SPP immobilized to 50 μg of magnetic beads were incubated with 20 μl of [35S]Met preFD transit peptide preparation in a 25-μl reaction using 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. Binding was carried out either in the absence or in the presence of synthetic peptides using discrete concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μm. After 2 min at 24 °C, the matrix was separated from the supernatant, washed three times with 50 μl of 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and resuspended in gel-loading buffer. Boiling released the immobilized SPP fraction for analysis by Tricine SDS-PAGE (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Radioactive-labeled precursors were incubated with soluble extract of E. coli cells expressing recombinant SPP ([35S]Met preRBCA, preLHCP, and preOEE1), with immobilized SPP ([35S]Cys preFD and [35S]Met preSPP), or with chloroplast-soluble extract ([35S]Cys preFD, [35S]Met preRBCA, preLHCP, preOEE1, and preSPP) as described previously (12Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). If immobilized SPP was used, reactions also contained 2.5 μg × μl−1bovine serum albumin and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM/EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions using chloroplast-soluble extract contained the inhibitor mixture. Processing of 80 μl of [35S]Met preFD was initially carried out using immobilized SPP in a 400-μl volume containing 25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm PMSF, and 2.5 μg × μl−1 bovine serum albumin. After 5 min at 24 °C, the supernatant containing the [35S]Met transit peptide was separated from the matrix and divided into 20-μl aliquots. Each aliquot was mixed with 90 ng of immobilized SPP in a 25-μl reaction without or with 150 μm oligopeptide, incubated for 30 and 60 min at 24 °C, and analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Conditions of the degradation assay described previously (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were modified. Reactions were carried out in a volume of 25 μl containing 10 μl of [35S]Met subfragment mixed with 10 μl of chloroplast-soluble extract and 150 or 300 μmoligopeptide, at 25 mm of Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. Azocasein (400 μg × ml−1) was tested in the presence of 2 mm PMSF. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C and analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Azocasein stability was monitored in a separate reaction (23Sarath G. de la Motte R.S. Wagner F.W. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 25-55Google Scholar) where the sample volume was increased to 150 μl containing 60 μl of chloroplast extract, 400 μg × ml−1 azocasein, 2 mm PMSF, and 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, along with a mock reaction without chloroplast extract. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C and stopped by adding 450 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid for precipitation. After 15 min, precipitates containing intact azocasein were removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were mixed with 525 μl of 1.0 n NaOH for analysis by a spectrophotometer. For both samples, with chloroplast-soluble extract or without,A 440nm showed that azocasein was not hydrolyzed. Our previous experiments (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have indicated that the transit peptide alone is sufficient to mediate SPP binding to the precursor which we predict determines substrate recognition. However, transit peptides do not share a specific motif but instead are characterized by their amino acid composition. They are enriched in hydroxylated amino acid residues, serine and threonine, and deficient in acidic residues; and basic residues, i.e. arginine and lysine residues, are concentrated in a C-terminal region of 10–15 residues preceding the cleavage site (24von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 25Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 26Claros M.G. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we performed competition experiments to examine which parts of the transit peptide are involved in binding by SPP, which potentially could be either proximal or distal to the processing site of the substrate. The transit peptide sequence of preFD (16Smeekens S. van Binsbergen J. Weisbeek P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3179-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used to design chemically synthesized oligopeptides. PreFD transit peptide consists of 48 residues (Fig. 1). It was split in half to generate two 24-mers, T(1–24) and T(25–48), representing its N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. To examine more closely the region proximal to the processing site, T(25–48) was split again to yield two 12-mers, T(25–36) and T(37–48). The latter 12-mer represents the C-terminal part enriched in basic amino acids. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were previously employed by others (27Wienk H.L. Czisch M. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Pilon M. Rietveld A.G. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19907-19913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to demonstrate that the preFD transit peptide has an extended conformation in aqueous solution. Our own circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis of the oligopeptides T(1–24) and T(25–48) confirmed this finding (data not shown). Therefore, the oligopeptides appear to resemble the preFD transit peptide by both primary and secondary structure. Another oligopeptide, human TNFα(46–65) (29Pennica D. Nedwin G.E. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Derynck R. Palladino M.A. Kohr W.J. Aggarwal B.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1984; 312: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 30Wang A.M. Creasey A.A. Ladner M.B. Lin L.S. Strickler J. Van Arsdell J.N. Yamamoto R. Mark D.F. Science. 1985; 228: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), was chosen as a control in our experiments (Fig. 1). Statistical analysis using the program TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) predicts that TNFα(46–65) does not resemble a fragment of a transit peptide or any other targeting signal (2Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar). The effect of adding the synthesized oligopeptides to an in vitro binding assay was investigated. Recombinant SPP was immobilized onto magnetic beads and incubated with [35S]Met-labeled preFD transit peptide in the presence of the different oligopeptides (see “Materials and Methods”). The amount of bound transit peptide was analyzed after 2 min before its conversion to the subfragment by SPP would occur (see Introduction). Compared with the standard reaction without oligopeptide, the presence of the N-terminal half T(1–24) did not reduce transit peptide binding (Fig. 2 A). In striking contrast, the C-terminal half T(25–48) was found to be a strong competitor (Fig. 2 B). At 10 μm T(25–48), binding was reduced to 27% of the standard reaction, and at 100 μm it was further reduced to 14%. Examination of the two 12-mers derived from the C-terminal half, T(25–36) and T(37–48), revealed that only the oligopeptide consisting of the C-terminal 12 residues of the transit peptide blocked binding (Fig. 2, Cand D). Compared with the 24-mer T(25–48), the 12-mer T(37–48) had to be present at higher concentrations. A concentration of 10 μm T(37–48) reduced binding to 78%, and 100 μm decreased it to 36%. The control oligopeptide TNFα(46–65) did not interfere with binding (Fig. 2 E). We conclude that the C terminus of preFD transit peptide contains a binding site recognized by SPP, which is distinct from the N-terminal domain that interacts with the receptors of the translocation machinery (31Rensink W.A. Schnell D.J. Weisbeek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10265-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SPP removes the transit peptide from a precursor in a single endoproteolytic step (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Earlier studies (7Archer E.K. Keegstra K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Bassham D.C. Creighton A.M. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klosgen R.B.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using precursor mutants indicated that some transit peptides have elements important for processing at their C termini. However, because these mutations could have caused conformational changes in the precursor, the analysis of the features of the transit peptides necessary for processing required a different approach. Therefore, we examined whether the oligopeptides would interfere with processing of preFD by recombinant SPP (see “Materials and Methods”). The analysis revealed that neither T(1–24) nor T(25–36) interfered with the processing reaction (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, production of mature ferredoxin was strongly affected by both T(25–48) and T(37–48) (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 6). The C-terminal half T(25–48) completely blocked the reaction, whereas T(37–48) reduced it by 90% compared with the standard reaction. To test whether recombinant and native SPP require the same elements for substrate processing, parallel reactions with a chloroplast soluble extract were carried out. Significant differences between the reactions were not observed (Fig. 3 B). That the C-terminal 12-mer of preFD transit peptide effectively competed with its own precursor indicates that it contains the determinants necessary for processing by SPP. The importance of the transit peptide C terminus in preFD processing was suggested previously (33Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by an examination of a set of preFD mutants with internal deletions. To extend our analysis, we next tested whether the oligopeptides could compete in the removal of other transit peptides that lack sequence similarity with the preFD transit peptide and differ considerably in length. We selected the precursors for 1) a stromal protein, preRBCA, containing a transit peptide with 9 residues more than preFD; 2) a thylakoid membrane component, preLHCP, with a transit peptide 8 residues shorter than preFD; 3) a luminal protein, preOEE1, with a bipartite transit peptide mediating both stromal and luminal targeting; and 4) SPP itself with an unusually large transit peptide predicted to be 142 residues. The precursors were processed by recombinant SPP or a chloroplast-soluble extract in the presence of 150 μmoligopeptide. The competition of oligopeptides observed with preRBCA resembled the results obtained with preFD. T(1–24) and T(25–36) did not interfere with processing but both T(25–48) and T(37–25) acted as competitors (Fig. 3, C and D). We also observed that T(25–48) was slightly more effective in competition than T(37–48). We did not find significant differences between processing by the recombinant SPP and the chloroplast-soluble extract. Overall, the oligopeptides also had the same effect in the processing reactions with preLHCP, preOEE1, and preSPP (Fig. 3, E–J). This demonstrates that although the C-terminal 12-mer of preFD transit peptide does not share sequence identity with the transit peptides of the other four precursors (see “Discussion,” Fig. 7), it strongly competes with them for processing. We conclude that these transit peptides must share common features to mediate the highly specific processing reaction by SPP. Interestingly, the different lengths of the transit peptides, here from 35 residues for preOEE1 to 142 residues for preSPP, did not influence the effects of the oligopeptides on processing. The results suggest that independent of the length of a transit peptide, the determinants for processing reside in its C-terminal region that is usually characterized by a positive net charge within the 10–15 residues preceding the SPP cleavage site. To quantify the effects of the oligopeptides on processing, an extended analysis with one precursor was performed. PreRBCA was chosen because it is efficiently processed and well separated from its mature form by SDS-PAGE. Increasing concentrations (0–200 μm) of each oligopeptide were added to the reactions (Fig.4 A). The data demonstrated again that both T(25–48) and T(37–48) blocked preRBCA processing. The two oligopeptides, however, differed in their effectiveness as competitors. At 20 μm of the 24-mer T(25–48), production of mature ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (RBCA) was decreased to 30% of the reaction without oligopeptide. A similar inhibition by the 12-mer T(37–48) required 50 μm. We tested whether the 12-mer T(25–36) could cooperate with T(37–48) to further inhibit processing, but no change was observed (not shown). Next, time courses of processing were carried out using 20 μm T(25–48) or T(37–48). At 30 min, production of mature RBCA was reduced by both T(25–48) and T(37–48), although the latter was less effective (Fig. 4 B). To substantiate the specificity of the assay, the effect of the oligopeptide TNFα(46–65) on preRBCA processing using recombinant SPP or a chloroplast-soluble extract was tested, and no interference was found (Fig. 4 C). These quantitative analyses strongly support the conclusion that the determinants for precursor processing reside in the C terminus of a transit peptide, adjacent to the site cleaved. Upon processing, SPP releases the mature protein, but the transit peptide remains bound. Our earlier results indicated that SPP interrupts its interaction with the transit peptide by converting it to a subfragment form, which then dissociates (15Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We tested whether the oligopeptides of preFD transit peptide would interfere with the subfragment production. Conversion reactions were carried out by incubation of immobilized SPP with the [35S]Met preFD transit peptide, and samples were taken after 30 and 60 min (see “Materials and Methods”). In the standard reaction, conversion was nearly completed after 60 min (Fig.5 B, lane 2). In the reactions with 150 μm of the different oligopeptides, the subfragment was still produced if T(1–24) and T(25–36) were present (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 3 and5). In contrast, after 30 min both T(25–48) and T(37–48) efficiently competed with the transit peptide, blocking conversion by SPP. After 60 min, T(25–48) still blocked the reaction, whereas T(37–48) was no longer sufficient. However, if the concentration of T(37–48) was increased to 300 μm, conversion was blocked over a 60-min period, demonstrating the concentration-dependent inhibition by the oligopeptide (Fig. 5, A and B"
https://openalex.org/W2037283356,"Glycosylation analysis was used to probe the sequence of events accompanying the binding of antigenic peptides to the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains. Free heavy chains were isolated from the β2-microglobulin-negative cell line Daudi and from the B-lymphoblastoid cell line Raji. Heavy chains were also isolated from Raji cells in multimolecular complexes (peptide loading complexes) containing the transporter associated with antigen processing, tapasin and ERp57 with and without the lectin-like folding chaperone, calreticulin. Calreticulin is a soluble protein that recognizes primarily the terminal glucose of Glc1Man7–9GlcNAc2 glycans. This paper shows that monoglucosylated glycoforms of heavy chain, which exist transiently in the endoplasmic reticulum in the initial stages of the glycosylation processing pathway, are present in the peptide loading complex. The data are consistent with a model in which the release of peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I molecules from calreticulin, induced by deglucosylation of the heavy chain N-linked glycan, signals the dissociation of the complex.

The class I-peptide complexes are then transported to the cell surface where they can be screened by CD8-positive T cells and can potentially trigger an immune response (1Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms that regulate peptide binding to MHC class I molecules are not yet fully established. Mature MHC class I molecules consist of two subunits: the heavy chain (HC), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein, and a small, soluble, nonglycosylated protein, β2-microglobulin (β2m). A peptide must associate with the peptide-binding groove formed by the α1 and α2 domains of the HC for proper folding of the class I-β2m dimer and its subsequent transport to the cell surface. Class I assembly requires multiple coordinated intra- and inter-molecular events to ensure the continuous reporting of cellular contents to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. It has been proposed that in the ER of humans, unassembled heavy chains interact initially with the membrane-bound chaperone, calnexin (CNX) (2Degen E. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Exp.

Either CNX or CRT recruits the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 into the complex (6Lindquist J.A. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Hammerling G.J. Eur. Mol. Biol.

The assembled class I-β2m dimer, together with associated CRT and ERp57, is associated with a larger complex that also contains the TAP heterodimer and the transmembrane glycoprotein tapasin (10Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Tapasin provides the bridge that links MHC class I to the TAP heterodimer (5Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), and a disulfide bond between tapasin and ERp57 is dependent upon the association of class I molecules with the complex (9Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Peptides destined for MHC class I binding are translocated in an ATP-dependent fashion into the ER by the TAP heterodimer. Here they may undergo further N-terminal trimming prior to binding to TAP-associated MHC class I molecules (11Paz P. Brouwenstijn N. Perry R. Shastri N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Peptide binding induces dissociation of the class I-β2m dimer from the tapasin-TAP complex, as well as from CRT and ERp57, allowing glycan maturation and transport of the assembled MHC class I-peptide complex from the ER. CNX and CRT are both lectin-like molecules that can facilitate the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER, in part by binding to their N-linked glycans (12Bergeron J.J. Zapun A. Ou W.J. Hemming R. Parlati F. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 435: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). In the early stages of oligosaccharide processing, HCs, in common with all nascent glycoproteins, transiently carry the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide (Fig. 1). The α1,3 arm of this glycan, in particular the terminal Glc residue (G3), provides the ligand that enables the partially folded protein to interact with the lectin-binding sites on both CNX (12Bergeron J.J. Zapun A. Ou W.J. Hemming R. Parlati F. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 435: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and CRT (13Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). A quality control cycle has been proposed in which CNX and CRT in turn recruit ERp57, which facilitates the proper formation of disulfide bonds in the nascent glycoprotein (14Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Removal of the glucose residue by glucosidase II eliminates CNX or CRT binding. Only misfolded, non-native glycoproteins are substrates for the enzyme, UDP-glucosyl transferase, which adds back the terminal glucose residue, allowing the glycoprotein to rebind to CNX or CRT. Correctly folded glycoproteins, which are not reglucosylated, escape further interactions with the lectin-like chaperones and can generally leave the ER after further trimming of the mannose residues (15Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). There is no direct evidence for the involvement of the MHC class IN-linked glycan in CNX-mediated folding, and it has been proposed that this interaction may be mediated by the MHC class I polypeptide chain (16Suh W.K. Mitchell E.K. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Waneck G.L. Williams D.B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also suggestive evidence that the interaction of MHC class I with CNX may be important for the CRT-class I interaction and even for the incorporation of class I molecules into the class I loading complex. However, MHC class I association with CRT and with the peptide loading complex is inhibited in the presence of the glucosidase I inhibitor castanospermine (5Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the class I peptide loading process may be an adaptation of the general quality control mechanism involving CRT and ERp57 that regulates folding of glycoproteins in the ER. In this paper we investigated this hypothesis by determining the glycosylation status of MHC class I heavy chains, both free in the ER and associated with the loading complex, and we also analyzed the glycosylation of TAP-associated tapasin. The results are consistent with a role for theN-linked glycan-mediated, CRT-dependent, quality control pathway in modulating class I peptide loading. The following monoclonal antibodies were used for the affinity columns: MaP.ERp57 (anti-human ERp57) (20Diedrich G. Bangia N. Pan M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1703-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), 148.3 (anti-TAP1) (21Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and HC10 (anti-class I HC) (21Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Tapasin C-terminal specific rabbit antiserum R.gp48c and anti-HC-terminal peptide specific rabbit antiserum R.A3e7 used in Western blotting were prepared in the Cresswell laboratory (9Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Peptide N-glycanase F (EC3.5.1.52) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Lewes, UK), Jack bean α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) was from Glyko Inc. (Upper Heyford, UK), and glucosidase II was prepared in the Glycobiology Institute. The activity of this enzyme was measured by hydrolysis of [14C]glucose-labeled Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 substrate and was found to release 5.7% min−1 of labeled glucose (22Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the other reagents used throughout these experiments were of the highest quality available. Raji wild type B cells or Daudi β2m-negative B cells (1010) were lysed in 200 ml of 1% digitonin in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mTris, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline) containing protease inhibitors as previously described (10Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and passed through one of three affinity columns consisting of MaP.ERp57 (α-ERp57), 148.3 (α-TAP), or HC10 (α-HC) coupled to BioGel A15m beads (Bio-Rad) to produce ERp57-associated proteins, TAP-associated proteins, or free class I HC, respectively. After extensive washing with 0.1% digitonin in Tris-buffered saline, the proteins were eluted in 1% octylglucoside in 3.5 m MgCl2 and dialyzed against 0.1% octylglucoside in phosphate-buffered saline. During dialysis some protein precipitated that was removed by centrifugation. These preparations produced the following samples: (i) from the α-ERp57 affinity column: ERp57/CRT, ERp57-associated tapasin and ERp57-associated class I HC in solution (gel A), and ERp57-associated class I HC as a precipitate (gel B); (ii) from the α-TAP affinity column: ERp57/CRT, TAP-associated tapasin and TAP-associated class I HC in solution (gel C), and TAP-associated class I HC as a precipitate (gel D); (iii) from the α-HC affinity column: free class l HC from Raji cells (gel E) and Daudi cells (gel F); and (iv) from the α-TAP affinity column: tapasin from Daudi cells (gel G) (Fig.2). Precipitated samples were dissolved with sonication in 2–10% SDS. Samples of each of the proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels in a vertical mini-gel system, 80 × 80 × 0.75 mm at 500 V and 25 mA/gel. The gels were prepared according to Kuster et al. (23Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and 20 μl of sample and 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer were used per well. Reduction and alkylation of the proteins were carried out prior to running the gels. Dithiothreitol (10 mm, 0.5 μl) was added, and each sample was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Iodoacetamide (100 mm) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Up to 8 wells of each sample were run to provide sufficient glycans for NP-HPLC analysis, enzyme digestions, and mass spectrometry. The protein was visualized in the gel by staining with Coomassie Blue for at least 2 h, destaining with 50% methanol/7% acetic acid for a few minutes and then overnight with 5% methanol/7% acetic acid. The bands were excised, cut into pieces of ∼1 mm3, and frozen at −20 °C for at least 2 h. The gel pieces were washed with 2× 300 μl of 20 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.0, for 30 min and then with 300 μl of 1:1 acetonitrile:20 mm NaHCO3 for 60 min to remove residual SDS (23Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The volumes given are for 10–15 mm3 of SDS-PAGE gel band containing the protein of interest. 30 μl of peptide N-glycanase F (100 units/ml) were added to the gel pieces and left for about 5 min for the gel to re-swell, and then the gel was covered with 20 mmNaHCO3. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 1,100 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was retained, and the glycans were extracted from the gel using three changes of 200 μl of sub-boiling point distilled water and sonicated for 30 min, followed by extractions with 200 μl of acetonitrile, 200 μl of water, and 200 μl of acetonitrile. The extracts and the above supernatant were combined. 30 μl of activated anion exchange resin, AG-50 X12 (H+) slurry were added to the extracts and incubated for 5 min at room temperature to desalt. It was centrifuged for 5 min at 550 × g, and the supernatant was filtered with a 0.45-μm Millex-LH/hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter attached to a 2.5-ml syringe. The supernatant was partially dried in a vacuum centrifuge, transferred to a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and dried completely. The samples were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide by reductive amination according to Biggeet al. (24Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and processed through NP-HPLC using the low salt buffer system as described by Guile et al. (25Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This uses a 4.6 × 250-mm GlycoSep-N column (Glyko) with a gradient of 20–58% solvent A (solvent A, 50 mm formic acid adjusted to pH 4.4 with ammonia; solvent B, acetonitrile). Each 2-aminobenzamide-labeled sample was dissolved in 100 μl of sub-boiling point distilled water, and 20 μl was run on the NP-HPLC with 80 μl of acetonitrile. The system was calibrated using an external standard of hydrolyzed and 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glucose oligomers to create a dextran ladder (25Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The number of glucose residues in each dextran peak was plotted against the retention times of the peaks to obtain a standard curve. The retention times for the individual glycans were converted to glucose units (GU) using this curve. The retention times were then compared with a data base of experimental values. The higher the GU value the larger the glycan it represents. The incremental GU values are measures of the affinity of each glycan for the column matrix and are related to the hydrophilicity of each monosaccharide residue in the chain. It also depends on how much of the hydrophilic surface is exposed to the column matrix. In the case of GlcNAc, theN-acetyl side chain hinders some of the interactions which are available to glucose; therefore the incremental value for GlcNAc is about 50% of that of glucose (25Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). It is this feature that gives the fine specificity of the columns, allowing the distinction between arm-specific isomers. The area of each of the glycan peaks was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total glycans of each sample. Comparing the percentage areas of intact and digested glycan pools helps to identify glycans that co-elute. Approximately 100–300 fmol of each glycan pool were dried, and 10 μl of 50 units/ml Jack bean α-mannosidase in 100 mm sodium acetate with 2 mm Zn2+, pH 5, were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight, after which a further 10 μl of 100 units/ml enzyme were added, and the sample was incubated for a further 24 h. The sample was then heated at 100 °C for 5 min to denature the enzyme and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. It was redissolved in 20 μl of sub-boiling point distilled water and analyzed by NP-HPLC. Similarly two additions of 10 μl of α1,3-glucosidase II (in 80 mm triethylamine, pH 7, 0.1m sodium chloride, 10% glycerol and sodium azide) were made to 100–300 fmol of the released glycans. The samples were processed as for the mannosidase digests. The NP-HPLC profiles were analyzed according to Guile et al. (25Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Positive ion Reflectron MALDI time-of-flight mass spectra were recorded with a Micromass TofSpec 2E Reflectron mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) fitted with delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 nm). The acceleration voltage was 20 kV, the pulse voltage was 3200 V, and the delay for the delayed extraction ion source was 500 ns. The samples were prepared by adding 0.5 μl of an aqueous solution of the sample to the matrix solution (0.3 μl of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile) on the stainless steel target plate, allowing it to dry at room temperature and then recrystallizing it from ethanol. Heavy chain complexes, free HC, and tapasin (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) were produced by passing lysed Raji wild type B-cells or Daudi β2m-negative B cells through one of three affinity columns, α-ERp57, α-TAP, or α-HC (Fig. 2). The glycosylation of the following proteins was analyzed: ERp57/CRT, ERp57-associated tapasin and ERp57-associated class I HC (gel A; Figs.3 and 5); ERp57-associated class I HC (gel B; Fig. 3); TAP-associated tapasin and TAP-associated class I HC (gel C; Figs. 3 and 5); TAP-associated class I HC (gel D; Fig. 3); class l HC from Raji cells (gel E; Fig. 4); class l HC from Daudi cells (gel F; Fig. 4); and tapasin from Daudi cells (gel G; Fig. 4).Figure 5SDS-PAGE gels of Raji cell complexes eluted from the α-ERp57 affinity column (A) and from the α-TAP affinity column (C) and of a Daudi cell complex also eluted from the α-TAP affinity column (G). The NP-HPLC chromatograms (A TPN, C TPN, andG TPN) are of the glycans released from the tapasin bands in gels A, C, and G, respectively. The tapasin bands contain mainly Man9GlcNAc2 and a small peak of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3SDS-PAGE gels of complexes from Raji cells eluted from the α-ERp57 (A andB) and the α-TAP (Cand D) affinity columns. The bands containing ERp57/CRT, HC, and tapasin are indicated. The NP-HPLC chromatograms (A HC, B HC,C HC, and D HC) are of the glycans released from the CRT associated HCs in gels A, B, C, and D, respectively. Each of these glycan profiles contains predominantly Man9GlcNAc2 (peak 4) and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (peak 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gels (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) were identified according to their migration positions and by Western blotting. The approximate apparent molecular masses were as follows: ERp57/calreticulin, 55 kDa; tapasin, 50 kDa; and HC, 45 kDa. The tapasin bands were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, which indicated that the Raji cell tapasin ran as a doublet (Figs. 3 and 5). Fig.6 shows Western blotting performed on a selection of samples. The upper panel shows the reactivity of the samples with the tapasin C-terminal specific rabbit antiserum R.gp48c, and the lower panel shows the reactivity of the samples with the anti-HC-terminal peptide-specific rabbit antiserum R.A3e7. The specificity of both the tapasin-reactive and the HC-reactive antibodies is demonstrated by samples G (tapasin from Daudi cells) and E (free HC purified from Raji cells). Samples A–C all contain tapasin and HC. Samples A and C contain tapasin and HC in solution, and sample B has some tapasin co-precipitating with HC during dialysis. Glycans were released by incubating the excised gel bands with peptideN-glycanase F, which cleaves the N-glycosidic linkage to asparagine, and the glycan pools labeled with the fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide. The chromatograms of both the HC and the tapasin samples were all found to contain the same sugars in the peaks, labeled from 1 to 5, although in different proportions (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Peak a (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) was not identified. It is present in the samples eluted from the α-ERp57 and α-HC columns but not in those eluted from the α-TAP column (gels C and D), and it is not digested by either mannosidase or glucosidase II and was not seen in the MALDI mass spectrometric analysis (see Table III). As expected, the ERp57/CRT contained no glycans that could be detected by NP-HPLC because ERp57 and human CRT are not glycosylated (data not shown). In every case, glycan structures were assigned from the GU values of the peaks in the NP-HPLC trace of the intact glycan pools (TableI) combined with data from glucosidase II and Jack bean α-mannosidase digests including consideration of peak areas (Table II). The assignments are consistent with MALDI mass spectrometric data (TableIII).Table IIIMALDI mass spectrometry data for released glycansPeakMassCompositionGlycanFoundCalculatedHexHexNAcHC (gel B)11420.41419.562Man6GlcNAc221581.81581.572Man7GlcNAc23b1743.61743.682Man8GlcNAc241905.51905.692Man9GlcNAc2 + Glc1Man8GlcNAc252067.62067.7102Glc1Man9GlcNAc2Tapasin (gel G)11419.31419.562Man6GlcNAc221581.41581.572Man7GlcNAc23b1743.51743.682Man8GlcNAc241905.41905.692Man9GlcNAc252067.92067.7102Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 Open table in a new tab Table IIPeak areas expressed as percentages of the total glycans of intact and digested samplesPeak number and identificationα-ERp57 HC from precipitate (Gel B)After glcIIbGlucosidase II. digestα-ERp57 tapasin (Gel A)After glcIIbGlucosidase II. digest1Man6GlcNAc233682Man7GlcNAc26101093aMan8GlcNAc2aIsoforms.65743bMan8GlcNAc2aIsoforms.122113134Man9GlcNAc2 + Glc1Man8GlcNAc2376260665Glc1Man9GlcNAc2364a Isoforms.b Glucosidase II.

Open table in a new tab The identity of the peaks in the chromatograms in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 was confirmed with glucosidase II and Jack bean α-mannosidase digestions. Glucosidase II cleaves the nonreducing terminal glucose α1–3-mannose linkage. Fig.7 shows the glucosidase II digest of ERp57 associated class I HC (BHC), in which peak 5 (GU 10.15) is completely digested to Man9GlcNAc2, peak 4 (GU 9.49) (Table I). The incremental GU value for one glucose monomer is 0.7, so the digestion of peak 5 to peak 4 with a difference of ∼0.7 and an increase in peak area of peak 4 from 37.4 to 61.8% confirms the presence of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 in peak 5. Peak 5 was collected and digested with glucosidase II producing a single peak of Man9GlcNAc2 (Fig. 7, inset a), confirming that peak 5 contains only Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. A comparison of the percentage peak areas of the intact glycan pool of the ERp57 associated class I HC (BHC) with that of its glucosidase II digest shows the presence of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 (∼9% of total glycans), which co-elutes with Man9GlcNAc2(Table II). Similarly, peak 4 of ERp57-associated class l HC (AHC) contains ∼9% Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 as well as Man9GlcNAc2 (data not shown). Peak 4 was collected and digested with glucosidase II producing two peaks, Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2, derived from 42 and 58% of peak 4, respectively (Fig. 7, inset b), confirming that peak 4 contains both Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2. These data show that Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 is ∼16% of the total glycans, which is a more accurate assessment than the data from the total glycan pool where there is overlap of peaks 3a and 3b, which contain two isoforms of Man8GlcNAc2. None of the tapasin samples show evidence of Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 when comparing the peak areas (Table II). Jack bean α-mannosidase is an exoglycosidase that acts on nonreducing terminal mannose α1–2,3 and 6 linkages. Fig. 8shows the mannosidase digest of ERp57-associated class I HC (BHC). All of the oligomannose peaks were digested to Man1GlcNAc2, 65.5% of the total digested glycans (peak 6, GU 2.63). Glc1Man4GlcNAc2 (29.6%, peak 7, GU 5.97) and Glc1Man5GlcNAc2 (4.8%, peak 8, GU 6.88) were also identified as digestion products of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2. Jack bean α-mannosidase is sometimes unable to cleave a single Manα1–6 linked to the core β Man, so peak 8 may be the result of incomplete digestion. Figs. 7 and 8 also show representative cartoons of some of the glycan structures. Fig. 3shows the chromatograms of all the glycans of the calreticulin-associated heavy chain samples. The heavy chains of ERp57-associated class I MHC in solution (AHC) and the precipitated ERp57-associated class I MHC (BHC), the TAP-associated class I MHC in solution (CHC), and the precipitated TAP-associated class I MHC (DHC) all show a predominance of Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 (peak 4) and G"
https://openalex.org/W2057805791,"We previously demonstrated that α2,8-linked disialic acid (diSia) residues occur in several glycoproteins of mammalian brains (Sato, C., Fukuoka, H., Ohta, K., Matsuda, T., Koshino, R., Kobayashi, K., Troy, F. A., II, and Kitajima, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15422–15431). The role of the diSia epitope on these glycoproteins is not known, whereas the importance of the diSia epitope on glycolipids is well documented in neurite formation. In this study, we demonstrated that the diSia epitope (Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal) on glycoproteins, but not on glycolipids, is involved in neurite formation in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A, based on the following lines of evidence. First, the amount of diSia epitope on glycoproteins increased during retinoic acid-induced neurite formation. Second, retinoic acid treatment primarily increased the diSia epitope on a 100-kDa glycoprotein. We identified this protein as CD166 (SC1), an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule involved in neurite extension. Third, a monoclonal antibody against the diSia epitope specifically inhibited neurite formation. We also demonstrated that α2,8-sialyltransferase III mRNA expression increased 1.7-fold after the induction of neurite formation, suggesting that α2,8-sialyltransferase III is responsible for formation of the diSia epitope on CD166. We previously demonstrated that α2,8-linked disialic acid (diSia) residues occur in several glycoproteins of mammalian brains (Sato, C., Fukuoka, H., Ohta, K., Matsuda, T., Koshino, R., Kobayashi, K., Troy, F. A., II, and Kitajima, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15422–15431). The role of the diSia epitope on these glycoproteins is not known, whereas the importance of the diSia epitope on glycolipids is well documented in neurite formation. In this study, we demonstrated that the diSia epitope (Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal) on glycoproteins, but not on glycolipids, is involved in neurite formation in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A, based on the following lines of evidence. First, the amount of diSia epitope on glycoproteins increased during retinoic acid-induced neurite formation. Second, retinoic acid treatment primarily increased the diSia epitope on a 100-kDa glycoprotein. We identified this protein as CD166 (SC1), an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule involved in neurite extension. Third, a monoclonal antibody against the diSia epitope specifically inhibited neurite formation. We also demonstrated that α2,8-sialyltransferase III mRNA expression increased 1.7-fold after the induction of neurite formation, suggesting that α2,8-sialyltransferase III is responsible for formation of the diSia epitope on CD166. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids that are abundant in brains (1Nagai Y. Iwamori M. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 197-241Google Scholar, 2Sharon N. Lis H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 133-189Google Scholar). α2,8-Linked disialic acid (diSia) 1The abbreviations used are: diSia, disialic acid; oligoSia, oligosialic acid; polySia, polysialic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ST8Sia, α-2,8-sialyltransferase; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; 100-kDa-gp, 100-kDa glycoprotein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: diSia, disialic acid; oligoSia, oligosialic acid; polySia, polysialic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ST8Sia, α-2,8-sialyltransferase; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; 100-kDa-gp, 100-kDa glycoprotein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.-containing and trisialic acid-containing gangliosides (b and c series) in neuronal cells are considered to have an important role in neurite formation. Exogenous GD3 and GQ1c induce neurite sprouting and extension in a murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A, and several other types of neuronal cells (3Leeden R.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1984; 12: 147-159Google Scholar, 4Tsuji S. Yamashita T. Tanaka M. Nagai Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 414-423Google Scholar). Transfection of Neuro2A cells with the GD3 synthase cDNA leads to expression of GD3 and other b series gangliosides and subsequent neurite formation (5Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Google Scholar, 6Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1067-1076Google Scholar). In contrast, however, parental Neuro2A cells form neurites without expressing b or c series gangliosides endogenously when neurite formation is induced by retinoic acid (5Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Google Scholar, 6Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1067-1076Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that the diSia residue might be linked to glycoproteins and that such an epitope might be involved in neurite differentiation of Neuro2A cells. Until recently, there has been little attention paid to the presence of di/oligoSia residues on glycoproteins, whereas the polysialic acid (polySia) chain (degree of polymerization ≥ 8) has been well studied in the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (7Troy II, F.A. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 95-144Google Scholar, 8Brués J.L. Rutishauser U. Fukuda M. Hinsgaul O. Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 116-132Google Scholar) as well as in fish polysialoglycoprotein (9Inoue Y. Roth J. Rutishauser U. Troy II, F.A. Polysialic Acids. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 171-182Google Scholar). PolySia in NCAM is involved in neural cell migration, axonal growth and path finding, synaptogenesis, and synaptic functions associated with learning and memory (8Brués J.L. Rutishauser U. Fukuda M. Hinsgaul O. Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 116-132Google Scholar). Using recently developed highly sensitive techniques (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar, 11Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Google Scholar, 12Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Google Scholar), we demonstrated that glycoproteins containing di/oligoSia groups with up to seven sialic residues occur in brain (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar), and some other tissues (13Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Google Scholar, 14Sato C. Yasukawa Z. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-28856Google Scholar, 15Nadanaka S. Sato C. Kitajima K. Katagiri K. Irie S. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33657-33664Google Scholar) occur more frequently than previously recognized. It is thus hypothesized that these di/oligoSia moieties on glycoproteins have important functions similar to those proposed for gangliosides (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar,16Sato C. Kitajima K. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1999; 11: 371-390Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched for the diSia-containing glycoproteins in Neuro2A cells. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of the diSia epitope on glycoproteins, most prominently on O-linked glycan(s) of the 100-kDa glycoprotein (100-kDa-gp) during neurite formation, while this epitope was deficient in glycolipids. We further identified the 100-kDa-gp as CD166 (SC1), a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family that is involved in heterophilic and homophilic interactions during neuritogenesis (17Bowen M.A. Mason D. Leukocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 894-895Google Scholar). The antibody against the diSia epitope inhibited neurite extension, indicating the importance of the diSia epitope of this glycoprotein in retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Considering these results together with the critical roles of diSia-containing gangliosides following exogenous addition to or expression in Neuro2A cells (3Leeden R.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1984; 12: 147-159Google Scholar, 4Tsuji S. Yamashita T. Tanaka M. Nagai Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 414-423Google Scholar, 5Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Google Scholar, 6Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1067-1076Google Scholar), the diSia epitope either of the glycoprotein or the glycolipids might have an important role in some steps of neurite formation. Thus, the diSia epitope on glycoproteins might share a common function with that of glycolipids. We further demonstrated that the α2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia) III is expressed in the Neuro2A cells and that its mRNA expression increases during neurite formation. Therefore, ST8Sia III is suggested to be the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the diSia epitope on O-linked glycoproteins. This finding is important because it shows a physiologic importance of ST8Sia III in the neuronal system. NANase II (α2,3- and α2,6-specific sialidase) was purchased from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). Clostridium perfringens sialidase, acetylthiocholine, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and BW284C51 were purchased from Sigma. Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase was purchased from Nacalai Co.

Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM was purchased from American Qulex (San Clemente, CA). Monoclonal antibody S2-566 (IgM), which specifically recognizes the Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal sequence, and 12E3 (IgM), which recognizes (Neu5Ac)n (n ≥ 5), were generous gifts from Dr. Koichi Furukawa (Nagoya University School of Medicine) and Dr. Tatsunori Seki (Juntendo University School of Medicine), respectively. The purification of these antibodies was described (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar, 18Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Seki T. Troy F.A. II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18923-18928Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody 2A11 (IgM), which specifically recognizes the Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Acα2→6Glc was prepared as descried previously (19Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM was purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Goat anti-CD166 antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Cappel (West Chester, PA), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-hamster IgG antibody was purchased from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). Murine neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 and 95% air humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were seeded at 1.0 × 106 and incubated for 24 h in a 90-mm-diameter plastic dish. Then induction of neuritogenesis was performed as described (4Tsuji S. Yamashita T. Tanaka M. Nagai Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 414-423Google Scholar,20Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Google Scholar). Briefly, the differentiation was initiated by administration of 20 μm of retinoic acid (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was routinely changed every 2 days. The morphology of the cells was observed under the microscope, and photographs were taken at ×100 magnification. To evaluate neuritogenesis quantitatively, the differentiated cells were counted in five randomly chosen fields of each dish. Cells bearing neurites with at least 1.5-fold longer than the soma diameter were regarded as differentiated as described (21Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8007-8015Google Scholar). The activity of acetylcholinesterase was also measured as described (22Doctor B.P. Toker L. Roth E. Silman I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 399-403Google Scholar). Briefly, to the 40 μl of cell homogenates (see “SDS-PAGE and Immunostaining”) were added 50 μl of 2 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 μl of 5 mm acetylthiocholine in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 10−4m BW284C51, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Sialic acids were quantitated by the fluorometric analysis using the α-keto acid-specific reagent 1,2-diamino-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene (23Nakamura M. Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Ohkura Y. Chem. Parma. Bull. 1987; 35: 687-692Google Scholar, 24Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Nakamura M. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 377: 111-119Google Scholar). The internal sialic acids were quantitated by the fluorometric C7/C9 analysis as described previously (11Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by the BCA protein assay kit or by the measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. For preparation of the glycoprotein and lipid fractions, delipidation of the cells was carried out as described previously (25Folch-Pi J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Google Scholar, 26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar). The resulting precipitate and the organic phases were used as the glycoprotein and glycolipid fractions, respectively. The lipid fraction was dried and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (CH3COO− form, chloroform/methanol/water = 30:60:8; 1 ml). The acidic lipid fraction was eluted with 5 vol of methanol containing 0.3 m CH3COONH4and analyzed by the fluorometric C7/C9 analysis and TLC immunostaining (19Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Google Scholar) with the anti-diSia antibody S2-566 after being desalted with Sephadex G-50 chromatography (0.8 × 20 cm, water). The cells were harvested 0–4 days after neuronal differentiation, washed with 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl (PBS), and homogenized in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and leupeptin as described (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in Laemmli buffer with or without 5% mercaptoethanol and placed at 60 °C for 20 min. The samples were then electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted on the PVDF membrane using a semidry blotting apparatus. The PVDF membrane was blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 at 37 °C for 1 h. After being treated with or without NANase II (α2,3- and α2,6-specific sialidase) andA. ureafaciens sialidase (α2,3-, α2,6-, and α2,8-specific sialidase) (500 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 20 h in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) or with peptide:N-glycanse treatment (25 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 20 h in 0.125 m phosphate buffer (pH 8.2), the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody, S2-566 (0.51 μg/ml), or 12E3 (6.0 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 16 h. As the secondary antibody, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG+IgM (0.4 μg/ml) was used, and the color development was carried out as described (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar). Neuro2A cells were grown on coverslips. For immunofluorescence, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 8 min, followed by washing with PBS. The cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with the primary antibodies (10 μg/ml for S2-566 and 30 μg/ml for 12E3) at 4 °C for 20 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG+IgM (7 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). A DNA fragment coding for a truncated form of the mouse CD166 (U95030), lacking the N-terminal 27 amino acids and C-terminal 56 amino acids of the open reading frame, was amplified by PCR using the following primers containing EcoRI or XhoI site: 5′-GTGAATTCTGGTACACTGTCAACTCAGC-3′ and 5′-ATCTCGAGTTTTGCCTGGTCATTCACCT-3′. The amplified fragment (1499 bp) was subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) through the EcoRI and XhoI sites (pGEX-1). This plasmid encodes the recombinant mouse CD166 consisting of glutathioneS-transferase followed by the truncated form of the mouse CD166. The recombinant mouse CD166 was expressed and prepared as described (14Sato C. Yasukawa Z. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-28856Google Scholar). The recombinant mouse CD166 (20 μg/hamster) together with Freund's complete adjuvant was intraperitoneally injected into the Syrian hamster (female, 6 weeks old). The animals were boosted twice with the protein (20 μg/hamster) mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant every 2 weeks. Blood was collected 1 week after the last boost, and the serum was prepared as described (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar). Balb/c mouse brain homogenate was prepared as previously (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar) and was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the hamster anti-recombinant mouse CD166 (see above) and S2-566 antibodies after incubation with protein G-Sepharose as described previously (14Sato C. Yasukawa Z. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-28856Google Scholar). In case of S2-566, protein G was preincubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Seikagaku Co.). The cells were seeded at 1.0 × 104/well in a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h. The culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 20 μm of retinoic acid and with or without 0.1 μg/ml of monoclonal antibody S2-566 or 2A11 (day 0). The cells were incubated for 1–4 days. The culture medium was routinely changed every 2 days. The morphology of the cells was observed under the microscope, and photographs were taken at ×100 magnification. The length of neurite was measured as described above (see “Cell Culture and Induction of Neuronal Differentiation”). The following degenerate oligonucleotide primers for mouse proteins were used: ST8Sia I (accession number X84235, nucleotides 48–1014), 5′-CATGCTAGCTCGGAAATTCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCGATTTTGTGAAGAT-3′; ST8Sia II (X83562, nucleotides 46–1107), 5′-CTCGTGGTCTTCCTCATCTT-3′ and 5′-GCCGACAGTCAGTTTCAATG-3′; ST8Sia III (X80502, nucleotides 7–1101), 5′-AATTGCAAAATGGCCCGAGT-3′ and 5′-ATGCATTCGATAGAGCAGCT-3′; ST8Sia IV (X86000, nucleotides 72–1061), 5′-AATAGCCAGAACTGAGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCTGTGGTCAGTTTTAGAGC-3′; ST8Sia V (X98014, nucleotides 358–1140), 5′-AGGTGGAAGAGCCTCCAGAT-3′ and 5′-CTTGGGCTTGACGTTGTCAT-3′; and GAPDH (M32599, nucleotides −5–1013), 5′-ACAAAATGGTGAAGGTCGGT-3′ and 5′-TCCAGGGTTTCTTACTCCTT-3′. Total RNA was prepared from Neuro2A cells at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and mouse brain (Balb/c, 8 week female, SLC Co. Japan) using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Random-primed cDNA (∼50 ng) from poly(A)+ RNA prepared by the oligo(dT) column chromatography of total RNA was used as a template for PCR. Both sense and antisense primers (25 pmol each) were added to a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, all for dNTPs (each 200 μm), 1 unit ofTaq polymerase (Takara), and the template cDNA. 20–40 cycles were carried out on a thermal cycler; each cycle involved incubation at 94 °C for 30 s, at 51 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR amplification was found to be proportional to the initial amount of the cDNAs with GAPDH and the number of cycles (20–25 cycles) of PCR (data not shown). Aliquots of the PCR products were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then probed with the indicated digoxigenin-labeled cRNAs (ST8Sia I, II, III, IV, and V and GAPDH; nucleotides, 48–1014, 46–1107, 7–1101, 72–1061, 176–1140, and −5 to 1013, respectively) that had been cloned from the mouse adult brain mRNAs for ST8Sia I–V and GAPDH and sequenced (14Sato C. Yasukawa Z. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-28856Google Scholar). Neuro2A cells can be differentiated into neuron-like cells with neurites after addition of 20 μm of retinoic acid (4Tsuji S. Yamashita T. Tanaka M. Nagai Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 414-423Google Scholar, 20Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Google Scholar). Morphologic changes such as neurite sprouting and extension started 1 day after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig.1 a). The proportion of differentiated cells to the total cell number also increased (Fig.1 b), and at day 4, 90% of the cells had neurites. The length of the neurite also increased as the retinoic acid incubation period increased (Fig. 1 c). Acetylcholinesterase activity, which is a marker enzyme for the cholinergic neuron-like differentiation of Neuro2A (5Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Google Scholar, 21Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8007-8015Google Scholar), also increased (Fig.1 d). The Neuro2A cells were harvested every day after retinoic acid treatment (days 0–4), and the glycoprotein fraction (completely delipidated cell lysate) was analyzed for the amount of internal Neu5Ac (C9(Neu5Ac)) and terminal Neu5Ac (C7(Neu5Ac)) residues using fluorometric C7/C9 analysis. The amount of internal Neu5Ac in the glycoprotein fraction increased (Fig.2) with the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity (Fig. 1 d) and with the morphologic changes (Fig. 1, a–c). The amount of terminal Neu5Ac residues also increased, although it reached a plateau by day 2. These results suggest that the extensive formation of α2,8-linked di/oligoNeu5Ac occurs at day 2 and later. The acidic glycolipid fractions at days 0–4 were also analyzed by fluorometric C7/C9 analysis, and no internal Neu5Ac was detected (Table I). These chemical results indicate that the α2,8-linked Neu5Ac structure on the glycoprotein(s) of Neuro2A increases in a differentiation-dependent manner.Table IComposition of the internal and terminal Neu5Ac residues in the glycoprotein and glycolipid fractions from Neuro2A cells before and during the retinoic acid-induced differentiationIncubation periodGlycoproteinGlycolipidTerminal Neu5AcInternal Neu5AcTerminal Neu5AcInternal Neu5Ac0 days425010714.6ND1 day439017216.3ND2 days656020419.1ND3 days716023826.2ND4 days750029330.8NDThe values are the nmol of each Neu5Ac residue pmg of protein as determined by the fluorometric C7/C9 analysis.

To identify the diSia epitope-containing molecule(s), Neuro2A cells of days 0–4 were subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting with the anti-diSia antibody S2-566, which recognizes Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Acα2→3Gal (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar), and the anti-oligo/polySia antibody 12E3, which recognizes (Neu5Ac)n(n ≥ 5) (18Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Seki T. Troy F.A. II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18923-18928Google Scholar). The diSia epitope was prominently detected at 100 kDa, and the amount of the diSia epitope on the 100-kDa glycoprotein (100-kDa-gp) increased as the neuronal differentiation proceeded (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, there was no immunostained band with 12E3 (Fig.3 b). Thus, the oligo/polySia (degree of polymerization ≥ 5) does not occur in glycoproteins in Neuro2A cells. The acidic lipid fraction of Neuro2A cells was not immunostained with S2-566 on the high performance thin layer chromatography/immunostaining, indicating the absence of diSia-containing gangliosides like GD3 (data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports that Neuro2A cells contain negligible amounts of GD3 and other b series gangliosides (5Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Google Scholar, 6Liu H. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Tsuji S. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1067-1076Google Scholar, 21Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J.

The immunoblotting results were consistent with the immunofluorescence of Neuro2A cells (Fig.4). Immunofluorescence of the Neuro2A cells before (day 0) and after neuronal differentiation (day 4) was examined using S2-566 and 12E3. The cell surface was clearly immunostained with S2-566 at day 4 when the cells were fully differentiated (Fig. 4). On the other hand, there was no staining with 12E3. The fluorescence of S2-566 at day 4 was much more intense than that at day 0. These results indicate that the expression of the diSia epitope on the cell surface increased during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the Neuro2A cells. This is consistent with the results of the fluorometric C7/C9 analysis (Table I) and the immunostaining of S2-566 (Fig. 3 a).Figure 4Immunofluorescence of the differentiated Neuro2A cells using the anti-diSia and anti-oligo/polySia antibodies. The cells before (day 0) and 4 days after (day 4) the retinoic acid treatment were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with the anti-diSia (S2-566) (10 μg/ml) and anti-oligo/polySia (12E3) (30 μg/ml) antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The photos of immunofluorescence of Neuro2A cells are shown. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize the diSia epitope of the 100-kDa-gp, we examined the sensitivity of the stain to the linkage-specific sialidase treatments (Fig.5, lanes 1–3). With A. ureafaciens sialidase, which cleaves α2 → 3, α2 → 6, and α2 → 8 Neu5Ac linkages, the S2-566 stain of the 100-kDa-gp band disappeared (Fig. 5, lane 3). On the other hand, with NANase II, which cleaves α2 → 3 and α2 → 6 linkages, the S2-566 stain remained (Fig. 5, lane 2). These results confirmed that the diSia structure of the 100-kDa-gp contains the Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Ac linkage. Furthermore, S2-566 staining of the 100-kDa-gp was resistant to the peptide:N-glycanase treatment (Fig. 5, lane 4), suggesting that the diSia epitope is on O-glycan chain(s). The migration of the S2-566 stain of the 100-kDa-gp did not change under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5, lane 5), indicating that the 100-kDa-gp has no intermolecular disulfide bonds. These results indicated that the 100-kDa-gp contains the Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal epitope on the O-linked glycan chain(s). The 100-kDa-gp was also detected in mouse brain homogenates by S2-566, together with five other components at 58, 53, 48, 44, and 38 kDa (Fig. 3 a). The 100- and 58-kDa glycoproteins were prominently stained in mouse adult brain. These observations were previously described (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar). In contrast, the 12E3 epitope was not observed except for a greater than 180-kDa NCAM as reported previously (28Seki T. Rutishauser U.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3757-3766Google Scholar, 29Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wnag L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar). The S2-566 stain of the 100-kDa-gp derived from mouse adult brain had the same properties (shown in Fig. 5) as that derived from the Neuro2A cells (data not shown). These results together suggest that the 100-kDa-gp of mouse adult brain is the same glycoprotein as that of Neuro2A cells. The results described above as well as our previous results (10Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy F.A. II Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Google Scholar) clearly indicate that the 100-kDa-gp is the diSia-containing glycoprotein in mouse adult brain. Notably, it was previously suggested that rat lymphocytes also express the diNeu5Gc-containing glycoprotein at 100 kDa (30Nohara K. Kunimoto M. Fujimaki H. J. Biochem.

Currently, there are nine known human MRPs. Distinct from many other members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, human MRP1 and four other MRPs have an additional membrane-spanning domain (MSD) with a putative extracellular amino terminus. The functional significance of this additional MSD (MSD1) is currently unknown. To understand the role of MSD1 in human MRP1 structure and function, we studied the amino-terminal 33 amino acids. We found that the amino terminus of human MRP1 has two cysteine residues (Cys7 and Cys32) that are conserved among the five human MRPs that have MSD1. Mutation analyses of the two cysteines in human MRP1 revealed that the Cys7 residue is critical for the MRP1-mediated drug resistance and leukotriene C4transport activity. On the other hand, mutation of Cys32reduced only moderately the MRP1 function. The effect of Cys7 mutation on MRP1 activity appears to be due to the 5–7-fold decrease in the maximal transport rateV max. We also found that mutation of Cys7 changed the amino-terminal conformation of MRP1. This conformational change is likely responsible for the decrease inV max of LTC4 transport mediated by the mutant MRP1. Based on these studies, we conclude that the amino terminus of human MRP1 is important and that the Cys7residue plays a critical role in maintaining the proper structure and function of human MRP1.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Of the nine human MRPs, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and MRP7 have different membrane organization from the other human MRPs and from most of other known human ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and CFTR (ABCC7). They have an extra membrane-spanning domain (MSD) in addition to the traditional core structure consisting of two nucleotide-binding domains and two MSDs (see Fig. 1 A). This additional MSD (MSD1) shows a low overall amino acid identity among the members that have this domain, but it may be structurally conserved (13Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It consists of five putative transmembrane segments with an amino terminus that has been suggested to be extracellular by determining glycosylation status (14Bakos E. Hegedus T. Hollo Z. Welker E.

J. 2000; 348: 597-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extracellular location of the amino terminus of MSD1 has recently been questioned using a monoclonal antibody generated against the amino terminus of human MRP1 (18Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 B). It is currently unknown whether MSD1 is functionally important. Gaoet al. (19Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that partial deletion of MSD1 (as little as the amino-terminal 66 amino acids including the first transmembrane segment) reduced 90% of the LTC4 transport activity of human MRP1. On the other hand, Bakos et al. (20Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E. Szabo K. de Haas M. van Deemter L. Borst P. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32167-32175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) found that human MRP1 lacking the entire MSD1 is still functional in transporting substrates such as LTC4. However, both groups found that the loop (L0) linking MSD1 and MSD2 is functionally important (19Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Sarkadi B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4451-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with these results, the novel finding that the amino terminus of human MRP1 may be intracellular (18Chen Q. Yang Y. Liu Y. Han B. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) makes it interesting to investigate the importance of the amino terminus in both the structural and functional integrity of human MRP1. To this end, we investigated the importance of the amino-terminal 33 amino acids in the structure and function relationship of human MRP1. Examination of the amino termini of human MRP1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 revealed that there are two cysteine residues (Cys7 and Cys32 in human MRP1) at the amino terminus that are conserved among the five human MRPs and mouse mrp1 (see Fig.1 A). In this study, we mutated these two cysteines of human MRP1 to alanine individually or in combination and investigated the effect of these mutations on MRP1 function and conformation. We found that mutation of Cys7 reduced ∼80% of MRP1-mediated drug resistance and LTC4 transport, whereas mutation of Cys32 reduced only ∼20–40% of MRP1 function. The effect of Cys7 mutation on drug transport appears to be due to a 5–7-fold decrease in the maximal transport rateV max. This change is likely due to the conformational alteration of the amino terminus caused by the mutation of Cys7. Based on these results, we conclude that the amino terminus of human MRP1 is important and that the Cys7residue plays a critical role in maintaining the proper structure and function of human MRP1. [3H]LTC4 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LTC4,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenyethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, peroxidase- and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG, doxorubicin, colchicine, vincristine, and VP16 (etoposide) were purchased from Sigma. LipofectAMINE and G418 were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from BioWhittaker. ECL reagent and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Bio-Rad, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies QCRL-1 and MRPr1 were obtained from Centocor and Kamiya Biomedical Company, respectively. All other chemicals were from Fisher or Sigma. Mutations of Cys7 and Cys32 to Ala were generated using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA template was prepared by cloning the BamHI fragment encoding the first 281 amino acids of MRP1 from pRc/RSV-MRP (a gift from Dr. Piet Borst, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) into the BamHI site of pGEM-4Z. Mutagenesis was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the selection primer 5′-pGTGCTCATCATTGGGAAACGTTCTTCGGG and the mutagenic primers 5′-pCCGGGGCTTCGCCAGCGCCGATG (Cys7 → Ala) and 5′-pCCGACTTCACCAAGGCCTTTCAGAACACGG (Cys32 → Ala). The underlined nucleotides represent mutations. TheNheI-BamHI fragments containing the wild type or desired mutations from pGEM-4Z together with aBamHI-NotI fragment from pRc/RSV-MRP were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) vector linearized with NheI andNotI to create pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT, pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1C7A, pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1C32A, and pcDNA3.1(+)- MRP1C7A/C32A. To generate wild type and mutant pCEP4-MRP1281N constructs, the plasmids pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT, -MRP1C7A, -MRP1C32A, and -MRP1C7A/C32A were digested withBamHI and blunted with Klenow followed by digestion withNheI. The NheI-BamHI fragment encoding the first 281 amino acids of MRP1 were ligated to linearized pCEP4 vector with a cohesive NheI end and a bluntedNotI end. Translation of the inserted fragment terminates at a stop codon in the vector, resulting in the addition of 16 amino acids (RPLEAGKAGSRHDKIH) following the amino acid residue Asp281of human MRP1, similar to what was described in Refs. 19Gao M.

The human MRP1CORE construct was engineered by amplifying a 464-bp fragment of MRP1 using a forward primer with a NheI site (underlined) 5′-CTAGCTAGCGCCGCCATGGATCCTGCCCAGCCG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-CACAGACATGAGGTTGAC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with NheI and PshAI to generate a 365-bp fragment from nucleotides 976 to 1327 of MRP1, which was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1WT digested with NheI andPshAI, resulting in pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1CORE. To generate pCEP4-MRP1CORE, the cDNA encoding amino acid residues 281–1531 of MRP1 was released from the pcDNA3.1(+)-MRP1CORE by NheI andNotI digestion and inserted into the pCEP4 vector, which was digested with NheI and NotI. All of the constructs and mutations described above were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. For stable transfection, 5 μg of pcDNA3.1(+)- MRP1WT, -MRP1C7A, -MRP1C32A, or -MRP1C7A/C32A were transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days following transfection, 10% of the transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml of G418 for 2 weeks. The G418-resistant cells were cloned using cloning cylinders and propagated for testing expression of wild type and mutant human MRP1. For transient transfection, pCEP4-MRP1281N and/or pCEP4-MRP1CORE were transfected into HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day, tunicamycin was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, and the cells were treated for 2 additional days before the cells were harvested for membrane preparations. Tunicamycin was used to eliminate heterogeneous glycosylation for convenience of detecting MRP1281N as a single sharp band rather than as a smear because of glycosylation on Western blot. The membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously with modifications (22Zhang M. Wang G. Shapiro A. Zhang J.T.

Briefly, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm PMSF) at 1 × 106 cells/ml followed by homogenization and centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. Crude membranes were obtained by centrifugation of the 4,000 × g supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The crude membrane pellet was then resuspended in STBS (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF), passed through a 26-gauge needle for 20 times, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The plasma membrane fractions were prepared by layering the 4,000 × g supernatant on top of a 35% sucrose cushion containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes at the interface between the supernatant and the sucrose cushion were collected and pelleted by centrifugation. The membrane pellet was washed with STBS, and then the vesicles were prepared as described above. The ATP-dependent transport of [3H]LTC4 into the inside-out plasma membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration method as previously described (23Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G.

Briefly, 10-μg membrane vesicles were incubated at 23 °C in 120 μl of transport buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4) containing 4 mm ATP or AMP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml of creatine kinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 nm [3H]LTC4 (0.05 μCi). At each desired time point, a 20-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, followed by filtration under vacuum through a glass fiber filter (Type GF/B, Whatman). The filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold transport buffer and then dried before measurement of radioactivity by scintillation counting. The K m and V maxvalues of ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4transport by membrane vesicles were measured at various [3H]LTC4 concentrations (12.5–1600 nm) for 1 min at 23 °C in 25 μl of transport buffer followed by nonlinear regression analysis. The [3H]LTC4 uptake and theV max value were corrected for the MRP1 expression level in each sample as previously described (20Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E.

Briefly, isolated membranes or membranes treated with Peptide N-glycosidase F (22Zhang M. Wang G. Shapiro A. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9728-9736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at room temperature for 30 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the samples were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without DTT. The blots were then blocked with 10% milk and probed with monoclonal antibodies QCRL-1 (2.2 μg/ml) or MRPr1 (0.25 μg/ml) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (for MRPr1). The signal was detected using ECL. 1 × 105stably transfected HEK293 cells were seeded on a glass coverslip in a six-well tissue culture plate. After the culture reaches confluency, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) at room temperature for 10 min and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 1% horse serum in PBS). The cells were then probed with primary antibody QCRL-1 (11 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2fragment (Sigma) (1:100 dilution) at 4 °C for another 30 min. After being washed twice with blocking solution, the cell nucleus was counterstained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) for 10 min. The coverslips were then mounted on the slides before viewing with a confocal microscope. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4 × 103 cells/well. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the medium containing different concentrations of drugs was added to a final volume of 100 μl. The cells were then incubated for 3 days in the absence or presence of drugs followed by the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (5 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubation of the plates at 37 °C for 2 h. An equal volume (100 μl) of solubilization solution (10% SDS in 0.01 m HCl) was then added, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. TheA 570 nm was measured using an automated plate reader. IC50 is defined as the concentration of drugs required to kill 50% of the cells in the control condition and was corrected for the MRP1 expression level as previously described (20Bakos E. Evers R.

Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9052-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were aliquoted into a microtiter plate at the density of 0.5 × 106/well and were washed twice with wash buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The cells were then blocked in blocking solution for 30 min followed by incubation with IU2H10 and QCRL-1 for 30 min in the presence of 0.2% saponin. The cells were then washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2fragment in blocking solution for 30 min and then washed twice again with wash buffer. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and analyzed by FACS. Fig. 1 A shows that the two cysteine residues (Cys7 and Cys32) in the amino terminus are conserved among human MRP1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and mouse mrp1. To investigate whether these two cysteine residues are functionally important, we mutated them to alanine in human MRP1 and created MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A. These mutant and wild type human MRP1 cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) and transfected into HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were chosen because they have been used successfully in previous studies to express wild type and mutant human MRP1 for functional studies, and no detectable endogenous MRP1 were found in these cells (24Stride B.D.

As shown in Fig.2 A, both wild type and mutant MRP1 were efficiently produced in MRP1-transfected HEK293 cells but at different levels as determined using MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody QCRL-1. However, the vector-transfected cells did not have detectable endogenous MRP1. Fig. 2 B shows that both the wild type and mutant MRP1 were glycosylated to the same extent, suggesting that both wild type and mutant human MRP1 are properly routed and modified post-translationally. To further determine whether the mutant proteins were properly routed to the cell surface, we performed an indirect immunofluorescence staining of these cells with QCRL-1. As shown in Fig. 3, the cells expressing MRP1WT, MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A all showed plasma membrane staining. Based on the above observation, we conclude that mutations of cysteine residues in the amino terminus of human MRP1 do not affect the proper routing and trafficking of these proteins to the plasma membrane and their glycosylation in HEK293 cells.Figure 3Indirect immunofluorescence staining of HEK293 cells expressing wild type and mutant human MRP1. HEK293 cells expressing human MRP1WT, MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A grown on glass coverslips were stained with MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody QCRL-1 followed by incubation with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment. The nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the above mutations affect the function of human MRP1, we performed ATP-dependent [3H]LTC4 transport analysis using plasma membrane vesicles isolated from the cells expressing wild type and mutant human MRP1. As shown in Fig. 4, the [3H]LTC4 uptake profiles are very different between the wild type and mutant MRP1. The calculated initial transport rates for MRP1WT, MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A after correction for protein expression level were 35.9 ± 4.9, 6.0 ± 1.5, 26.5 ± 1.0, and 6.9 ± 1.5 pmol/mg/min, respectively. The corrected initial [3H]LTC4 transport rates of the mutant MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A were about 17, 74, and 19% of that of MRP1WT, respectively. This observation suggests that the Cys7 residue is critical for the function of human MRP1 to transport LTC4. We next measured the [3H]LTC4 transportK m and V max of MRP1WT, MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32A. As shown in TableI, the K m values of wild type and all of the mutant MRP1s were similar. However, theV max of MRP1C7A and MRP1C7A/C32A corrected for MRP1 expression level was 5–7-fold less than that of MRP1WT and MRP1C32A. This observation suggests that mutation of Cys7 residue decreased the V max but had no effect on K m of the LTC4transport by human MRP1.Table IKinetics parameters of LTC4 transport by vesicles from transfectants expressing MRP1WT, MRP1C7A, MRP1C32A, and MRP1C7A/C32AK mV maxV max(corrected)MRP1WT194 ± 2089 ± 989MRP1C7A175 ± 2067 ± 1313MRP1C32A175 ± 48116 ± 2383MRP1C7A/C32A176 ± 12137 ± 2616 Open table in a new tab The above studies showed that the Cys7 residue is critical for human MRP1-mediated LTC4 transport.

It appears that mutation of Cys7 reduced the MRP1-mediated drug resistance to about 20% of the wild type MRP1 for all four drugs tested. On the other hand, mutation of Cys32 reduced the MRP1-mediated drug resistance to only 60–80% of the wild type MRP1 for three of the four drugs tested (colchicine, doxorubicin, and VP16).

The structural and functional role of the C-terminal extension of small heat shock proteins, particularly of αA- and αB-crystallins, is not well understood. We have swapped the C-terminal extensions between αA- and αB-crystallins and generated two novel chimeric proteins, αABc and αBAc. We have investigated the domain-swapped chimeras for structural and functional alterations. We have used thermal and non-thermal models of protein aggregation and found that the chimeric αB with the C-terminal extension of αA-crystallin, αBAc, exhibits dramatically enhanced chaperone-like activity. Interestingly, however, the chimeric αA with the C-terminal extension of αB-crystallin, αABc, has almost lost its activity. Pyrene solubilization and bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate binding studies show that αBAc exhibits more solvent-exposed hydrophobic pockets than αA, αB, or αABc. Significant tertiary structural changes are revealed by tryptophan fluorescence and near-UV CD studies upon swapping the C-terminal extensions. The far-UV CD spectrum of αBAc differs from that of αB-crystallin whereas that of αABc overlaps with that of αA-crystallin. Gel filtration chromatography shows alteration in the size of the proteins upon swapping the C-terminal extensions.

These shsps have monomeric masses ranging from 12 to 43 kDa; most of them form large oligomeric assemblies of 150–800 kDa (2MacRae T.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). αA- and αB-crystallins are multimeric proteins having a subunit molecular mass of ∼20 kDa with high sequence homology (3Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-41Google Scholar). They are abundantly present in the eye lens as dynamic, heteromultimeric complexes and are encoded by two different genes (4Quax-Jeuken Y. Quax W. van Rens G. Khan P.M. Bloemendal H. Proc. Natl.

The presence of αA- and αB-crystallin in non-lenticular tissues, in addition to the eye lens, and the up-regulation of αB-crystallin expression under pathological/stress conditions suggests that they have other important biological functions, in addition to their specialized role in vision. Like many shsps, α-crystallins, either in their hetero- or homo-oligomeric states, exhibit molecular chaperone-like properties in preventing thermal and non-thermal protein aggregation (17Horwitz J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); its differential and reversible interaction with early unfolding, refolding-competent intermediates of target proteins decreases their partitioning into aggregation-prone late unfolding intermediates, thus offering protection against heat-induced inactivation (35Rajaraman K. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). α-Crystallins/shsps are believed to thus serve as reservoirs to maintain partially unfolded target proteins in a folding-competent state (36Muchowski P.J.

The chaperone activity of α-crystallin is crucial and appears to be one of the important functions of the protein in vivo. Mutation of a conserved arginine residue has been shown to result in disease in humans; the R120G mutation in αB-crystallin leads to desmin-related myopathy, and R116C in αA-crystallin leads to congenital cataract (40Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 41Litt M.

These mutant molecules have been shown to exhibit poor chaperone activity in vitro (42Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been shown that the R116C mutant of αA-crystallin offers reduced protection to apoptosis in lens epithelial cells subjected to UV stress (44Andley U.P. Patel H.C. Xi J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10178-10186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although growing evidences appear, implicating the functional importance of α-crystallins in many cellular processes (45Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), our knowledge about its structure-function relationship remains elusive largely because of the lack of an x-ray crystal structure or NMR solution structure. As of today, only two members of the shsp family, namely Methanococcus jannaschii hsp16.5 (46Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and wheat hsp16.9 (47van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), have been crystallized successfully, and the three-dimensional has been structure determined. α-Crystallin-like small heat shock proteins from prokaryotes and plants differ significantly from their mammalian counterparts in structure and function (45Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). One notable feature of these proteins (e.g. hsp16.5 and hsp16.9) is that they form monodisperse oligomers with discreet numbers of subunits in the assembly, whereas α-crystallins exhibit a dynamic, polydisperse oligomeric assembly. The polydispersity makes it difficult to crystallize α-crystallin. The α-crystallins are evolutionarily related by the presence of a conserved sequence of about 80 to 100 amino acids, called the “α-crystallin domain” (48Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This domain is rich in β-strands and is proposed to form the classical seven-β-strand Ig-like fold; it has therefore been hypothesized that the shsp family of proteins could belong to the immunoglobulin super family (49Mornon J.P. Halaby D. Malfois M. Durand P. Callebaut I. Tardieu A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of shsps, including α-crystallins, shows that though these molecules possess a highly conserved α-crystallin domain, they differ considerably in both sequence and length of the N- and C-terminal regions flanking this domain (16Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In general, the N-terminal region forms an independent folding structural domain, whereas the C-terminal region is largely unstructured and is referred to as the C-terminal extension. These differences in the N-terminal domains and the C-terminal extensions of shsps may result in their differing oligomeric assembly, size, dynamics, and functions. The chaperone-like activity of the α-crystallins is attributed to the ability of these large, functional oligomeric complexes to bind aggregation-prone target proteins and keep them from precipitating. Binding sites for target proteins and hydrophobic probes such as bis-ANS map to regions in the N-terminal and the α-crystallin domains (50Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 51Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3767-3771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These domains are also involved in subunit contacts, forming large and small molecular mass aggregates, respectively (53Feil I.K. Malfois M. Hendle J. van Der Zandt H. Svergun D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 54Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal extension in both structure and chaperone activity of α-crystallin is not understood. It is believed to function as solubilizer of the α-crystallin-target protein complex as it has a preponderance of charged amino acid residues (55Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Either deletion or introduction of hydrophobic residues within this domain was found to decrease the chaperone activity (55Smulders R.H.P.H. Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. van Boekel M.A. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, the length and the sequence of the C-terminal extensions of shsps differ considerably. However, a conserved motif, IX(I/V), has been shown to be present toward the C-terminal end (16Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Though the C-terminal extensions of αA- and αB-crystallins share more homology compared with the rest of the shsps, they differ significantly as shown in Fig. 1 A. We therefore set out to investigate the role of the C-terminal extensions of αA- and αB-crystallins by swapping these regions between them. An HpaI site engineered by silent mutagenesis was inserted at the end of the α-crystallin domain. This unique site has been used to create the chimeric proteins, αA-crystallin with the swapped C-terminal of αB-crystallin, αABc(144–175), and αB crystallin with the swapped C-terminal of αA crystallin, αBAc(140–173) (see Fig. 1 B). For the sake of simplicity we refer to the chimeras as αABc and αBAc from here onwards. The chimeras were then studied with respect to their wild type counterparts for their structure and chaperone activities. pET-21a(+), T7 promoter, and terminator primers were obtained from Novagen, pBS(II)SK was from Stratagene, insulin, bis-ANS, pyrene, and butyl-Sepharose were from Sigma, and rabbit muscle aldolase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Gel filtration supports, Bio-Gel A-1.5m, and Bio-Gel A-5m were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, and Superose-6 HR 10/30 and a high molecular weight calibration kit were from Amersham Biosciences. DTT was obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories, Mumbai, India. βl- and ζ-crystallin were purified as described earlier (3Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-41Google Scholar, 56Rao P.V. Zigler Jr., J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallin genes were cloned in pET-21a(+) as described earlier (42Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These constructs were used as templates to generate a HpaI site by silent mutagenesis using the PCR at the region coding the C-terminal end of the α-crystallin domain. For αA-crystallin, two independent PCRs were performed using T7 promoter primer and the mutagenic primer bearing the HpaI site (underlined), 5′-CACAGAAGGTTAACATGCCATC-3′, as one primer pair and 5′-GATG GCAGTTAACCTTCTGTG-3′ and T7 terminator primer as the second primer pair. Fragments of 515 and 362 bp generated in the PCR, having a partial overlap, were cloned separately in pBS(II)SK. The same strategy was employed for αB-crystallin using T7 promoter primer and 5′-CATTCACAGTTAACACCCCATA-3′ and 5′-GATGGGGTGTTAACTGTGAATG-3′ and the T7 terminator primer to generate 527- and 300-bp fragments, respectively. These fragments, having partial overlap at the HpaI site, were also cloned separately in pBS(II)SK. To construct the gene encoding the chimeric protein, αABc, the 417-bp NdeI-HpaI fragment of αA-crystallin and the 199-bpHpaI-HindIII of αB-crystallin were excised from pBS(II)SK, ligated, and cloned into the NdeI andHindIII sites of pET-21a(+) expression vector. αBAc was generated similarly by ligating the 429-bpNdeI-HpaI fragment of αB-crystallin to the 261-bp HpaI-HindIII of αA-crystallin and cloning into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET-21a(+). These constructs were verified by sequencing using a 3700 ABI automated DNA sequencer. The wild type and the chimeric recombinant proteins were over expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. All the purification processes were performed using TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Bacterial cells were lysed in TNE buffer using lysozyme and sodium deoxycholate. The purification procedures for the wild type proteins were followed as described by Sun et al. (7Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). αABc was purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate as follows. The protein precipitated with 30–60% saturated ammonium sulfate was dissolved in TNE buffer and loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration column (1.8 × 130 cm). The fractions containing αABc were pooled and subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The protein in TNE buffer containing 20% ammonium sulfate was loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose (C4) column (1 × 5 cm). The protein was eluted using the same buffer with decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient. It elutes at 15% of ammonium sulfate. The other chimeric protein, αBAc, was precipitated with 10–35% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved in TNE buffer, and loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration column. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon ultra filtration unit and loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-5m gel filtration column (1.8 × 145 cm). The purified proteins were dialyzed against the TNE buffer and concentrated by ultra filtration. The purity of wild type and chimeric proteins was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were found to be homogeneous. The concentrations of the protein samples were determined by the method described by Pace et al. (57Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The samples were stored at 4 °C. The chaperone-like activity of the wild type and the chimeric α-crystallins was studied using various model systems where the aggregation of the target proteins is induced either by thermal or non-thermal means as described below. The aggregation of the target proteins was monitored as right angle light scattering using a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The samples were placed in the thermostated cuvette holder, and the light scattering was measured as a function of time by setting the excitation and emission monochromators at 465 nm with the excitation and emission band passes set at 3 nm. Insulin (0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mmNaCl in the absence or the presence of chaperones (at the different concentrations mentioned in figure legends to obtain different chaperone to target protein ratios) was incubated at 37 °C. Aggregation was initiated by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. Citrate synthase (0.02 mg/ml) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 150 mmNaCl and 2 mm EDTA or ζ-crystallin (0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mmNaCl was incubated at 43 °C in the absence or the presence of the required concentrations of the wild type or the chimeric proteins. Aldolase (0.2 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl in the absence or the presence of the required concentrations of the chaperones was incubated at 60 °C, and the aggregation as a function of time was measured as light scattering at 465 nm. Similarly, 0.1 mg/ml βl-crystallin in the same buffer was incubated at 63 °C in the absence or the presence of the mentioned concentrations of the chaperone proteins, and the aggregation was measured as mentioned above. The process of aggregation was monitored in all these cases by means of light scattering at 465 nm, keeping the excitation and emission bandpasses at 3 nm. All fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation and emission band passes set at 5 and 3 nm, respectively. All spectra were recorded in corrected spectrum mode. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the wild type and the chimeric α-crystallins (0.15 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl were recorded by exciting the sample with 295 nm of light. To study binding of the hydrophobic probe, bis-ANS, 0.15 mg/ml of the wild type or chimeric proteins in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl were used. To each of the protein samples (1.2 ml), 15 μl of 0.8 mmmethanolic solution of bis-ANS was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded from 400 to 600 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 390 nm. A 1.2-ml sample of the wild type or the chimeric α-crystallins (0.3 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl was incubated with 1 mm pyrene suspension (12 μl of 100 mm pyrene in Me2SO4) at 37 °C for 30 min with constant stirring. The mixture was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min, and optical density of the clear supernatant was measured at 338 nm using a Hitachi 200–20 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Near- and far-UV CD spectra of the wild type and chimeric α-crystallins were recorded using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Experiments were performed with 1.0 mg/ml of protein in TNE buffer using a 1-cm path length cell for near-UV region and 0.01-cm path length cell for far-UV region. All spectra reported are the average of five accumulations. Oligomeric sizes of the wild type and chimeric proteins were estimated by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose-6 HR 10/30 FPLC column. 100 μl of 1.2 mg/ml α-crystallins in TNE buffer were applied to the column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. High molecular mass standards comprising aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) were used for calibration. Our knowledge of the structure and function of small heat shock proteins, especially αA- and αB-crystallins, is far from complete. Though considerable progress has been made to understand the role of the N-terminal and the α-crystallin domain in the chaperone function of these proteins, the functional and structural roles of the C-terminal extensions are not understood completely and are debatable (45Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 58Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The domain-swapping approach may be particularly useful to give insights into these aspects. The C-terminal extensions of αA- and αB-crystallins are so far characterized as largely unstructured, flexible, and solvent-exposed regions (59Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 60Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If they function as only as “charged tags” that keep the rest of the molecule and the substrate-bound complex in solution, exchanging these regions between αA- and αB-crystallins would not be expected to alter the structure and function of the molecules significantly. Whether in addition to their solubilizer role C-terminal extensions also significantly influence the structure and function of α-crystallins is an important aspect that needs to be investigated. In this context, we have swapped the C-terminal extensions of αA- and αB-crystallin and investigated the resultant chimeric proteins. An HpaI site was engineered within the αA- and αB-crystallin genes by silent mutagenesis to exchange C-terminal extensions between their conserved leucine and threonine residues toward the end of the α-crystallin domain (see Fig.1). The resulting chimeric proteins were called αABc, (N-terminal and α-crystallin domains of αA-crystallin with the swapped C-terminal extension of αB-crystallin) and αBAc (N-terminal and α-crystallin domains of αB-crystallin with the swapped C-terminal extension of αA-crystallin) having 171 and 177 residues, respectively. The predicted pI values of αA- and αB-crystallin, αABc, and αBAc are 5.77, 6.76, 6.59, and 6.04, respectively. The proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. We have observed that αBAc precipitates in the 10–35% ammonium sulfate fraction whereas αABc precipitates in the 30–60% ammonium sulfate fraction similar to wild type αA- and αB-crystallins. These observations suggest that αBAc differs considerably from the other proteins in its columbic interactions and solubility, although the"
https://openalex.org/W1982216644,"Brain cells in situ contain low concentrations of free polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) that are released following pathological insults. As a large rise in extracellular [K+] accompanies cerebral ischemia, we explored whether this was a stimulus for cellular AA release employing a murine mixed cortical cell culture preparation radiolabeled with AA. Elevating the [K+]o from 5 to 52 mm induced a time-dependent increase in [3H]AA release, which reached a plateau after 15 min. Removal of [Ca2+]o or addition of CdCl2 (100 μm) diminished the net high K+-induced AA release, as did treatment of the cultures with tetanus toxin (300 ng/ml) to block endogenous neurotransmitter release. Pharmacological antagonism of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors completely prevented high K+-evoked AA release, indicating that glutamate was the neurotransmitter in question. Addition of exogenous glutamate mimicked precisely the characteristics of AA release that followed increases in [K+]o. Finally, glutamate and AA were released solely from neurons as tetanus toxin did not cleave astrocytic synaptobrevin-2, nor was AA released from pure astrocyte cultures using the same stimuli that were effective in mixed cultures. Taken in toto, our data are consistent with the following scenario: high [K+]o depolarizes neurons, causing an influx of Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This Ca2+ influx stimulates the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft, where it activates postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Events likely converge on the activation of a phospholipase A2 family member and possibly the enzymes diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipases to yield free AA.

Ischemic cell death in the brain accompanies any condition characterized by a significant interruption in cerebral blood flow, including stroke and head trauma. Although many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to ischemic cell death have been described, efficacious methods of intervention remain elusive. Brain levels of free fatty acids, specifically arachidonic acid (AA), 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; AMPA, S-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid; CNQX, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; MCPG, S-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine; MK-801, dizocilpine maleate; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; Ara-C, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside; p-INT, p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channels; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MS, media stock; HBSS, HEPES balance salt solution; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography can be released rapidly during cerebral ischemia and can reach up to 10-fold higher concentrations than levels estimated during normal physiological conditions (1Bazan Jr., N.G.

Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that pharmacological inhibition of AA metabolism has proven to be an effective strategy for ameliorating cerebral ischemic damage in animal models (3Sasaki T.

However, AA itself can have effects independent from its metabolites, some of which can have deleterious consequences for a cell. For instance, AA may directly decrease membrane integrity by acting as a detergent, thereby altering membrane fluidity (16Wieloch T. Siesjo B.K. Pathol. Biol. 1982; 30: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar). Further, AA directly enhances NMDA receptor currents (17Miller B. Sarantis M. Traynelis S.F. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 355: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and may enhance the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft by increasing its release (18Williams J.H. Errington M.L.

J Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). In addition, unesterified AA has been reported to inhibit mitochondrial respiration (24Hillered L. Chan P.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 19: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Takeuchi Y. Morii H. Tamura M. Hayaishi O. Watanabe Y. Arch. Biochem.

Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). Given this, inhibition of AA release from cellular membranes may be a more effective neuroprotective strategy than inhibition of its metabolism alone. Thus, it is of great import to understand the mechanism by which AA is released following cerebral ischemia. Since a large rise in extracellular [K+] (up to 60 mm) has been measured during cerebral ischemia (16Wieloch T. Siesjo B.K. Pathol. Biol. 1982; 30: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gido G. Kristian T. Siesjo B.K. Stroke. 1997; 28: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we questioned whether this might be a trigger for AA release. Studies addressing this question are discrepant. Rat cortical synaptosomes (i.e. isolated nerve terminals) or isolated cerebellar glomeruli release AA when bathed in a depolarizing K+buffer (29Lazarewicz J.W. Leu V. Sun G.Y. Sun A.Y. Neurochem.

The ability of elevated [K+]o to stimulate AA release from intact cortical cells, which are highly susceptible to cerebral ischemic damage, has not been explored. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether a rise in extracellular [K+] was a sufficient stimulus for AA release in a murine mixed cortical cell culture system, and if so, by what mechanism.

Tetanus toxin (Clostridium tetani) was purchased from Calbiochem. Primary murine mixed cortical cell cultures containing both astrocytes and neurons were prepared from either CD1 or Swiss Webster mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as described in detail previously (36Trackey J. Uliasz T.F. Hewett S.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical astrocytes were first prepared from postnatal (1–3 days) animals. Following an aseptic dissection of cerebral cortices, dissociated cells were plated (1–1.5 hemispheres/10 ml/plate) in 15-mm 24-well plates (Falcon Primaria, BD Biosciences) in media stock (MS; see below) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% iron supplemented calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. Once confluent, and thus contact-inhibited, astrocyte cultures were treated with 8 μm Ara-C for 48–72 h to inhibit the growth of any rapidly dividing contaminating cells such as microglia. Hereafter, cultures were maintained in a maintenance medium (MS plus 10% calf serum). Cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic (day 15) animals. Briefly, cortices were dissected, dissociated, and plated (3–3.75 hemispheres/10 ml/plate) in MS supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, and antibiotics on an established bed of astrocytes. All cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified 6% CO2-containing atmosphere. After 6–7 days in vitro, mixed cultures were exposed to 8 μm Ara-C for 48 h. Cells were subsequently shifted into maintenance medium. The medium was changed twice weekly. Experiments were performed on cortical cultures after 13–14 days in vitro. MS consisted of modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, glucose, and sodium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 2.0, 25.7, and 28.2 mm, respectively. Solutions used in the [3H]AA release and the 45Ca2+accumulation experiments, as well as experiments in which glutamate was measured, were as follows. HEPES balance salt solution (HBSS) contained 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose, and 0.01 mm glycine (pH = 7.4; ∼300 mosm). Depolarizing K+ buffer contained 77.5 mm KCl, 47.5 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose, and 0.01 mm glycine (pH = 7.4; ∼299 mosm). The contents of the non-depolarizing K+ buffer were identical to those of the depolarizing buffer except that [KCl] was 5 mm and 145 mmsucrose was added to maintain iso-osmolarity (∼305 mosm). Ca2+-free solutions were made by omitting CaCl2and adding EGTA (100 μm) to the aforementioned buffers. To perform the K+ concentration response experiments, four separate HBSS-based buffers varying in KCl concentration were made. Iso-osmolarity was maintained by concomitantly increasing [KCl] and decreasing the [NaCl]. The concentration of NaCl and KCl in each of these buffers was: 5 mm KCl, 125 mm NaCl; 10 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl; 32.5 mm KCl, 97.5 mm NaCl; 55 mm KCl, 75 mmNaCl; 77.5 mm KCl, 47.5 mm NaCl (∼284–290 mosm). Mixed cortical cell cultures (12–13 days in vitro) were labeled for 18–24 h (37 °C) with [3H]AA (0.25 μCi/ml) in MS containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. On average, 80–90% of the [3H]AA was incorporated into the cells (data not shown). Prior to the initiation of most experiments, cultures were washed four times (750 μl each) with HBSS/0.1% BSA to remove any unincorporated [3H]AA. [3H]AA release was elicited by exposing cultures to various stimuli in HBSS/0.1% BSA (25 °C). BSA was used to trap the AA released into the extracellular space (37Peters-Golden M. Song K. Marshall T. Brock T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the K+ concentration response experiments, cultures were first washed with HBSS (2 × 750 μl) followed by the appropriate experimental K+ solution (2 × 750 μl; 1 × 250 μl) to give a final volume of 400 μl. Following stimulation, 200 μl of culture supernatant was removed directly to a scintillation vial, and the radioactivity was estimated in a Packard TriCarb 2300TR liquid scintillation counter. Data are expressed as either total cpm released/well or net cpm released/well; the latter is calculated by subtracting the cpm release obtained under basal conditions. Values represent 0.4–1.8% of total [3H]AA incorporated. We determined via HPLC analysis that greater than 80% of the radioactivity released into the extracellular space by NMDA stimulation was AA and not a metabolite. 2M. Peters-Golden, A. L. Taylor, and S. J. Hewett, unpublished observations. Cultures were washed twice (750 μl each) with HBSS and then stimulated with various K+ solutions containing a trace amount of 45CaCl2 (0.5 μCi/400 μl/well). After 15 min, cultures were washed three times (750 μl each) to remove any residual extracellular45CaCl2, aspirated dry, and then lysed using 400 μl of warm 0.2% SDS. The amount of radioactivity in 200 μl of the cell lysate was estimated via liquid scintillation counting. Readings of cpm were corrected back to the original volume of lysate and expressed as total cpm/well accumulated, or values were normalized to accumulation that occurred under non-stimulated conditions (basal; set at 100%). For reference,45Ca2+ accumulation induced in a single culture well by exposure to a depolarizing K+ solution (51.6 mm) ranged from 14,000 to 18,000 cpm. Concentrations of extracellular KCl up to 80 mm have been shown to stimulate45Ca2+ accumulation in neurons but not glia in murine mixed cortical cell cultures (38Hartley D.M. Kurth M.C. Bjerkness L. Weiss J.H. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1993-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of glutamate released into the cell culture supernatant was measured indirectly using a colorimetric end point assay, modified from one originally developed by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Glutamate is converted to 2-oxoglutarate via glutamate dehydrogenase, in the process reducing NAD+ to NADH. The subsequent oxidation of NADH drives a reaction catalyzed by diaphorase, resulting in the conversion ofp-INT to a formazan product, the absorption of which is measured spectrophotometrically (490 nm). To generate samples, cultures were washed four times (750 μl each) with phenol red-free non-depolarizing buffer and then stimulated with various phenol red-free K+ solutions. After 15 min of stimulation, culture supernatant (250 μl) was collected and either stored at −20 °C or analyzed immediately. The non-transportable glutamate transporter inhibitor,dl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (0.3 or 1 mm), was present during stimulation to block reuptake of released glutamate, or else glutamate levels were below the level of detection by this assay. 3A. L. Taylor and S. J. Hewett, unpublished observations. For analysis, 200 μl of sample was boiled (95–100 °C; 5 min) to inactivate enzymes that use NAD+ or NADH as cofactors, as they might otherwise interfere with this assay. Samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature following which 100 μl of a reaction mixture (see below) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 45 min while rocking. Next, 250 μl of each was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 490 nm was spectrophotometrically determined using an MRX microtiter plate reader (Thermolabs, Chantilly, VA). The glutamate concentration in the experimental medium was calculated via linear regression (Biolinx software) using known glutamate solutions as standards (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 μm). All standard solutions were treated identically to the samples as described above. To make the reaction mixture, solutions A, B, and C were combined in a 3:1:1 ratio, respectively, and then glutamate dehydrogenase (final concentration = 30 units/ml) was added. Solution A consisted of 5 mm K2HPO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 160 mm triethanolamine chloride in H2O (pH = 8.6). It was made up in advance and stored in an opaque bottle at 4 °C (stable for one year). Solution B, made fresh on the day of the assay, contained 30 mmNAD+ and 1.6 units/ml diaphorase in water. Solution C consisted of 1.2 mm p-INT in H2O, made in advance and stored in an opaque bottle at 4 °C (stable for three months). Culture plates were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (2 × 750 μl). Each culture well then received 75–100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm iodoacetamide). After 45 min of rocking, cells were harvested by scraping. The contents of three to six wells per treatment condition were combined and pelleted (10,000 × g; 5 min; 4 °C). The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined via the BCA assay (Pierce). Fifteen μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). VAMP-2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein; also known as synaptobrevin-2) was visualized using the WesternBreeze Detection System (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (39Vidwans A.S. Uliasz T.F. Hewett J.A. Hewett S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11533-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-VAMP-2 antibody (SYSY, Göttingen, Germany) was reconstituted per the manufacturer's guidelines and used at 1:2500. Murine mixed cortical cell cultures were incubated overnight with [3H]AA to allow for its incorporation into membrane phospholipids. Elevating the [K+]o from 5 to 52 mm resulted in a time-dependent increase in [3H]AA released into the extracellular medium that reached a plateau between 10 and 16 min (Fig.1). Thus, measurements of [3H]AA release were made 15 min following stimulation in all subsequent experiments. No significant change in the basal release of [3H]AA occurred when cultures were maintained in a non-depolarizing K+ buffer (5 mm) over the same time frame (Fig. 1). Stimulation of the cultures with buffers containing greater than 52 mm KCl did not lead to a further increase in AA accumulation, nor was the stimulated AA release a consequence of cell death/lysis (data not shown). Removal of [Ca2+]o prevented, whereas addition of CdCl2 (100 μm) to block VGCC diminished, the net K+-induced AA release (Fig.2 A), as did treatment of the cultures with tetanus toxin (300 ng/ml), a clostridium toxin that prevents synaptic vesicle exocytosis via cleavage of synaptobrevin-2 (40Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rossetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, treatment with tetanus toxin had no effect on the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]AA into their phospholipid stores, nor was basal [3H]AA release affected (data not shown). Further, these same treatments resulted in a parallel change in the amount of glutamate released upon K+ depolarization, suggesting that the exocytosis of glutamate that followed high [K+]o exposure might be the stimulus for [3H]AA release in these cells (Fig. 2, C andD). Neither basal glutamate nor non-stimulated [3H]AA release was significantly affected by removal of calcium or addition of CdCl2 (data not shown). To assess the involvement of glutamate in both high K+-stimulated AA release and Ca2+ entry, pharmacological inhibitors were employed. Ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists had no effect on either the basal (non-stimulated)45Ca2+ influx or [3H]AA release (Fig. 3). However, inclusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (10 μm) during high K+ stimulation virtually abolished Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3 A), whereas only partially preventing stimulated AA release (Fig. 3 B). This concentration of MK-801 was chosen as it completely prevented 45Ca2+ accumulation induced by exposure of the cultures to NMDA (100 μm for 15 min), indicating that all NMDA receptors were indeed fully blocked (data not shown). Addition of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (30 μm) had little effect alone with simultaneous application of both providing no greater inhibition than that observed with MK-801 alone (Fig. 3, A and B). The lack of effect of CNQX was not due to its inability to block AMPA/kainate receptors in our cultures because we demonstrated previously that 30 μm CNQX completely prevents the toxicity (≈ 80% neuronal cell death) associated with a 24-h exposure to either AMPA (20 μm) or kainate (75 μm) (36Trackey J. Uliasz T.F. Hewett S.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 41Uliasz T.F. Hewett S.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, addition of MCPG (0.3 or 1 mm), an antagonist of nonselective group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), with MK-801 and CNQX resulted in complete block of high K+-stimulated AA release (Fig. 4 A), although MCPG (1 mm) had no effect when used alone (Fig.4, inset). Competitive antagonism of mGluRs by MCPG has been confirmed by many groups (43Jane D.E. Jones P.L. Pook P.C. Salt T.E. Sunter D.C. Watkins J.C.

Sci. 1994; 15: 333-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Additionally, the concentrations used herein have no effect on AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated currents (46Watkins J. Collingridge G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 333-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), nor do they inhibit45Ca2+ accumulation or neuronal cell death induced by NMDA and kainate, respectively. 4T. F Uliasz and S. J. Hewett, unpublished observations. Thus, it is clear that synaptically released glutamate release is a necessary stimulus for AA liberation following treatment of cultures with high [K+]o. It is also sufficient. Exogenous addition of glutamate (100 μm) triggers AA release via a process dependent on both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor activation (Fig. 5). However, what is the cellular source? The synaptobrevin-2 contained in pure astrocyte cultures was not cleaved by an effective concentration of tetanus toxin (Fig. 6 A,lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the cleavage detected in Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4, and thus the glutamate released from mixed cultures was of neuronal origin. In addition, neither glutamate (100 μm) nor depolarizing K+ buffer (52 mm) stimulated release of [3H]AA from pure astrocyte cultures, leading to the conclusion that AA was liberated from neurons as well (Fig.6 B).Figure 6Astrocytes do not contribute to stimulated [3H] AA release. In A, astrocyte (lanes 1 and 2) or mixed cortical cell cultures (lanes 3 and 4) were incubated with (+) or without (−) tetanus toxin (300 ng/ml) overnight and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the total cellular protein was isolated. Fifteen μg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal antibody to synaptobrevin-2 (SB-2). Results are representative of two and five experiments from astrocyte and mixed cultures, respectively. In B, astrocyte cultures were labeled with [3H]AA, washed, and then stimulated with glutamate (100 μm) or depolarizing K+ buffer. After 15 min, samples of culture supernatants were collected, and the amount of radioactivity in each was estimated via liquid scintillation counting. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. total cpm released/well (n = 9 from three different experiments). There was no significant difference between conditions as determined by a one-way ANOVA. [K +]e, [K+]o.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Brain cells in situ contain low concentrations of free polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as AA, that are released following pathological insults. The goal of this study was to define the triggering mechanism responsible for the liberation of AA from cellular membranes with the specific intent of determining whether an increase in [K+]o, approximating that measured during cerebral ischemia and spreading depression, is a sufficient stimulus for free fatty acid release. The results obtained are the first to demonstrate that treatment of murine mixed cortical cultures with an iso-osmotic high K+ buffer can indeed elicit AA release from cortical neurons. Further, the data indicate that high K+-induced AA release occurs via a process dependent on extracellular Ca2+, synaptically released glutamate, and activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Fig. 7). The idea that high [K+]o might be a stimulus for AA release from neural tissue has been explored before with varying results. For instance, 50 mm [K+]owas found to be a sufficient stimulus for AA release from chick intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (47Clements M.P. Rose S.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and from various rat synaptosomal preparations (29Lazarewicz J.W. Leu V. Sun G.Y. Sun A.Y. Neurochem.

https://openalex.org/W2081650299,"In several cells and tissues the synthesis of HSP47, a collagen-specific molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum, is closely correlated with the synthesis of collagen. We previously reported that the Sp1 binding site at −210 bp in the promoter region and the first and second introns are required for the tissue-specific expression of HSP47 in transgenic mice (Hirata, H., Yamamura, I., Yasuda, K., Kobayashi, A., Tada, N., Suzuki, M., Hirayoshi, K., Hosokawa, N., and Nagata, K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 35703–35710). Here, we analyze how these introns influence the transcriptional regulation of the hsp47 gene in BALB/c 3T3 cells, which produce high levels of HSP47. In vitro promoter analysis using a luciferase reporter and gel mobility shift analysis revealed that two cis-acting elements in the first and second introns, BS5-B and EP7-D, respectively, are required for the activation of hsp47 in BALB/c 3T3 cells. Several members of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family of proteins were identified as BS5-B-binding proteins by yeast one-hybrid analysis using these elements as baits. One of these proteins, KLF-6/Zf9, binds to the BS5-B element and activates expression of the reporter construct when transfected into cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analysis revealed that the endogenous KLF-6/Zf9 binds the BS5-B elements that contain the CACCC motif, which is a consensus recognition sequence for other proteins in the KLF family. We also showed that BS5-B and EP7-D are bound by two members of the Sp1 family, Sp2 and Sp3. These results suggest that at least three sequences are required for the constitutive expression of hsp47 in BALB/c 3T3 cells: the −210 bp Sp1 binding site, the BS5-B element in the first intron, and the EP7-D element in the second intron. We suggest that KLF proteins regulate the transcription of hsp47 by binding the BS5-B element in cooperation with Sp2 and/or Sp3. In several cells and tissues the synthesis of HSP47, a collagen-specific molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum, is closely correlated with the synthesis of collagen. We previously reported that the Sp1 binding site at −210 bp in the promoter region and the first and second introns are required for the tissue-specific expression of HSP47 in transgenic mice (Hirata, H., Yamamura, I., Yasuda, K., Kobayashi, A., Tada, N., Suzuki, M., Hirayoshi, K., Hosokawa, N., and Nagata, K.

HSP47 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident stress-protein that transiently binds to newly synthesized procollagen.

Kudo H. Takechi H. Nakai A. Iwamatsu A. Yamada K.M. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4036-4044Google Scholar). HSP47 associates with procollagen during its assembly, folding, and/or post-translational modification in the ER and dissociates from it in the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) or in the cis-Golgi (2Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using synthetic model peptides of collagen have revealed that HSP47 preferentially binds to Gly-Xaa-Arg triplets in the procollagen triple helical region (3Koide T. Takahara Y. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6178-6182Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HSP47 plays a crucial role in collagen biosynthesis as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone; hsp47 null mice cannot synthesize collagen normally and cannot survive beyond the E11.5 stage of embryogenesis (4Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Google Scholar). These mice exhibit severe impairments in the processing of the collagen N- and C-propeptides and in type I procollagen triple helix formation, resulting in the absence of collagen fibrils in mesenchymal tissues and basement membranes that lie between the epithelial cell layer and the mesenchyme. All known ER-localized stress proteins in mammalian cells are induced by various ER stresses through the unfolded protein response pathway (5Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Google Scholar). HSP47 is the only heat shock protein that resides in the ER of mammalian cells that is induced by cytosolic stresses, including heat shock, but it is not induced by ER stress (6Chapman R. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Google Scholar). This induction depends on the presence of the heat shock element in thehsp47 promoter (7Hosokawa N. Takechi H. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 187-193Google Scholar). On the other hand, the constitutive expression of hsp47 appears to be co-regulated with that of several types of collagens. For example, during the differentiation of mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells the rates of synthesis of HSP47 and type IV collagen coordinately increase (8Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nakai A. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 323-329Google Scholar), and following the malignant transformation of fibroblasts the rates of synthesis of the two proteins, HSP47 and type I collagen, decrease (9Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Google Scholar). Collagen nonproducing cells such as mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells do not synthesize HSP47. The spatiotemporally concerted expression of HSP47 with collagens is also observed during mouse and chick embryonic development (10Masuda H. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 256-264Google Scholar). In addition, a marked induction of HSP47 has been reported in the progression of fibrosis in various experimental fibrosis models, including liver cirrhosis (11Masuda H. Fukumoto M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2481-2488Google Scholar), kidney fibrosis (12Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Iehara N. Takeoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 133-140Google Scholar), and atherosclerosis (13Murakami S. Toda Y. Seki T. Munetomo E. Kondo Y. Sakurai T. Furukawa Y. Matsuyama M. Nagate T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 157: 361-368Google Scholar). The down-regulation of hsp47 caused by introducing hsp47 antisense oligoribonucleotides into rat renal cells after the initiation of fibrosis markedly reduces the rate of the progression of fibrosis and reduces the levels of types I and III collagens in the kidney (14Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Tsuji H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 967-972Google Scholar). In a previous paper (15Hirata H. Yamamura I. Yasuda K. Kobayashi A. Tada N. Suzuki M. Hirayoshi K. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35703-35710Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both the 280-bp promoter region and the first and second introns are required for the tissue-specific expression of HSP47 in transgenic mice harboring a β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of these elements.In vitro promoter analysis using a luciferase reporter gene revealed that the Sp1 binding site at −210 bp is necessary for the basal expression of hsp47, and the addition of a downstream intron region caused a marked up-regulation of reporter activity in HSP47- and collagen-producing cells but not in nonproducing cells. In this paper, we have further analyzed the cis-acting elements in the intron regions that are responsible for the activation ofhsp47 expression, and we identify two such elements in the first and second introns. We also used a yeast one-hybrid assay, gel mobility shift analysis, and CHIP analysis to identify the transcription factors that bind these elements. In addition to the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) proteins, which were identified in the yeast one-hybrid screen, we found that the Sp1 family proteins Sp2 and Sp3 are also involved in the regulation of hsp47 expression. Among the KLF proteins, we further focused on the KLF-6/Zf9 protein in the activation of hsp47, as shown by gel mobility shift analysis and reporter analysis of cells transfected with Zf9 cDNA. Murine BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with low glucose) (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. DNA was transfected into BALB/c 3T3 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BALB/c 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells in 35-mm culture dishes 16 h before transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured by using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid pact-β-galactosidase, which bears the chicken β-actin promoter upstream of lacZ, was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (15Hirata H. Yamamura I. Yasuda K. Kobayashi A. Tada N. Suzuki M. Hirayoshi K. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35703-35710Google Scholar). To make the BS-5 and BS5-B mutant constructs, which have deletions within the first intron of the hsp47gene, two sets of primers were designed. For the BS-5 deletion (pLucΔBS-5), HSP47/BS-S (5′-TGGCCGGACTTGACCAATTA-3′) and dBS5-S (5′-CGGAATTCACCAAAGCCCCCAGTTTTCC-3′) were used to amplify the 5′ end of the fragment. Primers HSP47/BS-AS (5′-CACTTGGTGGGGTCTAAAGA-3′) and dBS5-AS/2 (5′-CGGAATTCCGAGGTGTTTTTGTAGTGGG-3′) were used to amplify the 3′ end of the fragment. The two PCR products were ligated intoBstX1-SfiI-digested pLuc280(III). Primers dBS5B-S (5′-CGGAATTCCCTTACTTCCAGGCAACCAA-3′) and dBS5B-AS (5′-CGGAATTCTGTACCCATCCCCCATTTCC-3′) were used instead of dBS5-S and dBS5-AS/2 to construct pLucΔBS5-B. Site-directed mutagenesis of pLuc280(III) was performed using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers used for making the pLucBS5B/mt1–mt10 series are listed in Table I.

The amplified 1.0-kb fragment was subcloned into pT7blueT-Vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to make pT7/Zf9. To construct the GST-tagged Zf9 expression plasmid pGST/Zf9, the XhoI-BamHI fragment of pT7/Zf9 was cloned intoXhoI-BamHI-digested pGEX-5 (AmershamBiosciences). pCAG/Zf9, a plasmid that allows expression of Zf9 in mammalian cells, was constructed by subcloning theSphI-EcoRI fragment of pT7/Zf9 into the expression vector pCAGGS/2. pCAGGS/2 was constructed by the insertion of a multicloning site containing SacI, KpnI,SmaI, BclI, EcoRV, NheI,BstBI, NsiI, and SphI into pCAGGS at the EcoRI site. Nuclear extracts from BALB/c 3T3 cells were prepared by the method as described in Ref. 16Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar. Briefly, BALB/c 3T3 cells were washed twice with TBS and then harvested in TBS with a cell scraper. The cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rocked on ice for 15 min. The nuclear extracts were recovered by centrifugation. GST-tagged Zf9 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified with glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (17Asada S. Koide T. Yasui H. Nagata K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 187-196Google Scholar). The concentration of the GST fusion proteins eluted from the glutathione beads was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining with known amounts of bovine serum albumin as a standard. The DNA probes BS-1 to 9 and EP-1 to 7 were prepared by PCR with specific primers (Table II). The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes BS5-A to E and EP7-A to G are indicated in Table III. All probes were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA).Table IIPrimers for PCR to make probes of EMSA experimentsProbe DNA5′ Primer3′ PrimerBS-15′-AACTGCAGCTGGTTCCTGCAGGGCGA-3′5′-CAGGGAATGGATGCCTTC-3′BS-25′-GGGGACATTCCTGAGCCT-3′5′-AGGGCCCAGAAGGAAGCA-3′BS-35′-TATGGTCTAACGGCCTAG-3′5′-ACCAAAGCCCCCAGTTTT-3′BS-45′-TTGGCATCCAGGGCACGC-3′5′-GTACAGAACTATCAGAGA-3′BS-55′-TGCCTGGAAGTAAGGCCG-3′5′-GCAGGGAATCCTCGGAGA-3′BS-65′-CCATCCCCCATTTCCGTC-3′5′-TGACCACTGTGGAGTCCT-3′BS-75′-CGAGGTGTTTTTGTAGTG-3′5′-AGCAGGTCAGGCTTTCTC-3′BS-85′-GCCTGGGAGCTTTGCTGA-3′5′-GCTTTTGCAGAGGCAGAA-3′BS-95′-TGAGCCGAAGAAGGCCCA-3′5′-CCACTAGTGTCGGGCCCAGTCCCCAG-3′EP-15′-AACTGCAGGGCTCTGTGATATCTTAT-3′5′-CATTCTGCAACAGGCAAG-3′EP-25′-GGCTGGCGTTTCCCTGTG-3′5′-CACCCCGTTAAGCCCAGC-3′EP-35′-GGCTGCGGGAGGTTGGCT-3′5′-GTTTTACAACTGTGCCTC-3′EP-45′-GCCCTTCTCCCCAGCCCT-3′5′-CCTGGCTTGGGAACCTGG-3′EP-55′-GAGGCACAGTTGTAAAAC-3′5′-GACGTGGCAGACAAAAGC-3′EP-65′-GCTCCAGGTTCTTACCCT-3′5′-TCTCCAAAAAGCTCCAAA-3′EP-75′-ACCAGGGGCCTTGCGGCT-3′5′-CCACTAGTGTGGCACCCACCATCTTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Table IIIOligonucleotides used in EMSA experimentsProbe DNABS5-A5′-TGCCTGGAAGTAAGGCCGAGGCCACACCCT-3′BS5-B5′-CCGAGGCCACACCCTACTCTCTGATAGTTC-3′BS5-C5′-ACTCTCTGATAGTTCTGTACCCATCCCCCATTTCC-3′BS5-D5′-TGTACCCATCCCCCATTTCCGTCTGGTCCTTTGTC-3′BS5-E5′-GTCTGGTCCTTTGTCTCTCTCCGAGGATTCCCTGC-3′EP7-A5′-ACCAGGGGCCTTGCGGCTGCCAGAGGAATC-3′EP7-B5′-GCTGCCAGAGGAATCCCTAACTAGTCATTT-3′EP7-C5′-CCTAACTAGTCATTTGGAGCTTTTTGGAGA-3′EP7-D5′-GGAGCTTTTTGGAGAAGCCCCTCCCAGCCC-3′EP7-E5′-AGCCCCTCCCAGCCCCTGGTTGGCTGAGCG-3′EP7-F5′-CTGGTTGGCTGAGCGTGGGGGCTGTCAAGA-3′EP7-G5′-TGGGGGCTGTCAAGATGGTGGGTGCCACGTG-3′ Open table in a new tab EMSA were performed in a 10-μl final volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 12% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction was carried out with 10 μg of nuclear extract and ∼1 pmol of32P-labeled probe at room temperature for 30 min. Unlabeled probes or antibodies were added to the reaction mixture 30 min before the addition of 32P-labeled probes. Probes bound to proteins were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE at 250 V for 2.0 h. One-hybrid screening was carried out essentially as described (18Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Google Scholar, 19Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Google Scholar). Four repeats of the BS5-B sequence from the hsp47 first intron or the EP7-D sequence from the second intron were cloned into the BglII site of pEHEL2 (19Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Google Scholar); these plasmids were designated as pEHEL/BS5-B and pEHEL/EP7-D, respectively. Plasmids were linearized by digestion withNcoI and integrated into the his3−yeast strain KMY1015 (18Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Google Scholar). The resulting yeast strains were transformed with a multicopy plasmid DNA library containing mouse 11-day-old embryo cDNAs fused to the transcription activation domain of Gal4p (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transformants were plated on medium lacking histidine and containing 1 mm3-aminotriazole. After 4 days culture at 30 °C, His+ colonies were inoculated into liquid medium, and plasmid DNA was extracted. Following re-amplification in E. coli, the nucleotide sequence of each clone was determined. Nuclear extracts from BALB/c 3T3 cells were prepared by the same procedure as for EMSA. The biotinylated DNA probes BS5-B and EP7-D were made by PCR with a 5′-biotinylated primer. Probe (1 μg) was added to nuclear extracts (100 μg) containing poly(dI-dC) (15 μg) and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Streptavidin-Dynabeads (Dynal, Great Neck, NY) were added with mixing by rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The Dynabeads were collected with a magnet and washed twice with buffer. The trapped protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-Zf9 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BALB/c 3T3 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and sonicated three times for 10 s. Cell lysates were collected by centrifugation. An aliquot of the lysate (10 μl) was reserved as a control for amplification by PCR. The remainder was incubated overnight at 4 °C in CHIP dilution buffer containing protease inhibitors with 5 μl of anti-Sp2, -Sp3, and -Zf9 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA and a protein A-agarose bead suspension, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed for 5 min each with 1 ml of low and high salt buffer, then with 1 mm EDTA, Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing LiCl and finally with TE buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by incubation with 1% SDS plus 100 mm NaHCO3. After the addition of NaCl, the eluates were heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-linking of DNA by formaldehyde. DNA was recovered by proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of TE. Quantitative PCR was carried out for 35 cycles using 5 μl of sample DNA. PCR products were separated on 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE at 120 V for 1.0 h. In a previous study, Hirata et al.(15Hirata H. Yamamura I. Yasuda K. Kobayashi A. Tada N. Suzuki M. Hirayoshi K. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35703-35710Google Scholar) reported that a 280-bp region of the promoter upstream of the transcriptional start site is necessary for basal level expression ofhsp47 in murine cells. However, the cell type-specific expression of hsp47 could not be attributed to this promoter region alone. Hirata et al. (15Hirata H. Yamamura I. Yasuda K. Kobayashi A. Tada N. Suzuki M. Hirayoshi K. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35703-35710Google Scholar) also showed that the first two introns, located upstream of the translation initiation site, are necessary in addition to the 280-bp promoter region for the tissue-specific expression of hsp47. Considering these previous results, we made systematic deletion constructs fused to the luciferase gene to identify the cis-acting element(s) in the first and the second introns that are responsible for the constitutive expression of hsp47. Luciferase reporter analysis was performed after transfecting these deletion constructs into BALB/c 3T3 cells; the results of these experiments are shown in Fig.1. As reported previously, full activity was observed for the pLuc280(III) construct, which contains the first and second introns in addition to the 280-bp promoter region, upon transfection into BALB/c 3T3 cells, whereas modest luciferase activity was observed for a pLuc280 construct without introns (Fig. 1). pLuc280(III) derivatives with 500- and 480-bp deletions of the first and second introns (pLucΔBS and pLucΔEPm, respectively) had levels of luciferase activity that were half that of pLuc280(III), if the activity of pLuc280 is considered as the basal level of activity. When both regions were simultaneously deleted, the activity of the resulting construct (pLucΔPsPm) was equivalent to the basal activity of pLuc280. From the observation that the activity of pLucΔSE was the same as that of pLuc280(III), we conclude that the 500-bp sequence (BS-500) in the first intron and the 480-bp sequence (EPm-480) in the second intron are necessary for the activation ofhsp47 transcription in BALB/c 3T3 cells. To further analyze the cis-acting elements in the first and the second introns that are responsible for hsp47expression, we carried out gel mobility shift analysis (EMSA) using overlapping PCR-amplified fragments that collectively cover the two introns (Fig. 2 A). Incubation of [32P]phosphate-labeled probes with BALB/c 3T3 nuclear extracts produced bands of reduced mobility as seen by EMSA (Fig. 2,B and C). The specificity of the alterations in band mobility was tested by the addition of an excess of unlabeled probe. Among the fragments of reduced mobility, two bands that were produced by the incubation of extracts with the BS-5 probe were of the same size as two bands produced by incubation with the EP-7 probe (Fig.2, B, lane 10, and C, lane 14, indicated by arrows). In addition, the two BS-5-specific bands disappeared when not only unlabeled BS-5 but also unlabeled EP-7 probes were added as competitors (Fig. 2 D, indicated by arrows). The similar EP-7-specific bands were also lost when either EP-7 or BS-5 was added as a competitor. No other competitor fragment (BS-1 to BS-9 and EP-1 to EP-7) had this effect (data not shown). To further define the cis-acting elements in the region covered by the BS-5 (100 bp) and EP-7 (120 bp) probes that are responsible for hsp47 expression in BALB/c 3T3 cells, a series of 30-bp probes that collectively covers the BS-5 and EP-7 regions was synthesized as shown in Fig.3 A for use in EMSA. Fig.3 B clearly shows that incubation of nuclear extracts with both the BS5-B and EP7-D probes results in the formation of similar DNA-protein complexes (lanes 2 and 9,arrows). Interestingly, these bands could be eliminated by the presence of either of the unlabeled oligonucleotides; the band shift observed for the 32P-labeled BS5-B probe could be suppressed by the presence of an excess of the unlabeled BS5-B as well as of the EP7-D probes (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and4). The bands that were produced by incubation of extracts with EP7-D also did not appear in the presence of unlabeled BS5-B (lane 7). Other competitors, including BS5-C and EP7-E, did not interfere with band mobility (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3, 5, 8, and 10). These results indicate that BS5-B and EP7-D share an element(s) that is recognized by the same transcription factor(s). To identify the core cis-acting elements that activatehsp47 expression in BALB/c 3T3 cells, we systematically introduced 4-bp mutations into the BS5-B and EP7-D DNA fragments as shown in Fig. 4 A and performed EMSA using 32P-labeled BS5-B and EP7-D probes in the presence of an excess of each mutated construct as a competitor (Fig.4 B). For the 32P-labeled BS5-B probe, the two mobility shifted bands depicted by arrows disappeared when the unlabeled competitors BS5-B/mt-4, mt-5, and mt-6 were present, indicating that the mutated sites are not necessary for transcription factor binding. In contrast, these shifts in mobility were not affected by the presence of the competitors BS5-B/mt-1, mt-2, and mt-3. These results indicate that a 12-bp sequence (GAGGCCACACCC, Fig.4 A) in the BS5-B element is necessary for transcription factor binding. Similar experiments were performed with mutated EP7-D constructs (Fig. 4 B). For EP7-D, the presence of the competitors EP7-D/mt-2 and mt-6 caused the mobility shifted bands indicated by arrows to disappear (Fig. 4 B,lanes 10 and 14). However, the mutant probes EP7-D/mt-1, mt-3, mt-4, and mt-5 had no effect on the mobility of the shifted bands. Thus, a 10-bp sequence (GCCCCTCCCA) in the EP7-D element was identified as necessary for transcription factor binding. Interestingly, the 12-bp sequence in the BS5-B element and the 10-bp sequence in the EP7-D element are similar and can be characterized as GC-rich, as shown in Fig. 4 C. It is noteworthy that the band indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 4 B disappeared when the competitor BS5-B/mt-1 was present (lane 2), suggesting that this DNA-protein complex contains a protein different from that in the complexes indicated by the arrows and that this protein binds to the CCACACCC motif of the 12-bp sequence in the BS5-B element (see below). To verify that these two elements, which we assume are core sequences for transcription factor(s) binding, are also necessary for the transcriptional activation of hsp47 in BALB/c 3T3 cells, we performed luciferase reporter assays by transfecting a series of reporter gene constructs with 2-bp mutations in the BS5-B element (Fig.5). The pLucΔBS, pLucΔBS-5, and pLucΔBS5-B deletion constructs showed reduced luciferase activities as compared with pLuc280(III). This result suggested that the BS5-B 30-bp region is necessary for the full activation of the reporter gene. The mutant constructs pLucBS5-B/mt-3 to mt-8 exhibited reductions in luciferase activities similar to those of pLucΔBS, pLucΔBS-5, and pLucΔBS5-B. Other reporter constructs, including pLucBS5-B/mt-1, mt-2, mt-9, and mt-10 showed luciferase activities comparable with that of pLuc280(III). Thus, the 12-bp sequence (GAGGCCACACCC) is a core element necessary for the activation of the reporter gene in BALB/c 3T3 cells in combination with the 280-bp promoter region. This core sequence is the same as that identified by EMSA (Fig. 4). By a similar analysis of luciferase reporter constructs with systematic mutations in the EP7-D region, we also confirmed that the 10-bp sequence identified by EMSA is necessary for transcriptional activation of the reporter gene in BALB/c 3T3 cells (data not shown). To identify the transcription factors that bind to the core sequences (the 12-bp sequence in the BS5-B fragment and the 10-bp sequence in the EP7-D fragment) and activate hsp47expression, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screen using constructs containing a quadruplication of the BS5-B or EP7-D core sequences as baits. We screened a total of 1.2 × 107 independent clones from an 11-day embryonic mouse cDNA library and obtained 23 positive clones when the BS5-B repeat was used as the bait (TableIV). No positive clones were obtained from 1.0 × 107 independent clones screened from the same cDNA library when the EP7-D repeat was used as the bait. Sequencing of all the positive clones identified as interacting with the BS5-B repeat revealed that they encoded several members of the KLF family, KLF-6 (Zf9/CPBP), KLF-1 (EKLF), KLF-3 (BKLF), and KLF-4 (GKLF) in the order of the numbers of positive clones obtained (Table IV).Table IVKLF proteins obtained by one-hybrid screeningcis-ElementCloneNumber of clonesBS5-B × 4 repeatsKLF-6 (CPBP/zf-9)8KLF-1 (EKLF)6KLF-3 (BKLF)6KLF-4 (GKLF)3EP7-D × 4 repeatsNoneNoneKLF family/consensus sequence :CACCC‖‖‖‖‖BS5-B: TAAGGCCG"
https://openalex.org/W2120530202,"Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in GMP biosynthesis. The resulting intracellular pool of guanine nucleotides is of great importance to all cells for use in DNA and RNA synthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction. The enzyme binds IMP and the cofactor NAD+ in random order, IMP is converted to XMP, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, and finally, NADH and then XMP are released sequentially. XMP is subsequently converted into GMP by GMP synthetase. Drugs that decrease GMP synthesis by inhibiting IMPDH have been shown to have antiproliferative as well as antiviral activity. Several drugs are in use that target the substrate- or cofactor-binding site; however, due to differences between the mammalian and microbial isoforms, most drugs are far less effective against the microbial form of the enzyme than the mammalian form. The high resolution crystal structures of the protozoan parasiteTritrichomonas foetus IMPDH complexed with the inhibitor ribavirin monophosphate as well as monophosphate together with a second inhibitor, mycophenolic acid, are presented here. These structures reveal an active site cation identified previously only in the Chinese hamster IMPDH structure with covalently bound IMP. This cation was not found previously in apo IMPDH, IMPDH in complex with XMP, or covalently bound inhibitor, indicating that the cation-binding site may be catalysis-dependent. A comparison of T. foetus IMPDH with the Chinese hamster andStreptococcus pyogenes structures reveals differences in the active site loop architecture, which contributes to differences in cation binding during the catalytic sequence and the kinetic rates between bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian enzymes. Exploitation of these differences may lead to novel inhibitors, which favor the microbial form of the enzyme."

Plasma SHBG is produced by hepatocytes, but the human SHBG gene is also expressed in the testis. Little is known about SHBG gene expression in the human testis, but human SHBG transcripts accumulate in a spermatogenic stage-dependent manner in the testes of mice containing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene. We have now found that human SHBG transcripts containing an alternative exon 1 sequence are located specifically in the testicular germ cells of these transgenic mice, whereas murine SHBG transcripts are confined to Sertoli cells. In addition, we have detected immunoreactive human SHBG in the acrosome during all stages of spermiogenesis in mice containing an 11-kb human SHBGtransgene. Western blots of germ cell extracts from these transgenic mice and from human sperm indicate that the immunoreactive human SHBG in the acrosome composes electrophoretic variants, which are 3–5 kDa smaller than the major electrophoretic isoforms of human SHBG in the blood. This apparent size difference is due in part to differences in glycosylation of plasma and acrosomal SHBG isoforms.

In humans, the transcription unit responsible for the production of plasma SHBG by hepatocytes consists of eight exons that span ∼3.2 kb on chromosome 17 (1, 3) and is under the control of a promoter sequence that contains several well defined binding sites for liver-enriched transcription factors (4Jänne M.

The human SHBG gene contains a second transcription unit that consists of an alternative exon 1 sequence that replaces the exon 1 sequence present in the SHBG mRNA found in the liver. As a consequence, these differentially spliced SHBG transcripts lack the secretion signal sequence associated with the plasma SHBG precursor polypeptide.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 349-355Google Scholar) and encodes the SHBG homologue that is generally known as the testicular androgen-binding protein (ABP). The ABP produced by rat Sertoli cells is secreted into the lumen of seminiferous tubules where it is thought to serve primarily as a carrier of testosterone throughout the male reproductive tract (2Joseph D.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 197-280Google Scholar). Although SHBG transcripts are present in the human testis (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar), virtually nothing is known about their function or how they are regulated, and evidence that they encode a precursor polypeptide containing a leader sequence for secretion is lacking. In fact, all the available evidence suggests that the human testis contains several alternative SHBG transcripts comprising a non-coding alternative exon 1 sequence and some of them also lack exon 7 sequences (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar, 8Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9245-9258Google Scholar). Differentially spliced humanSHBG transcripts lacking exon 7 sequences have also been identified in several other tissues (9Misao R. Nakanishi Y. Fujimoto J. Tamaya T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5579-5583Google Scholar, 10Misao R. Nakanishi Y. Fujimoto J. Tamaya T. Fertil. Steril. 1998; 69: 324-328Google Scholar), but their 5′-sequences have not been characterized. Like the human SHBG gene, the rat SHBG gene produces transcripts that consist of alternative exon 1 sequences, and these have been identified in the rat brain (11Wang Y.-M. Bayliss D.A. Millhorn D.E. Petrusz P. Joseph D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3124-3130Google Scholar) and the fetal rat liver (12Sullivan P.M. Wang Y.-M. Joseph D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 702-715Google Scholar). There is no obvious sequence similarity between the alternative exon 1 sequences associated with various SHBG transcripts in different species, but there is evidence they encode SHBG isoforms comprising subcellular localization signals within a unique amino-terminal sequence (13Joseph D.R. Becchis M. Fenstermacher D.A. Petrusz P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1138-1143Google Scholar). To study the tissue-specific expression of various humanSHBG transcripts, we have produced several lines of transgenic mice (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar) containing either a 4- or an 11-kb humanSHBG transgene. The 4-kb transgene consists of the eight exons encoding plasma SHBG (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar) and 0.9 kb of 5′-flanking DNA that includes the promoter utilized in the liver (4Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Google Scholar), whereas the 11-kb human SHBG transgene contains an additional 5′-flanking DNA sequence that includes an alternative exon 1 sequence associated with the SHBG transcripts present in the human testis (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar, 8Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9245-9258Google Scholar). We have shown previously that only the 11-kb human SHBGtransgene is expressed in the mouse testis, as evidenced by the presence of human SHBG transcripts in the seminiferous epithelium (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar). These studies also indicated that the humanSHBG transcripts accumulate in a spermatogenic cycle stage-dependent manner in this location, but the cell type in which they were located could not be clearly identified, and their protein products eluded detection (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar). We have therefore re-examined this issue, and we have found that the majority of humanSHBG transcripts in the testis of these mice consist of the alternative exon 1 sequence associated with SHBG cDNAs from a human testis library (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar). Furthermore, these alternatively spliced humanSHBG transcripts are confined to testicular germ cells and an immunoreactive human SHBG isoform accumulates in the acrosome of developing spermatids and immature sperm in the transgenic mice. We have also obtained direct evidence that this acrosomal SHBG isoform binds steroids and is also present in human sperm. Transgenic mice containing 11-kb (linesshbg 11-a and shbg 11-b) or 4-kb (linesshbg 4-a and shbg 4-b) regions of humanSHBG gene have been characterized previously (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar, 15Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Google Scholar). Animals were housed under standard conditions and provided with food and water ad libitum. At ∼10 weeks of age, mice were sacrificed for the isolation of Sertoli cells and/or germ cells for protein and RNA analysis (see below). For immunohistochemistry, mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Animal Use Subcommittee of the University Council on Animal Care (University of Western Ontario, Canada). The anti-human SHBG antibodies for immunohistochemistry were purified from a rabbit antiserum by immunoaffinity chromatography using anN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HiTrap column coupled to purified human SHBG (16Avvakumov G.V. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25920-25925Google Scholar), according to instructions provided byAmersham Biosciences. Testes from perfused mice (see above) were further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h, subsequently dehydrated with a series of ethanol solutions, and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin sections were de-waxed and incubated at high power in a microwave oven for 10 min in citrate buffer, pH 9.9. The sections were then cooled at room temperature for 20 min and treated with a 0.03% hydrogen peroxide solution for 7 min, prior to incubation (overnight at 4 °C) with affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against human SHBG. The immunoreactive human SHBG was detected using the EnVisionTM + System, HRP (DAB) from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). Sperm from transgenic mice (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar) were spread on slides, fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed with PBS. After incubation in citrate buffer, pH 9.9, for 30 min at room temperature, the sections were treated with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide solution for 7 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the affinity-purified antibodies against human SHBG overnight at 4 °C, and immunoreactivity was detected using the EnVisionTM + System (DAKO). A mixed population of Sertoli cells and germ cells was isolated from the testes of wild-type and transgenic mice (17Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.-H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Google Scholar). Briefly, the testes were excised and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NUT mix F-12 culture medium (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (17Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.-H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Google Scholar). The testes were then de-capsulated and incubated in a collagenase solution (0.9 mg/ml) at 33 °C for 10 min with agitation. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of the same culture medium and allowed to sediment for 15 min. This was repeated three times. A second incubation with collagenase (0.9 mg/ml) was then performed at 33 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed twice with PBS and frozen for RNA and protein extraction (see below). Germ cells were isolated separately from the mouse testes using an established method (17Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.-H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Google Scholar). Briefly, testes were excised and washed with PBS supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin (17Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.-H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Google Scholar), de-capsulated, and minced for 5 min in the PBS solution. The medium was removed, and the remaining testicular fragments were digested in PBS containing trypsin (80 mg/ml) at 33 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and the resulting solution was treated with deoxyribonuclease I (0.4 mg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min. The isolated tubules were subjected to several rounds of mincing and filtration, as described previously (17Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.-H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Google Scholar, 18Selva D.M. Tirado O.M. Toràn N. Suárez-Quian C.A. Reventós J. Munell F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1168-1177Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NUT mix F-12 culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated in a tissue culture flask for 5 h. The supernatant containing germ cells without Sertoli cells was recovered and centrifuged. After two washes with PBS, the pellet was frozen in aliquots for protein or RNA extraction. Soluble protein was extracted from mixed populations of Sertoli cells and germ cells and from isolated germ cells (see above) with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS at 4 °C for 12 h. Human donor sperm samples were centrifuged (350 × g for 10 min) to fractionate seminal plasma and sperm, and sperm samples were either washed in HTF culture medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) or purified by Percoll® density gradient centrifugation prior to extraction with 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, by sonication in a water bath and three freeze-thaw cycles. Samples were heat-denatured in loading buffer and subjected to discontinuous SDS-PAGE with 4 and 10% polyacrylamide in the stacking and resolving gels, respectively. Proteins in the gel were transferred (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were first blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk and were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against human SHBG (DAKO; kindly provided by Dr. Francina Munell) in the same buffer. The blots were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 for 15 min to remove excess antibody, and specific antibody-antigen complexes were identified using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) by exposure to x-ray film. To assess the influence of glycosylation on the electrophoretic mobility of immunoreactive human SHBG in different samples (i.e. diluted serum and protein extracts from isolated testicular cells), we performed a similar Western blotting experiment. For this purpose, protein was extracted from isolated testicular cells with 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, by sonication in a water bath and three freeze-thaw cycles, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Samples were then treated withN-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) at 37 °C overnight, as recommended by the enzyme supplier, prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described above. Total RNA was extracted from mouse testicular cells and liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde, and transfered to a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized with various 32P-labeled human SHBG cDNAs, i.e. the 3′ EcoRI fragment spanning exons 6–8 (20Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Harley M.J. Musto N.A. Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 100-104Google Scholar), the SHBG exon 1 sequence encoding the leader sequence for secretion of SHBG, and the SHBGalternative exon 1 sequence (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar). In addition, cDNAs for mouse vimentin and transition protein 1 were used as markers for somatic cells and germ cells, respectively. In some experiments, a mouse SHBG cDNA corresponding to exon 6–8 sequences was used as a probe, and a cDNA for 18 S ribosomal RNA was also used as an additional control for RNA loading and transfer (15Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Google Scholar). We also used the total RNA from isolated germ cells to further analyze the human SHBG transcripts. To accomplish this, reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 42 °C for 50 min using 3 μg of total RNA and 200 units of Superscript II together with an oligo(dT) primer and reagents provided by Invitrogen. An aliquot (1 μl) of the RT product was amplified in a 20-μl reaction in the presence of 1 unit of Taq polymerase, 0.05 mmMgCl2, 1.25 μm of each dNTP, and 0.2 μm of each oligonucleotide primer. For this purpose, we used an oligonucleotide corresponding to a 5′-sequence (5′-GCGGTTCAAAGGCTCCC) in the SHBG alternative exon 1 and a reverse primer complementary to a sequence (5′-TGGCTTCTGTTCAGGGCC) within exon 8 of the human SHBG gene (1Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Google Scholar). The PCR was performed for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 min, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. A mouse transition protein 1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR under the same conditions using as two specific primers (5′-CCAGCCGCAAGCTAAAGACTCATGC and 5′-AGCTCATTGCCGCATCACAAGTGGG) to control for the integrity and relative amounts of germ cell mRNA in the samples. The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and purified using the GenElute Gel Extraction kit (Sigma). They were then cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen), and plasmids containing PCR products were sequenced. To determine whether the immunoreactive SHBG extracted from testicular cells binds steroids, we used a saturation ligand binding assay (23Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II. Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-301Google Scholar). In this assay, the endogenous steroids were first removed from protein extracts (25 μg/μl) by dilution (1:3) in a dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) suspension and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation to remove the DCC, aliquots of the supernatants were further diluted (1:3) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 10 nm 5α-[3H]dihydrotestosterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by an additional incubation (30 min) at 0 °C. Nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of excess unlabeled 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Free ligand was removed by incubation (10 min) with an ice-cold DCC suspension, and following separation of the DCC by centrifugation, the supernatant containing SHBG-bound ligand was taken for radioactivity measurements (21Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Google Scholar). A similar protocol was used to determine the steroid-binding properties of the immunoreactive SHBG extracted from the acrosome and involved a Scatchard plot (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar) to determine the affinity constant and a competitive binding assay to determine steroid-binding specificity, as described previously (21Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Google Scholar). A single Northern blot was used to measure the relative abundance of human SHBG transcripts in mixed populations of Sertoli cells and germ cells, as well as a pure population of germ cells isolated from the testes of wild-type mice and mice containing 4- or 11-kb human SHBG transgenes (Fig.1). When a human SHBG cDNA that recognizes exon 6–8 sequences was used as probe, human SHBGtranscripts were only detected in RNA extracts of testicular cells from mice containing the 11-kb human SHBG transgene. The use of mouse vimentin (a marker of somatic cells) and transition protein 1 (a germ cell specific marker) cDNAs allowed us to demonstrate the purity of the germ cells isolated from the testes of transgenic mice (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). These data indicate that similar numbers of germ cells were present in all samples, as evidenced by the presence of similar amounts of transition protein 1 mRNA. Therefore, because the relative abundance of human SHBGtranscripts in the germ cell-only preparation was similar to that in the mixed population of Sertoli cells and germ cells, this suggested that the SHBG transcripts in the testis of 11-kb humanSHBG transgenic mice cannot be derived from Sertoli cells. To characterize further the human SHBG transcripts that accumulate in testicular germ cells, a Northern blot of total RNA extracts of germ cells, isolated from transgenic mice containing either the 4- or 11-kb human SHBG transgenes, was performed using exon 1- and alternative exon 1-specific cDNA probes. As a control, we also included a similar amount of total RNA from an 11-kb humanSHBG transgenic mouse liver (Fig.2). When comparing the ratios of signals obtained using these exon 1-specific cDNAs with those obtained using a cDNA corresponding to human SHBG exon 6–8 sequences (Fig. 2), it is again apparent that SHBGtranscripts are only present in germ cells from the 11-kb humanSHBG transgenic mice. As expected, the SHBGtranscript in the liver RNA sample comprises predominantly the exon 1 sequence containing the translation initiation codon for the SHBG precursor polypeptide and the leader sequence for secretion. By contrast, the SHBG transcript in the germ cells from mice containing the 11-kb human SHBG transgene can only be detected using the cDNAs that recognize the alternative exon 1 sequence and sequences corresponding to exons 6–8. The human alternative SHBG transcripts were also analyzed in germ cells from transgenic mice by an RT-PCR with specific primers for human SHBG alternative exon 1 and human SHBGexon 8, and mouse transition protein 1-specific primers were again used in an RT-PCR as a positive control for the presence of intact mRNA species. Human SHBG transcripts were detected only in the germs cells of the 11-kb human SHBG transgenic mice, whereas mouse transition protein 1 was amplified in all samples including those from 4-kb human SHBG transgenic mice and wild-type mice (Fig. 3). When the two differently sized RT-PCR products amplified using human SHBG-specific primers were cloned and sequenced, the ∼1.1-kb RT-PCR product (Fig. 3) was found to contain the alternative exon 1 sequence followed by the sequences of exons 2–8, whereas the smaller and less abundant RT-PCR product (∼0.9 kb) contained the alternative exon 1 sequence followed by the sequences of exons 2–6 and 8. Expression of the endogenous mouse SHBG gene was examined in the testicular cell preparations from wild-type mice by Northern blotting, and mouse vimentin and transition protein 1 cDNAs were again used to monitor for the presence of somatic cells and germ cells, respectively (Fig. 4). When we used a cDNA corresponding to mouse SHBG exon 6–8 sequences, murine SHBG transcripts were only detected in the mixed population of Sertoli cells and germ cells. Although similar levels of transition protein 1 mRNA levels were detected in the two different isolated testicular cell preparations, murine SHBG transcripts could not be detected in the purified germ cells (Fig. 4). These data therefore indicate that the mouse SHBG gene is expressed in Sertoli cells rather than in germ cells. The immunoaffinity-purified rabbit antibodies against human SHBG do not detect antigens in the testes of wild-type mice, and this illustrates the specificity of the immunoreactivity observed at low power magnification (10×) in the sections of testes from transgenic mice containing the 4- or 11-kb human SHBGtransgenes (Fig. 5 A). In these sections, similar amounts of immunoreactive human SHBG are present in the interstitial compartment of both transgenic mouse lines, irrespective of the size of the human SHBG transgene. Because we have been unable to detect any human SHBG transcripts in the testes of mice containing the 4-kb human SHBG transgene, and because the plasma levels of human SHBG are similar in these two lines of transgenic mice (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar), the immunoreactivity in the interstitial compartment reflects the sequestration of SHBG from the plasma. In contrast to previous studies (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Google Scholar), in which we were not able to detect any immunoreactive human SHBG within the seminiferous tubules of mice containing human SHBG transgenes, microwave pretreatment of histology sections in a high pH buffer most likely exposed human SHBG epitopes within the seminiferous tubules of the 11-kb human SHBG transgenic mouse testis (Fig.5 A). At higher power magnification, this immunoreactive human SHBG could be detected within the acrosome of spermatids during spermiogenesis only in the seminiferous tubules of transgenic mice containing the 11-kb human SHBG transgene (Fig.5 B). Moreover, this immunoreactivity could be detected in the acrosome as soon as it begins to form on spermatids (stage VII of spermatogenesis) and persists in the acrosome as it develops throughout the elongation stages (stages IX–XII) of spermiogenesis (Fig. 5 B). To investigate whether the immunoreactive human SHBG remains within the acrosome after sperm are released into the male reproductive tract, we performed immunohistochemistry on sperm isolated from the epididymis of transgenic mice containing either the 4- or 11-kb human SHBGtransgenes (Fig. 5 C), and this clearly shows that immunoreactive human SHBG is only present in the acrosome of sperm from the 11-kb human SHBG transgenic mice (Fig.5 C). To determine the molecular size of the immunoreactive SHBG within the acrosome of 11-kb human SHBG transgenic mouse germ cells, we used Western blotting to examine protein extracts isolated from testicular cells, i.e. a mixed population of Sertoli cells and germ cells or isolated germ cells. The lack of any immunoreactive molecules in the protein extract of testicular cells from wild-type mice confirms the specificity of the anti-human SHBG antibodies used for this purpose (Fig.6). In addition, there was no immunoreactivity in the protein extract of isolated testicular cells from mice containing a 4-kb human SHBG transgene (Fig. 6), despite the fact that the testes of these animals contain appreciable amounts of immunoreactivity in the interstitial cell compartment (Fig.5 A). Thus, the ∼45-kDa immunoreactive protein observed in the isolated testicular cell extracts of mice containing the 11-kb transgene cannot be accounted for by contamination of SHBG from blood or the interstitial cell compartment. In preliminary Western blotting experiments of the testicular protein extracts, we noticed that the apparent molecular size of the immunoreactive human SHBG in these samples was slightly smaller than that in a serum sample from the same animals and that its electrophoretic heterogeneity was different from that associated with human SHBG purified from serum. To explore this further, we compared the electrophoretic behavior of immunoreactive SHBG in serum and testicular cell extracts from the 11-kb human SHBGtransgenic mice. For this experiment, aliquots of the samples were also treated with N-glycosidase F to remove N-linked oligosaccharides prior to Western blot analysis (Fig.7). This confirmed that the apparent molecular size of immunoreactive human SHBG in the testicular protein extract (44–46 kDa) is smaller and electrophoretically more heterogeneous than the major electrophoretic isoform of SHBG in serum (50–51 kDa). However, treatment with N-glycosidase F clearly reduces the electrophoretic heterogeneity of immunoreactive SHBG in both samples and results in similarly sized immunoreactive products of about 43 kDa for deglycosylated serum SHBG and 42 kDa for deglycosylated acrosomal SHBG (Fig. 7). The steroid-binding properties of the immunoreactive human SHBG in the protein extracts from isolated testicular cells were also examined using a steroid-binding capacity assay. Our experiments indicated that specific binding could only be detected in the extracts from mice containing the 11-kb human SHBG transgene and that the highest levels were present in one particular line (shbg11-b) of these mice (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S.-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-1"

https://openalex.org/W2078579639,"HCF-1 is a cellular protein required by VP16 to activate the herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate-early genes. VP16 is a component of the viral tegument and, after release into the cell, binds to HCF-1 and translocates to the nucleus to form a complex with the POU domain protein Oct-1 and a VP16-responsive DNA sequence. This VP16-induced complex boosts transcription of the viral immediate-early genes and initiates lytic replication. In uninfected cells, HCF-1 functions as a coactivator for the cellular transcription factors LZIP and GABP and also plays an essential role in cell proliferation. VP16 and LZIP share a tetrapeptide HCF-binding motif recognized by the β-propeller domain of HCF-1. Here we describe a new cellular HCF-1 β-propeller domain binding protein, termed HPIP, which contains a functional HCF-binding motif and a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence. We show that HPIP shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner and that overexpression of HPIP leads to accumulation of HCF-1 in the cytoplasm. These data suggest that HPIP regulates HCF-1 activity by modulating its subcellular localization. Furthermore, HPIP-mediated export may provide the pool of cytoplasmic HCF-1 required for import of virion-derived VP16 into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2033309773,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a major regulator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis. Its function has not been fully characterized and may depend on the association with additional proteins. To identify ABCA1-interacting proteins a human liver yeast two-hybrid library was screened with the 144 C-terminal amino acids of ABCA1. Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) was identified to bind to ABCA1, and this interaction was confirmed by pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitations. Recombinant expression of a dominant negative form of FADD or the C terminus of ABCA1 in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 markedly reduced the transfer of phospholipids to apoA-I. This indicates that the binding of additional proteins, one of them being full-length FADD, is required for ABCA1 function. The association of FADD with ABCA1 provides an unexpected link between high density lipoprotein metabolism and an adaptor molecule mainly described in death receptor signal transduction.

The association of FADD with ABCA1 provides an unexpected link between high density lipoprotein metabolism and an adaptor molecule mainly described in death receptor signal transduction. high density lipoprotein ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 Tangier disease apolipoprotein Fas-associated death domain protein FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethylketone fetal calf serum dominant negative green fluorescent protein tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor cycloheximide Patients with HDL1deficiency suffer from massive accumulation of cholesteryl esters in many tissues and a variety of clinical phenotypes like hepatosplenomegaly, atherosclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy (1Schmitz G.

Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) are the underlying cause of Tangier disease (TD), and specific apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-inducible phospholipid efflux is severely impaired in these patients (2Bodzioch M. Orso E. Klucken J. Langmann T. Bottcher A. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Barlage S. Buchler C. Porsch O.M. Kaminski W.E. Hahmann H.W. Oette K. Rothe G. Aslanidis C. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Nat.

Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). ABCA1 facilitates the transfer of phospholipids to apoA-I, thus generating an acceptor particle for reverse cholesterol transport (5Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). ABCA1 expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells binds ATP but has no measurable ATPase activity, demonstrating that ABCA1 is not an active transporter but may function as a regulator protein analogous to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (6Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux may depend on multiple, yet uncharacterized, associated proteins. Several proteins have been described to interact with ABCA1 (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and three ABCA1-interacting proteins have been analyzed in more detail, namely apoA-I, Cdc42, and β2-syntrophin. ApoA-I was co-immunoprecipitated with ABCA1, and functional ABCA1 was required for the specific docking of apoA-I to the cell surface (5Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In addition, ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdc42, a GTPase that binds to numerous effector proteins controlling cell polarity, cytoskeletal remodeling, and vesicular transport (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). The association of ABCA1 with Cdc42 may explain the altered actin cytoskeleton in cells overexpressing ABCA1 and suggests that ABCA1 regulates actin organization through Cdc42 (9Diederich W. Orso E. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 313-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Tsukamoto K. Hirano K. Tsujii K. Ikegami C. Zhongyan Z. Nishida Y. Ohama T. Matsuura F. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cdc42 increases apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux, whereas the expression of the dominant negative form of Cdc42 decreases lipid efflux (11Hirano K. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Zhang Z. Matsuyama A. Takaishi K. Komuro R. Suehiro T. Yamashita S. Takai Y. Matsuzawa Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, β2-syntrophin was found to interact with the C-terminal five amino acids of ABCA1, and utrophin, known to couple β2-syntrophin and its PDZ ligands to the F-actin cytoskeleton, was identified as a constituent of this complex (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To further elucidate the multifaceted and complex role of ABCA1, it is important to identify all interacting proteins. Therefore the C-terminal 144 amino acids of ABCA1 were used as bait to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. The C-terminal region of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) was identified to interact with ABCA1, and the association of FADD and ABCA1 was verified in mammalian cells by pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation. A dominant negative form of FADD markedly reduced apoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux further supporting the biological relevance of this interaction.RESULTSA fusion construct of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the C terminus of human ABCA1 (bp 6292–6723) was used as a bait for the screening of a human liver yeast two-hybrid cDNA library. One of the positive clones identified to interact with the ABCA1 C terminus encoded the 98 C-terminal amino acids of FADD (amino acid positions 111–208) as a Gal4 activation domain fusion protein. The identified ABCA1-interacting FADD fragment contains almost the complete death domain of FADD (amino acids 97–161). To further confirm the association of ABCA1 and FADD, His-tagged full-length human FADD bound to nickel-chelating resin was incubated with in vitrotranslated ABCA1 C terminus with an N-terminal Myc tag. Whereas incubation of FADD-agarose with Myc-tagged aldehyde oxidase as control gave no signal on Western blots, the ABCA1 C terminus was pulled down by FADD-agarose and detected on the immunoblot using a Myc antibody (Fig. 1 A). In addition, FADD-agarose pulled down ABCA1 from cell lysates of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. When FADD was eluted from the agarose with 100 mm imidazole before loading the cell lysate, ABCA1 was not detected in the precipitate (Fig. 1 B).Increasing amounts of ABCA1 were pulled down by FADD-agarose when 10, 20, and 30 μg of cell lysate prepared from the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line Meg-01 with a high expression of ABCA1 (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were used (Fig. 1 C). In addition, a faint ABCA1 signal was detected in the FADD precipitates from HepG2 cells, whereas the ABCA1 signal on immunoblots was much stronger when Meg-01 lysate was used (Fig.1 D). These experiments support our initial finding that ABCA1 interacts with FADD. Caspase 8, a protein described to interact with FADD, was also detected in the FADD-agarose precipitates by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, C and D). Although caspase 8 is not associated with FADD in non-apoptotic cells, caspase 8 was precipitated by FADD-agarose. With this approach potentially interacting proteins can be identified, but this alone does not prove that FADD and ABCA1 are really associated in these cell lysates. Therefore, to investigate the presumptive endogenous association of ABCA1 with FADD, ABCA1 antiserum was covalently linked to magnetic beads. Upon incubation of the beads with cell lysates, the ABCA1 antibody was able to precipitate ABCA1 and endogenous FADD from lysates of the hepatoma cell line HepG2 and Meg-01 cells (Fig. 1 E). Caspase 8, which is expressed in these cells (not shown), was not co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 E). ABCA1 and FADD but not caspase 8 were also precipitated from lysates of primary fibroblasts of two different donors (F1 and F2) using ABCA1 antiserum. A control antiserum failed to immunoprecipitate ABCA1 and FADD from the lysate of F2 (Fig. 1 F). The supernatant of the lysate F2 after incubation with ABCA1 antibody was 5-fold concentrated, and the immunoblot indicates that about 50% of ABCA1 and FADD and nearly 100% of caspase 8 remain in the supernatant (Fig. 1 F). This indicates that caspase 8 does not interact with FADD associated with ABCA1 or that the amount of caspase 8 associated with ABCA1 and FADD is beyond the sensitivity of the Western blot.ABCA1 facilitates the transfer of phospholipids to apoA-I, and to further exclude an involvement of caspase activation in ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux, fibroblasts from three different donors were treated with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (20 μm) that was added to the culture with apoA-I. Specific apoA-I-dependent efflux of choline phospholipid was 16.2 ± 5.5% in untreated fibroblasts and 15.8 ± 5.2% in fibroblasts treated with the caspase inhibitor. This result demonstrates that caspase activation is not necessary for ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux.FADD is mainly described as an adaptor molecule in death receptor-induced apoptosis, and the association of ABCA1 with FADD may imply an altered response of fibroblasts with mutated ABCA1 to apoptotic stimuli when compared with primary fibroblasts from controls. A characteristic feature of apoptosis is the release of histone-bound DNA fragments, which can be detected in the supernatant of these cells. Apoptosis was induced in primary fibroblasts from different donors by Fas cross-linking or the addition of TNF-α and cycloheximide (CHX). The release of histone-bound DNA fragments varied from donor to donor but was not consistently induced or suppressed in TD fibroblasts. Therefore, mutations of ABCA1 do not sensitize or protect fibroblasts from Fas- or TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis.In addition, we investigated the expression of FADD by immunoblotting in whole cell lysates from primary fibroblasts of healthy probands and of patients with Tangier disease (Fig.2 A). The two TD patients from pedigree TD2 are homozygous for a 1,500-nucleotide deletion at the 3′-end of the ABCA1 mRNA, and the patients from the pedigrees TD4 and TD5 are compound heterozygous for missense mutations (2Bodzioch M. Orso E. Klucken J. Langmann T. Bottcher A. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Barlage S. Buchler C. Porsch O.M. Kaminski W.E. Hahmann H.W. Oette K. Rothe G. Aslanidis C. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Full-length ABCA1 was detected in fibroblasts from TD4 and TD5, whereas the TD2 fibroblasts expressed no ABCA1 protein (Fig. 2 A). FADD was found to be reduced in fibroblasts of five different TD patients when compared with four controls. The protein levels of caspase 8 and FLIPL, known to directly interact with FADD, varied within different fibroblasts but did not exhibit a consistent down- or up-regulation in TD cells (Fig.2 A). Decreased expression of FADD may be a direct consequence of disturbed lipid homeostasis in these fibroblasts. Therefore we investigated the protein expression of FADD in fibroblast from controls incubated with enzymatically modified low density lipoprotein (24 h, not shown) in serum-starved cells (3 days) and in cells incubated with HDL3 (24 h) (Fig.2 B) to promote lipid efflux. FADD expression was not altered under these culture conditions indicating that FADD expression is not sensitive to lipid loading/deloading but may be compensatorily down-regulated in cells with mutated ABCA1.Figure 2Analysis of FADD expression in fibroblasts from patients with Tangier disease and controls. A, the expression of ABCA1, FADD, caspase 8, FLIPL, and actin was analyzed by immunoblots in lysates from fibroblasts isolated from five TD patients (2Bodzioch M. Orso E. Klucken J. Langmann T.

To analyze whether inhibition of FADD may modulate ABCA1 function, FADD-DN was cloned into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP and expressed with a N-terminal GFP fusion in HepG2 cells. In addition, a GFP fusion with the 144-amino acid C terminus of ABCA1 was generated to analyze a possible inhibitory function of the ABCA1 C terminus. Stable clones were selected, and expression of GFP was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Nearly 95% of the transfected HepG2 cells were GFP-positive with both methods. Immunoblot analysis with GFP antiserum revealed that the ABCA1 C-terminal construct was weakly expressed, whereas FADD-DN was expressed at a much higher level (Fig. 3 A). In the transfected cells expression of ABCA1, FADD, and caspase 8 was investigated by immunoblots. Recombinant FADD-DN was much more abundant than native FADD, which was similarly expressed in the transfected cells. Furthermore native ABCA1 and caspase 8 levels were comparable in these cells (Fig. 3 A). ABCA1 antiserum, which was generated using the 20 C-terminal amino acids of ABCA1, was capable of precipitating FADD-DN, confirming that FADD-DN really binds to ABCA1 (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Analysis of choline phospholipid efflux in HepG2 cells expressing ABCA1 C terminus or FADD-DN. A, immunoblot analysis of GFP, FADD, ABCA1, and caspase 8 in stably transfected HepG2 cells expressing ABCA1 C terminus with an N-terminal GFP tag (lane 1), FADD-DN fused to GFP (lane 2), or GFP (lane 3) alone as control. B, lysates from stably transfected HepG2 cells expressing ABCA1 C terminus with an N-terminal GFP tag (lane 1) or GFP-FADD-DN (lane 2) were used for immunoprecipitation with covalently linked ABCA1 antiserum. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblot using ABCA1 or GFP antibody. The ABCA1 C-terminal fusion adds 15.8 kDa and the FADD-DN fusion adds 14.1 kDa to GFP with a molecular mass of 27 kDa.C, specific choline phospholipid efflux from stably transfected HepG2 cells expressing GFP as control, FADD-DN fused to GFP, or ABCA1 C terminus with an N-terminal GFP tag. The efflux of the GFP-transfected cells was set to 100%. Specific efflux in FADD-DN-expressing cells was 46.2 ± 9.5% and 26.2 ± 7.4% in cells with recombinant ABCA1 C terminus. Four assays with triplicate determinations were performed. Specific efflux was calculated by subtraction of efflux without acceptor from apoA-I-mediated efflux. Reduction of efflux is significant for FADD-DN and ABCA-1 C terminus with p < 0.001 (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The transfected cells were further analyzed for choline phospholipid efflux to apoA-I. For each assay five to seven different stable clones were combined to exclude differences due to clonal variability. Four independent assays with triplicate determinations were performed, and [3H]choline-derived radioactivity incorporation was found to be similar in the transfected cells. Expression of the ABCA1 C terminus inhibited apoA-I-inducible phospholipid efflux 4-fold (Fig.3 C), and the expression of FADD-DN reduced efflux by 50% thereby confirming that full-length FADD has a relevance for ABCA1 function (Fig. 3 C). FADD-DN protected HepG2 cells from TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis, whereas HepG2 cells expressing GFP or the ABCA1 C terminus revealed a similar response as detected by the release of histone-bound DNA fragments and trypan blue staining of dead cells.DISCUSSIONThe identification and molecular understanding of ABCA1-associated proteins will provide important insights into ABCA1 function. ApoA-I, as a primary acceptor of phospholipids, associates with ABCA1 (5Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) as does Cdc42 (9Diederich W. Orso E. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 159: 313-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and β2-syntrophin (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that FADD directly interacts with ABCA1 in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, in the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line Meg-01, and in primary human fibroblasts indicating that the association of ABCA1 with FADD is not cell type-specific. The FADD-ABCA1 interaction is a surprising finding that links HDL metabolism and reverse lipid efflux with a protein mainly described in the context of death receptor-induced apoptosis (15Strasser A. Newton K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Death domain-containing proteins like FADD mostly interact with death domains. However, no death domain was identified in the ABCA1 C terminus, and the positively interacting FADD-derived clone in the yeast two-hybrid system did not encode the complete death domain of FADD. Similar observations have been made in the BAG-4/TNFR1 system. The N terminus of BAG-4 (SODD (silencer of death domains)) binds the death domain of TNFR1 preventing cell death signaling, although no death domain is found in this protein (16Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).Recombinant expression of the ABCA1 C terminus and FADD-DN significantly reduced cellular efflux of choline phospholipid to apoA-I. This underlines the importance of proteins associated with the C terminus of ABCA1 for ABCA1 function and indicates that full-length FADD is one of these accessory proteins. The death effector domain of FADD is known to interact with the death effector domain of caspase 8 (17Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, caspase 8 was not found in ABCA1·FADD complexes, and activation of caspases was not necessary for apoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux.The expression of FADD was found to be reduced in primary fibroblasts from five TD patients compared with fibroblast from four controls. FADD expression was not altered in cholesterol-loaded or serum-starved cells nor influenced by stimulating reverse lipid efflux, and therefore the reduced expression of FADD in TD fibroblasts is not a secondary response to disturbed cholesterol homeostasis. FADD expression was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with mutated ABCA1 but was not down-regulated in HepG2 cells stably expressing ABCA1 C terminus or FADD-DN with reduced apolipoprotein A-I-dependent phospholipid efflux. Therefore the reduced expression of FADD may be a consequence of absent or defective ABCA1 protein. However, additional work is necessary to fully explain the details of this observation. Recombinant expression of the ABCA1 C terminus did not alter the cellular response to death receptor-induced apoptosis; a similar result was observed in TD fibroblasts when compared with controls indicating that neither the inhibition of apoA-I-dependent lipid efflux nor the reduced expression of FADD in TD fibroblasts alters the cellular response to TNF-α/CHX- or Fas-induced apoptosis.ABCA1 was suggested to be a phosphatidylserine translocase that facilitates phosphatidylserine exofacial flipping (18Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciano M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The transient local exposure of anionic phospholipids in the outer membrane leaflet enhances the engulfment of apoptotic cells (18Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciano M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphatidylserine transmembrane redistribution at the cell surface is one of the early characteristics of cells undergoing apoptosis (21Kunzelmann-March C. Freyssinet J.M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and also occurs in cells fulfilling a more specialized function, such as the phosphatidylserine-dependent procoagulant response of platelets after appropriate activation (21Kunzelmann-March C. Freyssinet J.M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The association of ABCA1 with FADD shown here and the high expression of ABCA1 on platelets (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) may reflect an ABCA1-related phosphatidylserine translocase effect. Alternatively the FADD/ABCA1 interaction may indicate an antiapoptotic ABCA1 function independent from phosphatidylserine translocase activity.Besides being a signal transducer in apoptosis, the dominant negative form of FADD reduces the proliferation of T-cells and fibroblasts (13Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Bernard A.M. Chautan M. Evan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10453-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle (22Drobnik W. Liebisch G. Biederer C. Trumbach B. Rogler G. Muller P. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Growth and cell cycle abnormalities of fibroblasts from Tangier disease patients have been described suggesting that similar pathways seem to be involved in the disturbances of lipid transport and growth retardation (22Drobnik W. Liebisch G. Biederer C. Trumbach B. Rogler G. Muller P. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An inverse relation between proliferation and apoA-I-mediated choline phospholipid efflux was described recently (23Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Lymp J. Kavanagh T.J. Halbert C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1769-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding of the molecular and functional association of ABCA1 with FADD may contribute to a better understanding of the processes of cholesterol homeostasis, proliferation, and apoptosis with the emphasis on the involvement of ABCA1. Patients with HDL1deficiency suffer from massive accumulation of cholesteryl esters in many tissues and a variety of clinical phenotypes like hepatosplenomegaly, atherosclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy (1Schmitz G. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Klucken J. Orso E. Bodzioch M. Buchler C. Drobnik W. Pathobiology. 1999; 67: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) are the underlying cause of Tangier disease (TD), and specific apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-inducible phospholipid efflux is severely impaired in these patients (2Bodzioch M. Orso E. Klucken J. Langmann T. Bottcher A. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Barlage S. Buchler C. Porsch O.M. Kaminski W.E. Hahmann H.W. Oette K. Rothe G. Aslanidis C. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Nat.

Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). ABCA1 facilitates the transfer of phospholipids to apoA-I, thus generating an acceptor particle for reverse cholesterol transport (5Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). ABCA1 expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells binds ATP but has no measurable ATPase activity, demonstrating that ABCA1 is not an active transporter but may function as a regulator protein analogous to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (6Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux may depend on multiple, yet uncharacterized, associated proteins. Several proteins have been described to interact with ABCA1 (7Buechler C. Boettcher A. Bared S.M. Probst M.C. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and three ABCA1-interacting proteins have been analyzed in more detail, namely apoA-I, Cdc42, and β2-syntrophin. ApoA-I was co-immunoprecipitated with ABCA1, and functional ABCA1 was required for the specific docking of apoA-I to the cell surface (5Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In addition, ABCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdc42, a GTPase that binds to numerous effector proteins controlling cell polarity, cytoskeletal remodeling, and vesicular transport (8Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). The association of ABCA1 with Cdc42 may explain the altered actin cytoskeleton in cells overexpressing ABCA1 and suggests that ABCA1 regulates actin organization through Cdc42 (9Diederich W. Orso E.

We devised a model approach to generate specific, competitive kinase inhibitors by isolating substrate mimics containing two independent binding sites with an anti-idiotype strategy from combinatorial RNA libraries. As a general test for the ability to generate highly specific kinase inhibitors, we selected the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) that is phosphorylated on the same serine residue by the protein kinase MSK1 as well as by RSK1. The sequences and structures of these kinases are very similar, about 60% of their amino acids are identical. Nevertheless, we can demonstrate that the selected RNA inhibitors inhibit specifically CREB phosphorylation by MSK1 but do not affect CREB phosphorylation by RSK1. The inhibitors interact preferentially with the inactive form of MSK1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RNA ligands can be conformation-specific probes, and this feature allowed us to describe magnesium ion-dependent conformational changes of MSK1 upon activation.

Combinatorial RNA libraries can be used to isolated specific ligands, called aptamers, for virtually any target molecule by a procedure probably best known as SELEX (1Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7745) Google Scholar, 2Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). Inhibitory aptamers can be isolated either directly by using the purified target molecule or indirectly by a variety of strategies like decoy selection, blended SELEX, and anti-idiotype approaches (3Gold L.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Decoys are aptamers designed to compete with small, structured RNA sequences produced by viruses for binding to the target proteins that are essential for viral replication (8Sullenger B.A. Gallardo H.F. Ungers G.E. Gilboa E. Cell. 1990; 63: 601-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Blended SELEX has been used to increase the affinity and specificity of an inhibitory chemical compound by attaching it non-covalently to an RNA library used subsequently to select for an additional, stabilizing contact for the target molecule (9Smith D. Kirschenheuter G.P. Charlton J. Guidot D.M. Repine J.E. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 741-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Anti-idiotype approaches use antibodies directed against interfaces of protein-protein interactions to isolate RNA mimics of one of the interaction domains (10Doudna J.A. Cech T.R.

A direct demonstration for the ability of RNA to mimic protein domains is supplied by the work of Nyborg and co-workers (12Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) who compared the crystal structures of the elongation factor (EF) 1The abbreviations used for: EF, elongation factor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. -G and a ternary complex of tRNA/GDP/EF-Tu. The structures appear to be very similar and provide evidence for the model that EF-G induces translocation of the ternary tRNA complex by functional mimicry. Protein kinases form a large family of related enzymes that play important roles in intracellular signaling. Their key regulatory roles are subject to intensive investigation and targeted by pharmaceutical companies in drug discovery programs. Protein kinases are themselves very tightly regulated; however, information on the mechanisms of regulation or the nature of the conformational changes that take place are vastly lacking for the several hundreds of protein kinases present in the human genome. Growth factor-induced transcription of target genes by the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is dependent on the phosphorylation of a specific serine residue (Ser-133) (13Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 14Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). MSK1 and RSK1, two structurally highly related kinases, have been shown to phosphorylate Ser-133 of CREB (15Arthur J.S.

We have combined the anti-idiotype approach and the blended SELEX strategy to select a bi-functional, substrate mimicking, all RNA aptamer capable of specifically inhibiting CREB phosphorylation by MSK1. A similar approach had been suggested in the past and was termed “walking SELEX” but had not been performed experimentally so far, at least according to our knowledge. We provide evidence that the aptamers can be indicators for magnesium ion-dependent conformational changes of kinases. The bi-functional CREB mimics were also used to precipitate specifically endogenous MSK1 from cellular extracts, further highlighting the strength and specificity of the interaction with the target protein. The aptamers do not bind to RSK1, a kinase structurally related to MSK1, nor do they inhibit RSK1 activity in vitro. Rabbits were immunized with CREBtide coupled to a mixture of keyhole limpet hemocyanin/BSA, and the antisera were immunopurified on CH-Sepharose columns containing covalently linked, recombinant GST-CREB protein expressed in bacteria. Briefly, 2–4 mg of GST-CREB dialyzed previously against coupling buffer (0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl) was coupled to 1 g of activated CH4-B-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences), and columns were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); 15–20 ml of antiserum was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and antibodies were purified. We recovered routinely 500–700 μg of purified anti-CREB antibody from 20 ml of antiserum. For Western blots of co-precipitated proteins a sheep anti-MSK1 antibody and a rabbit anti-RSK1 antibody were used (16Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). GST-MSK1, GST-RSK1, and GST-MAPK were expressed in 293 cells, and active or inactive GST proteins were purified as described (16Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). His6-MSK1 was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected cells as described for His6-PDK (19Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). 7.5 mg of M270-epoxy beads (Dynal) were washed 4 times with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaPO4, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 500 μl of coupling solution (160 μg of purified, recombinant protein; 1× PBS; 1 mNH4SO4). The beads were mixed in a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C and washed 4 times with 1 ml of PBS and 4 times with 1 ml of PBS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA and resuspended in 1 ml of storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 110 mmKOAc, 6 mm MgOAc, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Selection of CREB mimics with anti-CREB antibodies immobilized on M280-anti-mouse IgG (Dynal) was performed in selection buffer NaK150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2) as described (20Hamm J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2220-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Selection of additional contact CREB mimics was done in an analogous way with the following modifications of the original protocol: (a) depletion of RNA binding to the magnetic beads was done with M270-GST-CREB beads, selection with M270-His6-MSK1 beads; (b) new buffer for depletion, selection, and washing steps (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 110 mm KOAc, 6 mm MgOAc, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm ATP); (c) the reaction temperature for cycles 1–2 was 4 and 20 °C for cycles 3–5; (d) the primer 3′RSP1 for the reverse transcriptase and PCRs with LL22 was substituted by 3′LL-st5, 5′-CCC AAG CTT CCC GGG CGT TCA AAG TCC ACC ACT CAT CTC CGC CCG GGT TGC ACA CCG TCT CG-3′ for LL22-st5, and by 3′LL-C5-st5, 5′-CCC AAG CTT CCC GGG CGT TCA AAG TCC ACC ACT CAT CTC CGC CCG GGG GGG GTT GCA CAC CGT CTC G-3′ for LL22-C5-st5. Interactions between antibodies or kinases and RNA were analyzed by pull-down experiments. In essence, one of the binding partners was immobilized on a solid matrix; a binding reaction was performed with the second partner in solution; the matrix-bound material was washed extensively; and co-precipitation of the binding partner, which had been in solution, was scored. Immunoprecipitations were performed as during the selection of CREB mimics with the anti-CREB antibody, 50 μl of M280 sheep anti-mouse IgG coated with anti-CREB antibodies (≅20–50 pmol) were incubated in NaK150 with labeled, gel-purified RNA (≅1 pmol); beads were washed, and RNA was extracted and analyzed on denaturing acrylamide gels. For precipitations with His6-MSK1, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) were coated with His6-MSK1 in the buffer used for the selection of the additional contact supplemented by 15 mm imidazole, and subsequent binding and washing steps were also performed in the imidazole-containing buffer in conditions as for the immunoprecipitations. For precipitations with GST-MSK1 purified MSK1 or MSK1TPA (0.5 μg) was bound to GT-Sepharose in PBS, washed 2 times for 5 min with PBS, subsequently 2 times for 5 min with PBS ± 5 mm MgCl2, depending on whether the subsequent binding step was to be performed in the presence or absence of MgCl2, incubated for 30 min at 20 °C with labeled RNA in PBS ± 5 mm MgCl2, washed 4 times for 5 min with 500 μl of PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 ±5 mm MgCl2, and RNA was eluted and analyzed as for the immunoprecipitations. For precipitations with M270-epoxy beads, all steps were performed at 4 °C and in buffer KB (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgOAc) also including 0.1% Nonidet P-40 during the washing steps, and RNA was extracted and analyzed on denaturing acrylamide gels. Cells collected in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmNaF, 5 mm Na3PO4, 0.27m sucrose, 1 μm microcystin/complete proteinase inhibitor from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from a 10-cm dish were spun for 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. Biotinylated RNA immobilized on M280-streptavidin beads (Dynal) was incubated in NaK150, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μg of tRNA, 200 μg of 293 lysate for 15 min at 20 °C and washed 4 times for 5 min with 600 μl of NaK150, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in 100 μl of NaK150, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and beads were transferred into a fresh tube, and proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Unlabeled RNA (100 pmol/μl) was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2). 10 μl of renatured RNA diluted in renaturation buffer to the desired concentration was incubated with 1 μl of active MSK1 (diluted in KB, 0.1 μg/μl BSA) and 6.5 μl of KB for 10 min at 30 °C; GST-CREB (c final = 0.5 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (c final = 0.1 mm) were added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of protein loading buffer, and an aliquot of the reaction was analyzed as described. Inactive MSK1 (8.5 pmol) was incubated with renatured, unlabeled RNA (1 nmol = 50 μm) for 15 min at room temperature (volume = 20 μl, 53.75 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgOAc, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 37.5 mm KCl, 0.375 mmMgCl2). Active MAPK was added (final concentration 1 unit/ml), and the reaction was left for 15 min at 30 °C to permit phosphorylation of MSK1 by MAPK. An aliquot (4 μl) was removed and added to a second reaction (volume = 20 μl; 60.75 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.12 mm EGTA, 0.12% β-mercaptoethanol, 12 mm MgOAc, 0.023 mm ATP, 7.5 mm KCl, 0.075 mm MgCl2) containing CREB protein (0.5 μm) and radioactively labeled γ-ATP (final RNA concentration 10 μm) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C to test for CREB phosphorylation by MSK1. Binding was analyzed directly by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore 3000 system. Monoclonal anti-GST antibody was coupled (amine coupling, 1000 response units) to specific and control cells of CM5 chips (BIAcore AB, Stevenage, UK). GST proteins (1000 response units) were coupled to the anti-GST antibodies. GST-MSK1 was bound to the specific channel and either GST, GST-MAPK, or nothing was added to the control channel. No significant binding was recorded on the control cells. Interactions were studied in buffer HBS-P (0.01m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated with pulses of buffer containing 0.75 mm NaCl, and injections were performed in HBS-P containing 10% RNA renaturation buffer and the indicated concentration of RNA. Substrates for individual protein kinases are frequently distinguishable by some kind of consensus sequence surrounding the amino acid phosphorylated by the kinase. We therefore considered that a substrate mimic of a specific kinase substrate might be a good starting point to generate a specific kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1 A). A polyclonal antibody was raised against CREBtide, an 11-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CREB sequence surrounding Ser-133 that is phosphorylated with high efficiency by MSK1 (16Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A peptide sequence can usually adopt many different conformations when taken out of the context of the native protein. Because we were interested in an aptamer mimicking the native substrate, we decided to purify the anti-peptide antibodies on columns containing native CREB protein produced in bacteria (Fig. 1 B). Three different types of structurally constrained RNA libraries were utilized to select aptamers binding specifically to the antigen-binding site of the anti-CREB antibody (Fig. 2). The variable stretches of 22 or 30 nucleotides were placed in a structural backbone formed by the fixed sequences serving as the primer-binding sites for the reverse transcriptase-PCR steps of the selection cycle. The selection progress was fast; maximum enrichment for anti-CREB binding RNA was obtained after 4 cycles of selection. For each of the three libraries 24 clones were picked randomly, inserted into DNA vectors, and sequenced manually. The sequence data showed that we had selected a virtually identical RNA motif from all libraries despite the differences in the structural constraints and the length of the variable sequences (Fig.3, A and B). A single sequence motif was isolated from the library LL22, whereas a number of highly similar sequences were obtained for the terminal loop-sequence from L30 and SSL30, although all clones showed an identical sequence and structure for the internal loop/bulge motif. This might be attributable to the lower structural complexity of LL22, which results in a higher enrichment of the prominent binder per selection cycle. Based on the common motif, we designed a set of seven RNA molecules to confirm the selected motif and to reduce the size of the minimal aptamer element (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Consensus structures for CREB mimics. A, the consensus structures selected from LL22and LL30 with the purified anti-CREB antibody are shown. RNA regions where base pairing is maintained but primary sequence is variable are indicated schematically (−). Sequence variants in the loop of LL30 are shown on the right.

In the RNA analyzed inlanes 1–4 the selected core motif was left unaltered, but the length of the closing stem was reduced from 5 to 2 bp. In contrast, the RNA analyzed in lanes 5–7 contained point mutations in the internal and the terminal loop sequence, either separately or in combination. The experiment illustrated that a minimum sequence of 28 nucleotides closed by a 3-bp stem structure is sufficient to bind to the anti-CREB antibody (Fig. 4 A, IPP, lane 3; Fig. 5 B, st5 secondary structure prediction) and that both the sequence of the internal loop as well as of the terminal loop were essential for binding (Fig.4 A, IPP, lanes 5–7). The original clone selected from LL22 containing the entire 18-bp stem and st5, both carrying the identical, selected internal and terminal loop sequences were binding with apparently identical efficiency to the anti-CREB antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, the anti-CREB aptamers competed with recombinant CREB for binding to the anti-CREB antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). To test whether the selected aptamers were true CREB mimics, we linked recombinant CREB or MSK1 covalently to magnetic beads and probed for binding. Because the RNA had been selected with an anti-CREB antibody from the libraries, it should bind to MSK1 only if mimicking structurally the CREB domain interacting with MSK1, whereas a CREB mimic should not bind to CREB itself. The experimental data showed that this was indeed the case because there was a clear correlation between the ability to bind to the anti-CREB antibody and the capacity to interact with the MSK1 protein. CREB mimic st5 (Fig. 4 C, lane 3) but not the mutant st5 SA2TL (Fig. 4 C, lane 4) was precipitated by MSK1, whereas neither bound to purified CREB (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 2).Figure 5Structure of the “additional contact library.” A, schematic presentation of the additional contact library. To select for RNA capable of contacting MSK1 in two distinct regions of the protein surface the additional contact library LL22-st5 was designed. The minimal structure of the CREB mimic (st5) was incorporated covalently into the 3′ end of the library LL22 and would be expected to direct the additional contact library to the active site of MSK1. The variable region of LL22-st5 should therefore be free to target surface residues at a distance from the active site limited or conditioned by the length of the constant 18-bp stem (∼6 nm). To alter the relative geometry of LL22 and the CREB mimic a stretch of 5 C-residues was incorporated at the 5′ end of st5 in a second library LL22-C5-st5. The three structural domains present in LL22-C5-st5 arehighlighted and indicated by arrows. B, secondary structures of st5 and TL18. The sequences and the proposed secondary structures of the CREB mimic st5 and the control RNA TL18 are shown. The stem sequence of TL18 is identical to the stem sequence of LL22/addcon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The CREB mimics isolated by the anti-idiotype approach and described in the previous section were binding specifically to MSK1 as anticipated. However, the interaction was stable only at low temperature due to the rapid off-rate of the MSK1-RNA complexes, a characteristic shared with genuine enzyme-substrate complexes. Formation of a long lived, stable complex would compromise the catalytic rate of the enzyme. But since the aim of our experiments was to generate a specific enzyme inhibitor, we had to increase the half-live of aptamer-MSK1 complexes. We designed a new library named LL22-st5 which contained the selected CREB mimic as part of the fixed sequence located at the 3′ end of the library (Fig. 5 A) and selected for stable binding to recombinant MSK1. The underlying rationale was that the CREB mimic located at the 3′ end should direct all library molecules preferentially to the active site of MSK1, whereas the variable part of the library might be able to provide an additional MSK1 contact. The distance between the active site contact and the additional contact to be selected was obviously determined by the relative orientation and the distance between the aptamer domains present in the new library. To allow for a greater degree of rotational freedom between the CREB mimic domain and the putative additional contact domain, we created a variant library containing a stretch of 5 C residues between the two domains (LL22-C5-st5). The additional contact libraries were used to select aptamers binding to His6-MSK1 produced in baculovirus-infected cells and immobilized on magnetic beads. MSK1 produced in baculovirus-infected cells was a mixture of active and inactive MSK1, with about 60% being in the active form (data not shown). The first two rounds of selection were performed at low temperature to favor the binding of the CREB mimic to the active site of MSK1. In fact, after two rounds of selection a large proportion of the RNA remained bound to MSK1 after the washing step, indicating enrichment for stably binding RNA. Subsequent rounds were therefore performed at room temperature to increase the stringency of the selection, and after an initial decrease of bound RNA in the first selection cycle at room temperature, a maximal enrichment was observed after 3 cycles executed at room temperature. Individual clones were sequenced both for the LL22-st5 as well as for the LL22-C5-st5 selection and analyzed. Curiously, no defined RNA structure was apparent, rather purine residues had been selected preferentially from the variable part of both libraries (Tables I and II). On average 16/22 residues of the initially variable part were purines, with many clones containing as much as 19/22, and the sequences selected from LL22-st5 and LL22-C5-st5 were similar.Table ISelected sequences of library LL22-st5The sequences of the variable part of individual clones obtained from round 4 of selection with the library LL22-st5 are shown.

For all of the experiments presented in this work, we have used the additional contact sequence corresponding to clone 4.05 (TableII) with or without a stretch of 5 C residues inbetween the two aptamer domains (named addcon-st5 and addcon-C5-st5). We have tested several other clones (among those also clone 3.03, Table I, which was the clone with the lowest number of purine residues), but no differences were observable in any of the assays performed (Fig. 6and Fig. 10 and data not shown).Figure 10Addcon-st5 inhibits specifically phosphorylation of CREB by MSK1. A, active MSK1 (4 nm) was preincubated with increasing amounts of unlabeled RNA (addcon-st5, addcon, andTL18; concentration 0–50 μm) for 10 min at 30 °C. CREB (0.5 μm) and radioactively labeled [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the reaction was continued for 10 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated on denaturing acrylamide gels and visualized with a Fuji imager, and the relative amount of CREB phosphorylated by MSK1 was determined with the help of the image quantification program of the imager and plotted against the RNA concentration. B, active RSK1 was preincubated with unlabeled addcon-st5 or tRNA and analyzed as inA. C, inactive MSK1 was incubated with unlabeled RNA (50 μm) containing two MSK1-binding sites (addcon-st5), only one contact (addcon,addcon-SA2TL, and st5), no contact point (TL18), or no unlabeled RNA (no RNA) and active MAPK was added to permit phosphorylation of MSK1 by MAPK. An aliquot was removed and added to a second reaction containing CREB protein (0.5 μm) and radioactively labeled [γ-32P]ATP (final RNA concentration 10 μm) to test for CREB phosphorylation by MSK1. Proteins were separated on a denaturing acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Additional contact-CREB mimics (addcon-st5 and addcon-C5-st5) or RNA corresponding only to the additional contact (addcon) or containing the additional contact in the context of a mutant CREB mimic (addcon-C5-SA2TL) were incubated at room temperature with immobilized MSK1, and bound RNA was analyzed. Whereas the additional contact CREB mimic bound equally well with or without the stretch of 5 C residues (Fig. 6 A,lanes 5 and 8), removal (Fig. 6 A,lane 7) or mutation (Fig. 6 A, lane 6) of the CREB mimicking aptamer sequence reduced binding to MSK1. This could be also demonstrated by a protein sequestering assay that is more sensitive to changes in affinity than a direct precipitation assay, because the RNA to be analyzed for binding is present in molar excess and complexes have to be stable only during the preincubation step of the experiment but not during the subsequent washing steps (21Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Immobilized MSK1 was incubated with unlabeled additional contact CREB mimic, additional contact RNA, control RNA (the same 18-bp stem present in LL22 but closed by a stable tetra-loop sequence instead of the selected sequences; Fig. 5 B, TL18), or no unlabeled RNA before adding a small amount of labeled additional contact CREB mimic (addcon-C5-st5). After a short incubation beads were washed extensively, and bound and labeled RNA was analyzed. Preincubation of MSK1 with excess of unlabeled addcon-C5-st5 prevents subsequently added labeled addcon-C5-st5 from binding to MSK1 (Fig. 6 B,lane 2); no RNA (Fig. 6 B, lane 1) or control RNA (Fig. 6 B, lane 4) did not interfere with binding of labeled addcon-C5-st5, whereas preincubation with addcon alone resulted in partial reduction of labeled addcon-C5-st5 binding (Fig. 6 B,lane 3). This demonstrated that even an excess of additional contact RNA was not able to compete efficiently with additional contact CREB mimics for b"
https://openalex.org/W2028156270,"Uga3p, a member of zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor family, is required for γ-aminobutyric acid-dependent transcription of the UGA genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Members of this family bind to CGG triplets with the spacer region between the triplets being an important specificity determinant. A conserved 19-nucleotide activation element in certain UGA gene promoter regions contains a CCGN4CGG-everted repeat proposed to be the binding site of Uga3p, UAS GABA. The function of conserved nucleotides flanking the everted repeat has not been rigorously investigated. The interaction of Uga3p with UAS GABAwas characterized in terms of binding in vitro and transcriptional activation of lacZ reporter genes in vivo. Electromobility shift assays using mutantUAS GABA sequences and heterologously produced full-length Uga3p demonstrated that UAS GABAconsists of two independent Uga3p binding sites. Simultaneous occupation of both Uga3p binding sites of UAS GABAwith high affinity is essential for GABA-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo. We present evidence that the two Uga3p molecules bound to UAS GABAprobably interact with each other and show that Uga3p(1–124), previously used for binding studies, is not functionally equivalent to the full-length protein with respect to binding in vitro. We propose that the Uga3p binding site is an asymmetric site of 5′-SGCGGNWTTT-3′ (S = G or C, W = A, or T and n = no nucleotide or G). However,UAS GABA, is a palindrome containing two asymmetric Uga3p binding sites."
