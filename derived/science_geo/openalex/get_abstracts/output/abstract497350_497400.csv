https://openalex.org/W2048444585,"Background Every day, around 400 million tweets are sent worldwide, which has become a rich source for detecting, monitoring and analysing news stories and special (disaster) events. Existing research within this field follows key words attributed to an event, monitoring temporal changes in word usage. However, this method requires prior knowledge of the event in order to know which words to follow, and does not guarantee that the words chosen will be the most appropriate to monitor. Methods This paper suggests an alternative methodology for event detection using space-time scan statistics (STSS). This technique looks for clusters within the dataset across both space and time, regardless of tweet content. It is expected that clusters of tweets will emerge during spatio-temporally relevant events, as people will tweet more than expected in order to describe the event and spread information. The special event used as a case study is the 2013 London helicopter crash. Results and Conclusion A spatio-temporally significant cluster is found relating to the London helicopter crash. Although the cluster only remains significant for a relatively short time, it is rich in information, such as important key words and photographs. The method also detects other special events such as football matches, as well as train and flight delays from Twitter data. These findings demonstrate that STSS is an effective approach to analysing Twitter data for event detection."

Probiotics promote mucin production by goblet cells in the intestine. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived soluble protein, has been shown to transactivate the EGF receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells, which is required for inhibition of apoptosis and preservation of barrier function in the colon, thereby ameliorating intestinal injury and colitis. Because activation of EGFR has been shown to up-regulate mucin production in goblet cells, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. p40 activated EGFR and its downstream target, Akt, in a concentration-dependent manner in LS174T cells. p40 stimulated Muc2 gene expression and mucin production in LS174T cells, which were abolished by inhibition of EGFR kinase activity, down-regulation of EGFR expression by EGFR siRNA transfection, or suppression of Akt activation. Treatment with p40 increased mucin production in the colonic epithelium, thus thickening the mucus layer in the colon of wild type, but not of Egfrwa5 mice, which have a dominant negative mutation in the EGFR kinase domain. Furthermore, inhibition of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation suppressed the effect of p40 on increasing mucin production and protecting intestinal epithelial cells from TNF-induced apoptosis in colon organ culture. Thus, these results suggest that p40-stimulated activation of EGFR mediates up-regulation of mucin production, which may contribute to the mechanisms by which p40 protects the intestinal epithelium from injury.

Mucus plays an important role in protecting epithelial surfaces from bacterial and viral assault and mechanical damage in several systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract (1Johansson M.E.

Mucin, a major component of mucus, is a heavily O-linked glycoprotein produced by goblet cells. There are two forms of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucin, the major component of the mucus system (1Johansson M.E. Sjövall H. Hansson G.C.

The colon and the stomach have a two-layered mucus system: an inner mucus layer attached to the epithelium and an outer, unattached, loose mucus layer with MUC2 in the colon and MUC5AC and MUC6 in the stomach. The small intestine has one layer of unattached mucus containing MUC2 (7Ermund A. Schütte A. Johansson M.E. Gustafsson J.K. Hansson G.C.

Qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of mucin gene expression have been found in several diseases. For example, a defect in the inner mucus layer that allows bacteria to reach the epithelium has been found in patients with ulcerative colitis and in mouse models of colitis (9Johansson M.E. Gustafsson J.K. Holmén-Larsson J. Jabbar K.S. Xia L. Xu H. Ghishan F.K. Carvalho F.A. Gewirtz A.T. Sjövall H. Hansson G.C.

In necrotizing enterocolitis, the goblet cell number in the ileum is decreased (10McElroy S.J. Prince L.S. Weitkamp J.H. Reese J. Slaughter J.C. Polk D.B.

Animal studies have revealed that Muc2-deficient mice develop spontaneous colitis and are susceptible to experimental colitis because of increased intestinal permeability and bacterial adhesion to the mucosal cell surface (11Van der Sluis M.

Thus, mucins play a role in protection of the intestinal epithelium and in maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Probiotics have been reported to promote mucus production to enhance the host's defense against infection. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) 3The abbreviations used are: LGGL. rhamnosus GGbenzyl-α-GalNAcbenzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranosideEGFREGF receptorHBheparin-bindingPASperiodic acid-Schiff. has been shown to up-regulate Muc2 gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells (12Mattar A.F.

Int. 2002; 18: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that LGG and Lactobacillus planetarium inhibit the adherence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelial cells through induction of MUC2 and MUC3 mucin production (13Mack D.R. Michail S. Wei S. McDougall L. Hollingsworth M.A. Probiotics inhibit enteropathogenic E. coli adherence in vitro by inducing intestinal mucin gene expression.Am. J.

EGFR is a member of the ErbB family that has an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular portion that contains a tyrosine kinase domain (14Yarden Y.

We have previously purified and cloned a LGG-derived soluble protein, p40, that prevents cytokine-induced epithelial damage and apoptosis, as well as hydrogen peroxide disruption of the epithelial barrier function through stimulation of EGFR ligand release, which activates EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells (22Yan F.

Furthermore, specific delivery of p40 to the colon using hydrogel beads to protect it from degradation prevents and treats colonic epithelial cell injury and inflammation in mouse models of colitis in an EGFR-dependent manner (25Yan F. Cao H. Cover T.L. Washington M.K. Shi Y. Liu L. Chaturvedi R. Peek Jr., R.M. Wilson K.T. Polk D.B. Colon-specific delivery of a probiotic-derived soluble protein ameliorates intestinal inflammation in mice through an EGFR-dependent mechanism.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2242-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of p40 regulation of mucin production. These studies demonstrate that p40-stimulated mucin production in LS174T cells and in mouse colonic epithelium is mediated by EGFR transactivation. Our data define the mechanism by which p40 protects the intestinal epithelium from injury. The LS174T cell line (ATCC CL-188TM) is a human colon cancer cell line that exhibits characteristics of normal colonic mucosal cells, including microvilli prominent in secretory cells and the presence of intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles. LS174T cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide. Prior to all experiments, the cells were serum-starved for 16–18 h in minimal essential medium containing 0.5% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C. p40 was isolated from LGG culture supernatant, as previously described (23Seth A. Yan F. Polk D.B. Rao R.K. Probiotics ameliorate the hydrogen peroxide-induced epithelial barrier disruption by a PKC- and MAP kinase-dependent mechanism.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 294: G1060-G1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with p40 or human EGF (Pepro Tech, Inc.) in the presence or absence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (Calbiochem), or a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (Calbiochem). LS174T cells were transiently transfected with either 75 nm human EGFR siRNA (a set of four pooled siRNAs; Dharmacon) or 75 nm nontargeting siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with p40 in serum-starved medium for up to 24 h for MUC2 immunostaining and RNA isolation for real time PCR assay. Cellular lysates were collected at the end of the experiment for Western blot analysis to determine levels of EGFR expression. LS174T cells were solubilized in cell lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 1 h on ice. The scraped suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Thermo Scientific). The lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis using anti-total EGFR, anti-phospho-EGFR 1068, anti-total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Mice were kept on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle, and all animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). 6–8-week-old C57BL/6 WT and Egfrwa5 (EGFR dominant negative) (26Lee D. Cross S.H. Strunk K.E. Morgan J.E. Bailey C.L. Jackson I.J. Threadgill D.W. Wa5 is a novel ENU-induced antimorphic allele of the epidermal growth factor receptor.Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) on C57BL/6J background were gavaged with p40-containing pectin/zein beads (10 μg of p40/day/mouse) or control pectin/zein beads without p40 for 4 h or 5 days. The preparation of p40-containing pectin/zein beads was described in our previous publication (25Yan F. Cao H. Cover T.L. Washington M.K. Shi Y. Liu L. Chaturvedi R. Peek Jr., R.M. Wilson K.T. Polk D.B. Colon-specific delivery of a probiotic-derived soluble protein ameliorates intestinal inflammation in mice through an EGFR-dependent mechanism.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2242-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mice without any treatment were also used as no-treatment controls. After euthanasia, the colon was collected and opened, and the feces was removed. Then colon tissues were washed with PBS before preparation of paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed and Carnoy-fixed sections and for epithelial cell isolation. Colon explants obtained from 6–8-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were used for the organ culture, as previously described (23Seth A. Yan F. Polk D.B. Rao R.K. Probiotics ameliorate the hydrogen peroxide-induced epithelial barrier disruption by a PKC- and MAP kinase-dependent mechanism.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 294: G1060-G1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, the colon explants were cultured on NetwellTM inserts in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h before treatment with p40, murine TNF (Pepro Tech, Inc.), benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-α-GalNAc; EMD Millipore), or various combinations of these three treatments for 8 h. At the end of the experiment, colon tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight before preparing paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Mucosal lysates were prepared in PBS for a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) assay. Mouse colonic and small intestinal epithelial cells were isolated using a modified protocol (27Whitehead R.H. Demmler K. Rockman S.P. Watson N.K. Clonogenic growth of epithelial cells from normal colonic mucosa from both mice and humans.Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The colon and jejulium were incubated with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 3 mm EDTA at room temperature for 1.5 h without shaking. After removing the solution, PBS was added to the tissues. Villi and crypts were released from the tissues by vigorous shaking and then washed with PBS. To determine the percentage of epithelial cells in the isolated cell population, the cells were incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-mouse E-cadherin antibody (E-cadherin is a cell surface marker for epithelial cells) and PE-Cy5-labeled streptavidin (BD Biosciences). The cells were then fixed in 0.1% paraformaldyhyde in PBS and analyzed using multicolor flow cytometry to determine the percentage of positive cells using a BD LSRII system (BD Biosciences). LS174T cells and colon and small intestinal epithelial cells isolated from mice were solubilized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were coated on a 96-well dish with a flat bottom by incubating 1:10 dilution of proteins in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.5, at 4 °C overnight. The plate was washed with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and blocked by 10% FBS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-p40 antibody (generated by our group (23Seth A. Yan F. Polk D.B. Rao R.K. Probiotics ameliorate the hydrogen peroxide-induced epithelial barrier disruption by a PKC- and MAP kinase-dependent mechanism.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 294: G1060-G1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)) at 1:500 dilution in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The substrate solution, teramethylbenzidine (BD Biosciences) was used to develop the reaction through incubation for 30 min. This reaction was stopped by 2 n H2SO4. The OD at 450-nm wavelength was measured. Purified p40 was used to generate a concentration curve. Colon epithelial cells isolated from mice, mucosal lysates from colon organ culture, and LS174T cells were disrupted in PBS using Tissuelyser to obtain soluble proteins. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Mucous glycoprotein in soluble fractions was measured as previously reported (28Garcia M.A. Yang N. Quinton P.M. Normal mouse intestinal mucus release requires cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-dependent bicarbonate secretion.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular soluble fractions were incubated with 0.1% periodic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature. Then the Schiff reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The OD of the resulting solution at 550 nm wavelength was taken as a measure of the amount of PAS-positive product present and compared with a known standard of porcine stomach mucin (Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA was isolated from LS174T cells or colonic epithelial cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and was treated with RNase-free DNase. Reverse transcription was performed using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real time PCRs were set up by addition of 1.25 μl of the MUC2 (Mm 00439306) primer mix (containing 5 μm of reverse and forward primers; Applied Biosystems), 5 μl of diluted cDNA template, and 12.5 μl of TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix. Real time PCR was performed using the 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The data were analyzed using the Sequence Detection System V1.4.0 software. The relative abundance of GAPDH mRNA was used to normalize levels of the mRNAs of MUC2. All of the cDNA samples were analyzed in triplicate. LS174T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 2% Triton X-100 for 5 min in PBS at room temperature and blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Colonic tissue sections were deparaffinized and treated with an unmasking antigen solution (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Colonic sections were blocked using 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections and cultured cell slides were incubated with an rabbit anti-MUC2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by a FITC-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Slides using the horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody were developed using a 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with hematoxylin, and observed using light microscopy. The number of MUC2-positive cells in the distal colon tissues was determined by counting the absolute number of positive stained cells in at least 300 colonic crypts for each mouse. Slides using the FITC-labeled secondary antibody were mounted using mounting medium with DAPI and observed using fluorescence microscopy. FITC and DAPI images were taken from the same field. The thickness of the colonic attached mucus was determined by measuring the distance between the epithelial surface and the mucus surface in 20 fields for each mouse. LS174T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and stained using a PAS kit (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PAS-stained slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Apoptosis was detected in colon culture sections using the ApopTagTM in situ oligo ligation (ISOL) kit and T4 DNA ligase according to the manufacturer's guidelines (23Seth A. Yan F. Polk D.B.

Invest. 2011; 121: 2242-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The number of apoptotic cells was determined by counting the absolute number of positive stained cells in at least 100 colonic crypts/colonic explant. Statistical significance for multiple comparisons in each study was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls analysis using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). A p value < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. The data are presented as means ± S.E. Our previous studies have demonstrated that p40 transactivates EGFR by stimulating HB-EGF release in intestinal epithelial cells (24Yan F. Liu L. Dempsey P.J. Tsai Y.H. Raines E.W. Wilson C.L. Cao H.

However, whether p40 transactivates EGFR in goblet cells and stimulates mucin production as a mucosal defense mechanism against injury and inflammatory assault in then intestinal tract is unknown. Thus, this work was focused on determining the role of p40 in activation of EGFR and mucin production in goblet cells. We treated LS174T cells, a human colon cancer cell line with characteristics of normal colonic mucosal cells with p40 at various concentrations and treatment times and analyzed the phosphorylation state of EGFR and Akt, a known target of EGFR by Western blot analysis. p40 at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 50 ng/ml increased EGFR and Akt phosphorylation in LS174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). No further increase was observed by p40 at 100 ng/ml, indicating that the effects of p40 on stimulation of EGFR activation in LS174T cells are saturated by the concentrations higher than 50 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the time course of p40-stimulated EGFR and Akt phosphorylation was analyzed. p40 was able to stimulate EGFR and Akt phosphorylation at multiple time points. For example, two peaks of EGFR and Akt phosphorylation were observed: an early peak at 1 h and a later peak at 24 h after p40 at 50 ng/ml treatment (Fig. 1B). We chose to use p40 at a concentration of 50 ng/ml for the remainder of the cell culture studies, based on the dose-response analysis shown in Fig. 1A. We next applied a PAS assay to examine the intracellular mucin level in LS174T cells. p40 treatment of 6.25 to 50 ng/ml for 24 h increased mucin production in LS174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). p40 at 100 ng/ml did not further increase mucin production (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the ability of p40 to activate EGFR, and Akt in LS174T cells is saturated by this concentration. LS174T cells were also treated with human EGF at 10 and 20 ng/ml for 15 min and 24 h as positive controls for EGFR and Akt activation (Fig. 1A) and stimulation of mucin production (Fig. 1C), respectively. To test whether p40 up-regulates mucin gene expression, real time PCR analysis was performed to measure the Muc2 mRNA level in LS174T cells, which is a known mucin gene expressed in goblet cells in the colon (1Johansson M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2031433667,"Recently, the Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) and its yeast homolog Vps74p have been characterized as essential for the Golgi localization of glycosyltransferase in yeast. GOLPH3 has been identified as a new oncogene that is commonly amplified in human cancers to modulate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms of the carcinogenic signaling pathway remain largely unclear. To investigate whether the expression of GOLPH3 was involved in the glycosylation processes in mammalian cells, and whether it affected cell behavior, we performed a loss-of-function study. Cell migration was suppressed in GOLPH3 knockdown (KD) cells, and the suppression was restored by a re-introduction of the GOLPH3 gene. HPLC and LC/MS analysis showed that the sialylation of N-glycans was specifically decreased in KD cells. The specific interaction between sialyltransferases and GOLPH3 was important for the sialylation. Furthermore, overexpression of α2,6-sialyltransferase-I rescued cell migration and cellular signaling, both of which were blocked in GOLPH3 knockdown cells. These results are the first direct demonstration of the role of GOLPH3 in N-glycosylation to regulate cell biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1997281913,"Background Outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) have been reported for many times in Asia during the last decades. This emerging disease has drawn worldwide attention and vigilance. Nowadays, the prevention and control of HFMD has become an imperative issue in China. Early detection and response will be helpful before it happening, using modern information technology during the epidemic. Method In this paper, a hybrid model combining seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and nonlinear auto-regressive neural network (NARNN) is proposed to predict the expected incidence cases from December 2012 to May 2013, using the retrospective observations obtained from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention from January 2008 to November 2012. Results The best-fitted hybrid model was combined with seasonal ARIMA and NARNN with 15 hidden units and 5 delays. The hybrid model makes the good forecasting performance and estimates the expected incidence cases from December 2012 to May 2013, which are respectively −965.03, −1879.58, 4138.26, 1858.17, 4061.86 and 6163.16 with an obviously increasing trend. Conclusion The model proposed in this paper can predict the incidence trend of HFMD effectively, which could be helpful to policy makers. The usefulness of expected cases of HFMD perform not only in detecting outbreaks or providing probability statements, but also in providing decision makers with a probable trend of the variability of future observations that contains both historical and recent information."
https://openalex.org/W2051793433,"The mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) is negatively regulated by reversible phosphorylation.BCKDC kinase (BDK) inhibitors that augment BCKDC flux have been shown to reduce branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations in vivo. In the present study, we employed high-throughput screens to identify compound 3,6- dichlorobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (BT2) as a novel BDK inhibitor (IC(50) = 3.19 μM). BT2 binds to the same site in BDK as other known allosteric BDK inhibitors, including (S)-α-cholorophenylproprionate ((S)-CPP). BT2 binding to BDK triggers helix movements in the N-terminal domain, resulting in the dissociation of BDK from the BCKDC accompanied by accelerated degradation of the released kinase in vivo. BT2 shows excellent pharmacokinetics (terminal T(1⁄2) = 730 min) and metabolic stability (no degradation in 240 min), which are significantly better than those of (S)-CPP. BT2, its analog 3-chloro-6-fluorobenzo[ b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (BT2F), and a prodrug of BT2 (i.e. N-(4-acetamido-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3,6-dichlorobenzo[ b]thiophene-2-carboxamide (BT3)) significantly increase residual BCKDC activity in cultured cells and primary hepatocytes from patients and a mouse model of maple syrup urine disease. Administration of BT2 at 20 mg/kg/day to wild-type mice for 1 week leads to nearly complete dephosphorylation and maximal activation of BCKDC in heart, muscle, kidneys, and liver with reduction in plasma BCAA concentrations. The availability of benzothiophene carboxylate derivatives as stable BDK inhibitors may prove useful for the treatment of metabolic disease caused by elevated BCAA concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1971380390,"Although they play a critical role in shaping ecological communities, many threatened predator species are data-deficient. The Dhole Cuon alpinus is one such rare canid with a global population thought to be <2500 wild individuals. We assessed habitat occupancy patterns of dholes in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India, to understand ecological and anthropogenic determinants of their distribution and habitat-use. We conducted spatially replicated detection/non-detection surveys of dhole signs along forest trails at two appropriate scales: the entire landscape and a single wildlife reserve. Landscape-scale habitat occupancy was assessed across 38,728 km(2) surveying 206 grid cells of 188-km(2) each. Finer scale habitat-use within 935 km2 Bandipur Reserve was studied surveying 92 grid cells of 13-km(2) km each. We analyzed the resulting data of dhole signs using likelihood-based habitat occupancy models. The models explicitly addressed the problematic issue of imperfect detection of dhole signs during field surveys as well as potential spatial auto-correlation between sign detections made on adjacent trail segments. We show that traditional 'presence versus absence' analyses underestimated dhole habitat occupancy by 60% or 8682 km2 [naïve = 0.27; ψL(SE) = 0.68 (0.08)] in the landscape. Addressing imperfect sign detections by estimating detection probabilities [p(t)(L) (SE) = 0.12 (0.11)] was critical for reliable estimation. Similar underestimation occurred while estimating habitat-use probability at reserve-scale [naïve = 0.39; Ψs(SE) = 0.71 (0.06)]. At landscape scale, relative abundance of principal ungulate prey primarily influenced dhole habitat occupancy. Habitat-use within a reserve, however, was predominantly and negatively influenced by anthropogenic disturbance. Our results are the first rigorous assessment of dhole occupancy at multiple spatial scales with potential conservation value. The approach used in this study has potential utility for cost-effectively assessing spatial distribution and habitat-use in other species, landscapes and reserves."
https://openalex.org/W1984625698,"Systematic conservation planning is increasingly used to identify priority areas for protection in marine systems. However, ecosystem-based approaches typically use density estimates as surrogates for animal presence and spatial modeling to identify areas for protection and may not take into account daily or seasonal movements of animals. Additionally, sympatric and inter-related species are often managed separately, which may not be cost-effective. This study aims to demonstrate an evidence-based method to inform the biological basis for co-management of two sympatric species, dugongs and green sea turtles. This approach can then be used in conservation planning to delineate areas to maximize species protection.Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry was used to track eleven dugongs and ten green turtles at two geographically distinct foraging locations in Queensland, Australia to evaluate the inter- and intra-species spatial relationships and assess the efficacy of existing protection zones. Home-range analysis and bathymetric modeling were used to determine spatial use and compared with existing protection areas using GIS. Dugong and green turtle home-ranges significantly overlapped in both locations. However, both species used different core areas and differences existed between regions in depth zone use and home-range size, especially for dugongs. Both species used existing protection areas in Shoalwater Bay, but only a single tracked dugong used the existing protection area in Torres Strait.Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry can provide evidence-based information on individual animal movements to delineate relationships between dugongs and green turtles in regions where they co-occur. This information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation planning and complement more broadly based survey information. These species also use similar habitats, making complimentary co-management possible, but important differences exist between locations making it essential to customize management. This methodology could be applied on a broader scale to include other sympatric and inter-related species."
https://openalex.org/W2163002030,"Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has been proposed and verified in many cancers. The existence of osteosarcoma CSCs has been confirmed for many years and multiple surface markers have been employed to identify them. In this study, we identified CD271+ subpopulation of osteosarcoma displaying stem-like properties. CD271, known as the neural crest nerve growth factor receptor, is the marker of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and human melanoma-initiating cells. We discovered that CD271 was expressed differentially in diverse types of human osteosarcoma and stabilized cell lines. CD271+ osteosarcoma cells displayed most of the properties of CSC, such as self-renewal, differentiation, drug resistance and tumorigenicity in vivo. Nanog, Oct3/4, STAT3, DNA-PKcs, Bcl-2 and ABCG2 were more expressed in CD271+ cells compared with CD271− cells. Our study supported the osteosarcoma CSC hypothesis and, to a certain extent, revealed one of the possible mechanisms involved in maintaining CSCs properties."

Given that multiple members of the NCoR complex are misregulated at relapse, it is likely that the activity of this complex plays a role in the development of recurrent disease. Glucocorticoids are members of the steroid hormone family that mediates the transcriptional effects of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (18Schlossmacher G. Stevens A. White A. Glucocorticoid receptor-mediated apoptosis: mechanisms of resistance in cancer cells.J. Endocrinol. 2011; 211: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The bulk of inactive GR is sequestered in the cytoplasm, bound by chaperone proteins. Upon hormone binding, the GR receptor translocates into the nucleus and is recruited to glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs), where it then activates or represses transcription (19Yamamoto K.R. Steroid receptor regulated transcription of specific genes and gene networks.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 20Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5834-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other classes of nuclear hormone receptors, GR activity has not yet been shown to be mediated through the nuclear corepressor (NCoR) complex (21Ghisletti S. Huang W. Jepsen K. Benner C.

We hypothesized that TBL1XR1 may result in increased resistance to chemotherapy, specifically GC agonists and therefore be a driver of relapse in ALL. We show that decreased expression of TBL1XR1 results in resistance to glucocorticoid agonist, prednisolone, but not to other classes of chemotherapy tested. The increased prednisolone resistance is caused by a decrease in GR recruitment at gene regulatory regions, resulting in decreased glucocorticoid signaling. The decrease in GR recruitment is driven by increased levels of NCoR1 residing on the promoters of prednisolone responsive genes with increased recruitment of HDAC3, resulting in altered GR-mediated transcription. Furthermore, pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid (SAHA) resensitizes TBL1XR1-deficient cells to prednisolone by restoring GC signaling. Altogether, these data suggest that TBL1XR1 is a novel regulator of glucocorticoid signaling and a driver of drug resistance in ALL.

The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) 1:10,000 diluted in 4% nonfat dry milk PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized using ECL (GE Healthcare). CellTiter-Glo Luminescent cell viability assays (Promega) were performed on cell lines exposed to chemotherapy. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated with prednisolone (200, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 μg/ml), etoposide (0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 4, and 8 μg/ml), doxorubicin (25, 50, 75, 100, 250, and 500 nm), or 6-thioguanine (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 25, 250, and 500 μg/ml) added to the medium for 24–48 h. For time course experiments, RS4;11 control and TBL1XR1 knockdown cells were incubated with 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 300, or 500 μg/ml prednisolone for 24, 48, or 72 h. For HDAC inhibitor experiments, the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated with 1 μm SAHA for 24 h followed by prednisolone treatment for an additional 24 h. Following this, CellTiter-Glo reagent was added, and luminescence was recorded using a Flex Station 3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Each doxorubicin, etoposide, and 6-thioguanine viability assay was repeated twice in replicates of three. Prednisolone and SAHA assays were repeated three times in replicates of three. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. After a 24-h incubation with prednisolone, apoptosis was determined by annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin D staining (annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) followed by flow cytometry using the FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The percentage of annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D-positive and -negative cells were analyzed by FlowJo software (version 7.2.5; Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Each experiment was repeated three times. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. RNA was isolated from nontargeting and TBL1XR1 knockdown cell lines after treatment with vehicle or prednisolone for 8 h from three independent experiments using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quality was verified with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. In vitro transcription was completed with biotinylated UTP and CTP for labeling using the ENZO BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics). Labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix U133Plus2 microarrays according to the Affymetrix protocol. Raw Affymetrix CEL files were processed with GeneSpringGX 11.5 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) using the standard Affymetrix probe-modeling algorithm RMA. Background correction and quantile normalization were applied. Only gene probe sets with signals higher than 20 in at least one condition were further considered. Gene expression alterations between pairs of prednisolone-treated cells and vehicle-treated control cells were determined by employing a paired t test analysis on three and two paired samples in the nontargeting and TBL1XR1 knockdown lines, respectively. Multiple testing correction analysis revealed little difference, likely because of experimental limitations that result from a small sample size. t test analysis without correction was used to identify differences. In nontargeting cells, gene probe sets that were significantly altered (p ≤ 0.05) and that displayed a 2-fold induction/repression in response to prednisolone were selected. The difference between the average log-fold changes in nontargeting and TBL1XR1 knockdown cells was calculated. Only probe sets that displayed a difference of at least 25% (Δ log-fold change ≥ 0.322) between the nontargeting, and TBL1XR1 knockdown lines were considered in this analysis. Heat maps were produced using GENE-E software. Ten million cells were treated with vehicle or 500 μg/ml prednisolone for 3 h and collected for small scale biochemical cell fractionation including cytosolic, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bound fractions as previously described (25Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Loss of HCF-1: chromatin association precedes temperature-induced growth arrest of tsBN67 cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ChIP was carried out following the protocol provided by EZ-ChIP (Millipore) with few modifications. Briefly, control and TBL1XR1 knockdown Reh cells (1 × 106 cells per immunoprecipitation) were treated with vehicle or prednisolone (500 μg/ml) for three h. Proteins were then cross-linked to DNA with 1% formaldehyde (10 min at 37 °C), followed by cell lysis with 1% SDS buffer. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to the length of 200–1,000 base pairs using the Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 20 cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off. Magnetic protein G Dyna beads (life Technologies; 10007D) were used for the preclearing of chromatin and immunoprecipitation using the following antibodies: GR (Abcam; ab3579), NCoR1 (Millipore; CS207360), TBL1XR1 (Abcam; ab24551), and HDAC3 (Abcam; ab7030). For the negative control, species-specific IgG was used. DNA from protein-associated complexes, and corresponding input samples (nonimmunoprecipitated DNA) were recovered using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and assayed by real time PCR under standard conditions. Primers were targeted to the previously annotated GREs on GILZ ((A in Fig. 7b) 8694 and (B in Fig. 7b) 5131 base pairs downstream from transcription start site) and TXNIP ((C in Fig. 7b) 141 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site and (D in Fig. 7b) 3463 base pairs downstream from the transcriptional start site) genes. Written informed assent or consent was obtained from patients or their parents/guardians (as appropriate). The research and use of these samples were approved by the institutional review board at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. DNA was isolated at the time of diagnosis from lymphoblasts from patient bone marrow aspirates. Genome-wide copy number status was determined using either Affymetrix 500K or Affymetrix SNP6 arrays and Affymetrix Power Tools copy number pipeline in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). All microarrays were performed by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics & Biotechnology. Statistical analyses were performed using R, and exact Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney rank sum tests were used for significance testing. Ex vivo drug sensitivity assays were performed as previously described (26Holleman A. Cheok M.H. den Boer M.L. Yang W. Veerman A.J. Kazemier K.M. Pei D. Cheng C. Pui C.H. Relling M.V.

Med. 2004; 351: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In brief, leukemia cells were isolated at diagnosis from patient bone marrow aspirates. If the leukemia cell percentage from diagnostic bone marrow samples was less than 90%, magnetic activated cell sorting (Miltenyl Biotec, Auburn, CA) was performed to further enrich for leukemia cells. If red cell contamination was greater than 30%, red blood cell lysis was performed. The cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspended at a concentration of 2,000,000 cells/ml. Eighty microliters of this leukemia cell suspension was then plated into each experimental well of round-bottomed 96-well plates. Twenty microliters of decreasing concentrations of prednisolone were added, and the plates were incubated for 96 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the final 6 h, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml 3–4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added to each experimental well. LC50 values were determined as previously described (26Holleman A.

Our study identified six patients harboring a TBL1XR1 deletion in a total of 56 patients. These deletions vary in location either covering the TBL1XR1 gene or the region immediately upstream of the gene (Fig. 1). Gene expression data were available on a subset (46 of 56) of these patients (8Mullighan C.G. Goorha S. Radtke I. Miller C.B. Coustan-Smith E. Dalton J.D. Girtman K. Mathew S. Ma J. Pounds S.B. Su X.

Importantly, the two of three patients with relapse-specific deletions had gene expression data. We observed a significant decrease in TBL1XR1 gene expression at relapse compared diagnosis (Table 1). The overall expression of TBL1XR1 at relapse compared with diagnosis was not changed (ratio 1.084 ± 0.0540) in a cohort of 49 matched pairs (46 with overlapping copy number data plus an additional 3 patients with only gene expression data) (data not shown) (6Hogan L.E.

Furthermore, CpG promoter methylation of the TBL1XR1 gene is not altered at relapse compared with diagnosis (data not shown) (6Hogan L.E. Meyer J.A. Yang J. Wang J. Wong N. Yang W. Condos G.

https://openalex.org/W2007255205,"Background Total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) is associated with a high complication rate because it is technically demanding and involves patients compromised by cancer. Specifically, perioperative complications are more likely to occur in patients receiving preoperative irradiation. We examined the perioperative complications associated with TES in patients receiving preoperative irradiation. Methods Seventy-seven patients underwent TES between May 2010 and April 2013. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 50 patients with metastatic tumors of the thoracic spine, excluding patients with primary spinal tumors, lumbar spinal metastasis, and combined anterior and posterior approach TES. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with preoperative irradiation (RT-TES group, 18 patients) and those without preoperative irradiation (TES group, 32 patients). The following perioperative complications, occurring within 2 months of surgery, were compared between the groups: intraoperative dural injuries, epidural hematomas, deep surgical-site infections, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound dehiscence, pleural effusions, and neurological deficits. Results Significant differences in patient characteristics were not observed between the RT-TES and TES groups. Perioperative TES complications occurred in 20/50 patients (40.0%). The complication rate in the RT-TES group was 77.8% (14 out of 18), threefold higher than the 18.8% (6 out of 32) in the TES group (P<0.01). The incidence of complications, including intraoperative dural injuries, postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, wound dehiscence, and pleural effusions, was significantly higher in the RT-TES group (P<0.01). Conclusion The perioperative complication rate associated with TES for spinal metastasis was significantly higher among patients receiving preoperative irradiation than among those not receiving preoperative irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1997855264,"Rodents have primary and secondary motor cortices that are involved in the execution of voluntary movements via their direct and parallel projections to the spinal cord. However, it is unclear whether the rodent secondary motor cortex has any motor function distinct from the primary motor cortex to properly control voluntary movements. In the present study, we quantitatively examined neuronal activity in the caudal forelimb area (CFA) of the primary motor cortex and rostral forelimb area (RFA) of the secondary motor cortex in head-fixed rats performing forelimb movements (pushing, holding, and pulling a lever). We found virtually no major differences between CFA and RFA neurons, regardless of neuron subtypes, not only in their basal spiking properties but also in the time-course, amplitude, and direction preference of their functional activation for simple forelimb movements. However, the RFA neurons, as compared with the CFA neurons, showed obviously a greater susceptibility of their functional activation to an alteration in a behavioral situation, a 'rewarding' response that leads to reward or a 'consummatory' response that follows reward water, which might be accompanied by some internal adaptations without affecting the motor outputs. Our results suggest that, although the CFA and RFA neurons commonly process fundamental motor information to properly control forelimb movements, the RFA neurons may be functionally differentiated to integrate motor information with internal state information for an adaptation to goal-directed behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2049295538,"Serum microRNAs hold great promise as easily accessible and measurable biomarkers of disease. In prostate cancer, serum miRNA signatures have been associated with the presence of disease as well as correlated with previously validated risk models. However, it is unclear whether miRNAs can provide independent prognostic information beyond current risk models. Here, we focus on a group of low-risk prostate cancer patients who were eligible for active surveillance, but chose surgery. A major criteria for the low risk category is a Gleason score of 6 or lower based on pre-surgical biopsy. However, a third of these patients are upgraded to Gleason 7 on post surgical pathological analysis. Both in a discovery and a validation cohort, we find that pre-surgical serum levels of miR-19, miR-345 and miR-519c-5p can help identify these patients independent of their pre-surgical age, PSA, stage, and percent biopsy involvement. A combination of the three miRNAs increased the area under a receiver operator characteristics curve from 0.77 to 0.94 (p<0.01). Also, when combined with the CAPRA risk model the miRNA signature significantly enhanced prediction of patients with Gleason 7 disease. In-situ hybridizations of matching tumors showed miR-19 upregulation in transformed versus normal-appearing tumor epithelial, but independent of tumor grade suggesting an alternative source for the increase in serum miR-19a/b levels or the release of pre-existing intracellular miR-19a/b upon progression. Together, these data show that serum miRNAs can predict relatively small steps in tumor progression improving the capacity to predict disease risk and, therefore, potentially drive clinical decisions in prostate cancer patients. It will be important to validate these findings in a larger multi-institutional study as well as with independent methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W2010907636,"MicroRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in a variety of biological processes including stem cell differentiation and function. Human foetal femur derived skeletal stem cells (SSCs) display enhanced proliferation and multipotential capacity indicating excellent potential as candidates for tissue engineering applications. This study has examined the expression and role of miRs in human foetal femur derived SSC differentiation along chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Cells isolated from the epiphyseal region of the foetal femur expressed higher levels of genes associated with chondrogenesis while cells from the foetal femur diaphyseal region expressed higher levels of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition to the difference in osteogenic and chondrogenic gene expression, epiphyseal and diaphyseal cells displayed distinct miRs expression profiles. miR-146a was found to be expressed by human foetal femur diaphyseal cells at a significantly enhanced level compared to epiphyseal populations and was predicted to target various components of the TGF-β pathway. Examination of miR-146a function in foetal femur cells confirmed regulation of protein translation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, important TGF-β and activin ligands signal transducers following transient overexpression in epiphyseal cells. The down-regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 following overexpression of miR-146a resulted in an up-regulation of the osteogenesis related gene RUNX2 and down-regulation of the chondrogenesis related gene SOX9. The current findings indicate miR-146a plays an important role in skeletogenesis through attenuation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 function and provide further insight into the role of miRs in human skeletal stem cell differentiation modulation with implications therein for bone reparation."
https://openalex.org/W2056968394,"Siglec-E is a sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin expressed on murine myeloid cells. It has recently been shown to function as a negative regulator of β2-integrin-dependent neutrophil recruitment to the lung following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we demonstrate that siglec-E promoted neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following CD11b β2-integrin ligation with fibrinogen in a sialic acid-dependent manner, but it had no effect on ROS triggered by a variety of other stimulants. Siglec-E promotion of ROS was likely mediated via Akt activation, because siglec-E-deficient neutrophils plated on fibrinogen exhibited reduced phosphorylation of Akt, and the Akt inhibitor, MK2206, blocked fibrinogen-induced ROS. In vivo imaging showed that siglec-E also promoted ROS in acutely inflamed lungs following exposure of mice to LPS. Importantly, siglec-E-promoted ROS were required for its inhibitory function, as the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, reversed the siglec-E-mediated suppression of neutrophil recruitment and blocked neutrophil ROS production in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that siglec-E functions as an inhibitory receptor of neutrophils via positive regulation of NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production. Our findings have implications for the inhibitory role of siglec-9 on human neutrophils in sepsis and acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2082849854,"The scleractinian coral Acropora millepora is one of the most studied species from the Great Barrier Reef. This species has been used to understand evolutionary, immune and developmental processes in cnidarians. It has also been subject of several ecological studies in order to elucidate reef responses to environmental changes such as temperature rise and ocean acidification (OA). In these contexts, several nucleic acid resources were made available. When combined to a recent proteomic analysis of the coral skeletal organic matrix (SOM), they enabled the identification of several skeletal matrix proteins, making A. millepora into an emerging model for biomineralization studies. Here we describe the skeletal microstructure of A. millepora skeleton, together with a functional and biochemical characterization of its occluded SOM that focuses on the protein and saccharidic moieties. The skeletal matrix proteins show a large range of isoelectric points, compositional patterns and signatures. Besides secreted proteins, there are a significant number of proteins with membrane attachment sites such as transmembrane domains and GPI anchors as well as proteins with integrin binding sites. These features show that the skeletal proteins must have strong adhesion properties in order to function in the calcifying space. Moreover this data suggest a molecular connection between the calcifying epithelium and the skeletal tissue during biocalcification. In terms of sugar moieties, the enrichment of the SOM in arabinose is striking, and the monosaccharide composition exhibits the same signature as that of mucus of acroporid corals. Finally, we observe that the interaction of the acetic acid soluble SOM on the morphology of in vitro grown CaCO3 crystals is very pronounced when compared with the calcifying matrices of some mollusks. In light of these results, we wish to commend Acropora millepora as a model for biocalcification studies in scleractinians, from molecular and structural viewpoints."
https://openalex.org/W1986910044,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is the world most productive sugar producing crop, making an understanding of its stress physiology key to increasing both sugar and ethanol production. To understand the behavior and salt tolerance mechanisms of sugarcane, two cultivars commonly used in Brazilian agriculture, RB867515 and RB855536, were submitted to salt stress for 48 days. Physiological parameters including net photosynthesis, water potential, dry root and shoot mass and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of leaves were determined. Control plants of the two cultivars showed similar values for most traits apart from higher root dry mass in RB867515. Both cultivars behaved similarly during salt stress, except for MDA levels for which there was a delay in the response for cultivar RB867515. Analysis of leaf macro- and micronutrients concentrations was performed and the concentration of Mn2+ increased on day 48 for both cultivars. In parallel, to observe the effects of salt stress on protein levels in leaves of the RB867515 cultivar, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MS analysis was performed. Four proteins were differentially expressed between control and salt-treated plants. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase was down-regulated, a germin-like protein and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase showed increased expression levels under salt stress, and heat-shock protein 70 was expressed only in salt-treated plants. These proteins are involved in energy metabolism and defense-related responses and we suggest that they may be involved in protection mechanisms against salt stress in sugarcane."
https://openalex.org/W2062935394,"The East African jumping spider Evarcha culicivora feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by preferentially preying upon blood-fed Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of human malaria1, using the distinct resting posture and engorged abdomen characteristic of these specific prey as key elements for their recognition. To understand perceptual categorization of objects by these spiders, we investigated their predatory behavior toward different digital stimuli - abstract ‘stick figure’ representations of Anopheles constructed solely by known key identification elements, disarranged versions of these, as well as non-prey items and detailed images of alternative prey. We hypothesized that the abstract images representing Anopheles would be perceived as potential prey, and would be preferred to those of non-preferred prey. Spiders perceived the abstract stick figures of Anopheles specifically as their preferred prey, attacking them significantly more often than non-preferred prey, even when the comprising elements of the Anopheles stick figures were disarranged and disconnected from each other. However, if the relative angles between the elements of the disconnected stick figures of Anopheles were altered, the otherwise identical set of elements was no longer perceived as prey. These data show that E. culicivora is capable of making discriminations based on abstract concepts, such as the hypothetical angle formed by discontinuous elements. It is this inter-element angle rather than resting posture that is important for correct identification of Anopheles. Our results provide a glimpse of the underlying processes of object recognition in animals with minute brains, and suggest that these spiders use a local processing approach for object recognition, rather than a holistic or global approach. This study provides an excellent basis for a comparative analysis on feature extraction and detection by animals as diverse as bees and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2090701945,"A persistent debate in population ecology concerns the relative importance of environmental stochasticity and density dependence in determining variability in adult year-class strength, which contributes to future reproduction as well as potential yield in exploited populations. Apart from the strength of the processes, the timing of density regulation may affect how stochastic variation, for instance through climate, translates into changes in adult abundance. In this study, we develop a life-cycle model for the population dynamics of a large marine fish population, Northeast Arctic cod, to disentangle the effects of density-independent and density-dependent processes on early life-stages, and to quantify the strength of compensatory density dependence in the population. The model incorporates information from scientific surveys and commercial harvest, and dynamically links multiple effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on all life-stages, from eggs to spawners. Using a state-space approach we account for observation error and stochasticity in the population dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of density-dependent survival in juveniles, indicating that this period of the life cycle largely determines the compensatory capacity of the population. Density regulation at the juvenile life-stage dampens the impact of stochastic processes operating earlier in life such as environmental impacts on the production of eggs and climate-dependent survival of larvae. The timing of stochastic versus regulatory processes thus plays a crucial role in determining variability in adult abundance. Quantifying the contribution of environmental stochasticity and compensatory mechanisms in determining population abundance is essential for assessing population responses to climate change and exploitation by humans."
https://openalex.org/W1991864495,"Chloride (Cl-) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth, but can be toxic at high concentrations resulting in reduced growth and yield. Although saline soils are generally dominated by both sodium (Na+) and Cl- ions, compared to Na+ toxicity, very little is known about physiological and genetic control mechanisms of tolerance to Cl- toxicity. In hydroponics and field studies, a bread wheat mapping population was tested to examine the relationships between physiological traits [Na+, potassium (K+) and Cl- concentration] involved in salinity tolerance (ST) and seedling growth or grain yield, and to elucidate the genetic control mechanism of plant Cl- accumulation using a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis approach. Plant Na+ or Cl- concentration were moderately correlated (genetically) with seedling biomass in hydroponics, but showed no correlations with grain yield in the field, indicating little value in selecting for ion concentration to improve ST. In accordance with phenotypic responses, QTL controlling Cl- accumulation differed entirely between hydroponics and field locations, and few were detected in two or more environments, demonstrating substantial QTL-by-environment interactions. The presence of several QTL for Cl- concentration indicated that uptake and accumulation was a polygenic trait. A major Cl- concentration QTL (5A; barc56/gwm186) was identified in three field environments, and accounted for 27-32% of the total genetic variance. Alignment between the 5A QTL interval and its corresponding physical genome regions in wheat and other grasses has enabled the search for candidate genes involved in Cl- transport, which is discussed."

Myc and Bcl2 are differentially expressed in U-2932, TMD-8, OCI-Ly10 and Granta-519, but only U-2932 cells over-express mutated p53. Alisertib [MLN8237 or M], a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase, was synergistic with vincristine [VCR] and rituximab [R] for inhibition of cell proliferation, abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints and enhanced apoptosis versus single agent or doublet therapy. A DLBCL (U-2932) mouse model showed tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of ∼10–20% (p = 0.001) for M, VCR and M-VCR respectively, while R alone showed ∼50% TGI (p = 0.001). M-R and VCR-R led to tumor regression [TR], but relapsed 10 days after discontinuing therapy. In contrast, M-VCR-R demonstrated TR with no relapse >40 days after stopping therapy with a Kaplan-Meier survival of 100%. Genes that are modulated by M-VCR-R (CENP-C, Auroras) play a role in centromere-kinetochore function in an attempt to maintain mitosis in the presence of synthetic lethality. Together, our data suggest that the interaction between alisertib plus VCR plus rituximab is synergistic and synthetic lethal in Myc and Bcl-2 co-expressing DLBCL. Alisertib plus vincristine plus rituximab [M-VCR-R] may represent a new strategy for DLBCL therapy."

Protein displacement was dependent on the ATPase-driven function of the helicase and unique properties of RPA. Further biochemical studies demonstrated that the shelterin proteins TRF1 and TRF2, which preferentially bind the telomeric repeat found at chromosome ends, effectively block FANCJ from unwinding the forked duplex telomeric substrate. RPA, but not the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein or shelterin factor Pot1, stimulated FANCJ ejection of TRF1 from the telomeric DNA substrate. FANCJ was also able to displace TRF2 from the telomeric substrate in an RPA-dependent manner. The stimulation of helicase-catalyzed protein displacement is also observed with the DNA helicase RECQ1, suggesting a conserved functional interaction of RPA-interacting helicases. These findings suggest that partnerships between RPA and interacting human DNA helicases may greatly enhance their ability to dislodge proteins bound to duplex DNA, an activity that is likely to be highly relevant to their biological roles in DNA metabolism. Understanding how cellular machinery deals with chromosomal genome complexity is an important question because protein bound to DNA may affect various cellular processes of nucleic acid metabolism. DNA helicases are at the forefront of such processes, yet there is only limited knowledge how they remodel protein-DNA complexes and how these mechanisms are regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2048798913,"The type IV secretion system (T4SS) is a major virulence determinant of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. The CagL protein is a specialized adhesin of the corresponding T4SS pilus, which establishes initial contact with the integrin β1 receptor on host target cells. Recent studies proposed that Y58 and E59 amino acid polymorphisms in CagL increase the virulence of H. pylori strains by enhanced translocation and phosphorylation of the CagA effector protein. These polymorphisms were therefore correlated with an increased risk of gastric cancer development. Here we show that the Y58/E59 motif, which is located in a loop connecting two α-helices, and corresponding polymorphisms could influence the function of CagL. However, expression of isogenic CagL Y58/E59 variants in H. pylori strain 26695 significantly blocked the translocation and phosphorylation of CagA as compared to complemented wild-type CagL. These results suggest that the function of the T4SS for delivery of CagA is turned-off by the Y58/E59 mutation in CagL. This activity appears to be similar to the one recently described for another T4SS pilus protein, CagY, which is also sufficient to cause gain or loss of T4SS function. These data support the hypothesis that certain mutations in CagL or recombination events in CagY may serve as a sort of molecular switch or perhaps rheostat in the T4SS, which could alter the function of the pilus and ""tunes"" injection of CagA and host pro-inflammatory responses, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2087293126,"The TWEAK-fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) system is a critical regulator of denervation-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Although the expression of Fn14 is a rate-limiting step in muscle atrophy on denervation, mechanisms regulating gene expression of Fn14 remain unknown. Methylation of CpG sites within promoter region is an important epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing. Our study demonstrates that Fn14 promoter contains a CpG island close to transcription start site. Fn14 promoter also contains multiple consensus DNA sequence for transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP1) and specificity protein 1 (SP1). Denervation diminishes overall genomic DNA methylation and causes hypomethylation at specific CpG sites in Fn14 promoter leading to the increased gene expression of Fn14 in skeletal muscle. Abundance of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its interaction with Fn14 promoter are repressed in denervated skeletal muscle of mice. Overexpression of Dnmt3a inhibits the gene expression of Fn14 and attenuates skeletal muscle atrophy upon denervation. Denervation also causes the activation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and ERK5 MAPKs and AP1 and SP1, which stimulate the expression of Fn14 in skeletal muscle. Collectively, our study provides novel evidence that Dnmt3a and MAPK signaling regulate the levels of Fn14 in skeletal muscle on denervation."
https://openalex.org/W1977758071,"Recent studies have linked necrotic cell death and proteolysis of inflammatory proteins to the adaptive immune response mediated by the lysosome-destabilizing adjuvants, alum and Leu-Leu-OMe (LLOMe). However, the mechanism by which lysosome-destabilizing agents trigger necrosis and proteolysis of inflammatory proteins is poorly understood. The proteasome is a cellular complex that has been shown to regulate both necrotic cell death and proteolysis of inflammatory proteins. We found that the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors, MG115 and MG132, block lysosome rupture, degradation of inflammatory proteins and necrotic cell death mediated by the lysosome-destabilizing peptide LLOMe. However, non-aldehyde proteasome inhibitors failed to prevent LLOMe-induced cell death suggesting that aldehyde proteasome inhibitors triggered a pleotropic effect. We have previously shown that cathepsin C controls lysosome rupture, necrotic cell death and the adaptive immune response mediated by LLOMe. Using recombinant cathepsin C, we found that aldehyde proteasome inhibitors directly block cathepsin C, which presumably prevents LLOMe toxicity. The cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074-Me also blocks lysosome rupture and necrotic cell death mediated by a wide range of necrosis inducers, including LLOMe. Using cathepsin-deficient cells and recombinant cathepsins, we demonstrate that the cathepsins B and C are not required for the CA-074-Me block of necrotic cell death. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that lysosome-destabilizing adjuvants trigger an early proteolytic cascade, involving cathepsin C and a CA-074-Me-dependent protease. Identification of these early events leading to lysosome rupture will be crucial in our understanding of processes controlling necrotic cell death and immune responses mediated by lysosome-destabilizing adjuvants."

This study evaluated associations between smoking cessation and continued smoking with incident diabetes and IFG three years after a quit attempt. The 1504 smokers (58% female) were mean (standard deviation) 44.7 (11.1) years old and smoked 21.4 (8.9) cigarettes/day. Of 914 participants with year 3 data, the 238 abstainers had greater weight gain, increase in waist circumference, and increase in fasting glucose levels than the 676 continuing smokers (p ≤ 0.008). In univariate analyses, Year 3 abstinence was associated with incident diabetes (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.44-4.67, p = .002; 4.3% absolute excess) and IFG (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.74-3.41, p<0.0001; 15.6% absolute excess). In multivariate analyses, incident diabetes was associated independently with older age (p = 0.0002), higher baseline body weight (p = 0.021), weight gain (p = 0.023), baseline smoking rate (p = 0.008), baseline IFG (p<0.0001), and baseline hemoglobin A1C (all p<0.0001). Smoking more at baseline predicted incident diabetes among eventual abstainers (p<0.0001); weighing more at baseline predicted incident diabetes among continuing smokers (p = 0.0004). Quitting smoking is associated with increased diabetes and IFG risk. Independent risk factors include older age, baseline body weight, baseline glycemic status, and heavier pre-quit smoking. These findings may help target smokers for interventions to prevent dysglycemia.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00332644."
https://openalex.org/W1990334913,"Translation of mRNA plays a critical role in consolidation of long-term memory. Here, we report that markers of initiation of mRNA translation are activated during training for contextual memory and that they undergo diurnal oscillation in the mouse hippocampus with maximal activity observed during the daytime (zeitgeber time 4-8 h). Phosphorylation and activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), ribosomal protein S6, and eIF4F cap-complex formation, all of which are markers for translation initiation, were higher in the hippocampus during the daytime compared with night. The circadian oscillation in markers of mRNA translation was lost in memory-deficient transgenic mice lacking calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclases. Moreover, disruption of the circadian rhythm blocked diurnal oscillations in eIF4E, 4EBP1, rpS6, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and impaired memory consolidation. Furthermore, repeated inhibition of translation in the hippocampus 48 h after contextual training with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin impaired memory persistence. We conclude that repeated activation of markers of translation initiation in hippocampus during the circadian cycle might be critical for memory persistence."

The NDUFVI knockdown enhanced C2C12 myogenesis by decreasing the NAD+/NADH ratio and subsequently inactivating SIRT1 and SIRT1 activators (pyruvate, SRT1720, and resveratrol) abolished the NDUFV1 knockdown-induced myogenesis enhancement.

The mitochondrial OXPHOS system is composed of five complexes: complex I (CI, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), II (CII, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), III (CIII, ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), IV (CIV, cytochrome c oxidase), and V (CV, ATP synthase). Two electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to CI and CII, respectively, and subsequently to ubiquinone, CIII, cytochrome c, and CIV, thus generating proton a gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane that is utilized by CV for ATP synthesis.

These findings create a paradox for the SIRT1-PGC-1α pathway in mitochondrial biogenesis during skeletal myogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the role of mitochondrial function in skeletal myogenesis and insulin signaling after NDUFV1 knockdown. Here we demonstrate that NDUFV1 knockdown enhances skeletal myogenesis by lowering the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and then inactivating SIRT1. In addition, we show that NDUFV1 knockdown blunts the insulin-elicited activation of insulin receptor β (IRβ) through PTP1B up-regulation, which supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction is a causative factor of insulin resistance. In addition, we demonstrate that SIRT1 is not required for mitochondrial biogenesis during skeletal myogenesis.

Confluent C2C12 cells were differentiated into myotubes by incubating them with DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (Invitrogen) and refeeding them every 24 h. C2C12 myotubes were co-stained with an anti-MyHC antibody and DAPI and observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). The myogenic index was determined as the average number of nuclei from the myosin heavy chain (MyHC)-positive myotubes in five separate images. siRNA oligomers targeting NDUFV1 (si-NDUFV1), NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 7 (NDUFS7; si-NDUFS7), and a scrambled oligomer (si-control) were obtained from Invitrogen. siRNA oligomers targeting SIRT1 (si-SIRT1) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (si-PTP1B) were purchased from Ambion. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with 50 nm siRNA by electroporation according to the protocol of electroporator MP-100 (Invitrogen).

After microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the whole cell lysates (supernatant) were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Antigens were visualized by sequential treatment with specific antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit. C2C12 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) and primary antibodies, and the primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells were also incubated with DAPI for 10 min and then observed with a LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl ZEISS) or a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The whole cell lysates (1∼2 mg of total protein) were incubated with specific antibodies (1∼3 μg) for 1 h and then with 50 μl of a protein A-agarose bead (Roche Applied Science) slurry overnight. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed using immunoblotting. Table 1 shows the information on the antibodies used for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The FLAG-SIRT1 and FLAG-SIRT1 H355A genes were kindly provided by Professor Soo-Jong Um at Sejong University, and the myogenin- and creatine kinase promoter-luciferase reporter genes were provided by Professor Jeong-Ho Hong at Korea University. The mitsugumin 53 (MG53) promoter-luciferase reporter gene was previously generated (40Lee C.S. Yi J.S. Jung S.Y. Kim B.W. Lee N.R. Choo H.J. Jang S.Y. Han J. Chi S.G. Park M. Lee J.H. Ko Y.G.

Gene transfection was performed using electroporation according to the protocol of electroporator MP-100 (Invitrogen) for C2C12 myoblasts. Luciferase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Labsystems). We normalized the luciferase activity to the activity of coexpressed β-galactosidase. To calculate the relative luciferase activity, we divided each normalized luciferase activity by that of the empty vector-transfected cells. The mitochondrial OCR and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 myoblasts and 4-day-differentiated myotubes were cultured on an XF assay plate at a density of 50,000 cells per well. After 24 h the cells were washed and incubated with DMEM without bicarbonate in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 h at 37 °C. For calibration, the sensor cartridge was loaded into an XF24 analyzer, and after calibration was complete, the assay plate was loaded into the XF24 analyzer. Oligomycin (5 mg/ml), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (5 mm), and rotenone (1 mm) were automatically injected according to priority. OCR and ECAR were automatically calculated and recorded by the Seahorse XF24 software. For mitochondria isolation, C2C12 myotubes were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 600 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; the resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a discontinuous gradient consisting of 50% w/v and 40% w/v and 20% w/v sucrose containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g in an SW41 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. Mitochondria were collected at the 40–50% sucrose interface. Mitochondria (80 μg of protein) were prepared from C2C12 myoblasts and analyzed for their OXPHOS I, II, and IV activities according to the manufacturer's protocol (Mitosciences). In addition, OXPHOS III activity was estimated by the reduction of oxidized cytochrome c at 550 nm as described previously (41Spinazzi M. Casarin A. Pertegato V. Salviati L. Angelini C. Assessment of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities on tissues and cultured cells.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Intracellular ATP was measured as previously described (42Kim B.W. Choo H.J. Lee J.W. Kim J.H. Ko Y.G. Extracellular ATP is generated by ATP synthase complex in adipocyte lipid rafts.Exp. Mol. Med. 2004; 36: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After removal of the medium, the residual C2C12 cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, and the lysates were neutralized by the addition of the same volume of 0.1 n HCl. Aliquots (50 μl) of the cell lysates were used to determine intracellular ATP content, and ATP levels were measured using the bioluminescence assay according to the protocol provided with the ATP determination kit (Sigma). C2C12 cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, and the lysates were neutralized by the addition of the same volume of 0.1 n HCl. The lysates were then neutralized with a 110 volume of 4 m KOH and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant (10 μl) was used to determine the intracellular lactate and pyruvate levels. The contents of pyruvate were detected using assay kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioVision). To quantify the lactate level, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. After sonication for 10 s, the lysates were concentrated using Centricon filters (Millipore) with a 10-kDa cutoff. The lactate contents were measured using a lactate assay kit (BioVision) according to manufacturer's protocol. The contents of pyruvate and lactate were normalized to the protein amount. C2C12 cells were incubated with serum-free media containing 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (10 μm, Invitrogen) for 20 min, scraped off, and then transferred to 96-well plates. The cells were incubated for the indicated times with Krebs-HEPES buffer, and then fluorescence was monitored using a UV spectrofluorophotometer (excitation, 480 nm; emission, 530 nm). Approximately 5 × 105 C2C12 cells were transfected with siRNAs, and then 5,000 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and maintained in 10% FBS-containing DMEM for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured using a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay with MTS (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular NAD+ and NADH concentrations were determined according to the protocol of the NAD+/NADH assay kit (Bioassay ECND-100). The concentration of NAD+ (or NADH) was obtained by spectrophotometrically measuring the rate of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetra"

Identifying clinical subtypes among patients experiencing COPD exacerbations (ECOPD) could help better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in exacerbations, establish different strategies of treatment, and improve the process of care and patient prognosis. The objective of this study was to identify subtypes of ECOPD patients attending emergency departments using clinical variables and to validate the results using several outcomes. We evaluated data collected as part of the IRYSS-COPD prospective cohort study conducted in 16 hospitals in Spain. Variables collected from ECOPD patients attending one of the emergency departments included arterial blood gases, presence of comorbidities, previous COPD treatment, baseline severity of COPD, and previous hospitalizations for ECOPD. Patient subtypes were identified by combining results from multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis. Results were validated using key outcomes of ECOPD evolution. Four ECOPD subtypes were identified based on the severity of the current exacerbation and general health status (largely a function of comorbidities): subtype A (n = 934), neither high comorbidity nor severe exacerbation; subtype B (n = 682), moderate comorbidities; subtype C (n = 562), severe comorbidities related to mortality; and subtype D (n = 309), very severe process of exacerbation, significantly related to mortality and admission to an intensive care unit. Subtype D experienced the highest rate of mortality, admission to an intensive care unit and need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation, followed by subtype C. Subtypes A and B were primarily related to other serious complications. Hospitalization rate was more than 50% for all the subtypes, although significantly higher for subtypes C and D than for subtypes A and B. These results could help identify characteristics to categorize ECOPD patients for more appropriate care, and help test interventions and treatments in subgroups with poor evolution and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2006792241,"Seed germination is a crucial stage in the life history of a species because it represents the pathway from adult to offspring, and it can affect the distribution and abundance of species in communities. In this study, we examined the effects of phylogenetic, life history and environmental factors on seed germination of 134 common species from an alpine/subalpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In one-way ANOVAs, phylogenetic groups (at or above order) explained 13.0% and 25.9% of the variance in germination percentage and mean germination time, respectively; life history attributes, such as seed size, dispersal mode, explained 3.7%, 2.1% of the variance in germination percentage and 6.3%, 8.7% of the variance in mean germination time, respectively; the environmental factors temperature and habitat explained 4.7%, 1.0% of the variance in germination percentage and 13.5%, 1.7% of the variance in mean germination time, respectively. Our results demonstrated that elevated temperature would lead to a significant increase in germination percentage and an accelerated germination. Multi-factorial ANOVAs showed that the three major factors contributing to differences in germination percentage and mean germination time in this alpine/subalpine meadow were phylogenetic attributes, temperature and seed size (explained 10.5%, 4.7% and 1.4% of the variance in germination percentage independently, respectively; and explained 14.9%, 13.5% and 2.7% of the variance in mean germination time independently, respectively). In addition, there were strong associations between phylogenetic group and life history attributes, and between life history attributes and environmental factors. Therefore, germination variation are constrained mainly by phylogenetic inertia in a community, and seed germination variation correlated with phylogeny is also associated with life history attributes, suggesting a role of niche adaptation in the conservation of germination variation within lineages. Meanwhile, selection can maintain the association between germination behavior and the environmental conditions within a lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2034595413,"Hyperkalemia is an important cause of membrane depolarization in renal failure. A recent theoretical model of axonal excitability explains the effects of potassium on threshold electrotonus, but predicts changes in superexcitability in the opposite direction to those observed. To resolve this contradiction we assessed the relationship between serum potassium and motor axon excitability properties in 38 volunteers with normal potassium levels. Most threshold electrotonus measures were strongly correlated with potassium, and superexcitability decreased at higher potassium levels (P = 0.016), contrary to the existing model. Improved modelling of potassium effects was achieved by making the potassium currents obey the constant-field theory, and by making the potassium permeabilities proportional to external potassium, as has been observed in vitro. This new model also accounted well for the changes in superexcitability and other excitability measures previously reported in renal failure. These results demonstrate the importance of taking potassium levels into account when assessing axonal membrane dysfunction by excitability testing, and provide evidence that potassium currents are activated by external potassium in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2094304778,"Veterinary nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria cause increased morbidity, higher cost and length of treatment and increased zoonotic risk because of the difficulty in treating them. In this study, an individual-based model was developed to investigate the effects of movements of canine patients among ten areas (transmission points) within a veterinary teaching hospital, and the effects of these movements on transmission of antibiotic susceptible and resistant pathogens. The model simulates contamination of transmission points, healthcare workers, and patients as well as the effects of decontamination of transmission points, disinfection of healthcare workers, and antibiotic treatments of canine patients. The model was parameterized using data obtained from hospital records, information obtained by interviews with hospital staff, and the published literature. The model suggested that transmission resulting from contact with healthcare workers was common, and that certain transmission points (housing wards, diagnostics room, and the intensive care unit) presented higher risk for transmission than others (lobby and surgery). Sensitivity analyses using a range of parameter values demonstrated that the risk of acquisition of colonization by resistant pathogens decreased with shorter patient hospital stays (P<0.0001), more frequent decontamination of transmission points and disinfection of healthcare workers (P<0.0001) and better compliance of healthcare workers with hygiene practices (P<0.0001). More frequent decontamination of heavily trafficked transmission points was especially effective at reducing transmission of the model pathogen."

We previously reported that CsyB from Aspergillus oryzae forms α-pyrone csypyrone B compounds when expressed in A. oryzae. Feeding experiments of labeled acetates indicated that a fatty acyl starter is involved in the reaction catalyzed by CsyB. Here we report the in vivo and in vitro reconstitution analysis of CsyB. When CsyB was expressed in Escherichia coli, we observed the production of 3-acetyl-4-hydroxy-α-pyrones with saturated or unsaturated straight aliphatic chains of C9–C17 in length at the 6 position. Subsequent in vitro analysis using recombinant CsyB revealed that CsyB could accept butyryl-CoA as a starter substrate and malonyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA as extender substrates to form 3-acetyl-4-hydroxy-6-propyl-α-pyrone. CsyB also afforded dehydroacetic acid from two molecules of acetoacetyl-CoA. Furthermore, synthetic N-acetylcysteamine thioester of β-ketohexanoic acid was converted to 3-butanoyl-4-hydroxy-6-propyl-α-pyrone by CsyB. These results therefore confirmed that CsyB catalyzed the synthesis of β-ketoacyl-CoA from the reaction of the starter fatty acyl CoA thioesters with malonyl-CoA as the extender through decarboxylative condensation and further coupling with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-acetyl-4-hydroxy-6-alkyl-α-pyrone.

https://openalex.org/W1999363188,"This study evaluated the effects of carbon ion and X-ray radiation and the tumor microenvironment on the migration of glioma and endothelial cells, a key process in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis during cancer progression. C6 glioma and human microvascular endothelial cells were treated with conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cells irradiated at a range of doses and the migration of both cell types, tube formation by endothelial cells, as well as the expression and secretion of migration-related proteins were evaluated. Exposure to X-ray radiation-conditioned medium induced dose-dependent increases in cell migration and tube formation, which were accompanied by an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression. However, glioma cells treated with conditioned medium of cells irradiated at a carbon ion dose of 4.0 Gy showed a marked decrease in migratory potential and VEGF secretion relative to non-irradiated cells. The application of recombinant VEGF165 stimulated migration in glioma and endothelial cells, which was associated with increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861, suggesting that the suppression of cell migration by carbon ion radiation could be via VEGF-activated FAK signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate that carbon ion may be superior to X-ray radiation for inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through modulation of VEGF level in the glioma microenvironment."

In the present work, we have compared the IGS molecular organizations in two divergent species of Fagaceae, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus suber, aiming to comprehend the evolution of the IGS sequences within the family. Self- and cross-hybridization FISH was done on representative species of the Fagaceae. The IGS length variability and the methylation level of 18 and 25S rRNA genes were assessed in representatives of three genera of this family: Fagus, Quercus and Castanea. The intergenic spacers in Beech and Cork Oak showed similar overall organizations comprising putative functional elements needed for rRNA gene activity and containing a non-transcribed spacer (NTS), a promoter region, and a 5'-external transcribed spacer. In the NTS: the sub-repeats structure in Beech is more organized than in Cork Oak, sharing some short motifs which results in the lowest sequence similarity of the entire IGS; the AT-rich region differed in both spacers by a GC-rich block inserted in Cork Oak. The 5'-ETS is the region with the higher similarity, having nonetheless different lengths. FISH with the NTS-5'-ETS revealed fainter signals in cross-hybridization in agreement with the divergence between genera. The diversity of IGS lengths revealed variants from ∼ 2 kb in Fagus, and Quercus up to 5.3 kb in Castanea, and a lack of correlation between the number of variants and the number of rDNA loci in several species. Methylation of 25S Bam HI site was confirmed in all species and detected for the first time in the 18S of Q. suber and Q. faginea. These results provide important clues for the evolutionary trends of the rDNA 25S-18S IGS in the Fagaceae family."
https://openalex.org/W2058057358,"Analyzing spatiotemporal characteristics of the historical urbanization process is essential in understanding the dynamics of urbanization and scientifically planned urban development. Based on historical urban area maps and remote sensing images, this study examined the urban expansion of Shenyang from 1910 to 2010 using area statistics, typology identification, and landscape metrics approaches. The population and gross domestic product were analyzed as driving factors. The results showed that the urban area of Shenyang increased 43.39-fold during the study period and that the growth rate has accelerated since the 1980s. Three urban growth types were distinguished: infilling, edge-expansion, and spontaneous growth. Edge-expansion was the primary growth type. Infilling growth became the main growth type in the periods 1946-70, 1988-97, and 2004-10. Spontaneous growth was concentrated in the period of 1997 to 2000. The results of landscape metrics indicate that the urban landscape of Shenyang originally was highly aggregated, but has become increasingly fragmented. The urban fringe area was the traditional hot zone of urbanization. Shenyang was mainly located north of the Hun River before 1980; however, the south side of the river has been the hot zone of urbanization since the 1980s. The increase of urban area strongly correlated with the growth of GDP and population. Over a long time scale, the urbanization process has been affected by major historical events."
https://openalex.org/W2120727039,"Background The Thai HIV programme is a leader in the public health approach to HIV treatment. Starting at transmission of HIV and ending with transition to adult services this paper assesses the paediatric HIV treatment continuum from three perspectives: service-user, provider and policy maker, to understand what works well and why. Methods A qualitative research design was used to assess and triangulate the stakeholder perspectives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ART service-users (n = 35), policy actors (n = 20); telephone interviews with prior caregivers of orphans (n = 10); and three focus group discussions with service-providers (hospital staff and volunteers) from a district, provincial and a university hospital. Findings Children accessing HIV care were often orphaned, cared for by elderly relatives and experiencing multiple vulnerabilities. Services were divided into three stages, 1. Diagnosis and linkage: Despite strong policies there were supply and demand-side gaps in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission ‘cascade’ preventing early diagnosis and/or treatment. 2. Maintenance on ART - Children did well on treatment; caregivers took adherence seriously and valued the quality of services. Drug resistance, adherence and psychosocial issues were important concerns from all perspectives. 3. Adolescents and transition: Adolescent service-users faced greater complexity in their physical and emotional lives for which providers lacked skills; transition from the security of paediatric clinic was a daunting prospect. Dedicated healthcare providers felt they struggled to deliver services that met service-users' diverse needs at all stages. Child- and adolescent-specific elements of HIV policy were considered low priority. Conclusions Using the notion of the continuum of care a number of strengths and weaknesses were identified. Features of paediatric services need to evolve alongside the changing needs of service users. Peer-support volunteers have potential to add continuity and support at all stages. It is critical that adolescents receive targeted support, particularly during transition to adult services."
https://openalex.org/W2147449697,"The level of parasite virulence, i.e., the decrease in host's fitness due to a pathogen, is expected to depend on several parameters, such as the type of the disease (e.g., castrating or host-killing) and the prevalence of multiple infections. Although these parameters have been extensively studied theoretically, few empirical data are available to validate theoretical predictions. Using the anther smut castrating disease on Silene latifolia caused by Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae, we studied the dynamics of multiple infections and of different components of virulence (host death, non-recovery and percentage of castrated stems) during the entire lifespan of the host in an experimental population. We monitored the number of fungal genotypes within plants and their relatedness across five years, using microsatellite markers, as well as the rates of recovery and host death in the population. The mean relatedness among genotypes within plants remained at a high level throughout the entire host lifespan despite the dynamics of the disease, with recurrent new infections. Recovery was lower for plants with multiple infections compared to plants infected by a single genotype. As expected for castrating parasites, M. lychnidis-dioicae did not increase host mortality. Mortality varied across years but was generally lower for plants that had been diseased the preceding year. This is one of the few studies to have empirically verified theoretical expectations for castrating parasites, and to show particularly i) that castrated hosts live longer, suggesting that parasites can redirect resources normally used in reproduction to increase host lifespan, lengthening their transmission phase, and ii) that multiple infections increase virulence, here in terms of non-recovery and host castration."
https://openalex.org/W1991676976,"While pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been implemented in most countries worldwide, use in Asia has lagged in part because of a lack of data on the amount of disease that is vaccine preventable in the region. We describe pneumococcal serotypes elicited from 111 episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) from 2005 to 2013 among children and adults in Pakistan. Seventy-three percent (n = 81) of 111 IPD episodes were cases of meningitis (n = 76 in children 0-15 years and n = 5 among adults). Serotypes were determined by target amplification of DNA extracted from pneumococcal isolates (n = 52) or CSF specimens (n = 59). Serogroup 18 was the most common serogroup causing meningitis in children <5 years, accounting for 21% of cases (n = 13). The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) or PCV10- related serotypes were found in 61% (n = 47) of childhood (age 0-15 years) meningitis episodes. PCV-13 increased this coverage to 63% (one additional serotype 19A; n = 48). Our data indicate that use of PCVs would prevent a large proportion of serious pneumococcal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2088645003,"Radiographic imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Currently, computed-tomography (CT) is used to measure tumor-induced osteolysis as a marker for tumor growth by monitoring the bone fractional volume. As most tumors primarily induce osteolysis, lower bone fractional volume has been found to correlate with tumor aggressiveness. However, osteosarcoma is an exception as it induces osteolysis and produces mineralized osteoid simultaneously. Given that competent bone is highly anisotropic (systematic variance in its architectural order renders its physical properties dependent on direction of load) and that tumor induced osteolysis and osteogenesis are structurally disorganized relative to competent bone, we hypothesized that μCT-derived measures of anisotropy could be used to qualitatively and quantitatively detect osteosarcoma provoked deviations in bone, both osteolysis and osteogenesis, in vivo. We tested this hypothesis in a murine model of osteosarcoma cells orthotopically injected into the tibia. We demonstrate that, in addition to bone fractional volume, μCT-derived measure of anisotropy is a complete and accurate method to monitor osteosarcoma-induced osteolysis. Additionally, we found that unlike bone fractional volume, anisotropy could also detect tumor-induced osteogenesis. These findings suggest that monitoring tumor-induced changes in the structural property isotropy of the invaded bone may represent a novel means of diagnosing primary and metastatic bone tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2006900953,"In inner ear development, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is necessary for neuronal maintenance, such as neuronal survival and accurate nerve innervations of hair cells. We previously reported that Pten conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibited disorganized fasciculus with neuronal apoptosis in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). To better understand the genes and signaling networks related to auditory neuron maintenance, we compared the profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using microarray analysis of the inner ear in E14.5 Pten cKO and wild-type mice. We identified 46 statistically significant transcripts using significance analysis of microarrays, with the false-discovery rate set at 0%. Among the DEGs, expression levels of candidate genes and expression domains were validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis using DEGs identified significant signaling networks associated with apoptosis, cellular movement, and axon guidance (i.e., secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1)-mediated cellular movement and regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (Rgs4)-mediated axon guidance). This result was consistent with the phenotypic defects of SGNs in Pten cKO mice (e.g., neuronal apoptosis, abnormal migration, and irregular nerve fiber patterns of SGNs). From this study, we suggest two key regulatory signaling networks mediated by Spp1 and Rgs4, which may play potential roles in neuronal differentiation of developing auditory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1987612457,"The predictors of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption were previously found to include preoperative pain, anxiety, age, type of surgery, and genotype, but remaining unclear was whether intraoperative factors could predict postoperative pain. In the present study, we investigated the time-course of fentanyl consumption using intravenous patient-controlled analgesia records from patients who underwent orthognathic surgery for mandibular prognathism and analyzed the influence of anesthesia methods and surgical methods together with sex on the time course. A significant difference in the time course of fentanyl administration was found (P<0.001). No significant difference in the time course of fentanyl administration was found between males and females (P = 0.653), with no interaction between time course and sex (P = 0.567). No significant difference in the time course of fentanyl administration was found among anesthesia methods, such as fentanyl induction followed by fentanyl maintenance, fentanyl induction followed by remifentanil maintenance, and remifentanil induction followed by remifentanil maintenance (P = 0.512), but an interaction between time course and anesthesia method was observed (P = 0.004). A significant difference in the time course of fentanyl administration was found between surgical methods, such as bilateral mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) and BSSRO combined with Le Fort I osteotomy (bimaxillary; P = 0.008), with no interaction between time course and surgical method (P = 0.535). Total postoperative 24 h consumption associated with the bimaxillary procedure was significantly higher than with BSSRO (P = 0.008). The present results indicate that administration patterns and total 24 h consumption were different among the three groups of anesthesia methods and between the two groups of surgical methods, respectively. Although more research on patient-controlled analgesia patterns and consumption is necessary, the present study will contribute to adequately relieving individual patients from postoperative pain."
https://openalex.org/W1990698489,"Group II intron ribozymes catalyze the cleavage of (and their reinsertion into) DNA and RNA targets using a Mg2(+)-dependent reaction. The target is cleaved 3' to the last nucleotide of intron binding site 1 (IBS1), one of three regions that form base pairs with the intron's exon binding sites (EBS1 to -3).We solved the NMR solution structure of the d3' hairpin of the Sc.ai5γ intron containing EBS1 in its 11-nucleotide loop in complex with the dIBS1 DNA 7-mer and compare it with the analogous RNA-RNA contact. The EBS1-dIBS1 helix is slightly flexible and non-symmetric. NMR data reveal two major groove binding sites for divalent metal ions at the EBS1-dIBS1 helix, and surface plasmon resonance experiments show that low concentrations of Mg2(+) considerably enhance the affinity of dIBS1 for EBS1. Our results indicate that identification of both RNA and DNA IBS1 targets, presentation of the scissile bond, and stabilization of the structure by metal ions are governed by the overall structure of EBS1-dIBS1 and the surrounding loop nucleotides but are irrespective of different EBS1-(d)IBS1 geometries and interstrand affinities."
https://openalex.org/W2040168376,"Exposure to trichloroethene (TCE), a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, has been linked to a variety of autoimmune diseases (ADs) including SLE, scleroderma and hepatitis. Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ADs are largely unknown. Earlier studies from our laboratory in MRL+/+ mice suggested the contribution of oxidative/nitrosative stress in TCE-induced autoimmunity, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation provided protection by attenuating oxidative stress. This study was undertaken to further evaluate the contribution of nitrosative stress in TCE-mediated autoimmunity and to identify proteins susceptible to nitrosative stress. Groups of female MRL +/+ mice were given TCE, NAC or TCE + NAC for 6 weeks (TCE, 10 mmol/kg, i.p., every 4th day; NAC, ∼ 250 mg/kg/day via drinking water). TCE exposure led to significant increases in serum anti-nuclear and anti-histone antibodies together with significant induction of iNOS and increased formation of nitrotyrosine (NT) in sera and livers. Proteomic analysis identified 14 additional nitrated proteins in the livers of TCE-treated mice. Furthermore, TCE exposure led to decreased GSH levels and increased activation of NF-κB. Remarkably, NAC supplementation not only ameliorated TCE-induced nitrosative stress as evident from decreased iNOS, NT, nitrated proteins, NF-κB p65 activation and increased GSH levels, but also the markers of autoimmunity, as evident from decreased levels of autoantibodies in the sera. These findings provide support to the role of nitrosative stress in TCE-mediated autoimmune response and identify specific nitrated proteins which could have autoimmune potential. Attenuation of TCE-induced autoimmunity in mice by NAC provides an approach for designing therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2113524487,"Aims Mouse models of myocardial infarction (MI) are commonly used to explore the pathophysiological role of the monocytic response in myocardial injury and to develop translational strategies. However, no study thus far has examined the potential impact of inter-individual variability and sham surgical procedures on monocyte subset kinetics after experimental MI in mice. Our goal was to investigate determinants of systemic myeloid cell subset shifts in C57BL/6 mice following MI by developing a protocol for sequential extensive flow cytometry (FCM). Methods and Results Following cross-sectional multiplex FCM analysis we provide for the first time a detailed description of absolute quantities, relative subset composition, and biological variability of circulating classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocyte subsets in C57BL/6 mice. By using intra-individual longitudinal measurements after MI induction, a time course of classical and non-classical monocytosis was recorded. This approach disclosed a significant reduction of monocyte subset dispersion across all investigated time points following MI. We found that in the current invasive model of chronic MI the global pattern of systemic monocyte kinetics is mainly determined by a nonspecific inflammatory response to sham surgery and not by the extent of myocardial injury. Conclusions Application of sequential multiplexed FCM may help to reduce the impact of biological variability in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, the confounding influence of sham surgical procedures should always be considered when measuring monocyte subset kinetics in a murine model of MI."
https://openalex.org/W2065797568,"Twist1 encodes a transcription factor that plays a vital role in limb development. We have used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene, Ubc-CreERT2, to generate time-specific deletions of Twist1 by inducing Cre activity in mouse embryos at different ages from embryonic (E) day 9.5 onwards. A novel forelimb phenotype of supernumerary pre-axial digits and enlargement or partial duplication of the distal radius was observed when Cre activity was induced at E9.5. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of Hoxd10, Hoxd11 and Grem1 in the anterior half of the forelimb bud at E11.5. There is also localized upregulation of Ptch1, Hand2 and Hoxd13 at the site of ectopic digit formation, indicating a posterior molecular identity for the supernumerary digits. The specific skeletal phenotypes, which include duplication of digits and distal zeugopods but no overt posteriorization, differ from those of other Twist1 conditional knockout mutants. This outcome may be attributed to the deferment of Twist1 ablation to a later time frame of limb morphogenesis, which leads to the ectopic activation of posterior genes in the anterior tissues after the establishment of anterior-posterior anatomical identities in the forelimb bud."
https://openalex.org/W1965188325,"The pixel purity index (PPI) and two-dimensional (2-D) scatter plots are two popular techniques for endmember extraction in remote sensing spectral mixture analysis, yet both suffer from one major drawback, that is, the selection of a final set of endmembers has to endure a cumbersome process of iterative visual inspection and human intervention, especially when a spectrally-complex urban scene is involved. Within the conceptual framework of a V-H-L-S (vegetation-high albedo-low albedo-soil) model, which is expanded from the classic V-I-S (vegetation-impervious surface-soil) model, a tetrahedron-based endmember selection approach combined with a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA) was designed to identify urban endmembers from multispectral imagery. The tetrahedron defining the enclosing volume of MNF-transformed pixels in a three-dimensional (3-D) space was algorithmically sought, so that the tetrahedral vertices can ideally match the four components of the adopted model. A case study with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery in Shanghai, China was conducted to verify the validity of the method. The method performance was compared with those of the traditional PPI and 2-D scatter plots approaches. The results indicated that the tetrahedron-based endmember selection approach performed better in both accuracy and ease of identification for urban surface endmembers owing to the 3-D visualization analysis and use of the MOGA."
https://openalex.org/W2085407634,"The Lagrangian FLEXPART model has been used during the last decade to detect moisture sources that affect the climate in different regions of the world. While most of these studies provided a climatological perspective on the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle in terms of precipitation, none assessed the minimum temporal domain for which the climatological approach is valid. The methodology identifies the contribution of humidity to the moisture budget in a region by computing the changes in specific humidity along backward (or forward) trajectories of air masses over a period of ten days beforehand (afterwards), thereby allowing the calculation of monthly, seasonal and annual averages. The current study calculates as an example the climatological seasonal mean and variance of the net precipitation for regions in which precipitation exceeds evaporation (E-P<0) for the North Atlantic moisture source region using different time periods, for winter and summer from 1980 to 2000. The results show that net evaporation (E-P>0) can be discounted after when the integration of E-P is done without affecting the general net precipitation patterns when it is discounted in a monthly or longer time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2112233066,"A set of 15 new sulphonamide derivatives, presenting antitumor activity have been subjected to a metabolic stability study. The results showed that besides products of biotransformation, some additional peaks occurred in chromatograms. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed the same mass and fragmentation pathway, suggesting that geometric isomerization occurred. Thus, to support this hypothesis, quantitative structure-retention relationships were applied. Human liver microsomes were used as an in vitro model of metabolism. The biotransformation reactions were tracked by liquid chromatography assay and additionally, fragmentation mass spectra were recorded. In silico molecular modeling at a semi-empirical level was conducted as a starting point for molecular descriptor calculations. A quantitative structure-retention relationship model was built applying multiple linear regression based on selected three-dimensional descriptors. The studied compounds revealed high metabolic stability, with a tendency to form hydroxylated biotransformation products. However, significant chemical instability in conditions simulating human body fluids was noticed. According to literature and MS data geometrical isomerization was suggested. The developed in sillico model was able to describe the relationship between the geometry of isomer pairs and their chromatographic retention properties, thus it supported the hypothesis that the observed pairs of peaks are most likely geometric isomers. However, extensive structural investigations are needed to fully identify isomers' geometry. An effort to describe MS fragmentation pathways of novel chemical structures is often not enough to propose structures of potent metabolites and products of other chemical reactions that can be observed in compound solutions at early drug discovery studies. The results indicate that the relatively non-expensive and not time- and labor-consuming in sillico approach could be a good supportive tool assisting the identification of cis-trans isomers based on retention data. This methodology can be helpful during the structural identification of biotransformation and degradation products of new chemical entities--potential new drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2012340318,"A challenge in phylogenetic inference of gene trees is how to properly sample a large pool of homologous sequences to derive a good representative subset of sequences. Such a need arises in various applications, e.g. when (1) accuracy-oriented phylogenetic reconstruction methods may not be able to deal with a large pool of sequences due to their high demand in computing resources; (2) applications analyzing a collection of gene trees may prefer to use trees with fewer operational taxonomic units (OTUs), for instance for the detection of horizontal gene transfer events by identifying phylogenetic conflicts; and (3) the pool of available sequences is biased towards extensively studied species. In the past, the creation of subsamples often relied on manual selection. Here we present an Automated sequence-Sampling method for improving the Taxonomic diversity of gene phylogenetic trees, AST, to obtain representative sequences that maximize the taxonomic diversity of the sampled sequences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AST, we have tested it to solve four problems, namely, inference of the evolutionary histories of the small ribosomal subunit protein S5 of E. coli, 16 S ribosomal RNAs and glycosyl-transferase gene family 8, and a study of ancient horizontal gene transfers from bacteria to plants. Our results show that the resolution of our computational results is almost as good as that of manual inference by domain experts, hence making the tool generally useful to phylogenetic studies by non-phylogeny specialists. The program is available at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~zhouchan/AST.php."
