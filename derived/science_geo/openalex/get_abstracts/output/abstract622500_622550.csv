https://openalex.org/W2899696887,"Interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mediodorsal thalamus are critical for cognitive flexibility, yet the underlying computations are unknown. To investigate frontothalamic substrates of cognitive flexibility, we developed a behavioral task in which mice switched between different sets of learned cues that guided attention toward either visual or auditory targets. We found that PFC responses reflected both the individual cues and their meaning as task rules, indicating a hierarchical cue-to-rule transformation. Conversely, mediodorsal thalamus responses reflected the statistical regularity of cue presentation and were required for switching between such experimentally specified cueing contexts. A subset of these thalamic responses sustained context-relevant PFC representations, while another suppressed the context-irrelevant ones. Through modeling and experimental validation, we find that thalamic-mediated suppression may not only reduce PFC representational interference but could also preserve unused cortical traces for future use. Overall, our study provides a computational foundation for thalamic engagement in cognitive flexibility."

https://openalex.org/W2950896076,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain development by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts. However, miRNAs operate nonuniformly upon the transcriptional profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining miRNA–mRNA networks include limited knowledge of in vivo miRNA targets and their abundance in single cells. By combining multiple complementary approaches, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation with an antibody to AGO2 (AGO2-HITS-CLIP), single-cell profiling and computational analyses using bipartite and coexpression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are highly dynamic during development and over the course of evolution. One such interaction is between radial-glia-enriched ORC4 and miR-2115, a great-ape-specific miRNA, which appears to control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain development. Highly dynamic miRNA networks mediate developmental transitions during human brain development. Single-cell networks were detected by combining single-cell miRNA and mRNA profiling with HITS-CLIP analyzed with bipartite and co-expression networks."
https://openalex.org/W2901355931,"In females with X-linked genetic disorders, wild-type and mutant cells coexist within brain tissue because of X-chromosome inactivation, posing challenges for interpreting the effects of X-linked mutant alleles on gene expression. We present a single-nucleus RNA sequencing approach that resolves mosaicism by using single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes expressed in cis with the X-linked mutation to determine which nuclei express the mutant allele even when the mutant gene is not detected. This approach enables gene expression comparisons between mutant and wild-type cells within the same individual, eliminating variability introduced by comparisons to controls with different genetic backgrounds. We apply this approach to mosaic female mouse models and humans with Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-DNA-binding protein MECP2, and observe that cell-type-specific DNA methylation predicts the degree of gene upregulation in MECP2-mutant neurons. This approach can be broadly applied to study gene expression in mosaic X-linked disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2901943593,"The aim of this work was to analyse the distribution of causal and candidate mutations associated to relevant productive traits in twenty local European pig breeds. Also, the potential of the SNP panel employed for elucidating the genetic structure and relationships among breeds was evaluated. Most relevant genes and mutations associated with pig morphological, productive, meat quality, reproductive and disease resistance traits were prioritized and analyzed in a maximum of 47 blood samples from each of the breeds (Alentejana, Apulo-Calabrese, Basque, Bísara, Majorcan Black, Black Slavonian (Crna slavonska), Casertana, Cinta Senese, Gascon, Iberian, Krškopolje (Krškopoljski), Lithuanian indigenous wattle, Lithuanian White Old Type, Mora Romagnola, Moravka, Nero Siciliano, Sarda, Schwäbisch-Hällisches Schwein (Swabian Hall pig), Swallow-Bellied Mangalitsa and Turopolje). We successfully analyzed allelic variation in 39 polymorphisms, located in 33 candidate genes. Results provide relevant information regarding genetic diversity and segregation of SNPs associated to production and quality traits. Coat color and morphological trait-genes that show low level of segregation, and fixed SNPs may be useful for traceability. On the other hand, we detected SNPs which may be useful for association studies as well as breeding programs. For instance, we observed predominance of alleles that might be unfavorable for disease resistance and boar taint in most breeds and segregation of many alleles involved in meat quality, fatness and growth traits. Overall, these findings provide a detailed catalogue of segregating candidate SNPs in 20 European local pig breeds that may be useful for traceability purposes, for association studies and for breeding schemes. Population genetic analyses based on these candidate genes are able to uncover some clues regarding the hidden genetic substructure of these populations, as the extreme genetic closeness between Iberian and Alentejana breeds and an uneven admixture of the breeds studied. The results are in agreement with available knowledge regarding breed history and management, although largest panels of neutral markers should be employed to get a deeper understanding of the population’s structure and relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2900232853,"In addition to cognitive impairments, neurodevelopmental disorders often result in sensory processing deficits. However, the biological mechanisms that underlie impaired sensory processing associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are generally understudied and poorly understood. We found that SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans, which causes a sporadic neurodevelopmental disorder defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy, also leads to deficits in tactile-related sensory processing. In vivo neurophysiological analysis in Syngap1 mouse models revealed that upper-lamina neurons in somatosensory cortex weakly encode information related to touch. This was caused by reduced synaptic connectivity and impaired intrinsic excitability within upper-lamina somatosensory cortex neurons. These results were unexpected, given that Syngap1 heterozygosity is known to cause circuit hyperexcitability in brain areas more directly linked to cognitive functions. Thus, Syngap1 heterozygosity causes a range of circuit-specific pathologies, including reduced activity within cortical neurons required for touch processing, which may contribute to sensory phenotypes observed in patients. Michaelson et al. report that human SYNGAP1 variation alters touch-related sensory processing. Studies in Syngap1 mice revealed circuit-specific impairments in the somatosensory cortex that underlie reduced cortical activation in response to touch."
https://openalex.org/W2900575911,"Mutations in, and the altered expression of, epigenetic modifiers are pervasive in human tumours, making epigenetic factors attractive antitumour targets. The open-versus-closed chromatin state within the cells-of-origin of cancer correlates with the uneven distribution of mutations. However, the long-term effect of targeting epigenetic modifiers on mutability in patients with cancer is unclear. Here, we increased chromatin accessibility by deleting the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase G9a in murine epidermis and show that this does not alter the single nucleotide variant burden or global genomic distribution in chemical mutagen-induced squamous tumours. G9a-depleted tumours develop after a prolonged latency compared with their wild-type counterparts, but are more aggressive and have an expanded cancer progenitor pool, pronounced genomic instability and frequent loss-of-function p53 mutations. Thus, we call for caution when assessing long-term therapeutic benefits of chromatin modifier inhibitors, which may promote more aggressive disease. Avgustinova et al. report that targeting the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a in skin cancer does not affect single nucleotide variant profiles, but leads to increased tumour aggressiveness after a prolonged latency."
https://openalex.org/W2901847723,"Background Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Drug resistance, which is predicted to rise in many countries worldwide, threatens tuberculosis treatment and control. Objective To identify features associated with treatment failure and to predict which patients are at highest risk of treatment failure. Methods On a multi-country dataset managed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases we applied various machine learning techniques to identify factors statistically associated with treatment failure and to predict treatment failure based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics alone. Results The complete-case analysis database consisted of 587 patients (68% males) with a median (p25-p75) age of 40 (30–51) years. Treatment failure occurred in approximately one fourth of the patients. The features most associated with treatment failure were patterns of drug sensitivity, imaging findings, findings in the microscopy Ziehl-Nielsen stain, education status, and employment status. The most predictive model was forward stepwise selection (AUC: 0.74), although most models performed at or above AUC 0.7. A sensitivity analysis using the 643 original patients filling the missing values with multiple imputation showed similar predictive features and generally increased predictive performance. Conclusion Machine learning can help to identify patients at higher risk of treatment failure. Closer monitoring of these patients may decrease treatment failure rates and prevent emergence of antibiotic resistance. The use of inexpensive basic demographic and clinical features makes this approach attractive in low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2900730259,"The hyperkinetic symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are associated with the ensembles of interacting oscillators that cause excess or abnormal synchronous behavior within the Basal Ganglia (BG) circuitry. Delayed feedback stimulation is a closed loop technique shown to suppress this synchronous oscillatory activity. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) via delayed feedback is known to destabilize the complex intermittent synchronous states. Computational models of the BG network are often introduced to investigate the effect of delayed feedback high frequency stimulation on partially synchronized dynamics. In this study, we develop a reduced order model of four interacting nuclei of the BG as well as considering the Thalamo-Cortical local effects on the oscillatory dynamics. This model is able to capture the emergence of 34 Hz beta band oscillations seen in the Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings of the PD state. Train of high frequency pulses in a delayed feedback stimulation has shown deficiencies such as strengthening the synchronization in case of highly fluctuating neuronal activities, increasing the energy consumed as well as the incapability of activating all neurons in a large-scale network. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new feedback control variable based on the filtered and linearly delayed LFP recordings. The proposed control variable is then used to modulate the frequency of the stimulation signal rather than its amplitude. In strongly coupled networks, oscillations reoccur as soon as the amplitude of the stimulus signal declines. Therefore, we show that maintaining a fixed amplitude and modulating the frequency might ameliorate the desynchronization process, increase the battery lifespan and activate substantial regions of the administered DBS electrode. The charge balanced stimulus pulse itself is embedded with a delay period between its charges to grant robust desynchronization with lower amplitudes needed. The efficiency of the proposed Frequency Adjustment Stimulation (FAS) protocol in a delayed feedback method might contribute to further investigation of DBS modulations aspired to address a wide range of abnormal oscillatory behavior observed in neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2900906655,"The biotransformation of agricultural waste into valuable chemicals represents a promising approach in the field of biorefining. Herein, a general but highly efficient and robust process is reported for the production of organic acid from kimchi cabbage waste using lactic acid bacteria. The organic acid produced was tested for efficacy as a biological control agent. Lactobacillus sakei WiKim31 and L. curvatus WiKim38 could efficiently produce organic acids including lactic acid (12.1 and 12.7 g/L), fumaric acid (7.4 and 7.1 g/L), and acetic acid (4.5 and 4.6 g/L) from kimchi cabbage waste (3% substrate loading, w/v) by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation processes for 48 h, and the culture filtrate induced complete mortality of J2s Meloidogyne incognita at 2.5% concentration. These results suggested that lactic acid bacteria L. sakei WiKim31 and L. curvatus WiKim38 can efficiently produce organic acids, and the culture filtrate can be applied as a microbial nematicide."
https://openalex.org/W2901857195,"The multi-period (~38,000-6000 cal BP) site of Franchthi Cave, located in the Argolid peninsula of southern mainland Greece, is unique in the Eastern Mediterranean for preserving a long archaeological sequence extending from the Upper Palaeolithic through to the end of the Neolithic period. In this paper, we present new anthracological (carbonized fuel wood waste) evidence from Franchthi Cave with which we reconstruct the changing ecology of woodland vegetation in its environs during the late Pleistocene and the early-mid Holocene. The integrated archaeobotanical record (charred wood and non-wood macro-remains) demonstrates that in the Lateglacial the now-submerged coastal shelf of the southern Argolid peninsula was covered by steppe grassland vegetation dominated by junipers, almonds, cereals and legumes. The rapid climatic amelioration that marked the start of the Holocene brought about the disappearance of juniper and the expansion of deciduous woodland, cereals and lentils. This woodland-grassland biome bears no analogues in the modern and historical vegetation ecology of the Aegean basin. Instead, it is directly comparable to the steppe woodland biomes exploited by late Pleistocene and early Holocene hunter-gatherers in Southwest Asia, and points to the convergent evolution of late Pleistocene and early Holocene plant exploitation strategies between the two regions. Continuous sea-level rise during the early Holocene led to the gradual extinction of this unique palaeohabitat, which acted as the catalyst for the selective introduction of domesticated cereal crops at Franchthi Cave in the early 9th millennium cal BP. Our meta-analysis of the non-wood archaeobotanical data puts into question the concept of the wholesale introduction of a crop ""package"" by pioneer settler groups arriving from the East. It is proposed instead that selective cereal crop introduction formed part of a complex pattern of sociocultural interactions that brought together indigenous and immigrant groups into new communities."
https://openalex.org/W2901245357,"Nearly half the world’s population burns solid fuel for cooking, heating, and lighting. The incomplete combustion of these fuels is associated with detrimental health and environmental effects. The design and distribution of improved cookstoves that increase combustion efficiency and reduce indoor air pollution are a global priority. However, promoting exclusive and sustainable use of the improved stoves has proved challenging. In 2012, we conducted a survey in a community in rural Senegal to describe stove ownership and preferences for different stove technologies. This report aims to describe local stove and fuel use, to identify household preferences related to stove features and function, and to elicit the community perceptions of cleaner-burning stove alternatives with a focus on liquid propane gas. Similar to many resource-limited settings, biomass fuel use was ubiquitous and multiple stoves were used, even when cleaner burning alternatives were available; less than 1% of households that owned a liquid propane stove used it as the primary cooking device. Despite nearly universal use of the traditional open fire (92% of households), women did not prefer this stove when presented with other options. Propane gas, solar, and improved cookstoves were all viewed as more desirable when compared to the traditional open fire, however first-hand experience and knowledge of these stoves was limited. The stove features of greatest value were, in order: large cooking capacity, minimal smoke production, and rapid heating. Despite the low desirability and smoke emisions from the traditional open fire, its pervasive use, even in the presence of alternative stove options, may be related to its ability to satisfy the practical needs of the surveyed cooks, namely large cooking capacity and rapid, intense heat generation. Our data suggest women in this community want alternative stove options that reduce smoke exposure, however currently available stoves, including liquid propane gas, do not address all of the cooks’ preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2900987497,"Background Dystonia is a group of chronic diseases, causing considerable physical and psychosocial stress to patients and health care expenses. We studied the prevalence of different dystonia types in Finland in the years 2007–2016. Methods All patients with an ICD-10 code of dystonia were retrieved from the national care register. Average age-adjusted yearly prevalence was assessed for adult-onset isolated idiopathic or hereditary dystonia types from patient records from the Uusimaa and Pirkanmaa provinces. Results 1316 patients were confirmed to have adult-onset isolated idiopathic or hereditary dystonia based on hospital records from two provinces. On average, the age-adjusted prevalence for all adult-onset dystonia was 405 per million and for cervical dystonia 304 per million. For other dystonia types the prevalence ranged from 1–33 per million. Conclusions Adult onset cervical dystonia was the most common type of dystonia with relatively high prevalence in Finland compared with other countries. The prevalence of other types of dystonia was similar compared with other European studies. The higher prevalence of cervical dystonia may be partially explained by the better coverage of patients in public health care, but genetic and exogenous factors might contribute to it."
https://openalex.org/W2901098470,"Grain-filling ability is one of the factors that controls grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We developed a method for describing grain weight distribution, which is the probability density function of single grain weight in a panicle, using 128 Japanese rice varieties. With this method, we quantitively analyzed genotypic differences in grain-filling ability and used the grain weight distribution parameters for genomic prediction subject to genetic improvement in grain yield in rice. The novel description method could represent the observed grain weight distribution with five genotype-specific parameters of a mixture of two gamma distributions. The estimated genotype-specific parameters representing the proportion of filled grains had applicability to explain the grain filling ability of genotypes comparable to that of sink-filling rate and the conventionally measured proportion of filled grains, which suggested the efficiency and flexibility of grain weight distribution parameters to handle several genotypes. We revealed that perfectly filled grains have to be prioritized over partially filled grains for the optimum allocation of the source of yield in a panicle, from the analysis for obtaining an ideal shape of grain weight distribution. We conducted genomic prediction of grain weight distribution considering five genotype-specific parameters of the distribution as phenotypes relating to grain filling ability. The proportion of filled grains, average weight of filled grains, and variance of filled grain weight, which were considered to control grain yield to a certain degree, were predicted with accuracies of 0.30, 0.28, and 0.53, respectively. The proposed description method of grain weight distribution facilitated not only the investigation of the optimum allocation of nutrients in a panicle for realizing high grain-filling ability, but also allowed genomic selection of grain weight distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2951942155,"Circulatory shock is a life-threatening disease that accounts for around one-third of all admissions to intensive care units (ICU). It requires immediate treatment, which is why the development of tools for planning therapeutic interventions is required to deal with shock in the critical care environment. In this study, the ShockOmics European project original database is used to extract attributes capable of predicting mortality due to shock in the ICU. Missing data imputation techniques and machine learning models were used, followed by feature selection from different data subsets. Selected features were later used to build Bayesian Networks, revealing causal relationships between features and ICU outcome. The main result is a subset of predictive features that includes well-known indicators such as the SOFA and APACHE II scores, but also less commonly considered ones related to cardiovascular function assessed through echocardiograpy or shock treatment with pressors. Importantly, certain selected features are shown to be most predictive at certain time-steps. This means that, as shock progresses, different attributes could be prioritized. Clinical traits obtained at 24h. from ICU admission are shown to accurately predict cardiogenic and septic shock mortality, suggesting that relevant life-saving decisions could be made shortly after ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W2951944072,"Modern genomics sequencing techniques have provided a massive amount of protein sequences, but experimental endeavor in determining protein structures is largely lagging far behind the vast and unexplored sequences. Apparently, computational biology is playing a more important role in protein structure prediction than ever. Here, we present a system of de novo predictor, termed NiDelta, building on a deep convolutional neural network and statistical potential enabling molecular dynamics simulation for modeling protein tertiary structure. Combining with evolutionary-based residue-contacts, the presented predictor can predict the tertiary structures of a number of target proteins with remarkable accuracy. The proposed approach is demonstrated by calculations on a set of eighteen large proteins from different fold classes. The results show that the ultra-fast molecular dynamics simulation could dramatically reduce the gap between the sequence and its structure at atom level, and it could also present high efficiency in protein structure determination if sparse experimental data is available."
https://openalex.org/W2901043430,"Multimorbidity patterns of a population can be influenced by socioeconomic and lifestyle-related factors. Some of these factors are preventable when healthy habits are promoted to the population. This study analyzed the main grouping patterns of chronic diseases and the relationship with socioeconomic and lifestyle-related factors of the Brazilian population (over the age of 18), based on a population-based survey (2013 National Health Survey). A total of 60,202 participants were included. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify the combinations of chronic diseases. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to verify the relationship between disease clusters and independent variables, utilizing Poisson's regression with robust variance, considering a 95% confidence interval. Cluster analysis revealed four disease clusters:cardiometabolic diseases/cancer, mental/occupational diseases, musculoskeletal diseases and respiratory diseases, all significantly associated with the female gender, current/past smoking habits and overweight/obesity in multivariate analyses. These aspects must be considered when planning health services and developing strategies and guidelines for the prevention and treatment of multiple chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2901571517,"Although renal dysfunction is associated with a higher incidence of malignancies, there is no research on the incidence of specific types of digestive cancer in pre-dialytic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients compared to the general population. This study was conducted on newly diagnosed pre-dialytic CKD patients (n = 35,443) between 2003 and 2013 using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in Korea. The risk of digestive cancer development in pre-dialytic CKD patients was calculated as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). During a median follow-up of 54.9 months, the risk of digestive cancer in CKD patients was significantly higher than in the cohort population [SIR; 1.54, 95% confidence interval (95% CI); 1.46-1.62], the SIR of pancreatic cancer was 2.21, and the SIRs of hepatoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), bile duct cancer, and gastric cancer were 2.01, 1.60, 1.40, and 1.25, respectively. Moreover, in CKD patients younger than 40 years, the incidence ratios of hepatoma and CRC were remarkably larger compared with the cohort population of the same age (SIR; 5.98 in hepatoma, 4.58 in CRC). However, the incidence of specific types of digestive cancer seemed to be similar, irrespective of sex. In conclusion, digestive cancers were more frequently observed in CKD-diagnosed patients compared with a cohort population in Korea, which suggests that physicians should closely monitor their patients for the incidence of digestive cancer when they are diagnosed with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2901949952,"Apical periodontitis is frequently associated with the presence of bacteria biofilm, which has an indisputable impact on the prognosis of endodontic therapy due to the high resistance to adverse environmental conditions, chemicals, and antibiotic therapy that characterize bacteria within biofilm. The biofilm matrix acts as a protective shield over the encased microorganisms. The aim of this investigation was to identify the main biochemical components of biofilm matrix from endodontic mono- and dual-species biofilms. Enterococcus faecalis and Actinomyces naeslundii were cultured as mono- and dual-species biofilms for 14 days. Crude extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) from biofilm matrices were extracted using chemical and physical methods. High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry were used to determine the carbohydrate, protein, and fatty acid components. Chemical analysis of the biofilm matrices revealed that they were mainly composed of stachyose, maltose, and mannose carbohydrates. The protein profile in all biofilm samples showed abundant oxidoreductases and chaperone proteins and some virulence- associated proteins mainly located in the membrane surface. High percentages of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were identified in all biofilm matrices, with a major prevalence of palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Based on the results, it was possible to obtain for the first time a general overview of the biochemical profile of endodontic biofilm matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2900785991,"Continuous mixture interpretation methods that employ probabilistic genotyping to compute the Likelihood Ratio (LR) utilize more information than threshold-based systems. The continuous interpretation schemes described in the literature, however, do not all use the same underlying probabilistic model and standards outlining which probabilistic models may or may not be implemented into casework do not exist; thus, it is the individual forensic laboratory or expert that decides which model and corresponding software program to implement. For countries, such as the United States, with an adversarial legal system, one can envision a scenario where two probabilistic models are used to present the weight of evidence, and two LRs are presented by two experts. Conversely, if no independent review of the evidence is requested, one expert using one model may present one LR as there is no standard or guideline requiring the uncertainty in the LR estimate be presented. The choice of model determines the underlying probability calculation, and changes to it can result in non-negligible differences in the reported LR or corresponding verbal categorization presented to the trier-of-fact. In this paper, we study the impact of model differences on the LR and on the corresponding verbal expression computed using four variants of a continuous mixture interpretation method. The four models were tested five times each on 101, 1-, 2- and 3-person experimental samples with known contributors. For each sample, LRs were computed using the known contributor as the person of interest. In all four models, intra-model variability increased with an increase in the number of contributors and with a decrease in the contributor’s template mass. Inter-model variability in the associated verbal expression of the LR was observed in 32 of the 195 LRs used for comparison. Moreover, in 11 of these profiles there was a change from LR > 1 to LR < 1. These results indicate that modifications to existing continuous models do have the potential to significantly impact the final statistic, justifying the continuation of broad-based, large-scale, independent studies to quantify the limits of reliability and variability of existing forensically relevant systems."
https://openalex.org/W2901950827,"Recent discoveries highlight the importance of stochastic epigenetic changes, as indexed by epigenetic outlier DNA methylation signatures, as a valuable tool to understand aberrant cell function and subsequent human pathology. There is evidence of such changes in different complex disorders as diverse as cancer, obesity and, to a lesser extent, depression. The current study was aimed at identifying outlying DNA methylation signatures of depressive psychopathology. Here, genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured (by means of Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip) in peripheral blood of thirty-four monozygotic twins informative for depressive psychopathology (lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses). This dataset was explored to identify outlying epigenetic signatures of depression, operationalized as extreme hyper- or hypo-methylation in affected co-twins from discordant pairs that is not observed across the rest of the study sample. After adjusting for blood cell count, there were thirteen CpG sites across which depressed co-twins from the discordant pairs exhibited outlying DNA methylation signatures. None of them exhibited a methylation outlier profile in the concordant and healthy pairs, and some of these loci spanned genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as GHSR and KCNQ1. This exploratory study provides preliminary proof-of-concept validation that epigenetic outlier profiles derived from genome-wide DNA methylation data may be related to depression risk."
https://openalex.org/W2900793359,"Raman Microspectroscopy represents an innovative tool for the assessment of sperm biochemical features otherwise undetectable by routine semen analysis. Previously, it was shown that induced DNA damage can be detected in smeared sperm by this technique. This novel readout may be of value for clinical settings especially if it can be transferred to living cells. Yet, starting with living sperms this study was carried-out using a variety of conditions to disclose the Raman features of sperm nuclei under different hydration conditions and UV exposure. Human sperm were immobilized and Raman spectra were obtained from individual sperm as repeated measurements. To create conditions with controlled DNA damage, sperm samples were exposed to ultraviolet light. Several media were used to evaluate their effect on Raman spectra in aqueous conditions. To substantiate differences between the experimental conditions, the spectra were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis. We observed that spectra of sperm nuclei obtained in different solutions showed a qualitatively unchanged spectral pattern showing the principal signals related to DNA. Evaluating the effect of ultraviolet light generated the finding that spectra representing DNA damage were only observed in dry conditions but not in aqueous medium. Thus, Raman microspectroscopy was successfully applied for sperm analysis in different conditions, among them in live spermatozoa in aqueous solution during the initial measurement, revealing the principle use of this technique. However, implementation of Raman spectroscopy as a technique for clinical sperm analysis and selection may be especially relevant when DNA evaluation can be established using live sperm."

We demonstrated that dilysine motif, especially lysine at position 329, is crucial for the ER localization of this protein in human cells and therefore one should use protein C-tagging with caution. To verify the importance of the protein in glycoconjugates synthesis, we generated SLC35B4-deficient HepG2 cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 approach.

Triple-negative [Ostrogen receptor (ER-), Progesterone receptor (PgR-), and HER2/neu receptor (HER2-)] breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive class of BC characterized by poor prognosis and lacks the benefit of routinely available targeted therapies. This study aims to investigate the effect of human placental chorionic villi derived MSCs (CVMSCs) on the behavior of TNBC in vitro. This was done by assaying different cancer hallmarks including proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Cell proliferation rate of TNBC cell line (MDA-MB231) was monitored in real time using the xCELLigence system. Whereas, Boyden chamber migration assay was used to measure MDA-MB231 motility and invasiveness toward CVMSCs. Finally, a three-dimensional (3D) model using a co-culture system of CVMSCs with MDA-MB231 with or without the addition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was created to assess tumour angiogenesis in vitro. CVMSCs were able to significantly reduce the proliferative and migratory capacity of MDA-MB231 cells. Co-culturing of MDA-MB231 with CVMSCs, not only inhibited the tube formation ability of HUVECs but also reduced the expression of the BC characteristic cytokines; IL-10, IL-12, CXCL9 and CXCL10 of CVMSCs. These results support the hypothesis that CVMSCs can influence the behavior of TNBC cells and provides a basic for a potential therapeutic approach in a pre-clinical settings. The data from this study also highlight the complexity of the in vitro cancer angiogenesis model settings and regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2900495370,"Background Elderly patients are being increasingly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation. Previous studies demonstrated that 20% to 35% of elderly patients were reintubated within 48 to 72 hours after extubation. Given the age-related physiologic changes and multiple comorbidities in elderly patients, the current conventional parameters for predicting extubation outcomes may not be applicable to this population. This study was performed to identify the association between age-related parameters and extubation failure in elderly patients. Methods Intubated elderly patients (age of ≥60 years) admitted to the medical ICU of a university-based hospital from October 2014 to July 2015 were included. Failed extubation was defined as reintubation within 48 hours after the first extubation. The associations of extubation failure with demographic data, vital signs, cognition and anxiety, and ventilator parameters at the time of intubation and extubation were analyzed. Results In total, 127 intubated elderly patients were recruited. Extubation failure occurred in 15 patients (11.8%). Patients with failed extubation had a lower body temperature (37.0°C vs. 37.3°C, P < 0.05) but a higher Facial Anxiety Scale (FAS) score than those with successful extubation (3 vs. 2, P < 0.05). Patients with extubation failure had significantly higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (39.88 vs. 58.47 g/dL), serum sodium (137.66 vs. 141.47 mmol/L), and serum calcium (9.52 vs. 10.0 g/dL) but a wider anion gap (12.23 vs. 9.97), but no significant differences in respiratory parameters were found between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression revealed no independent factors associated with successful extubation. Conclusion This study revealed no strong predictive factors. However, several physiological parameters (lower body temperature and higher FAS scores) and metabolic parameters (BUN, sodium, calcium, and anion gap) were significantly associated with the rate of extubation failure."
https://openalex.org/W2900678484,"Recently, computational Grids have proven to be a good solution for processing large-scale, computation intensive problems.

The rigorous performance evaluation results clearly demonstrate that the proposed application-aware job scheduling mechanism can successful schedule more Grid jobs than the existing algorithms. For successful scheduled jobs, our proposed AJSM method is the best algorithm for job average processing time and makespan."
https://openalex.org/W2901353779,"One-quarter of systemic symptoms associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) are related to gastrointestinal complaints (GICs).To investigate the prevalence and features of urticaria-overlapping GICs.In this retrospective cross-sectional survey, 1426 consecutive outpatients were observed at our University Department. Only patients suffering from urticaria or GICs with a complete diagnostic work-up including serum total IgE level (Tot-IgE), differential blood count and urticaria activity score (UAS), were evaluated.Among different GICs, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was the most frequent syndrome observed (15.4%; 95%CI: 13.6-17.3). The prevalence of overlap syndrome for urticaria and GERD was 5.9% (95%CI: 4.7-7.2). In urticaria-patients, the prevalence of GERD was four-fold higher than in patients without hives (44% vs. 11%, p<0.001). UAS was significantly higher in urticaria and GERD overlap syndromes vs. isolated urticarias. In patients with GERD or acute/chronic urticaria or overlap syndrome, Tot-IgE and eosinophil blood count (EBC) differed significantly, with a stepwise increase in their values; from the subgroup of patients with GERD only, to that with overlap of CSU to GERD. Prevalence values for urticaria overlapping with GERD were three- and two-fold higher in CSU and in long-duration GERD cases respectively compared to acute urticaria or short-duration GERD cases. Similar to Th2 pathology models, CSU and GERD overlap syndrome was significantly and independently associated with Total-IgE ≥100IU/ml or EBC ≥250/mmc compared to CSU or GERD. Endoscopic/bioptic findings of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) or Barrett's esophagus (BE) were more frequent in chronic overlap syndrome than in GERD-patients.GERD was the most frequent GIC in patients with urticaria. Overlap syndrome was more frequent among patients with CSU, where this syndrome was associated with higher values of UAS, Tot-IgE, EBC and frequencies of NERD and BE. These results suggest that overlap syndrome is frequently a chronic syndrome with a Th2-like profile."
https://openalex.org/W2900469091,"Many studies have drawn attention to the vital role mothers have in safeguarding the health and nutritional wellbeing of their children. However, little is known about mothers’ experiences and the challenges they face in fulfilling this role in rapidly urbanizing cities in Africa. This study aims to explore child care and feeding practices of mothers with children under five years of age in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This qualitative study was conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. A total of thirty-six interviews were conducted with purposively selected participants. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated for analysis. We used a thematic analysis approach, which was guided by a resilience framework. The findings are presented as three major themes. 1) ‘Mixed blessings-balancing motherhood’s expectations’. While mothers identified positively with the social recognition and sense of fulfillment of being a ‘good mother’, they were ambivalent/torn about earning the necessary income from outside work and fulfilling their duties at home. 2) ‘Instabilities due to rampant urban sprawl’. While women expressed a keen desire to balance work and motherhood, the disintegrating social capital, due to large in-migration, market fluctuations and abrupt/forced resettlements to new housing units had left mothers without support for childcare, stressed and exhausted. 3) ‘Anchored by faith: a source of resilience to cope with adversities’. In the face of the multiple adversities, mothers cited their strong faith as their most reliable foundation for their resilience. In summary, the societal and environmental changes accompanying the rapid urbanization in low income settings makes combining child care and working outside the home very challenging for mothers. As a result they suffer from fatigue and feelings of isolation. Efforts to improve child feeding and care in urban low-income settings need to consider context appropriate strategies that support mothers with small children."

https://openalex.org/W2883947288,"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. Since AKI is sometimes preventable, there is great interest in prediction. Most existing studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to features available in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead on rehospitalized patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features from prior hospitalizations can be analyzed. Our objective is to provide a risk score directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized logistic regression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neural network are trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributes for 34,505 patients who generated 90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and 84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated with 50 iterations of 5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, an analysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level. Error is assessed with respect to diagnosis, race, age, gender, AKI identification method, and hospital utilization. In an additional experiment, the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony and interpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are also reported with a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable risk factors. Insights from this study might be used to construct a predictive tool for AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate of AKI risk at hospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or another predictive algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2900961196,"The global economic recession is relevant in public administration, especially in terms of the human factor. If we pretend to empower people as a resource, a key aspect is the perception of equity in their relationships. Previous research has shown how a positive shared interpersonal justice climate (IJC) in a work team impacts employee well-being, affecting the level of engagement and burnout. This influence is crucial in achieving positive results in the organization and for employees. The objective was to analyze the relationship between IJC and extra-role performance (ERP) and the mediating role of two indicators of well-being (burnout and engagement) in work teams. Furthermore, the study examined the Job Demands and Resources model (JD-R) including the relationship with the work family balance (WFB) of public employees. The sample was composed of 404 technical and administrative staff in a Spanish public university. The results indicated the significant relationships between the perceptions of IJC and burnout, engagement, and the two work outcomes WFB and ERP. When burnout and engagement were introduced in the regression equations, total mediation effects were produced."
https://openalex.org/W2901627785,"Background Previous studies have shown that smoking and smoking cessation may be associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In this study, we compared changes in HRQoL in people who maintained abstinence with people who had relapsed to smoking. Methods This was a secondary analysis of data from a trial of a relapse prevention intervention in 1,407 short-term quitters. The European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measured HRQoL at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Smoking outcome was continuous abstinence from 2 to 12 months, and 7-day smoking at 3 and 12 months. We used nonparametric test for differences in EQ-5D utility scores, and chi-square test for dichotomised response to each of the five EQ-5D dimensions. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between smoking relapse and HRQoL or anxiety/depression problems. Results The mean EQ-5D tariff score was 0.8252 at baseline. People who maintained abstinence experienced a statistically non-significant increase in the EQ-5D score (mean change 0.0015, P = 0.88), while returning to smoking was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the EQ-5D score (mean change -0.0270, P = 0.004). After adjusting for multiple baseline characteristics, the utility change during baseline and 12 months was statistically significantly associated with continuous abstinence, with a difference of 0.0288 (95% CI: 0.0006 to 0.0571, P = 0.045) between relapsers and continuous quitters. The only difference in quality of life dimensions between those who relapsed and those who maintained abstinence was in the proportion of participants with anxiety/depression problems at 12 months (30% vs. 22%, P = 0.001). Smoking relapse was associated with a simultaneous increase in anxiety/depression problems. Conclusions People who achieve short-term smoking abstinence but subsequently relapse to smoking have a reduced quality of life, which appears mostly due to worsening of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Further research is required to more fully understand the relationship between smoking and health-related quality of life, and to develop cessation interventions by taking into account the impact of anxiety or depression on smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2900491644,"Behavioral inhibition system (BIS) has a strong genetic basis, and emotional neglect (EN) in childhood is one of many environmental experiences that can affect individuals. This study aimed to examine the effects and interaction between BIS and EN on central serotonergic activity and other negative affect and cognition.A total of 153 non-clinical volunteers (54 men and 99 women; average age, 27.72 years, standard deviation = 6.40) were included in the analyses. The Behavioral Inhibition System scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and negative affect and cognition (Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire) were measured. As a biomarker of central serotonergic activity, the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials was measured.High EN was associated with higher loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) levels and low EN was associated with lower LDAEP levels in high BIS people only. People with high EN people showed significantly higher levels of depression and state anxiety than did those with low EN. Moreover, of people with low BIS, those who had more EN experience had higher levels of rejection sensitivity than did those with less EN experience, while people with high BIS did not show different patterns of rejection sensitivity regardless of the difference of EN.This study revealed different effects on physiological (loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials), intrapersonal (depression and state anxiety), and interpersonal aspects (rejection sensitivity) based on the interaction of BIS and EN. Our results suggest that the physiological and interpersonal aspects, but not the intrapersonal aspect, are significantly influenced by the interactive effect of BIS and EN."
https://openalex.org/W2900725444,"Visceral adiposity is associated with cardiovascular disease, an association that may be mediated in part by inflammation. We hypothesized that regional measures of visceral adiposity would associate with commonly obtained clinical measures of immune status. We consecutively studied 3,291 subjects (mean age, 49.8±9.8 years) who underwent an annual cardiovascular risk survey. Peri-cardial (PCF) and thoracic peri-aortic adipose tissue (TAT) volumes were determined by dedicated computed tomography (CT) software (Aquarius 3D Workstation, TeraRecon, San Mateo, CA, USA). Hepatic steatosis was assessed by abdominal ultrasonography. We explored cross-sectional associations between visceral fat measures and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leukocyte counts, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ration (NLR). Among 3,291 study participants, we observed positive linear associations between PCF and TAT, higher degree of hepatic steatosis and hs-CRP, various leukocyte counts, either total and its differential counts, and NLR (all trend p<0.001). Multi-variate linear and logistic regression models showed independent associations between PCF/TAT (ß-Coef: 0.14/0.16, both p<0.05) and total WBC counts, with only TAT further demonstrated significant relations with neutrophil counts and NLR (both p<0.05) and independently identified abnormally high WBC and NLR (Odds ratio: 1.18 & 1.21, both p<0.05). C-statistics showed significant incremental model prediction for abnormally high WBC and NLR (both ΔAUROC<0.05) when TAT was superimposed on traditional cardiovascular risks and biochemical information. Greater visceral adiposity burden and hepatic steatosis may be associated with higher circulating leukocyte counts and markers for atherosclerosis, with more pronounced influences for peri-aortic adiposity. Our data suggested the differential biological impacts for region-specific visceral adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2900772057,"Objective To evaluate the predictive role of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score concerning changes in testosterone levels following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and the effects of LDLT on total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, the free androgen index (FAI) and erectile function in LDLT recipients. Participants 41 adult male recipients of LDLT were evaluated before transplantation and six months after LDLT. Main outcome measures We evaluated the effects of LDLT on total testosterone and SHBG levels, the FAI and erectile function in LDLT recipients. In this prospective study, MELD score, serum total testosterone, SHBG levels and FAI were measured in the morning of the operation day and 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after LDLT. The 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire was administered before LDLT and six months after LDLT to evaluate erectile function. Results The main outcome measure was dynamic parameter changes of total testosterone, SHBG, FAI and erectile dysfunction. The mean FAI value before LDLT was 16.75±10.10. The mean FAI was significantly higher 1 month (32.75±15.56; p < 0.01), 3 months (25.23±10.26; p < 0.01) and 6 months (29.16±11.05; p < 0.01) after LDLT. Mean IIEF-5 scores significantly increased after LDLT (from 11.7±7.7 before LDLT to 14.7±7.5, p< 0.01). Conclusions MELD score correlates with severity of hypogonadism in men with end-stage liver disease. LDLT results in a reduction in serum levels of SHBG, an increase in FAI and improvement in erectile function."
https://openalex.org/W2901206299,"In zebrafish, the gene choline acetyltransferase a (chata) encodes one of the two ChAT orthologs responsible for the synthesis of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine (ACh) is essential for neuromuscular transmission and its impaired synthesis by ChAT can lead to neuromuscular junction disorders such as congenital myasthenic syndromes in humans. We have identified a novel mutation in the chata gene of zebrafish, chatatk64, in a collection of uncharacterised ENU-induced mutants. This mutant carries a missense mutation in the codon of a highly conserved serine changing it to an arginine (S102R). This serine is conserved among ChATs from zebrafish, rat, mice and chicken to humans. It resides within the catalytic domain and in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme. However, it has not been reported so far to be required for enzymatic activity. Modelling of the S102R variant change in the ChAT protein crystal structure suggests that the change affects protein structure and has a direct impact on the catalytic domain of the protein which abolishes embryo motility almost completely."
https://openalex.org/W2901792437,"Direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh laryngoscope is the most widely used approach; however, this skill is not easy for novices and trainees. We evaluated the performance of novices using a laryngoscope with a three-dimensional (3D)-printed ergonomic grip on an airway manikin. Forty second-year medical students were enrolled. Endotracheal intubation was attempted using a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope with or without a 3D-printed ergonomic support grip. Primary outcomes were intubation time and overall success rate. Secondary outcomes were number of unsuccessful attempts, first-attempt success rate, airway Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade, and difficulty score. In the easy airway scenario, intubation time, and the overall success rate were similar between two group. CL grade and ease-of-use scores were significantly better for those using the ergonomic support grip (P < 0.05). In the difficult airway scenario, intubation time (49.7±37.5 vs. 35.5±29.2, P = 0.013), the first-attempt success rate (67.5% vs. 90%, P = 0.029), number of attempts (1.4±0.6 vs. 1.1±0.4, P = 0.006), CL grade (2 [2, 2] vs. 2 [1, 1], P = 0.012), and ease-of-use scores (3.5 [2, 4] vs. 4 [3, 5], P = 0.008) were significantly better for those using the ergonomic support grip. Linear mixed model analysis showed that the ergonomic support grip had a favorable effect on CL grade (P<0.001), ease-of-use scores (P<0.001), intubation time (P = 0.015), and number of intubation attempts (P = 0.029). Our custom 3D-printed ergonomic laryngoscope support grip improved several indicators related to the successful endotracheal intubation in the easy and difficult scenario simulated on an airway manikin. This grip may be useful for intubation training and practice."
https://openalex.org/W2901868672,"Studies showed that the endotoxemia-related biomarker, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), is associated with obesity and fatty liver. The level of LBP is reduced after surgical weight loss. This study aimed to verify the change of serum LBP levels after one-year medical weight management in subjects with obesity.A total of 62 subjects with obesity, 39 subjects with overweight, and 21 subjects with normal body mass index were enrolled for a one-year weight management program. Basic information, body composition analysis, clinical data, serum LBP level, and abdominal ultrasonography findings were collected. At baseline, the serum LBP levels of the obese and overweight subjects were significantly higher than that of the normal group (30.9±7.4 and 29.6±6.3 versus 23.1±5.6 μg/mL, respectively, p<0.001). Serum LBP in subjects with obesity was significantly reduced to 26.5±7.1 μg/mL (p-value < 0.001) after one year. In the multivariate analyses, LBP was associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) before weight management in the obese group. Moreover, the change of LBP in response to weight management was significantly related to the changes of hs-CRP, leukocyte count and NFS by multivariate linear regression analysis also in the obese group.The serum level of the endotoxemia-related biomarker, LBP, decreases after one-year weight management in the obese subjects. In addition to serving as a metainflammatroy biomarker like hs-CRP, LBP may also be a potential biomarker as a non-invasive biomarker for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2900632481,"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the time course of syllabic and sub-syllabic processing in Cantonese spoken word production by using the picture-word interference task. Cantonese-speaking participants were asked to name individually presented pictures aloud and ignore an auditory word distractor. The targets and distractors were either phonologically related (i.e., sharing two identical word-initial phonemes) or unrelated. In Experiment 1, the target syllables were all consonant-vowel (CV)-structured. The phonological distractor was either a CV syllable (i.e., Full Syllable Overlap) or a CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) syllable (i.e., Sub-syllable Overlap). Relative to the unrelated control, Full Syllable Overlap distractors facilitated naming in all stimuli onset asynchronies (SOAs) (-175, 0, or +175 ms) whereas Sub-syllable Overlap distractors exhibited facilitation only at 0-ms and +175-ms SOAs. Experiment 2 adopted a similar design to examine the possible influence of syllabic structure similarity on the results of Experiment 1. The target syllables were all CVC-structured. The phonological distractor was either a CVC (i.e., Syllable-structure Consistent) or CV (i.e., Syllable-structure Inconsistent) syllable. Comparable priming was observed between the two distractor conditions across the three SOAs. These results indicated that an earlier priming effect was observed with full syllable overlap than sub-syllabic overlap when the degree of segmental overlap was held constant (Experiment 1). The earlier syllable priming observed in Experiment 1 could not be attributed to the effect of syllabic-structure (Experiment 2), thereby suggesting that the syllable unit is important in Cantonese and is retrieved earlier than sub-syllabic components during phonological encoding."
https://openalex.org/W2901813530,"When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals may form subjective expectations about probabilities of events relevant for their choice. Accurate measurement of subjective expectations is critical for high-quality data needed to analyze individual behavior. This paper reports the development and validity of a new method of eliciting point subjective expectations in developing countries. We developed a touchscreen-based application that combines an animated slider along with dynamic images that change relative sizes based on the probability indicated by the respondent. We compare our method to the more traditional approach of using beans as visual aids. First, we find that respondents have a sound understanding of basic concepts of probability. Second, we test for equality of the distributions elicited with the different methods and find them highly comparable. Third, we provide evidence that respondents report a more favorable opinion about the slider method and more willingness to complete long surveys using the slider rather than beans. Our findings suggest that the slider could be a viable elicitation method for empirical researchers who aim to collect data on subjective expectations in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2952290999,"The value of diatoms as bioindicators in contemporary and palaeolimnological studies through transfer function development has increased in the last decades. While such models represent a tremendous advance in (palaeo) ecology, they leave behind important sources of uncertainties that are often ignored. In the present study we tackle two of the most important sources of uncertainty in the development of diatom salinity inference models: the effect of secondary variables associated to seasonality and the comparison of conventional cross-validation methods with a validation based on independent datasets. Samples (diatoms and environmental variables) were taken in spring, summer and autumn in the freshwater and brackish ditches of the province of North Holland in 1993. Different locations of the same province were sampled again in 2008–2010 to validate the models. We found that the abundance of the dominant species significantly changed between the seasons, leading to inconsistent estimates of species optima and tolerances. A model covering intra-annual variability (all seasons combined) provides averages of species optima and tolerances, reduces the effect of secondary variables due to the seasonality effects, thus providing the strongest relationship between salinity and diatom species. In addition, the ¨all-season¨ model also reduces the edge effects usually found in all unimodal-based calibration methods. While based on cross-validation all four models seem to perform relatively well, a validation with an independent dataset emphasizes the importance of using models covering intra-annual variability to perform realistic reconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W2901974921,"Background A previous study (Roessner et al. 2007) found psychopathological evidence of an additive model of the comorbid group with Chronic Tic Disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CTD+ADHD), which demanded clinical interventions aimed primarily at the factor ADHD. This 14-year follow-up study tested whether this childhood additive model can also be found in young adulthood and whether ADHD remains the most impairing factor. Methods 92 patients (22.8% girls) from Roessner et al. (2007) were re-investigated as young adults at the age of 24 years, broken down into four groups: CTD-only (n = 22), CTD+ADHD (n = 23), ADHD-only (n = 24), and controls (n = 23). The Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL) was used as an equivalent parent-report instrument to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) applied 14 years ago. Statistically, 2x2 factorial design was completed. Results From the point of view of parents, the factors CTD and ADHD in young adults contributed almost equally to psychopathological problems and showed many interactions, i.e. an interactive model was supported. In addition, the ADHD factor was no longer the leading problem for psychosocial impairment in the adult CTD+ADHD group. Conclusion The additive model of CTD+ADHD seems to exist no longer in young adults, nor may the childhood predominance of the factor ADHD in comorbid CTD+ADHD. Thus, treatment priority should be decided by clinicians on a case-by-case basis depending on the most impairing disorder of each patient."
https://openalex.org/W2901332774,"Ghrelin is a peptide hormone which, when acylated, regulates appetite, energy balance and a range of other biological processes. Ghrelin predominately circulates in its unacylated form (unacylated ghrelin; UAG). UAG has a number of functions independent of acylated ghrelin, including modulation of metabolic parameters and cancer progression. UAG has also been postulated to antagonise some of the metabolic effects of acyl-ghrelin, including its effects on glucose and insulin regulation. In this study, Rag1-/- mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity and hyperinsulinaemia were subcutaneously implanted with PC3 prostate cancer xenografts to investigate the effect of UAG treatment on metabolic parameters and xenograft growth. Daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg/kg UAG had no effect on xenograft tumour growth in mice fed normal rodent chow or 23% high-fat diet. UAG significantly improved glucose tolerance in host Rag1-/- mice on a high-fat diet, but did not significantly improve other metabolic parameters. We propose that UAG is not likely to be an effective treatment for prostate cancer, with or without associated metabolic syndrome."

The goal of this study is to validate tumor-based single-gene expression biomarkers with demonstrated prognostic value in order to move them along the clinical translation pipeline. Methods Prognostic genes were selected from the literature and the best candidates measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in tumors of 233 patients with stage I adenocarcinoma. Significant prognostic genes were then validated in an independent set of 210 patients matching the first set in terms of histology, stage, and clinical data. Results Eleven genes with demonstrated prognostic value were selected from the literature. Complementary analyses in public databases and our own microarray dataset led to the investigation of six genes associated with good (BTG2, SELENBP1 and NFIB) or poor outcome (RRM1, EZH2 and FOXM1). In the first set of patients, EZH2 and RRM1 were significantly associated with better survival on top of age, sex and pathological stage (EZH2 p = 3.2e-02, RRM1 p = 5.9e-04). The prognostic values of EZH2 and RRM1 were not replicated in the second set of patients. A trend was observed for both genes in the joint analyses (n = 443) with higher expression associated with worse outcome. Conclusion Adenocarcinoma-specific mRNA expression levels of EZH2 and RRM1 are associated with poor post-surgical survival in the first set of patients, but not replicated in a clinically and pathologically matched independent validation set. This study highlights challenges associated with clinical translation of prognostic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2901318940,"Most studies of gene regulatory network (GRN) inference have focused extensively on identifying the interaction map of the GRNs. However, in order to predict the cellular behavior, modeling the GRN in terms of logic circuits, i.e., Boolean networks, is necessary. The perturbation techniques, e.g., knock-down and over-expression, should be utilized for identifying the underlying logic behind the interactions. However, we will show that by using only transcriptomic data obtained by single-perturbation experiments, we cannot observe all regulatory interactions, and this invisibility causes ambiguity in our model. Consequently, we need to employ the data of multiple omics layers (genome, transcriptome, and proteome) as well as multiple perturbation experiments to reduce or eliminate ambiguity in our modeling. In this paper, we introduce a multi-step perturbation experiment to deal with ambiguity. Moreover, we perform a thorough analysis to investigate which types of perturbations and omics layers play the most important role in the unambiguous modeling of the GRNs and how much ambiguity will be eliminated by considering more perturbations and more omics layers. Our analysis shows that performing both knock-down and over-expression is necessary in order to achieve the least ambiguous model. Moreover, the more steps of the perturbation are taken, the more ambiguity is eliminated. In addition, we can even achieve an unambiguous model of the GRN by using multi-step perturbation and integrating transcriptomic, protein-protein interaction, and cis-element data. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of utilizing different types of perturbation experiment and integrating multi-omics data on identifying the logic behind the regulatory interactions in a synthetic GRN. In conclusion, relying on the results of only knock-down experiments and not including as many omics layers as possible in the GRN inference, makes the results ambiguous, unreliable, and less accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2900786670,"In this paper, we study the limit of compactness which is a graph index originally introduced for measuring structural characteristics of hypermedia. Applying compactness to large scale small-world graphs (Mehler, 2008) observed its limit behaviour to be equal 1. The striking question concerning this finding was whether this limit behaviour resulted from the specifics of small-world graphs or was simply an artefact. In this paper, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for any sequence of connected graphs resulting in a limit value of CB = 1 which can be generalized with some consideration for the case of disconnected graph classes (Theorem 3). This result can be applied to many well-known classes of connected graphs. Here, we illustrate it by considering four examples. In fact, our proof-theoretical approach allows for quickly obtaining the limit value of compactness for many graph classes sparing computational costs."

However, this aggregate view, while useful for global policy discussion, may obscure the view for those actors who engage at a regional level. Therefore, we develop a method to associate large companies with their fishing operations and evaluate the biological sustainability of these operations. We link current fish biomass levels and landings to the revenue streams of the companies under study to compute potentially unrealized fisheries revenues and profits at the level of individual firms. We illustrate our method using two case studies: anchoveta (Engraulis ringens; Engraulidae) in Peru and menhaden in the USA (Brevoortia patronus and B. tyrannus; Clupeidae). We demonstrate that both these fisheries could potentially increase their revenues compared to the current levels of exploitation. We estimate the net but unrealized fishery benefits for the companies under question. This information could be useful to investors and business owners who might want to be aware of the actual fisheries performance options of the companies they invest in."
https://openalex.org/W2901535576,"It has been shown in literature that East Asians are more inclined to process context information than individuals in Western cultures. Using a context memory task that requires studying object images in social contexts (i.e., rating objects in an imagined social or experiential scenario), our recent study revealed an age-invariant advantage for Chinese young and older participants compared to their Canadian counterparts in memory for encoding contexts. To examine whether this cultural difference also occurred during encoding, this follow-up report analyzed encoding performance and its relationship to subsequent memory based on the same data from the same task of the same sample. The results revealed that at encoding, Chinese participants provided higher ratings of objects, took longer to rate, and reported more vivid imagery of encoding contexts relative to their Canadian counterparts. Furthermore, only Chinese participants rated objects with recognized context at retrieval higher and slower relative to those with misrecognized context. For Chinese participants, primarily older adults, slower ratings were only related to better context memory but not item memory. Importantly, Chinese participants' context memory advantage disappeared after controlling for encoding differences. Taken together, these results suggest that Chinese participants' memory advantage for social contexts may have its origin in the construction of elaborative and meaningful object-context associations at encoding."

The words were unrelated to the task itself, but related to the action required to complete the task. Forty participants (21 women) conducted a computerized categorization task while exposed to a sinewave tone as a standard stimulus (75% of the trials) or a to-be ignored word (press, stop) spoken either non-urgently or urgently as unexpected auditory deviant stimulus (6.25% trials for each category). Urgent words had sharp intonation and an average fundamental frequency (F0) ranging from 191.9 (stop) to 204.6 (press) Hz. Non-urgent words had low intonation with average F0 ranging from 103.9.9 (stop) to 120.3 (press) Hz. As expected, deviant distraction and longer response times were found by exposure to the word stop, but deviant distraction was not found to be significant with the word press or due to intonation. While the results showed that women had in general longer reaction times, there were no gender differences found related to the deviant distraction caused by word or intonation. The present results do not support the hypothesis that women have greater behavioral inhibitory control, but there was evidence that the meaning of the word could influence response times."
