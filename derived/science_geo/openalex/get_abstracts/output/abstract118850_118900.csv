https://openalex.org/W2005521257,"There is a common polymorphism in the promoter sequence of the human stromelysin-1 gene, with one allele having a run of six adenosines (6A) and the other five adenosines (5A). We have previously reported, in a 3-year follow-up study of patients with coronary atherosclerosis, that those patients who are homozygous for the 6A allele show a more rapid progression of the disease. In this study, we have investigated whether the 5A/6A promoter polymorphism plays a role in the regulation of stromelysin-1 gene expression. In transient transfection experiments, a stromelysin-1 promoter construct with 6A at the polymorphic site was found to express less of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene than a construct containing 5A. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting revealed the interaction of one or more nuclear protein(s) with the DNA sequence at the 5A/6A polymorphic site. The binding of one of the nucleoprotein factors was more readily detectable with an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the 6A allele as compared with a probe corresponding to the 5A allele. Replacing the core binding sequence with a random DNA sequence abolished the interaction between the nuclear protein(s) and the probe and also increased reporter gene expression in transiently transfected cells. Thus, the common 5A/6A polymorphism of the human stromelysin-1 promoter appears to play an important role in regulating stromelysin-1 gene expression and may be involved in the progression of coronary heart disease.

It can degrade types II, IV, and IX collagen, proteoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, gelatins, and elastin (1Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Royce P.M. Steinman B.

In addition, stromelysin-1 can also activate other MMPs such as collagenase, matrilysin, and gelatinase B, rendering stromelysin-1 crucial in connective tissue remodeling (4Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J.

Expression of stromelysin-1 is primarily regulated at the level of transcription, where the promoter of the gene responds to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products (7Frish S.M. Ruley H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16300-16304PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kerr L.D. Holt J.T. Matrisian L.M. Science. 1988; 242: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Kerr L.D.

J. 1993; 296: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The regulatory effects of such stimuli are mediated through a number of cis-elements located in the stromelysin-1 promoter. For instance, the activator protein-1 binding site at positions −63 to −70 is necessary for the basal expression of the gene and is also involved in interleukin-1 induction (11Giovanna B. Quinones S.

A promoter element located between −1218 and −1202 is responsible for the induction of stromelysin-1 expression by platelet-derived growth factor B/B (14Diaz-Meco M.T. Quinones S. Municio M.M.

Saus J. Otani Y. Harris E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). By in situ mRNA hybridization, we originally demonstrated the presence of stromelysin-1 in coronary atherosclerotic plaques (18Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Extensive expression of the stromelysin-1 gene was localized particularly to the regions considered prone to rupture, such as the cap and its adjacent tissues. These observations have been supported subsequently by the studies of Galis et al. (19Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar, 20Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Libby P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), who demonstrated the gelatinolytic and caseinolytic activity in atherosclerotic but not in the uninvolved arterial tissues, using in situ zymography, a method that allows direct detection and microscopic localization of MMP activity in tissue sections. Additional reports of MMP expression in atheroma have also appeared (21Brown D.L. Hibbs M.S. Kearney M. Loushin C. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 22Nikkari S.T. O'Brien K.D. Ferguson M. Hatsukami T. Welgus H.G. Alpers C.E. Clowes A.W. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we recently identified a common variant in the promoter of the stromelysin-1 gene (23Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This variant gives rise to one allele having a run of six adenosines (6A) and another having five adenosines (5A) at position −1171 according to the sequence published by Quinones et al. (16Quinones S. Saus J. Otani Y. Harris E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8339-8344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The frequency of the two alleles (5A/6A) was found to be 0.51/0.49 in a sample of 354 healthy individuals from the United Kingdom. However, in a study of 72 patients with coronary heart disease defined by angiography, the 5A/6A polymorphism was associated with progression of coronary atherosclerosis, with those who were homozygous for the 6A allele showing more rapid progression of both global and focal atherosclerotic stenoses over the 3-year study period (17Richardson P.D. Davies M.J. Born G.V.R. Lancet. 1989; ii: 941-944Abstract Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). This observation supports the findings by others that the MMPs are involved in the connective tissue remodeling during atherogenesis (18Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar, 20Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Libby P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).It was, however, unclear whether the 5A/6A polymorphism plays a role in the regulation of stromelysin-1 expression, or if it is in linkage disequilibrium with variants elsewhere at the gene locus that are functional. Therefore, we carried out experiments to address this question and report here the results of these studies.DISCUSSIONThe MMPs play important roles in connective tissue remodeling during tissue repair, cell migration, angiogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, and growth (2Woessener Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar, 3Matrisian L.M. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The normal operation of such physiological processes requires a tightly controlled balance between the MMPs and specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Disruption of the balance, however, could lead to various pathological states. For instance, unregulated expression of MMPs is partially the cause of the accelerated breakdown of extracellular matrix in arthritic disease, tumor invasion, and metastasis (1Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Royce P.M. Steinman B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 287Google Scholar, 28Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Hembry R.M. Reynolds J.J. Br. J.

Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), while on the other hand, inadequate production of these enzymes is associated with the excessive accumulation of connective tissue in systemic sclerosis (31Bou-Charios G. Osman J. Black C. Olsen I. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 231: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Clear evidence supporting the importance of maintaining the balance between active enzyme and inhibitor is provided by the recent discovery of mutations in the TIMP-3 gene, which cause abnormal connective tissue remodeling in the eye (32Weber B.H.F. Vogt G. Pruett R.C. Stohr H. Felbor U. Nature Genet. 1994; 8: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 33Jacobson S.G. Cideciyan A.V. Regunath G. Rodriguez F.J. Vandenburgh K. Sheffield V.C. Stone E.M. Nature Genet. 1995; 11: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated the possible function of the stromelysin-1 promoter 5A/6A polymorphism in regulating the expression of this metalloproteinase gene. In transient expression experiments, cultured fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with the constructs containing 6As expressed a roughly 2-fold lower amount of reporter gene product as compared with the transfectants of the constructs containing 5As. DNA-protein interaction assays showed the binding of one or more nuclear protein(s) to the sequence surrounding the polymorphic site. One of the nucleoprotein factors bound preferentially to the 6A allele (the allele associated with lower promoter strength), suggesting that it may be a transcriptional repressor. Replacing the 5A/6A cassette with a random DNA sequence abolished the binding of the nucleoprotein(s) and diminished the repressive effects. In vascular smooth muscle cells, the construct with a random DNA sequence replacing the 5A/6A cassette (M-CAT) expressed more CAT activity than the constructs containing the 5A or 6A allelic promoters (5T-CAT and 6T-CAT, respectively), suggesting the effective removal of the repressive effect. In fibroblasts, however, although CAT activity was higher in the M-CAT transfectants than the cells transfected with 6T-CAT, no difference was observed in CAT activity between the M-CAT and 5T-CAT transfectants. The reason for this is not clear, but it may reflect a difference in the repertoire of trans acting factors that are present in SMC and fibroblasts under these conditions, such that additional repressive effects are being exerted elsewhere in the 1.3 kilobase pairs of promoter by fibroblast-specific nuclear proteins.It has been demonstrated that variation in the promoters of a number of genes can affect the expression of gene products directly. For example, the 4G/5G polymorphism in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter regulates the transcription of the PAI-1 gene in an allele-specific manner, and is associated with inter-individual differences in plasma PAI-1 levels (26Eriksson P. Kallin B. van't Hooft F.M. Bavenholm P. Hamsten A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1851-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 34Dawson S.J. Wiman B. Hamsten A. Green F. Humphries S. Henney A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10739-10745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ye S. Green F.R. Scarabin P.Y. Nicaud V. Bara L. Dawson J. Humphries S.E. Evans A. Luc G. Cambou J.P. Arveiler D. Henney A.M. Cambien F. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The promoter activity of the 4G allele is 2-fold higher than that of the 5G allele in transiently transfected HepG2 cells (26Eriksson P. Kallin B. van't Hooft F.M. Bavenholm P. Hamsten A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1851-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Similar findings have also been reported on the genes encoding apolipoprotein AI and β-fibrinogen (36Angotti E. Mele E. Costanzo F. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17371-17374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Anderson G.M. Shaw A.R. Shafer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22650-22655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Humphries S. Ye S. Talmud P. Bara L. Wilhelmsen L. Tiret L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The results in the present study suggest that analogous mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of stromelysin-1 gene expression.In a study of 72 patients with coronary heart disease, we reported previously that the 6A allele of the stromelysin 5A/6A polymorphism was associated with a more rapid progression of coronary stenosis due to atherosclerosis (23Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the present study, the results suggest a lower promoter activity with the 6A allele. Thus, reduced stromelysin-1 expression seems to be associated with more rapid progression of atherosclerosis. But what are the mechanisms?One of the characteristics of atherosclerosis is the alteration in the content of extracellular matrix in the arterial wall (39Stary H.C. Chandler B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that, during atherogenesis, there is continuous connective tissue remodeling, which involves synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins including interstitial collagens, proteoglycans, and elastin (42Newby A. Southgate K.M. Davies M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1994; 89: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 43Dollery C.M. McEwan J.R. Henney A.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Recently, stromelysin-1 and several other MMPs have been implicated in this remodeling process (18Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin.

Atherosclerosis. 1995; 116: 43-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated an increase in MMP expression in certain lesional areas such as the plaque shoulders, and it is suggested that MMP activity may contribute to the weakening of atherosclerotic lesions and consequently to plaque rupture (18Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, in many atherosclerotic lesions, there is a net increase in the content of extracellular matrix, suggesting that the overall matrix turnover may have favored deposition rather than degradation. This is in agreement with the observations by Tyagi et al. (44Tyagi S.C. Meyer L. Schmaltz R.A. Reddy H.K. Voelker D.J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 116: 43-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), who recently studied the MMP levels in relation to the extracellular matrix contents in normal and atherosclerotic arteries, and showed that weight-for-weight atherosclerotic vessels contained more collagen and proteoglycans but lower collagenolytic activity than normal vascular tissues.Based on the results in this study, we speculate that, compared with other genotypes, individuals homozygous for the 6A allele could have lower stromelysin-1 levels in their arterial walls because of reduced transcription of the gene. We have previously reported augmented expression of stromelysin-1 in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques (18Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These data, supported by subsequent work by others (19Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar, 20Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Libby P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), demonstrate that there is a qualitative difference in expression of MMPs in atherosclerotic tissues compared with normal vessels, where active remodeling is not taking place. The majority of people in Western populations will develop atherosclerosis to some extent, and these enzymes will have a role in the matrix remodeling events associated with atherogenesis. The genetic studies identify inter-individual differences in the regulation of expression of these genes that may result in a quantitative difference between individuals in the level of enzyme activity, and which may therefore have an impact on the extent to which the matrix is degraded. It is emphasized that these changes are likely to be small, consistent with the contribution expected from a single gene operating in a complex multifactorial disorder. Our data support the concept that such differences may exist, potentially affecting the amount of enzyme in the vessel wall. In the model presented here, reduced levels of stromelysin-1 in the 6A homozygotes compared with other genotypes might affect the balance between synthesis and degradation during matrix turnover to favor increased deposition of matrix, leading to more rapid chronic growth of the atherosclerotic plaque, consistent with our previous findings (23Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that the 5A/6A polymorphism may play a functional role in regulating the expression of the stromelysin-1 gene. The genetic variant appears to influence stromelysin-1 expression in an allele-specific manner, a mechanism that could underlie its association with the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease, as reported previously (23Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As this is a common variant, with over a quarter of the population having the 6A6A genotype (23Ye S. Watts G.F. Mandalia S. Humphries S.E. Henney A.M. Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), its effect on stromelysin-1 expression with a 2-fold difference between the two alleles is likely to be biologically important. Although this common variant has been studied in relation to atherosclerosis, it is possible that it may also be relevant in the progression of other common chronic connective tissue disorders.

In addition, stromelysin-1 can also activate other MMPs such as collagenase, matrilysin, and gelatinase B, rendering stromelysin-1 crucial in connective tissue remodeling (4Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J.

Expression of stromelysin-1 is primarily regulated at the level of transcription, where the promoter of the gene responds to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products (7Frish S.M.

For instance, the activator protein-1 binding site at positions −63 to −70 is necessary for the basal expression of the gene and is also involved in interleukin-1 induction (11Giovanna B. Quinones S.

In this report, we demonstrate that fetuin antagonizes the antiproliferative action of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in cell cultures. Surface plasmon resonance measurements show that fetuin binds directly to TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 and with greater affinity to the TGF-β-related bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6). In a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fetuin blocked binding of TGF-β1 to the extracellular domain of TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII), one of the primary TGF-β-binding receptors. A comparison of fetuin and TβRII shows homology in an 18-19-amino acid sequence, which we have designated GF-βeceptor II omology 1 domain (TRH1). Since the TRH1 sequence is known to form a disulfide loop in fetuin, cyclized TRH1 peptides from both fetuin and TβRII were chemically synthesized and tested for cytokine binding activity. Cyclized TRH1 peptide from TβRII bound to TGF-β1 with greater affinity than to BMP-2, while the cyclized TRH1 peptide from fetuin bound preferentially to BMP-2. Finally, fetuin or neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies blocked osteogenesis and deposition of calcium-containing matrix in cultures of dexamethasone-treated rat bone marrow cells. In summary, these experiments define the TRH1 peptide loop as a cytokine-binding domain in both TβRII and fetuin and suggest that fetuin is a natural antagonist of TGF-β and BMP activities.

Fetuin was first identified over 5 decades ago as a major protein component of bovine fetal serum (1Pederson K.O. Nature. 1944; 154: 575Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but its biological function has remained unclear. Bovine fetuin is a globular 341-amino acid protein with six internal disulfide bonds and three N-linked and two O-linked oligosaccharide chains (2Dziegielewska K.M. Brown W.M. Casey S.-J.

Raoult J.P. Lannuzel B. Rogez J.P. Humbert G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1118-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and the inflammation-associated cytokine IL-1 has been shown to suppress fetuin transcript levels in cultured hepatocytes (8Akhoundi C. Amiot M. Auberger P. Le Cam A. Rossi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15925-15930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-HS glycoprotein, the human homolog of fetuin, is secreted by adult liver into the peripheral circulation and accumulates to high levels in bone (9Triffitt J.T.

Nature. 1975; 256: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fetuin also appears to be expressed in bone, as transcripts have been detected in chondrocytes and osteoblasts (11Yang F. Schwartz Z. Swain L.D. Lee C.-C. Bowman B.H. Boyan B.D. Blood. 1991; 12: 7-15Google Scholar). During mouse embryogenesis, fetuin mRNA is expressed in a number of developing tissues and organs, including the heart, lung, kidney, nervous system, and liver (12Yang F. Chen Z-I. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, fetuin mRNA is expressed in the developing limb buds of 12-day mouse embryos but not at 16 or 19 days of gestation (12Yang F. Chen Z-I. Bergeron J.M. Cupples R.L. Friedrichs W.E.

The TGF-β superfamily of cytokines has more than 30 members, and most have been grouped into the TGF-β, BMP/DVR, and activin subfamilies (16Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

The TGF-β subgroup has been shown to induce extracellular matrix production and differentiation in many cell types and to inhibit epithelial and lymphoid cell proliferation by down-regulating the activity of cyclin/Cdk kinase complexes (18Geng Y.

Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). TGF-β cytokines are present in bone matrix at concentrations approximately 100-fold higher than in soft tissues (20Wakefield L.M. Letterio J.J. Chen T. Danielpour D. Allison R.S.H. Pai L.H.

The BMP proteins possess osteoinductive activity, stimulating presumptive mesenchymal progenitor cells to differentiate into chondrocytic and osteocytic lineages (22Centrella M. Casinghino S. Kim J.

Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). BMPs are expressed during embryogenesis (24Lyons K.M. Pelton R.W. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1990; 109: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their importance in skeletal development is evident from studies of null mutations in mice that result in multiple skeletal abnormalities (25Kingsley D.M. Bland A.E. Grubber J.M. Marker P.C. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 399-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). TGF-β cytokines are assembled as disulfide-linked dimers, secreted in a precursor or latent form, and subsequently become activated by protease cleavage and release of the active cytokine (16Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Plasma TGF-β1 levels in humans are 100-1000-fold greater than required for many cellular responses, suggesting a large fraction is latent or inactivated by binding to serum constituents (20Wakefield L.M. Letterio J.J. Chen T. Danielpour D. Allison R.S.H. Pai L.H. Denicoff A.M. Noone M.H. Cowan K.H. O'Shaughnessy J.A. Sporn M.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 129-136PubMed Google Scholar).

Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). A null mutation in the follistatin gene resulted in widespread defects in muscle, skin, and skeleton, showing some phenotypic overlap with the activin null mutation (31Matzuk M.M. Lu N. Vogel H. Sellheyer K. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 374: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The TGF-β signaling receptors have been grouped into type I and type II subclasses; both types are transmembrane Ser/Thr kinases (32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Signaling by TGF-β or activin is initiated by cytokine binding to type II receptors (e.g., TβRII, ActRII, or ActRIIB), which recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptors (e.g., TβRI or ActRI). Activated type I receptors then phosphorylate as yet unidentified downstream signaling components (32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Herein, we report that fetuin binds to and antagonizes the antiproliferative and osteogenic activity of TGF-β cytokines in vitro. It is further shown that type II cytokine receptors and fetuin share sequence homology in a domain designated TRH1. Cyclized TRH1 peptides from fetuin and TβRII bound directly to cytokine and antagonized TGF-β binding to TβRII, suggesting that TRH1 is a cytokine-binding domain of the receptor. In cell culture, fetuin blocked TGF-β activity with an IC50 that was similar to both the KD measured by surface plasmon resonance and the physiological concentrations for fetuin in bone and serum. These experiments define the TRH1 peptide loop in TβRII and fetuin as a cytokine-binding domain and suggest a function for fetuin as a natural antagonist of TGF-β/BMP activities. Bovine fetuin was purchased from Sigma (catalog number F3004), adult human fetuin (α2-HS glycoprotein) from Calbiochem, and BSA (fraction V) from Boehringer Mannheim. Bovine fetuin is purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation of fetal calf serum followed by gel filtration chromatography. Human fetuin was purified from adult human serum by sequential runs of two DEAE columns, followed by affinity chromotography, gel filtration, and HPLC on a Mono Q column. Human TGF-β1 was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, Ma.). Recombinant human TGF-β2, BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6 were kindly supplied by the Genetics Institute (Boston, MA). Mv1Lu epithelial cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate containing 0.2% fetal calf serum in α-minimal essential medium and incubated with increasing concentrations of fetuin or BSA for 18 h. The cells were then pulsed with 8 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN) for 6 h, trypsinized, harvested onto filter mats, and counted in a β-counter. Binding constants for fetuin and TRH1 peptide interactions with TGF-β and BMPs were measured using the BIAcore machine and BIA-evaluation software (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (33O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). TGF-βs and BMPs were immobilized onto the carboxy-methylated dextran surface of the CM5 sensor chip. The running buffer was 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, and the flow rate was 3 µl/min. Protein binding to the surface causes a change in reflected light, which is directly proportional to mass bound and is measured in arbitrary response units. Protein binding is observed in two ways: increasing response with time during the injection phase, and the difference in the position of the base line before and after injection. Regeneration of the surface to remove bound analyte was done by injecting 10 µl of 20 mM NaOH. Peptides were synthesized on phenylacetoamidomethyl resin support using t-butoxycarbonyl amino acids and an automated peptide synthesizer. The peptides were extracted from the resin with 10% aqueous acetic acid, lyophylized, and purified by reverse phase HPLC. The TRH1 domain in fetuin is at amino acid positions 114-132, and in TβRII at positions 84-101 of the open reading frames. Synthetic peptides of 20 amino acids corresponding to TRH1 of bovine fetuin and human TβRII were made, CDIHVLKQDGQFSVLFTKCD and CVAVWRKNDENITLETVCHD, respectively. The peptide CKGSVIQKALGGEDVRVTCT in fetuin, corresponding to amino acids 230-249 (i.e. loop 2) was also synthesized as a control. To cyclize the peptides, samples were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol and then brought to a final concentration of 60 µM in 25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.5). After stirring in the dark for 30 min at 20°C with 30 mM potassium ferricyanide, the peptide was mixed with AG3-X4A resin (Bio-Rad), filtered, lyophilized, and desalted on a 50 × 2.5-cm column of Biogel P2 (Pharmacia) developed in water and further purified by reverse phase HPLC. Ion spray mass spectroscopy confirmed cyclization and lack of interpeptide cross-linking. A search of the PIR protein data bank was done to identify proteins with putitive TRH1 domains. Conserved residues in the TRH1 domains of fetuin, TβRII, and activin type II receptor were aligned visually and used to search the PIR protein data bank with the pattern, CX{0,1}(V,I,F,Y)X{1,3}(V,W,L)X{0,1}(K,R)X{4,5}(V,I,F)X{1,2}(L,I)X{2,4}CX{0,2}D, using the the GCG routine “findpatterns.” The Quantikine ELISA kit (R & D Systems) for measurement of TGF-β is supplied as 96-well plates precoated with the extracellular domain of human TβRII. To study competition of TGF-β1 binding, the cytokine was brought to a final concentration of 40 pM in diluent provided with the kit, either alone or with the antagonist fetuin (400 µM), TRH1 peptide from TβRII (200 µM), or BSA (400 µM) and incubated for 1.5 h at 20°C in siliconized Eppendorf tubes with shaking. This was followed by a 5-min incubation with the TβRII in coated ELISA wells with shaking, washing as recommended, and a 1-h incubation with polyclonal antibody against TGF-β1 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Plates were developed and optical density was read at 450 nm. Femoral bones were removed under aseptic conditions from adult male Wistar rats (120 g), cleaned of adherent soft tissues, and washed extensively in antibiotics. The distal ends were removed, and the marrow contents were flushed out with 10 ml of culture medium. The cells were dispersed by repeated passage through a 20-gauge needle and incubated in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, ascorbic acid (50 µg/ml), antibiotics (100 µg/ml penicillin G, 50 µg/ml gentamicin, 0.3 µg/ml fungizone) and 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate. The culture media were supplemented further with dexamethasone (10−8M) and various concentrations of fetuin. Following 6 days of culture, the cells were replated at a density of 1 × 102 cells/mm2 in 96-well plates and grown for another 12-14 days in the same medium. At the end of culture, the cells were fixed and stained for calcium with alizarin red-S to identify mineralized bone nodules. To quantify mineralized tissue formation in the cultures, morphometric measurements of the bone nodules, reported as mineralized area (mm2/well) were carried out with the aid of the Bioquant IV system (Bioquant, Nashville, TN) using a Leitz Orthoplan microscope. TGF-β levels in culture supernatants taken 4 days prior to scoring mineralization were measured with and without heat activation (80°C for 10 min) using the Mink cells as the indicator cell line as described above. Neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies supplied by R & D sytems were specific for TGF-β1, with 100-fold lower reactivity for TGF-β2 and TGF-β3. Fig. 1 shows a dose response for neutralization of TGF-β1 activity by bovine fetuin in cell culture. Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells are highly sensitive to the antiproliferative action of TGF-β1, showing an IC50 of 8 × 10−12M. Fetuin blocked the antiproliferative activity of exogenously added TGF-β1, with an IC50 of approximately 1 × 10−6M. Saturation with fetuin in this assay showed greater than 100% neutralization, suggesting that fetuin may be neutralizing endogenous TGF-β produced in the cultures (Fig. 1A). Indeed, both fetuin and neutralizing monoclonal anti-TGF-β1-3 antibody stimulated Mv1Lu cell proliferation in the absence of exogenous TGF-β (Fig. 1B). The growth-promoting effects of fetuin and anti-TGF-β antibodies were not additive at near saturating levels of fetuin, suggesting that both proteins stimulate cell growth by binding to and antagonizing TGF-β (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, Mv1Lu cell growth was also inhibited by BMP-2 with an IC50 of 1-2 × 10−8M. Fetuin blocked the antimitogenic activity of BMP-2 with 50% neutralization at approximately 6 × 10−7M (Fig. 1B). Although the specific receptors on Mv1Lu cells that mediate responses to BMP-2 have not been determined, BMP-2 can be cross-linked to putative cytokine receptors on Mv1Lu cells. 2J.

To examine whether fetuin inhibits TGF-β1 and BMP-2 activity by binding directly to the cytokine, association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rates for fetuin binding to TGF-β cytokines were measured by surface plasmon resonance (33O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Purified cytokines were covalently coupled to a carboxymethylated dextran surface, and binding molecules (e.g., fetuin) were passed in a fluid phase across the surface. Fig. 2A shows overlay plots for bovine fetuin binding to immobilized BMP-2. Fetuin bound specifically to immobilized TGF-β1, TGF-β2, BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-6 with varying affinities, whereas BSA and transferrin did not bind to these cytokines (Table I). The dissociation constant (KD) for fetuin-TGF-β1 binding was 2.2 × 10−6M, a value similar to the IC50 for neutralization of TGF-β1 by fetuin (Fig. 1). The affinity of bovine fetuin was 100-fold greater for BMP-2 than for TGF-β1. Human fetuin/α2-HS glycoprotein, which has 65% amino acid identity with bovine fetuin, bound to BMP-2 with a KD similar to that of bovine fetuin (Table I). The affinity of cytokine binding to bovine fetuin was BMP-2 > BMP-4 > BMP-6 > TGF-β1 > TGF-β2, a rank order that correlates with the degree of sequence divergence from BMP-2 (Table I).Table IFetuin and TRH1 binding to TGF-β cytokinesAnalyteLigandkakdKDM−1s−1s−1Mb-FetuinTGF-β1 (38%)8.7 × 102± 2.7 × 1021.9 × 10−3± 0.6 × 10−32.2 × 10−6TGF-β2 (36%)5.5 × 102± 1.2 × 1022.4 × 10−3± 0.2 × 10−34.4 × 10−6BMP-2 (100%)2.4 × 103± 1.2 × 1036.5 × 10−5± 2.1 × 10−52.7 × 10−8BMP-4 (86%)4.2 × 103± 0.2 × 1035.1 × 10−4± 0.1 × 10−41.2 × 10−7BMP-6 (57%)2.9 × 103± 0.5 × 1032.1 × 10−3± 0.3 × 10−37.1 × 10−7h-FetuinBMP-22.2 × 104± 0.5 × 1041.1 × 10−3± 0.1 × 10−35.0 × 10−8TRH1 (b-fetuin)BMP-21.6 × 103± 0.5 × 1033.8 × 10−3± 0.5 × 10−32.4 × 10−6TGF-β1>10−5TRH1 (reduced)BMP-2>10−5loop2 (b-fetuin)BMP-2>10−5TRH1 (TβRII)BMP-2>10−5TGF-β12.2 × 103± 1.3 × 1032.3 × 10−3± 0.5 × 10−31.0 × 10−6TRH1 (reduced)TGF-β1>10−5 Open table in a new tab To explore the possibility that fetuin is an antagonist of receptor binding by virtue of a shared cytokine-binding domain, the bovine fetuin amino acid sequence was compared with that of the TGF-β receptors. After aligning cysteine residues, we noted a region of similarity flanked by cysteines in fetuin (19 amino acids) and TGF-β type II receptors (18 amino acids), which we have designated GF-βeceptor II omology 1 domain (TRH1) (Fig. 3A). The TRH1 domain is present in TβRII, ActRII, ActRIIb, and BMP-RII but absent in the type I receptors (32Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The TRH1 sequences in fetuin and TβRII share 41 and 65% amino acid identity and similarity, respectively. A low stringency search of the PIR protein data bank was done using conserved residues in the TRH1 domains of fetuin and the type II receptors for TGF-β and activin (see “Experimental Procedures”). The search yielded 32 matches, 25 of which represented fetuin (n = 5), TβRII (n = 2), and type II activin receptors (n = 18) from various species. The search algorithm did not identify TRH1 sequences in several other cytokine-binding proteins including α2-macroglobulin, betaglycan, decorin, and follistatin. The intramolecular disulfide bonds in human fetuin have previously been determined (3Kellermann J. Haupt H. Auerswald E.-A. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14121-14128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the TRH1 domain forms a peptide loop. Algorithms for secondary structure predict a β-sheet-turn-β-sheet structure for the TRH1 peptides of both fetuin and TβRII (Fig. 3A). Low ultraviolet CD spectra analysis of cyclized synthetic TRH1 peptide from TβRII in water showed 58%β-sheet, 42% coil, confirming this prediction (Fig. 4). In the presence of the α-helix-inducing solvent 2,2,2-trifluroethanol (75%), β-sheet content remained similar, and coil was reduced at the expense of 20%α-helix. These data suggest that the looped peptides form stable secondary structure in aqueous solution. The disulfide-bonded TRH1 peptides from both fetuin and TβRII were tested for cytokine binding activity using surface plasmon resonance. Cyclized TRH1 peptide from TβRII bound to TGF-β1 with higher affinity than to BMP-2, and the cyclized peptide from fetuin bound preferentially to BMP-2 (Fig. 2C and Table I). This result reflected the cytokine-binding preference we had observed for full-length fetuin and that expected for TβRII (37Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reduced and alkylated TRH1 peptides showed significant loss of cytokine binding activity as did reduced fetuin protein, suggesting that the disulfide loop stabilizes a preferred TRH1 peptide structure for cytokine binding (Fig. 2D and Table I). Loop 2, a disulfide-looped peptide of the same length as TRH1 but divergent in sequence, is found in the C-terminal portion of fetuin (Fig. 3A). Cyclized loop 2 peptide did not bind to BMP-2 (Table I). The affinity of TGF-β1 for the looped TRH1 peptide of TβRII was only 10-fold less avid than TGF-β1 binding to the full-length extracellular domain of TβRII, which has also been measured by surface plasmon resonance (39O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Segarini P. Grothe S. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 766: 300-302Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Finally, in a competitive binding experiment, TRH1 peptide from TβRII and native fetuin glycoprotein, at concentrations approximately 100-fold higher than their respective KD values, were found to block TGF-β1 binding to the recombinant extracellular domain of TβRII (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that TRH1 is the primary cytokine recognition site in TβRII and fetuin and imply that sequence differences in TRH1 domains may largely dictate cytokine binding specificity. With the known bone remodelling effects of both fetuin and TGF-β/BMPs (14Colclasure G.C. Lloyd W.S. Lamkin M. Gonnerman W. Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Bürgi W. Schmid K. Nimberg R.B. J. Clin.

Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar), it is possible that fetuin-cytokine interactions play a role in bone differentiation. To examine this possibility, we cultured rat bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of dexamethasone, a treatment that induces osteogenic differentiation leading to deposition of a calcium-containing matrix after 3 weeks of culture (Fig. 5). Consistent with a bone phenotype, the matrix contained abundant collagen fibrils with discrete areas of mineralization as seen at the ultrastructural level, as well as bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin detected by Western blotting (data not shown). During the first week of culture, the bone marrow cells proliferate, and TGF-β1 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and osteogenesis during this period (41Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). However, in the latter phases of osteogenic differentiation, TGF-β is necessary for deposition of matrix (21Van Vlasselaer P. Borremans B. van Gorp U. Dasch J.R. De Waal-Malefyt R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 569-577Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone increased the fraction of active versus latent TGF-β cytokine in bone marrow cultures but had little effect on total TGF-β levels as has previously been reported (42Oursler M.J. Riggs B.L. Spelberg T.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2187-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5A, the addition of fetuin during the first week stimulated an increase in cell number consistent with its role as a TGF-β antagonist (Fig. 5A). When added during the latter 2 weeks of culture, fetuin blocked deposition of"

We have shown previously that these G/T mispairs are corrected to G/C pairs by a mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase, TDG, which we subsequently purified from human cells. Here we describe the cloning of the human cDNA encoding TDG. We have identified two distinct cDNA species that differ by 100 nucleotides at the 3′-untranslated region. These cDNAs contain a 410-amino acid open reading frame that encodes a 46-kDa polypeptide. The G/T glycosylase, expressed both in vitro and in Escherichia coli, migrated in denaturing polyacrylamide gels with an apparent size of 60 kDa. The substrate specificity of the recombinant protein corresponded to that of the cellular enzyme, and polyclonal antisera raised against the recombinant protein neutralized both activities. We therefore conclude that the cDNA described below encodes human TDG. Data base searches identified a serendipitously cloned mouse cDNA sequence that could be shown to encode the murine TDG homologue. No common amino acid sequence motifs between the G/T-specific enzyme and other DNA glycosylases could be found, suggesting that TDG belongs to a new class of base-excision repair enzymes.

The process of spontaneous hydrolytic deamination affects all DNA bases with exocyclic amino groups (15Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The rates of deamination vary, such that adenine is converted to hypoxanthine (H) 1The abbreviations used are: HhypoxanthineUuracilTDGthymine-DNA glycosylasePCRpolymerase chain reactionhhumanmmurineIPTGisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranosidebpbase pairORFopen reading framePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDTTdithiothreitol. approximately 1 order of magnitude slower than cytosine to uracil (U). In double-stranded DNA, the latter deamination processes give rise to H/T and U/G mispairs, which, if uncorrected prior to replication, give rise to A → G and C → T transition mutations in the progeny DNA, respectively. All organisms have evolved repair enzymes that remove these deaminated bases with high efficiency. Thus, cytosine deamination is countered by uracil glycosylase (15Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar for review; 4Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the removal of hypoxanthine is mediated by 3-methyladenine DNA-glycosylase (20Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). hypoxanthine uracil thymine-DNA glycosylase polymerase chain reaction human murine isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside base pair open reading frame phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride fast protein liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiothreitol. In organisms that methylate cytosine, the deamination process affects also 5-methylcytosine residues, which are converted to thymine and thus give rise to G/T mispairs. This process appears to proceed with kinetics slightly faster than that of the C → U conversion (6Ehrlich M. Norris K.F. Wang R.Y.-H. Kuo K.C. Gehrke C.W. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but, in addition to being mutagenic by giving rise to C → T transition mutations (5Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), it also brings about a change in the pattern of DNA methylation, which may, in turn, result in altered gene expression or any other phenomenon associated with or controlled by this important epigenetic process (12Hergersberg M. Experientia Basel. 1991; 47: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of 5-methylcytosine deamination in vertebrates, we set out to search for a repair mechanism dedicated to the correction of this type of damage, i.e. an enzymatic system capable of correcting G/T mispairs to G/C pairs. In our initial studies, using mismatch-carrying SV40 heteroduplexes transfected into monkey cells, we found strong evidence for the existence in these cells of a specific mismatch repair process, dedicated to G/T → G/C correction (1Brown T.C. Jiricny J. Cell. 1987; 50: 945-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Brown T.C. Jiricny J. Cell. 1988; 54: 705-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We were subsequently able to detect this process in cell-free extracts, using mismatch-containing oligonucleotide heteroduplexes (28Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and were later able to show that the initial step of the correction is mediated by a mismatch-specific thymine- DNA glycosylase (29Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells (17Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was then subjected to a limited biochemical characterization (18Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The latter study revealed that the enzyme possesses a relatively broad substrate specificity in vitro, in that it was able to excise thymine not only from mispairs with guanine, but also from other T-containing mispairs. Moreover, it could excise also uracil and 5-bromouracil from mismatches with guanine. Work from other laboratories substantiated and considerably extended our findings. Thus Day and co-workers (23Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7998-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Karran and colleagues (10Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.-Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme present in crude extracts processed also 6-O-methylguanine/thymine mispairs by excising the thymine. The same workers also showed that the enzyme is sensitive to the sequence context of the mispair (9Griffin S. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13032-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; 24Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6869-6875Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given the many capabilities of the enzyme in vitro, it is not easy to state with any certainty which, if any, of these enzymatic reactions reflect the true physiological function of the protein. Clearly, this potential anomaly can only be resolved by looking at the phenotype of a cell in which the G/T repair function is missing. As such a cell or organism is unavailable at present, we may need to create such a system by constructing knock-out cell lines and animal models. The first steps toward the achievement of this goal, namely the cloning and expression of the G/T mismatch-specific glycosylase from HeLa cells, are described below. All reagents were of analytical grade purity. Restriction enzymes were used according to the instructions of the manufacturers. HeLa cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. All DNA sequences are written in the 5′ to 3′ direction. HeLa cell monolayers in 150-mm diameter dishes were incubated with 7.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 Mβ-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at room temperature. The lysed cells were then layered onto 4.5 ml of CsCl solution (5.7 M CsCl in 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0) and centrifuged for 24 h at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 22°C. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 300 µl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and reprecipitated once with EtOH. It was then dried and resuspended in 100 µl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Reverse transcription of RNA was carried out with 800 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, 4 µg of total HeLa RNA, 100 pmol of oligo (dT)12MN (M: G, A, C and N: G, A, T, C) in 20 µl of 10 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate. The mixture was heated for 10 min at 70°C before the addition of DTT and enzyme and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The enzyme was inactivated by heating for 5 min at 95°C. The G/T glycosylase, purified as described (17Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following staining with Coomassie Blue, the band corresponding to the 55-kDa polypeptide was cut out of the gel, and the protein was digested in the gel with alkylated trypsin (Promega Corp. U. K.). The tryptic peptides were recovered by sequential extractions and separated by tandem high performance liquid chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 M with diode-array detection. Anion-exchange and octadecyl reverse phase columns were connected in series, essentially as described (14Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected and applied directly to an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed-liquid automated sequencer modified as described (27Totty N.F. Waterfield M.D. Hsuan J.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All PCR primers derived from amino acid sequences were fully degenerate. Restriction sites were added at the 5′-end of each primer to facilitate cloning. The procedure described by 16Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar was applied. Primers P1s (CCGAATTCATGGCNGA(A/G)GCNCC) and P1a (CCGTCGACAC(C/T)TC(C/T)TCNGGCAT) were designed to yield a nondegenerate nucleotide sequence coding for the internal part of PEP1. The PCR reaction contained 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 µg of HeLa cDNA, and 125 pmol of each primer in a total volume of 100 µl. Following a denaturation step of 5 min at 95°C, deoxynucleoside triphosphates at 150 µM each and 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer) were added. The PCR reaction was carried out for 30 cycles at 94°C for 30 s and 53°C for 20 s. Similarly, P2s (CCGAATTCTG(C/T)(C/T)TNTT(C/T)ATG) and P2a (CCGTCGAC(A/G)TTNA(A/G)(C/T)TGNAC) were designed in order to obtain the internal nondegenerate nucleotide sequence coding for the internal part of PEP2. The PCR reaction was performed as described above, except that 350 pmol of primers, 4 mM MgCl2, and an annealing temperature of 45°C were used. The DNA fragments coding for PEP1 and PEP2 were then digested with EcoRI and SalI, agarose gel-purified, and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEM-3Zf(+) plasmid, thus creating plasmids pGemP1 and pGemP2, respectively. The DNA fragment between PEP1 and PEP2 was amplified using 100 pmol of primers P3s (AATATGGCAGTTGTGAATGAACAGCAA) and P4a (CCGTCGACGTTTAGTTGGACCTCACTGAGCCCTGACAT), designed with the unambiguous cDNA sequences encoding the respective peptides obtained in the experiment above. The reaction was carried out for 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min and at 72°C for 2 min in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2. The resulting DNA fragment, F447, was cloned into the SmaI site of pGem-3Zf(+) to give plasmid (pGemF447). P3s did not contain additional restriction sites whereas P4a contained a SalI site at its 5′-end. The DNA fragment F447 was first used as a specific probe in the screening of Lambda ZAP II HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene). About 106 plaque-forming units were screened using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Two positive phage, 1 and 14, were identified and analyzed further. The pBluescript SK(−) vectors containing the cDNA inserts were rescued to give the constructs phTDG-1 and phTDG-14, respectively. phTDG-1 was shown by sequencing to contain the 88 N-terminal amino acid residues (including PEP1), as well as 400 bp of the 5′-untranslated region. phTDG-14 contained a 693-bp insert encoding PEP2-PEP5, but no 3′-untranslated region. This clone also did not overlap with phTDG-1. We therefore screened a second cDNA library, Lambda Uni-ZAP. After in vivo excision of the positive pBluescript SK(−) phagemids, the library clones were further screened by PCR, using the primers P5s (CCGTCGACGTTAAGAACTTGGAATTTGGGCTTCAG) and M13 forward (GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT). This process identified two clones, phTDG-2 with an insert of 2,200 bp, and phTDG-3 with an insert of 2,100 nucleotides. See Fig. 1c for relative location of the inserts. The clone coding for the full-length protein was constructed as follows. phTDG-1 was digested with DdeI, the fragment containing the insert was purified on a 0.8% low-melting agarose gel and digested with EcoRI. In parallel, pGemF447 was digested with SalI. The SalI fragment containing the insert was then partially digested with DdeI in order to yield a 380-bp fragment, which represented the insert cleaved only at position 548. In a two-step ligation reaction, the 550-bp EcoRI/DdeI fragment isolated from phTDG-1 and the 380-bp DdeI/SalI fragment from pGemF447 were ligated into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEM-3Zf(+). This new vector, pGem-2, contained a fusion of clone 1 and F447. In the next step, the insert of pGem-2 was fused to clone 14. pGem-2 was first digested with PvuII, and the insert-containing fragment was partially digested with DdeI in order to get a fragment of 1024 bp, which represented the insert cleaved only at position 901. This fragment was then digested with EcoRI to give a smaller, 900-bp fragment. In parallel, phTDG-14 was first digested with PstI and SalI. The insert was partially digested with DdeI, and the fragment cleaved at position 901 was gel-purified. The EcoRI/DdeI fragment of pGem-2 and the DdeI/SalI fragment of phTDG-14 were cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEM-3Zf(+). The new vector containing the fusion of clone phTDG-1, F447, and clone phTDG-14 was named pGem-3. The DNA fragment containing the 3′-end of the coding region could be obtained by PCR amplification of the clone phTDG-2, using standard conditions and the primers P6s (CTCTGCTATGTTATGCCATCATCCAGTG) and P7a (CCGTCGACTTAAGCATGGCTTTCTTCTTCCTG). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and SalI and cloned in pGem-3 previously digested with the same enzymes to finally obtain the construct phTDG. The nucleotide sequence of the final construct was compared with the sequences of the individual clones obtained from the library to ensure that no PCR-generated mutations were included. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). 10 µg of HeLa cell total RNA and 2 µg of poly (A)+ RNA purified from 70 µg of total RNA using Dynabeads Oligo(dT) (DYNAL) and following the manufacturer's protocol were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The positions of the 28 S and 18 S rRNAs were determined by inspection on an UV transilluminator, and the gel was blotted for 16 h in 20 × SSC on a GeneScreen nylon membrane (DuPont NEN). The filter was rinsed in 2 × SSC, baked under vacuum for 1 h at 80°C, and cross-linked for 30 s using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Pre-hybridization was performed in 0.5 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA for 2 h at 65°C. Hybridization was carried out for 12 h at 65°C in the above buffer containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the random-primed labeled F447 gel-purified fragment. After one wash at room temperature and two washes at 65°C for 10 min each in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS, the filter was air-dried and autoradiographed. The mouse cDNA coding region contained as a GAL4 fusion in the plasmid pC87 (a kind gift of D. Nathans) was excised by NcoI and HincII digestion and inserted in the pCITE-1 expression vector (Novagen) digested with NcoI and EcoRV. The resulting construct pCITEmTDG was linearized with XbaI and used as template in in vitro transcription reactions. The phTDG construct described above was linearized either with SalI to produce the full-length human protein or with BglII to produce a C-terminal truncated polypeptide of 201 amino acids, referred to as ΔhTDG. The linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. The transcripts were either boiled for 5 min prior to use or directly translated using nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). All translation reactions were carried out in a final volume of 30 µl in the presence of 3 µg of cRNA, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 66 mM potassium acetate, and 12 µl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Translation mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 90 min with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham Corp.) and 3 µM amino acid mix lacking methionine. Samples of the translation mixtures were either loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for autoradiography of the labeled proteins or used directly in nicking assays. A DNA fragment containing the entire G/T glycosylase ORF was obtained by PCR amplification of the phTDG plasmid using 100 pmol of M13 reverse primer and P8 primer CCTCTAGAATGGAAGCGGAGAACGCGGGC. The amplified product was digested at the 5′-end with XbaI followed by Klenow filling-in reaction and with SalI at the 3′-end. The purified 1232-bp fragment was inserted in the pT7.7 vector digested with SmaI and SalI. The resulting construct, pT7-hTDG, was sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and used for the expression in bacteria of the G/T glycosylase polypeptide. The N terminus of the recombinant protein contains eight amino acid residues derived from the vector (MARIRAPR) prior to the first natural in-frame methionine. The pT7-hTDG plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE3) as described (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). A 10-liter liquid culture derived from a single colony was grown at 37°C to A600 = 0.9. It was then cooled to 22°C and induced with 600 µM IPTG (isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside) for 5 h at 22°C. Bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA (HE buffer), frozen at −20°C, and resuspended in 400 ml of HE buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT. Cells were lysed through two passages in the French press at 4°C, brought to 0.1 M NaCl, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The 400-ml supernatant containing about 90% of the recombinant protein was incubated with 200 ml of a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 5 volumes of HE buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT. Stepwise elution with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 M NaCl in the same buffer yielded the protein in the 0.5 M NaCl fraction (400 ml). This was dialyzed against 4 liters of HE buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT. The dialyzed sample was adsorbed batchwise onto a 50 ml of S Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer, and the TDG protein was eluted with 0.5 M NaCl (100 ml). This fraction was diluted to 0.2 M NaCl with 150 ml of HE buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and loaded on a Resource-S 6-ml FPLC cartridge (Pharmacia). After washing with 10 volumes of 0.2 M NaCl buffer, stepwise elution with 0.3, 0.5, and 1 M NaCl was performed, the protein eluting with 0.3 M NaCl (6 ml). The sample was diluted to 0.1 M NaCl with an equal volume of HE buffer containing 10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT and loaded on a Mono-Q FPLC column (Pharmacia). After a wash with 5 ml of the 0.1 M NaCl buffer, a 0.1-0.5 M NaCl linear gradient (25 min, 0.5 ml/min) was applied, followed by a 1 M NaCl step (1 min). The protein peak was detected in fractions containing approximately 0.3 M NaCl. The FPLC-purified protein (1 mg) was used for immunization of a New Zealand White S.P.F. female rabbit (Charles River) according to standard protocols. Both the preimmune serum and the polyclonal antiserum were purified on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described (11Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescence were performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of the recombinant protein or of the polypeptide present in HeLa nuclear extracts were monitored by means of a “nicking assay,” as described previously (17Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the mismatch-containing 90- or 34-mer oligonucleotide duplexes (40 fmol) were incubated with 25 µg of HeLa nuclear extract, 3 µl of the in vitro translation mixture, or 40 ng of the pure recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. The reactions were performed in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT in a total volume of 25 µl at 30°C for 16, 3, and 1 h, respectively. After the incubation, the reactions were stopped by proteinase K digestion, extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. When the recombinant protein was tested, the dried DNA pellet was solubilized in 4 µl of 0.1 N NaOH and incubated at 90°C for 30 min to cleave the oligonucleotide at the AP site prior to separation on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. In the substrate specificity experiments, the neighboring base 5′ to the G or the m6G involved in the mismatch was either a C or a G. In the antibody neutralization studies, reactions were performed in the absence or presence of preimmune serum or of the specific antiserum under the conditions described above. The protein was purified from 900 g of HeLa cells as described previously (17Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total yield of the nearly homogeneous 55-kDa polypeptide was approximately 45 µg. Partial proteolysis of the pure TDG with trypsin (see “Experimental Procedures”) yielded five peptides, arbitrarily named PEP1-5. These were subjected to microsequencing, and the N-terminal residues of these peptides were as follows: PEP1, MAEAPNMAVVNEQQMPEEVPA; PEP2, CLFMSGLSEVQLN; PEP3, YGIGFTNMVER; PEP4, NLEFGLQP(L or H)K; PEP5, IPDTETLCYVMPS. Retro-translation of the above peptide sequences into DNA yielded a highly degenerate set of oligonucleotides, none of which was judged sufficiently specific for the screening of cDNA libraries. We therefore decided to adopt the strategy described by 16Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, whereby degenerate oligonucleotides complementary to the ends of a selected peptide are used as PCR primers in the amplification of a cDNA fragment encoding the respective peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). This strategy yielded the DNA sequence encoding PEP1, where the central 28 nucleotides could be unambiguously assigned. Using the same technology with PEP2, we were able to obtain a unique sequence of 15 nucleotides, which encoded the central five amino acid residues of PEP2. PCR-cloning primers P3s and P4a, respectively, were designed on the basis of these sequences and used to amplify the cDNA between PEP1 and PEP2. This experiment yielded a 447-bp TDG fragment, F447 (Fig. 1c). The F447 cDNA segment was used as a probe in the screening of a Lambda ZAP II HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene). Two positive phage were identified, and the respective pBluescript SK(−) plasmids were rescued and sequenced. phTDG-1 contained 400 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region and a 265-bp stretch encoding the N-terminal 88 amino acid residues. The fact that PEP1 was found within this fragment confirmed the authenticity of the clone. phTDG-14 contained a 693-bp insert, which did not overlap with the N-terminal sequence of TDG, but which contained PEP2, PEP3, PEP4, and PEP5. In order to obtain the 3′-end of the G/T glycosylase cDNA, the F447 fragment was used to screen a new, unidirectional HeLa cDNA library, Lambda Uni-ZAP (Stratagene). A number of positive clones were identified by PCR amplification of the inserts using the DNA primers P6s and M13 forward (see “Experimental Procedures”). One clone, which gave an amplified fragment of 2,200 bp (phTDG-2), was sequenced and found to contain the poly(A) tail, a polyadenylation signal, a 1,776-bp 3′-untranslated region and the coding sequence up to PEP5. Together, the three lambda clones contained almost all of the TDG cDNA, with the exception of the gap between clones phTDG-1 and phTDG-14. As this 89-bp stretch was present in the F447 fragment, we could construct the entire cDNA sequence of hTDG (Fig. 1), as summarized in Fig. 1c. Northern blot analysis of HeLa total and poly(A)+ RNAs confirmed that the G/T DNA glycosylase mRNA migrates with an apparent size of 3.3-3.4 kilobases (Fig. 1b), which indicates that the sequence in Fig. 1a represents the entire cDNA of the human TDG. The analysis of the positive clones containing the 3′- region of the cDNA revealed that the clones fell into two distinct families (Fig. 1c). One consisted of clones with the sequence AGTAAA 22 nucleotides upstream from the first adenine of the poly(A) tail. The other family of molecules was 100 nucleotides longer at the 3′-end, whereby the poly(A) tail was preceded by a perfect polyadenylation signal sequence, AATAAA, 23 nucleotides upstream. Closer examination of the nucleotide sequence around the upstream polyadenylation sequence revealed a termination signal sequence GTGTG, 31 nucleotides downstream from the AGTAAA motif, suggesting that these signals were used in the premature termination of the mRNA synthesis and in subsequent polyadenylation. Indeed, AGUAAA is the third most efficiently recognized motif in polyadenylation of mRNA, after AAUAAA and AUUAAA (22Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C. Wickens M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5799-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Due to the difference of only 100 nucleotides in the lengths of the two mRNA species, we could not estimate their relative abundance from Northern blot analysis. However, judging by the similar abundance of the short and the long clones in the Lambda Uni-ZAP cDNA library, the premature termination/polyadenylation of the G/T glycosylase mRNA cannot be considered an infrequent event. In summary, the entire sequence of the G/T glycosylase cDNA is shown in Fig. 1a. The full-length cDNA contains a 400-bp 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 1232 bp with a coding capacity of 410 amino acids, and two classes of 3′-untranslated regions of 1676 and 1776 bp, respectively (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, databank searches with the human TDG peptide sequence identified a murine polypeptide (PIR accession number A46132), encoded by a cDNA clone JZA-3, which displayed an 88% identity (92% homology) at the amino acid level with TDG (Fig. 2). The clone was originally identified during a search for proteins capable of interacting with c-Jun in a two-hybrid assay (3Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) but was subsequently discarded for lack of selectivity. We show below that the protein encoded by JZA-3 is the murine homologue of the human TDG. The three cDNA clones, phTDG-1, phTDG-14, and phTDG-2, together with the F447 fragment were used to construct the expression vector, phTDG, containing the entire G/T-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase open reading frame. The phTDG plasmid and a vector pCITEmTDG (encoding the murine enzyme) were used as templates in a T7 RNA polymerase-dependent in vitro transcription (see “Experimental Procedures”). The synthesized RNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine to give proteins of molecular mass around 60 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3a). The lysates containing both the human and the murine polypeptides possessed G/T glycosyla"
https://openalex.org/W2077156149,"Ceramide generation by stimulated sphingomyelinase activity has been implicated in tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) signaling of apoptosis and differentiation. We examined the role of ceramide in a major action of TNF: the initiation of inflammatory events. Sphingomyelinase C at high levels induced inflammatory protein expression in endothelial cells resulting in leukocyte adhesion, but the pattern of induction of adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and cytokines (interleukins 6 and 8) differed from that induced by TNF. TNF induced only a small increase in ceramide: using lower doses of sphingomyelinase to mimic this we found that small amounts of ceramide did not induce protein expression, but still rapidly activated Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and ERKs. TNF additionally caused rapid p38 and JNK-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and efficient NF-κB translocation, which could not be achieved even by high levels of ceramide. Thus activation of the ERK cascade alone is an incomplete endothelial cell stimulus, and the TNF receptor generates at least two signals: Raf-1 activation, which could be ceramide-dependent; and ceramide-independent efficient NF-κB translocation and activation of p38 and JNK-1 mitogen-activated kinases.

A major site of action of TNF for these effects is the vascular endothelium (3Pober J.S. Cotran R.S. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 70: 427-451Crossref Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), where it induces inflammatory responses by enhancing adhesion molecule expression and cytokine secretion. The binding of TNF to the TNFR1 receptor on endothelial cells (4Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mackay F. Loetscher H. Stueber D. Gehr G. Lesslauer W. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) is followed by rapid translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (6Heller R.A. Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This translocation is important for stimulated transcription of the adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, and the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (7Collins T. Lab. Invest. 1995; 68: 499-508Google Scholar), which all possess NF-κB promoter/enhancer elements. The regulated expression of these genes initiates the inflammatory cascade; E-selectin mediates the initial interaction of leukocytes with endothelium (8McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

The signaling pathways that couple TNF receptor activation to functional responses have remained elusive. TNF activates Raf kinase, initiating the ERK MAP kinase cascade, in some cells, while in others it activates a parallel path(s), likely via MEK kinase, that activates the p38 and JNK MAP kinases (10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). How these cascades are initiated remains unknown, but recent data suggest ceramide may couple the TNF receptor to certain downstream events (11Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

This outline, however, has been derived only in the context of growth regulation or induction of apoptosis (22Pushkareva M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As different domains of the TNF receptor signal apoptosis (23Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), coupling of the receptor to inflammatory events may differ from cell cycle related events. Here we determined if the ceramide proposed in the context of cell growth and viability also underlies the inflammatory effect of TNF on one of its major in vivo targets. We report that ceramide at high levels does activate primary cultures of human endothelial cells to synthesize certain inflammatory proteins. However, the small amount of ceramide evoked by TNF was incapable of stimulating a functional response from these cells, and TNF activated MAP kinase cascades that were inaccessible to ceramide. Conversely ceramide at the low levels induced by TNF rapidly stimulates a Raf-1/ERK kinase cascade, and so may couple TNF receptor activation to this pathway.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, with <1% contamination with CD45+ cells, and human neutrophils labeled with 111In-oxine were as described (26Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, TNF was used at 1000 units/ml and sphingomyelinase was used at 1 unit/ml. 111In-Neutrophil adhesion was quantified as described (27Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Mehra M. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Short chain ceramide analogs (10−2M in ethanol) were added to sterile HBSS/A and rocked at 37°C for 1 h prior to use. The effect of anti-E-selectin antibody was determined by preincubating the monolayer with 10 µg/ml P6E2 monoclonal antibody for 30 min and performing the adhesion assay with this concentration of antibody. Adhesion values are reported as the mean and range of duplicate values and are representative of at least two experiments. In some cases PMN adhesion to activated endothelial cells was determined by capturing the microscopic image with a videocamera, and using a framegrabber and NIH Image 1.47 to obtain a single image. Lucifer yellow staining showed glass bead cell permeabilization and resealing (28Fennell D.F. Whatley R.E. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was >80% effective, while mock incubations gave <0.1% Lucifer yellow-positive cells. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, endothelial cells were released by swirling (200 rpm for 3 min; 24°C) in the presence of Trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and gently repipetting the contents of the culture dish. The cells were washed twice in 50% goat serum, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with anti-E-selectin (P6E2), ICAM-1 (18E3D), or VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody in this buffer. Staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, also in 50% goat serum, was followed by fixation in 0.5% formaldehyde. Viability of recovered unfixed cells was examined in initial experiments using propidium iodide to gate viable cells (29Patel K.D. Modur V. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 631-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblots, monolayers were solubilized with boiling Laemmli buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204462) Google Scholar) without β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated under nonreducing conditions in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and probed with 1 µg/ml 3E6. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse (1:5000) in 100 µg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG in TBST was used as a secondary antibody before staining was detected by ECL. IL-6 and IL-8 were quantitated by sandwich ELISA with polyclonal rabbit anti-human antibody; detection employed biotinylated rabbit anti-human IL-8 or IL-6 and avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (31Weyrich A.S.

Nuclear extracts and mobility shift assays (32Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) were modified as follows; 35-mm monolayers were washed with cold 1 mM PMSF in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and pelleted (300 × g for 5 min at 4°C). The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 100 µM leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice, vortexing every 2 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The nuclear pellets were washed three times with 500 µl of buffer A without Nonidet P-40 before resuspension in 25 µl of buffer B (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 100 µM leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT). These were sonicated for 5 s in a sonic cleaner, incubated for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min, and the supernatants (13,000 × g, 10 min) analyzed immediately. For this ~3 µg of nuclear protein (Bradford protein assay) were incubated at 24°C for 15 min with ~30,000 cpm (~37.5 pmol) of 32P-end-labeled NF-κB-specific probe, 6 µl of 5 × gel shift binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 20% glycerol), 1.5 µg of poly(dI-dC), and 3.75 pmol of Oct-1 oligonucleotide as nonspecific competitor DNA in a final volume of 30 µl. The products were electrophoresed in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer, transferred, and the dried gel autoradiographed. Inclusion of 100-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide abrogated formation of DNA-probe complexes. Growth medium was replaced at 60% confluence, and the cells then grown in [14C]serine (1 µCi/ml). Lipids from 2 × 106 cells were extracted (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41039) Google Scholar) and separated by high performance-TLC (100:30:35:3, chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water). Sphingomyelin (~104 cpm) and phosphatidylserine (~2 × 104 cpm), identified by standards, were scraped and quantified for radioactivity. Phosphatidylserine labeling was not affected by treatment with either TNF or sphingomyelinase. A modified version of the diacylglycerol kinase assay was used to quantitate ceramide mass; 1) only glass tubes were used, 2) N-octanoylsphingosine and diacylglycerol were standards, 3) reactions were 3 h, and 4) the completed reaction mixture was separated by high performance-TLC. 32P-Labeled ceramide phosphate and phosphatidic acid bands were scraped and then quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were serum-starved for 20-26 h in M199 with 0.5% human serum albumin, treated with agonist for the stated times, and then washed with 4°C phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in 200 µl of kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mg/ml human serum albumin, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 100 µM leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 25 µM ATP) and disrupted by passage through a 25-gauge needle 10 times. Debris was cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min), and kinases immunoprecipitated with Protein A agarose macrobeads (Sigma) (preincubated in kinase buffer) for 2 h at 4°C with 3 µg of kinase antibody and then washed three times with 500 µl of kinase buffer. The protein A-antibody complex was added to 50 µl of cell lysates, rocked for 1 h, and washed twice with kinase buffer. Jun kinase assays used 100 ng of c-Jun, p38 kinase assays used 250 ng of ATF-2, and Raf-1 kinase assays used 1 µg of MEK-1. Immunoprecipitated ERK kinase was assayed using an Amersham MAP kinase assay kit. Immunoprecipitated kinases, or nonimmune controls, and relevant substrates were incubated with ~2.5 nCi of ATP in 25 µl of kinase buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by boiling with 8 µl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. Western blots of these kinases were performed using the same antibodies used for immunoprecipitation. First we determined if ceramide elicited an inflammatory response in endothelial cells by exposing these cells to the water-soluble synthetic ceramide analog N-octanoylsphingosine (C8-ceramide). Synthetic ceramides activated endothelial cells to bind quiescent PMN and, like the response to TNF, this could be inhibited by a blocking monoclonal antibody against E-selectin (Fig. 1). Since this adhesion molecule is solely expressed by activated endothelial cells (34Bevilacqua M.P. Nelson R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), the synthetic ceramide acted on endothelial cells and not on PMN. Accordingly an anti-β2 integrin antibody, which blocks adhesion of activated PMN, failed to inhibit this endothelial cell-dependent adhesion (data not shown). This stimulation also was not due to contaminating endotoxin (a potent endothelial cell agonist), as polymyxin B failed to block it (data not shown). We next determined whether endogenous ceramide, derived from cellular sphingomyelin, also effected this response. Treatment of endothelial cells with sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C activated them to bind quiescent PMN, and increasing amounts of sphingomyelinase C gave enhanced levels of adhesion (Fig. 2A). The response was sigmoidal with no apparent effect at 0.1 unit of enzyme activity, an important issue in light of the results presented below. Again, polymyxin B had no effect on PMN adhesion (data not shown). Increased adhesion was not immediate, but developed over the same period of several hours required for TNF's effects to become manifest (data not shown). We therefore assessed E-selectin surface expression by flow cytometry and found sphingomyelinase C, like TNF, activated endothelial cells from a basal state where no E-selectin was expressed to one where significant amounts were present on the surface (Fig. 2C). The amount of E-selectin induced by sphingomyelinase C treatment was always less than that expressed in response to TNF, and since this pattern obtained after 4 and 8 h of exposure, it was not due to a markedly different rate of E-selectin expression. Nevertheless, this amount of E-selectin was sufficient to account for the increase in PMN adhesion. A blocking E-selectin monoclonal antibody significantly inhibited TNF-induced adhesion and completely blocked that induced by sphingomyelinase C (Fig. 2B). Thus hydrolysis of cellular sphingomyelin to ceramide is an endothelial cell stimulus that induces at least one key inflammatory response of these cells. The hypothesis that TNF signaling proceeds via an activated sphingomyelinase C predicts the ceramide produced by this enzyme should exactly mimic responses evoked by TNF. Accordingly, we examined other endothelial cell responses and found sphingomyelinase C induced expression of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, as well as E-selectin, and that it induced secretion of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 3). However, except for IL-6 expression, even a maximally effective amount of sphingomyelinase C was a weak agonist compared to TNF. Similarly water-soluble ceramide analogs induced expression of all these molecules, but also were weak agonists for these responses (data not shown.) Thus sphingomyelinase C stimulates endothelial cell inflammatory responses, but it appears unlikely that ceramide alone accounts for all the effects of TNF on endothelial cells. The results above suggest the 55-kDa TNF receptor (4Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1724-1730PubMed Google Scholar) must, at a minimum, activate another signaling pathway in this cell type. There is a caveat to this conclusion, however, as it is postulated that intracellular pools of sphingomyelin generate the ceramide that mediates signaling (21DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 25Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so extracellular sphingomyelinase C might generate ceramide that may not have adequate access to its signaling effector. To circumvent this limitation, we reversibly permeabilized endothelial cells with glass beads under conditions where molecules as large as antibodies gain access to the interior of the cell (28Fennell D.F. Whatley R.E. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Permeabilized monolayers were treated with sphingomyelinase C, a water-soluble ceramide analog, or TNF and allowed to reseal. We found permeabilized and resealed endothelial cells still responded to TNF, as they synthesized E-selectin at levels indistinguishable from untreated monolayers, and that this procedure had only a minor stimulatory effect on monolayers exposed only to buffer (Fig. 4). However, when sphingomyelinase C and ceramide from the external aspect of the plasma membrane, or water-soluble ceramide analogs, had access to the interior of the cell, they remained weak agonists for E-selectin expression. We found (Fig. 4) that intracellular ceramide, derived from the cell's own metabolically active pool, also failed to generate significant E-selectin synthesis by using 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol to block ceramide metabolism to glycosylceramide. We conclude the failure of ceramide to act as a full inflammatory agonist was not due to inadequate access to the cell's signaling machinery. TNF stimulation can lead to enhanced levels of ceramide through a receptor-stimulated sphingomyelinase(s) activity (14Dressler K.A. Mathias S. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1992; 255: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar): resynthesis of sphingomyelin completes the ceramide cycle (11Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined whether this also occurred in endothelial cells, and found that TNF caused a rapid loss of half of the sphingomyelin pool (Fig. 5A). This depressed level was maintained for 1 h before returning to near basal level by 2 h. TNF correspondingly caused a small increase in ceramide levels within 10 min that continued to increase over the 2 h of the experiment (Fig. 5B). However, the increase was only 20% over basal levels by 30 min, with just an 80% increase following 2 h of TNF exposure. Since the loss of sphingomyelin was greater than the accumulation of ceramide, and the timing of sphingomyelin loss and ceramide accumulation differ, we infer much of the initial burst of ceramide was metabolized. We also found (Fig. 5B) that TNF did not cause diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C and acidic sphingomyelinase activity (21DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 36Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), to accumulate. In contrast to TNF, endothelial cells treated with sphingomyelinase C demonstrated a rapid decrease in sphingomyelin levels, equivalent to that induced by TNF treatment, and this depressed level of sphingomyelin content was maintained over the 2 h of the experiment (Fig. 5A). This resulted in a rapid, and large, enhancement in the cellular complement of ceramide (Fig. 5C); within 10 min of exposure to exogenous sphingomyelinase C, there was a sustained rise in cellular ceramide to 9 times its basal level. Despite the large increases in cellular ceramide content, there was not a concomitant change in diglyceride levels, demonstrating the substrate specificity of this enzyme. We also determined the amount of cell-associated ceramide following treatment of endothelial cell monolayers with a water-soluble ceramide analog and found a 4-5-fold increase in ceramide levels, with no increase in diglyceride levels or decrement in sphingomyelin content (data not shown). We conclude that TNF induces a complete ceramide cycle in endothelial cells, but that the peak ceramide accumulation is far less than that induced by exogenous sphingomyelinase C. Additionally, TNF-induced ceramide accumulation relevant to early signaling events was modest, being only 20-30% over basal levels. We determined if a small increase in ceramide could mimic TNF by reducing the amount of sphingomyelinase C in our experiments. We found a graded increase in cellular ceramide could be attained by varying the amount of sphingomyelinase C (Fig. 6A). Although this did not occur in a linear fashion, 0.1 unit of enzyme produced somewhat more ceramide accumulation that did TNF treatment. We then examined E-selectin accumulation as a function of sphingomyelinase C activity and found (Fig. 6B) that 0.5 and 1 unit gave levels of expression that were about half that induced by TNF. However, E-selectin expression was completely undetectable by this sensitive assay when the cells were exposed to 0.1 unit of sphingomyelinase C. Thus the small alterations in ceramide content induced by TNF alone are not able to stimulate E-selectin accumulation. We sought to determine by what mechanisms TNF and ceramide activate endothelial cells, and to elucidate the differences between them. TNF signaling is complicated in that in some systems it is Raf-dependent (24Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R. Neuloh M. Herrmann F. Kronke M. Brach M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) while in others it is Raf-independent (37Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol.

With regard to the control of MF synthesis, it has long been known that eyestalk removal leads to a rapid hypertrophy of the MO (20Bazin F. C. R. Acad. Sci.

This procedure also results in increases in synthesis and circulating titer of MF (3Laufer H. Landau M. Homola E. Borst D.W. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 1129-1131Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Laufer H. Landau M. Borst D.W. Homola E. Andries J.C. Dhainaut A. Advances in Invertebrate Reproduction 4. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 135Google Scholar), which can be reduced by injection of sinus gland extract (22Tsukimura B. Borst D.W. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1992; 86: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results clearly suggest that MF synthesis is modulated by a neuropeptide produced and released from the X-organ sinus gland complex of the eyestalk. This phenomenon is particularly significant in view of the established roles of the allatostatins in repressing JH synthesis by the corpora allata in insects (23Tobe S.S. Yu C.G. Bendena W.G. Davey K.G. Peter R.E. Tobe S.S. Perspectives in Comparative Endocrinology. National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa1994: 12Google Scholar, 24Stay B. Tobe S.S. Bendena W.G. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 25: 268-337Google Scholar). Thus, in both insects and crustaceans, juvenoid synthesis appears to be regulated by inhibitory neuropeptides. It therefore, seemed opportune, to identify the neuropeptide(s) regulating MF synthesis in crustaceans. We report here the complete amino acid sequence of a neuropeptide and a variant which profoundly inhibit MF synthesis in the edible crab Cancer pagurus, and demonstrate that these peptides are further members of the molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) group within the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) neuropeptide family. Consideration of structural and functional relationships between these neuropeptides, together with the proposed roles of MF, suggest that complex interendocrine mechanisms may control growth and reproduction in crustaceans. Edible crabs, C. pagurus, were obtained locally from commercial fishermen and briefly stored in a recirculating seawater system under ambient light and temperature conditions prior to use. MO were dissected in pairs from ice-anesthetized, intermolt (Stage C4) female C. pagurus (noting stage of vitellogenesis) and preincubated on ice in a drop of modified Medium 199 (25Brody M.D. Chang E.S. Invertebr. Reprod. Dev. 1989; 16: 141-147Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for 1 h. MO were subsequently cultured pairwise (control MO versus treated contralateral MO) in microtiter plates with 200 µl of the same medium, supplemented with 37 kBq L-[3H-methyl]methionine (2.92 TBq/mmol; Amersham Corp.) for upto 24 h at 12°C, removed, and rapidly frozen in liquid N2 prior to extraction and analysis. MF was extracted from MO by homogenization in 700 µl of CH3CN, 4% NaCl: 5/2 v/v, centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), and partitioned (three times) against 500 µl of hexane. The dried hexane extract was assayed for [3H]MF using HPLC and an on-line radioactivity flow monitor (Flo-one/Beta, Canberra Packard Ltd.). [12-3H]all-trans-MF (0.19 TBq/mmol) was used as a standard. Chromatographic conditions were: Novapak C18 (Waters) 100 × 8-mm column, isocratic elution with 80% MeOH, flow rate, 2 ml min−1 (retention time (Rt) of MF, 21.6 min). The identity of the labeled product was confirmed by co-chromatography with authentic all-trans-MF on a silica column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm; Rainin Instruments) eluted isocratically with 2% diethyl ether in 50% water-saturated hexane at 1 ml min−1, by measuring radioactivity and absorbance at 214 nm (Rt of MF, 7.0 min). Under our culture conditions, very little (<5%) of the synthesized MF was released into the culture medium. To identify active fractions obtained by HPLC of sinus gland (SG) extracts (see below), fractions were pooled, initially dividing the chromatogram into six zones, dried, and reconstituted in culture medium to 2 SG equivalents (SGE)/200 µl. This material was bioassayed, using the conditions described above, but for 4-h culture periods, and the resultant active zone further fractionally assayed to determine the bioactive peptide peaks. Since the inhibition of MF synthesis was highly dependent on the vitellogenic stage of the donor crab (see “Results”), data were expressed as an “MF inhibition index,” calculated as the percent inhibition of MF synthesis in the test sample divided by the mean maximum percent inhibition of MF synthesis (2SGE) for a crab at the same vitellogenic stage. Eyestalks were removed from ice-anesthetized, intermolt (Stage C4) C. pagurus. Sinus glands were dissected in batches of approximately 200, and neuropeptides were extracted in 2 M acetic acid as detailed previously (26Webster S.G. Keller R. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1986; 156: 617-624Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Extracts were reconstituted in 2 M acetic acid, centrifuged (14,000 × g, 5 min) and purified by HPLC. Conditions were: column, Waters µBondapak phenyl 3.9 × 300 mm; solvent A, 0.11% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B, 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient 30-80% solvent B over 60 min, 1 ml min−1. Eluate was monitored at 210 nm, and fractions were collected every minute or manually for identified peptides. Fractions were immediately dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at −20°C. 1-2-nmol portions (100-200 SG) of the most abundant, bioactive peptide (hereafter referred to as MOIH-1) were S-carboxymethylated with iodoacetic acid (27Chang E.S. Prestwich G.D. Bruce M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and purified by HPLC (Bakerbond WP C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 40-80% solvent B over 45 min, 1 ml min−1). Nanomole quantities of S-carboxymethylated peptide (S-CM-MOIH) were cleaved using one of the following endoproteinases: Lys-C, Asp-N, trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade), purified by HPLC, and small portions of cleaved peptides analyzed for amino acid composition, using reported procedures (28Webster S.G. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1991; 244: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Material of high yield and unequivocal amino acid composition was sequenced on an automated pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 471A). Additionally, 1-2 nmol samples of S-CM-MOIH-1 and −2 were N-terminally sequenced to the limits of unambiguous residue assignment (residue 32). Molecular weight determinations from 100-500 pmol quantities of peptide fragments generated by Lys-C endoproteinase digestion, native MOIH-1 and −2, and S-CM-MOIH-1 were obtained using a variety of MS techniques. Samples dissolved in 400 µl of 50% CH3CN containing 0.1% HCOOH were introduced into a VG Quattro MS at 10 µl min−1 using a Waters 600MS HPLC system. Samples were analyzed in the positive ion mode (source temperature 70°C; capillary voltage, 3.53 kV; lens voltage, 0.13 kV; scan range, m/z 500-2000; calibration with equine heart myoglobin). Sample was dissolved in 50% CH3CN and added to an equal volume of matrix solution (1%α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% CH3CN containing 1% citric acid). 1 µl of this mixture was analyzed using a Vestec Laser desorption MS (acceleration voltage, 25 kV; detector voltage, 3.4 kV; laser at 6% maximum; calibration with insulin internal standard). Samples were analyzed on (a) a VG Quattro MS (positive ion mode; acceleration voltage, 5 kV, cesium ion gun, 25 kV; mass range, 800-3500 Da; sample was dissolved in 50% CH3CN, 2 µl mixed with an equal volume of 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix and smeared on the probe tip), (b) a VG Autospec MS (positive ion mode, acceleration voltage 8 kV; cesium ion gun, 8 kV; mass range, 4500 Da); sample was dissolved in 50% CH3CN, 2 µl mixed with an equal volume of glycerol/thioglycerol matrix, including 0.5 µl of 1% HCl and smeared on the probe tip. Pooled fractions from HPLC purifications of sinus glands, containing material previously determined as MOIHs, and material identified as MIH (29Chung J.S. Wilkinson M.C. Webster S.G. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were assayed at an approximate dose of 0.75 SGE, using an in vitro Y-organ bioassay (30Webster S.G. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1986; 61: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but pairs of halved Y-organs were used instead of the pairwise comparison originally described. Ecdysteroid radioimmunoassay (31Borst D.W. O'Connor J.D. Steroids. 1974; 24: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) used an antiserum (Code H2A) raised against the 22-succinyl derivative of ecdysone (32Horn D.H.S. Wilkie J.S. Sage B.A. O'Connor J.D. J. Insect Physiol. 1976; 22: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During culture periods between 4 and 24 h, MO synthesized MF in an asymptotic manner, and it was significant to note that in animals that had been eyestalk-ablated 24 h prior to assay, MF biosynthesis more than doubled compared with eyestalk-intact animals when MOs were cultured over a 24-h assay period (Fig. 1). Analysis of MF synthesis by pairs of glands over this period (Table I) showed that MO pairs taken from eyestalk-ablated crabs produced very similar quantities of MF; pairwise comparison by matched-paired t test showed no significant difference in means between MO pairs and highly significant pairing correlations (0.8-0.99). For eyestalk-intact crabs, rather greater variation was evident. Nevertheless, significant differences in MF synthesis could not be observed between means of replicates of gland pairs. Thus, since pairs of MO produce similar quantities of MF, this assay could be used for the further identification of MOIH, where one gland acted as a control and the contralateral gland as a treatment. When MO were exposed to crude sinus gland extract, MF synthesis was profoundly inhibited, but an intriguing finding was that the degree of inhibition was highly dependent on the stage of vitellogenesis of the MO donor; maximal in early vitellogenic animals and minimal in animals that had completed vitellogenesis (Table II). Since vitellogenic crabs were found throughout the year, the (preferable) use of only early vitellogenic crabs would have been impracticable in view of the much larger numbers required. Thus, inhibition of MF synthesis was calculated as an index as detailed above. Since MO rapidly converted significant amounts of radiolabeled methionine to MF, the incubation period for the bioassay was usually 4 h; during this period MO from eyestalk-ablated donors incorporated around 80,000 dpm of radiolabel from L-[3H-methyl]methionine to MF (Fig. 1, Table I). Dose-response experiments demonstrated dose dependence of MF synthesis to inhibitory effects of various amounts of SG extracts (Fig. 2), although considerable variability in inhibition was observed at doses below 0.05 SGE.Table IIncorporation of L-[3H-methyl]methionine into MF by MO pairsIncubation time4 h6 h15 h24 hIntact crabsReplicates5553LRLRLRLRConversion to MF, dpm × 10−352.3 ± 6.757.8 ± 5.567.1 ± 14.381.0 ± 9.475.7 ± 24.789.8 ± 9.1167.1 ± 8.9160.3 ± 31.0Eyestalk-ablated crabsReplicates5545LRLRLRLRConversion to MF, dpm × 10−368.8 ± 10.167.4 ± 19.9113.8 ± 11.0113.0 ± 15.6219.7 ± 11.4207.4 ± 15.6370.0 ± 24.7379.3 ± 24.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIInhibition (percent) of MF synthesis in MO by sinus gland extract: effect of donor vitellogenic stage upon inhibition of MF synthesisMean ± S.E.nEarly vitellogenic ovary89.7 ± 6.15Mid-vitellogenic ovary53.4 ± 11.75Late vitellogenic ovary17.4 ± 8.73 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Dose-response relationship showing inhibition of MF synthesis in MO exposed to homogenates of SG (from intermolt crabs).

Since MOIH-1 was at least twice as abundant in the SG (approximately 10 pmol/SG) compared with MOIH-2, this material was first fully sequenced. Digestion of peptide with Lys-C endoproteinase gave highly reproducible cleavage patterns (Fig. 4), and the fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation and their Mr determined by mass spectrometry (Table III). In every instance, agreement was obtained between masses predicted by sequence and mass spectrometric analysis, within the limits of accuracy of the latter techniques. Overlaps were obtained by selective sequencing of peptide fragments obtained by digestion with Asp-N, and trypsin, and from N-terminal sequencing of S-CM-MOIH-1, as detailed in Fig. 5. The predicted molecular weights of native and S-CM-MOIH-1 were in complete agreement with mass spectrometric determinations (Table III).Fig. 4HPLC profiles of Lys-C digestions of S-CM-MOIH-1 (a) and −2 (b).

Within the limits af accuracy of the technique used, the only significant difference was a molar excess of glutamic acid and deficit of lysine, and the estimated molecular weight was very similar (9236.9 and 9235.6 for MOIH-2 and −1, respectively, accurate by ES/MS to ~1 Da). N-terminal sequencing showed that the first 32 amino acids were identical. Concurrent digestions of both (S-carboxymethylated) peptides, followed by HPLC (Fig. 4) and amino acid analysis (data not shown), demonstrated that fragments L2, L3, and L5 were most likely identical for both peptides. A single amino acid difference at position 33 from lysine to glutamate or glutamine would account for the differences in amino acid composition of the complete peptide and the cleavage pattern after Lys-C digestion of MOIH-2 (absence of L1 and L4, presence and amino acid composition of L1 and L4). Limited sequencing of L1 and L4 confirmed that residue 33 of MOIH-2 was glutamine rather than glutamate.Table IVAmino acid analysis of MOIH-1 and −2Amino acidMOIH-1 sequenceMOIH-1 analysisMOIH-2 analysisAsx1714.815.0Glx88.79.71/2Cys6NDNDSer11.31.5Pro0NDNDHis000Arg66.36.3Gly45.15.1Thr33.03.1Ala66.06.1Tyr22.22.4Trp4NDNDMet12.21.8Val11.51.7Phe44.03.8Ile66.26.1Leu55.66.1Lys44.43.5 Open table in a new tab HPLC fractions containing both MOIHs and those containing MIH were assayed for MIH activity (repression of ecdysteroid synthesis by Y-organs in vitro) at an approximate dose of 0.75 SGE. MIH repressed ecdysteroid synthesis to the maximum possible extent in this assay (mean ± S.E.: 61.85 ± 4.4% repression, n = 11), while MOIH showed much less activity, with considerable variability in response (24.75%± 14.7%, n = 10). This investigation has identified a neuropeptide from the sinus gland of C. pagurus, which represses synthesis of the crustacean juvenile hormone, MF, by the mandibular organ and is, thus, named MOIH. With respect to the action of this neuropeptide, two features are of interest. First, the synthesis of MF was higher in eyestalk-ablated crabs compared with controls, suggesting that the synthesis of MF is continuously modulated by MOIH and that the MO are rapidly activated in the absence of the inhibitory influence of this hormone. A similar phenomenon has been reported for the spider crab, Libinia emarginata (3Laufer H. Landau M. Homola E. Borst D.W. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 1129-1131Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the lobster, Homarus americanus (33Borst D.W. Tsukimura B. Laufer H. Couch E.F. Biol. Bull. 1994; 186: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the degree of inhibition of the MO by MOIH is related to the vitellogenic stage of the MO donor crab, being maximal during early stages of vitellogenesis and minimal in animals that had completed vitellogenesis. Two SG neuropeptides, MOIH-1 and −2 inhibited MF synthesis in vitro. The former was fully sequenced and was found to be a 78 residue peptide (average Mr 9235.6), with unblocked N and C termini. Consideration of sequence and mass spectrometric results suggested three intrachain disulfide bridges. Although MOIH-2 was not completely sequenced, the first 32 residues were identical, and Lys-C digestions, amino acid analysis of fragments, limited sequencing of L1 and L4 and molecular weight determination demonstrated that Lys was replaced by Gln at position 33. This difference could be accounted for by a single base substitution (A-C). While this might suggest allelic polymorphism, preliminary results obtained from HPLC analysis of SG peptides from individual crabs show that both MOIHs are always present. The sequence of MOIH clearly shows significant similarities (50-60%) to members of the CHH group and in particular to members of the MIH and vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone/gonad-inhibiting hormone (VIH/GIH) neuropeptides (Fig. 6). While an early study to identify neuropeptides involved in regulation of MF synthesis suggested that the chromatophorotrophins, red pigment-concentrating hormone and pigment-dispersing hormone, respectively, stimulated and inhibited MF synthesis in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii (34Landau M. Laufer H. Homola E. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1989; 16: 165-168Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we have been unable to confirm this result in C. pagurus. However, recent studies using P. clarkii (35Laufer H. Lui L. Van Herp F. Borkovec A.J. Loeb M.J. Insect Neurochemistry and Neurophysiology. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1994: 203Google Scholar) have indicated that a CHH-like molecule inhibits MF synthesis in this species, a result at least reconcilable with our results. Furthermore, a recent preliminary report 2L. Liu and H. Laufer (1995) Poster presented at the Sixth International Conference on the Juvenile Hormones, Woods Hole, MA (September 10-15, 1995). has indicated that in the spider crab, L. emarginata, three peptides that inhibit MF synthesis, and that also have hyperglycemic activity, have been isolated; the primary structure of one of the peptides indicates that it is a CHH-like molecule. In C. pagurus, material identified by homologous bioassay as CHHs elute in HPLC separations of SGs as two prominent, incompletely separated peaks with retention times of around 50 min. While CHH is moderately active in repressing ecdysteroid synthesis by the Y-organs, in addition to MIH, in C. pagurus (29Chung J.S. Wilkinson M.C. Webster S.G. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Carcinus maenas (26Webster S.G. Keller R. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1986; 156: 617-624Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), it should be stressed that neither of these peptides exhibited any inhibitory activity on MO in vitro (see Fig. 3). Thus, in C. pagurus it is clear that CHH does not act as an MOIH and that MF synthesis is inhibited by distinct MOIHs. In a broader context, it is of interest to note that the MOIH neuropeptides identified in this study, and those inferred from studies on P. clarkii (34Landau M. Laufer H. Homola E. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1989; 16: 165-168Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and L. emarginata2 show no sequence similarities with the allatostatins identified in insects (23Tobe S.S. Yu C.G. Bendena W.G. Davey K.G. Peter R.E. Tobe S.S. Perspectives in Comparative Endocrinology. National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa1994: 12Google Scholar, 24Stay B. Tobe S.S. Bendena W.G. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 25: 268-337Google Scholar). Thus, an important dichotomy in neurohormonal control of juvenoid synthesis (JH, MF) in arthropods is now evident. The relationship between MIH and MOIH is of particular interest, since these neuropeptides, respectively, inhibit ecdysteroid (26Webster S.G. Keller R. J. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1986; 156: 617-624Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and juvenoid synthesis. HPLC fractions corresponding to MIH were inactive in the MOIH bioassay, and MOIH had a somewhat limited and variable activity in the MIH bioassay. Thus, despite sequence similarities, MIH and MOIH appear to be functionally distinct. Nevertheless, consideration of a recent report (19Tamone S.L. Chang E.S. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1993; 89: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that ecdysteroid synthesis by Y-organs of Cancer magister could be promoted in the presence of MF- or MO-conditioned medium, in addition to reports which clearly demonstrate that injection of MO homogenates profoundly accelerate molting in vivo by heterologous bioassay in a variety of crustaceans (17Taketomi Y. Kawano Y. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1989; 9: 1069-1074Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Yudin A.I. Diener R.A. Clark Jr., W.H. Chang E.S. Biol. Bull. 1980; 159: 760-772Crossref Google Scholar), suggest that MF may generally act as an ecdysiotropin. Whilst the direct inhibitory influence of MIH and CHH on Y-organs is well established (for a recent review, see Ref. 36Webster S.G. Hartnoll R.G. Hawkins S.J. Marine Biology-A Port Erin Perspective. Immel, London1996Google Scholar), our findings clearly show that MOIH represses MF synthesis. Thus, considering the reports detailing the ecdysiotropic ativity of MF, it seems entirely reasonable to suggest that synthesis of ecdysteroids by the Y-organ, and consequently molting, may be directly controlled by MIH and CHH, and indirectly by MOIH, clearly suggesting complex, essentially inhibitory regulatory mechanisms, without precedent in the arthropods. With respect to establishing physiologically relevant roles for MOIH in the control of reproduction, the somewhat equivocal role of MF in this process is of critical importance. Whilst the balance of evidence suggests that MF has a key role (see Ref. 13Laufer H. Ahl J.S.B. Sagi A. Am. Zool. 1993; 33: 365-374Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar for review) in stimulating gonadal development, and in view of correlative relationships between MF titer and ovarian maturation in some crustaceans (3Laufer H. Landau M. Homola E. Borst D.W. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 1129-1131Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Laufer H. Landau M. Borst D.W. Homola E. Andries J.C. Dhainaut A. Advances in Invertebrate Reproduction 4. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 135Google Scholar), firmly established roles for MF in defined physiological processes during gonadal maturation remain to be defined, in contrast to well established roles of JH III in insect reproduction (37Wyatt G.R. Braun R.D. Edwards G.C. Glinka A.N. Zhang J. Davey K.G. Peter R.E. Tobe S.S. Perspectives in Comparative Endocrinology. National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa1994: 202Google Scholar). Despite such shortcomings, two aspects of this study may relate to the proposed involvement of MF and MOIH in reproduction. First, the variation in inhibitory action of MOIH, which was found to be highly dependent on the ovarian stage of the donor. For crabs in very early vitellogenic stages, MOIH inhibition was maximal, and the inhibitory activity of MOIH declined quite markedly during subsequent stages of vitellogenesis. This phenomenon suggested that MOs become insensitive to MOIH during vitellogenesis. A further observation that may be of consequence with respect to the initiation of vitellogensis is that a marked, but transient, rise in MF levels is seen in C. pagurus hemolymph at the onset of secondary vitellogenesis (38Wainwright, G., 1995, Hormonal Control of Ovarian Development in the Edible Crab Cancer pagurus. Ph.D. thesis, University of Liverpool.Google Scholar). The second observation relates to the similarity of structure between MOIH and the VIH/GIH. A classical tenet in crustacean endocrinology concerns the action of VIH. This sinus gland neuropeptide apparently inhibits vitellogenesis, as evidenced by many studies reporting accelerated gonadal development in sexually mature eyestalk-ablated female crustaceans (for review, see Ref. 39Meusy J.-J. Payen G.G. Zool. Sci. 1988; 5: 217-265Google Scholar). The only fully characterized (sequenced) VIH (40Soyez D. Le Caer J.-P. Noël P.Y. Rossier J. Neuropeptides. 1991; 20: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was identified from H. americanus sinus glands using a heterologous in vivo bioassay (41Soyez D. Van Deijnen J.-E. Martin M. J. Exp. Zool. 1987; 244: 479-484Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it is entirely feasible that the action of this hormone was indirect in that its action could involve repression of MF synthesis in the donor, i.e. VIH/GIH is equivalent to MOIH. Indeed, the evident sequence similarity between MOIH and VIH might support this view. While this study has identified new peptides, which are likely to be of key importance in controlling reproduction and growth, it should be stressed, if further reiteration is indeed necessary, that very little is known about the physiological significance of any of the CHH or MIH group peptides, and it is evident that complex interendocrine interactions will be discovered.

In the present studies, signaling via the adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway was investigated in the murine thymoma-derived T-cell line, EL4.IL-2. Northern analysis of EL4.IL-2 cells identified the presence of 4-kilobase CB2 but not CB1 receptor-subtype mRNA transcripts. Southern analysis of genomic DNA digests for the CB2 receptor demonstrated identical banding patterns for EL4.IL-2 cells and mouse-derived DNA, both of which were dissimilar to DNA isolated from rat. Treatment of EL4.IL-2 cells with either cannabinol or Δ9-THC disrupted the adenylate cyclase signaling cascade by inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation which consequently led to a decrease in protein kinase A activity and the binding of transcription factors to a CRE consensus sequence. Likewise, an inhibition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-induced interleukin 2 (IL-2) protein secretion, which correlated to decreased IL-2 gene transcription, was induced by both cannabinol and Δ9-THC. Further, cannabinoid treatment also decreased PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factor binding to the AP-1 proximal site of the IL-2 promoter. Conversely, forskolin enhanced PMA/ionomycin-induced AP-1 binding. These findings suggest that inhibition of signal transduction via the adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway induces T-cell dysfunction which leads to a diminution in IL-2 gene transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2084443730,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) molecules are preferentially assembled as dodecamers consisting of trimeric subunits associated at their amino termini. The NH2-terminal sequence of each monomer contains two conserved cysteine residues, which participate in interchain disulfide bonds. In order to study the roles of these residues in SP-D assembly and function, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to substitute serine for cysteine 15 and 20 in recombinant rat SP-D (RrSP-D), and have expressed the mutant (RrSP-Dser15/20) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells. The mutant, which was efficiently secreted, bound to maltosyl-agarose, but unlike RrSP-D, was assembled exclusively as trimers. The constituent monomers showed a decreased mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulting from an increase in the size and sialylation of the N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-70. Although RrSP-Dser15/20 contained a pepsin-resistant triple helical domain, it showed a decreased Tm, and acquired susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. Like RrSP-D, RrSP-Dser15/20 bound to the hemagglutinin of influenza A. However, it showed no viral aggregation and did not enhance the binding of influenza A to neutrophils (PMN), augment PMN respiratory burst, or protect PMNs from deactivation. These studies indicate that amino-terminal disulfides are required to stabilize dodecamers, and support our hypothesis that the oligomerization of trimeric subunits contributes to the anti-microbial properties of SP-D.

The short, non-collagenous amino-terminal domain contains two absolutely conserved cysteine residues (Cys-15 and Cys-20) involved in interchain disulfide bonding. The uninterrupted collagenous domain contains 59 Gly-X-Y repeats (in rat and human), and is connected to the carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) by a short linking sequence (L). A single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-70 is found within the collagenous domain, and studies of SP-D from natural and recombinant sources have shown that this site is utilized and contains a sialylated sugar moiety (12Crouch E.

Other collagenous C-type lectins include: pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A), serum mannose-binding protein (MBP), bovine serum conglutinin, and bovine serum lectin 43 (CL-43) (14Lim B.L.

Trans. 1993; 21: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SP-D is predominantly assembled as a dodecamer consisting of four homotrimeric subunits associated at their amino termini (12Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holmskov U. Laursen S.B. Malhotra R. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Stuart G.R. Tornoe I. Madsen P.S. Reid K.B. Jensenius J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of proteolytic fragments and limited reduction and alkylation of SP-D dodecamers suggests that the amino-terminal cysteine residues form intra- and intertrimeric disulfide bonds, which stabilize the fully assembled dodecamer (12Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimeric CRDs (but not monomers) show high affinity binding to various saccharide ligands in vitro (17Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, ultrastructural studies suggest that the rigid collagenous arms restrict the spatial distribution of the lectin domains and allow for bridging interactions between ligands separated by up to 100 nm (8Lu J. Wiedemann H. Holmskov U. Thiel S. Timpl R. Reid K.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that amino-terminal cross-linking of trimeric subunits is critical for SP-D-mediated microbial agglutination. We further hypothesized that trimeric subunits of SP-D (i.e. single arms) will bind to microorganisms but show decreased agglutinating activity. Although SP-D “arms” can be generated by reduction and alkylation, the intrachain bonds required for lectin activity are also disrupted (12Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test these hypotheses by mutating the amino-terminal cysteine residues in rat SP-D and utilizing a CHO K1 expression system. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that wild type recombinant rat SP-D (RrSP-D) produced by this system is chemically, morphologically, and functionally indistinguishable from natural rat SP-D (13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have produced a full-length mutant SP-D molecule, RrSP-Dser15/20, that is secreted as a trimer. These studies indicate that amino-terminal disulfide bonds are required to form or stabilize dodecamers, and provide support for our hypothesis that the oligomerization of trimeric subunits to form dodecamers is required for some of the previously observed interactions of SP-D with influenza A. Our results also show that the cysteine substitutions decrease the thermal stability of the collagen helix and increase the protein's susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a full-length rat SP-D cDNA clone provided by Drs. J. H. Fisher and D. R. Voelker, Denver, CO (10Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Primers for substituting serine for Cys-15 and Cys-20 of the mature protein were: CAATAACCAACACGAGCACCCTAGTCTTGAGTAGTCCAACAG (forward) and CTGTTGGACTACTCAAGACTAGGGTGCTCGTGTTGGTTATTG (reverse). Sp6 and T7 were used as outside primers. PCR reactions were performed using 400 ng of ScaI linearized rSP-DpGEM-3Z template. The reaction buffer contained 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). Separate reactions containing the forward and T7 primers or reverse and Sp6 primers were performed for 15 cycles with a 45°C annealing temperature. The resulting products were gel-purified and combined in a second PCR reaction for 10 cycles at 52°C annealing, followed by 20 cycles at 42°C annealing using Sp6 and T7 as primers. The ~1.3-kilobase pair DNA product was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into pGEM-3Z. Clones were sequenced up to the ApaI site within rSP-D to verify the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of any additional point mutations. An EcoRI/ApaI fragment containing the mutated region was then subcloned into the corresponding site in wild type rSP-DpGEM-3Z. Subcloning of the mutated region was performed in order to avoid introduction of extraneous Taq generated mutations. Mutated rSP-D cDNAs were excised from pGEM-3Z with EcoRI and subcloned into the corresponding site within the multiple cloning site of pEE14 (13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J.

Transfection of pEE14 constructs into CHO K1 cells and selection of stably expressing cell lines was performed as described previously (13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were washed in serum-free DMEM and then incubated for 16 h in DMEM containing 1% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 µCi/ml L-[14C]proline (283 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN). Secreted recombinant protein was isolated from the culture medium by sequential maltosyl-agarose and gel filtration chromatography as described previously (13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution of radiolabeled protein was monitored by liquid scintillation counting and/or SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluence. Metabolic labeling was performed with L-[14C]proline as described above or with Tran35S-label (ICN, 1255 Ci/mmol). For labeling with Tran35S-label, cells were washed and preincubated for 30 min with DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine, DMEM(−Cys/Met), supplemented with 50 µg/ml ascorbate. Cells were then incubated in 1 ml of DMEM(−Cys/Met) plus 10 µCi/ml Tran35S-label for up to 8 h. Conditioned medium was harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g to pellet any cells or debris, and the supernatant was used in subsequent steps. For analysis of intracellular protein, cell layers were washed twice with cold DMEM and lysed with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF) supplemented with 50 mM iodoacetamide to trap any free sulfhydryls. Cell lysates were incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g to pellet cell debris. Immunoprecipitations were performed by mixing 200-800 µl of cell lysate or conditioned medium with 500 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer and 5 µl of rabbit anti-rat SP-D antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Samples were then mixed with 300 µl of a 10% suspension of IgGsorb (The Enzyme Center, Malden, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s, the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 5/10% or 5/12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Immune complexes were washed with distilled water and then resuspended in 50 µl of endoglycosidase F buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.1, 50 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mM PMSF) or 50 µl of neuraminidase buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 2 mM EDTA). Samples were boiled and then incubated overnight at 37°C with 0.025 units of neuraminidase (Genzyme) or 0.050 units of endoglycosidase F (Sigma). Collagenase and pepsin digestions were performed as described (21Persson A. Rust K. Chang D. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E.

L-[3H]Proline-labeled wild type RrSP-D and L-[14C]proline-labeled RrSP-Dcys→ser15/20 were diluted in 100 mM Tris, 400 mM NaCl (pH 7.4), and 45 µl was added to 200 µl microcentrifuge tubes. Two tubes of each sample were kept at room temperature. The remaining tubes were placed in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler at 30°C and programmed to increase 2°C every 10 min between 30° and 44°C. At the end of each 10-min plateau, one tube of each sample was removed, quenched at 20°C for 30 s, and digested with 5 µl of 1 mg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma, 12,000 units/mg) for 2 min at 20°C. Digestion was stopped by addition of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing PMSF, followed by boiling. The susceptibility of wild type SP-D and RrSP-Dser15/20 to proteolytic degradation was further tested using a variety of highly purified proteinases including human leukocyte elastase (Elastin Products, Owensville, MO), human matrilysin (MMP-7), human 72-kDa (MMP-2) and 92-kDa (MMP-9) gelatinases, human interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), rat interstitial collagenase (MMP-13), stromelysin (MMP-3), and human and mouse metalloelastases (MMP-12). Human matrilysin, 92-kDa gelatinase, interstitial collagenase, metalloelastase, and mouse metalloelastase were expressed and purified as we have reported previously (24Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N.

Human 72-kDa gelatinase free of TIMP-2 was kindly provided by William Stetler-Stevenson (National Cancer Institute), rat interstitial collagenase was supplied by John J. Jeffrey (Albany Medical College), and human stromelysin catalytic domain was obtained from Qi-Zhuang Ye (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). To test susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, wild type SP-D and the Cys mutant (1.5 µg each) were incubated with 1 × 10−6M of each enzyme in a total mixture volume of 50 µl (buffer = 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02% Brij) at 37°C overnight. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 mM o-phenanthroline for the metalloproteinases and 1 mM PMSF for leukocyte elastase. The mixtures were then boiled in reducing sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Virus stocks were grown in the chorioallantoic fluid of 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs, purified on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient, stored, and titered as described previously (28Hartshorn K.L. Collamer M. Auerbach M. Myers J.B. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I. J. Immunology. 1988; 141: 1295-1301PubMed Google Scholar). The A/Texas 77/H3N2 (Texas 77) and A/PR/8/34/H1N1 (PR8) strains of IAV were gracious gifts of Dr. Jon Abramson (Bowman-Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC). The A/Mem71H-BelN (H3N1) and its glycosylation mutant derivative strain Mem71H-BelN/BS were kindly provided by Dr. E. Margot Anders (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia) (29Anders E.M. Hartley C.A. Jackson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Incubation of SP-Ds with IAV stocks was carried out at 37°C in TBS with 2 mM Ca2+ except in indicated experiments in which maltose was added, or in which the buffer contained 10 mM EDTA and no added Ca2+ (28Hartshorn K.L. Collamer M. Auerbach M. Myers J.B. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I. J. Immunology. 1988; 141: 1295-1301PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation was assessed by measuring changes in light transmission through suspensions of IAV after addition of various concentrations of SP-D (28Hartshorn K.L. Collamer M. Auerbach M. Myers J.B. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I. J. Immunology. 1988; 141: 1295-1301PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of SP-D alone in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ did not cause any decrease in light transmission. Neutrophils (PMN) from healthy volunteer donors were isolated to >95% purity using dextran sedimentation, followed by a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation for removal of mononuclear cells, and hypotonic lysis to remove contaminating erythrocytes (28Hartshorn K.L. Collamer M. Auerbach M. Myers J.B. Pavlotsky N. Tauber A.I. J. Immunology. 1988; 141: 1295-1301PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 production was measured by the oxidation of scopolectin, and O2 assessed by monitoring the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (30Hartshorn K.L. Collamer M. White M.R.

PMN protection assays measured the superoxide response to FMLP (5 × 10−7M) after exposure to IAV preincubated in the absence or presence of SP-D (4Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. White M.R. Eggleton P.

Sequence analysis of the constructs showed that we had generated the expected Cys-15/Cys-20 double substitution mutant, designated RrSP-Dser15/20. RrSP-Dser15/20 was efficiently secreted into the culture medium, and bound quantitatively to maltosyl-agarose (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The recovery was comparable to that obtained for wild type SP-D under comparable conditions of culture (~5 µg/ml) (13Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE indicated the absence of disulfide-bonded dimers, trimers, or other multimers, consistent with the absence of amino-terminal cysteine residues (Fig. 1). However, migration of RrSP-Dser15/20 on SDS-PAGE was slightly slower following reduction, indicating the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds in the globular CRD domain. Comparison of the migration of reduced wild type RrSP-D and RrSP-Dser15/20 on SDS-PAGE showed that the double cysteine mutant SP-D had a higher apparent molecular mass (~55 kDa versus 43 kDa) attributable to differences in post-translational modification (see below). The lower mobility of the secreted wild type and mutant proteins relative to the major intracellular species is attributed to maturation and terminal sialylation of the N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-70. The secreted and intracellular components migrated with approximately the same apparent molecular mass following incubation with endoglycosidase F (see below). As observed for wild type SP-D, incubation of RrSP-Dser15/20 with purified bacterial collagenase liberated an ~18-kDa fragment (reduced) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain (data not shown).Fig. 2Affinity purification and size analysis of RrSP-Dser15/20 A. 14C-Labeled RrSP-Dser15/20 was generated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following dialysis, RrSP-Dser15/20 conditioned medium was applied to the maltosyl-agarose affinity column. A 100-µl aliquot of each fraction and a sample of the starting material and break-through of the column were immunoprecipitated. Lanes 1-5, column wash fractions 1-5. Lanes 6-10, fractions 22-26 corresponding to the EDTA eluate. Lane 11, non-bound material from column load. Lane 12, RrSP-Dser15/20 conditioned medium (column load). The high radiochemical purity of the starting material and the apparent absence of other protein components in the non-bound fraction reflects enrichment of proline in the collagen domain of SP-D. B, affinity-purified [14C]RrSP-Dser15/20 was fractionated on 4% agarose in TBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.2% Triton X-100. Eluted proteins were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The elution volumes of SP-D dodecamers and trimers were determined using recombinant human SP-D as a standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oligomerization of affinity-purified RrSP-Dser15/20 was assessed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2B). RrSP-Dser15/20 eluted at approximately the same position as natural hSP-D trimers (single arms) or components liberated by reduction and alkylation of rSP-D under non-denaturing conditions (12Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a collagenous triple helix of approximately normal length was verified by overnight incubation with 100 µg/ml porcine pepsin A (Worthington, 3352 units/mg) at 27°C. Pepsin liberated two fragments, a minor component (~29 kDa, globular standards, reduced) that co-migrated with the major pepsin-resistant fragment of RrSP-D, and a major fragment of ~25 kDa. To identify the sites of peptic cleavage, fragments of RrSP-Dser15/20 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membranes, and submitted for gas-phase amino-terminal microsequencing as described previously (22Persson A. Chang D. Rust K. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The 29-kDa fragment gave sequence beginning within the amino-terminal peptide domain (Val18-Gly-Ser-Pro-Thr-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu) and including the substituted serine at position 20 (10Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the major fragment gave sequence beginning within the 10th Gly-X-Y triplet of the collagen domain (Ser55-Gly-Leu-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly) (9Crouch E. Rust K. Veile R. Donis-Keller H. Grosso L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2976-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the size differential of RrSP-Dser15/20 versus reduced wild type RrSP-D was due to overhydroxylation of proline or lysine residues in the collagen domain and/or overglycosylation of hydroxylysine, transfected cells were metabolically labeled in the presence or absence of 2,2′-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase. Comparison of mutant and wild type proteins synthesized under these conditions suggested that there was little if any overmodification of the helical domain of RrSP-Dser15/20 (data not shown). To determine if the increased mass of double cysteine mutant reflected differences in the size or structure of the N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-70, we compared the mobility of proteins synthesized in the absence or presence of up to 6 µg/ml tunicamycin (TM), and after glycosidase digestion. Consistent with the possibility, wild type and mutant proteins synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin showed approximately the same molecular mass (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of the wild type and mutant proteins with Endoglycosidase F generated cleavage products with the same mobility by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Neuraminidase digestion of RrSP-Dser15/20 resulted in a greater size shift than digestion of RrSP-D. However, differences in sialylation did not completely account for the size differential (Fig. 3). Although intra-trimer disulfide bonds were not required for trimerization and formation of a pepsin-resistant triple helix, we hypothesized that they might contribute to stabilization of the collagenous triple helix at physiologic temperatures. To address this possibility, we examined the temperature-dependent acquisition of sensitivity to degradation by trypsin, a technique commonly used to characterize the effects of mutations on collagen helix stability in inherited connective tissue disorders (23Wenstrup R.J. Shrago-Howe A.W. Lever L.W. Phillips C.L. Byers P.H. Cohn D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the wild type protein was relatively insensitive to trypsin digestion following incubation at temperatures through 38°C, but showed increasing degradation after incubation between 40 and 44°C (Fig. 4). Even after heating to 44°C, some intact RrSP-D remained. RrSP-Dser15/20 was similarly resistant to trypsin degradation following incubation at temperatures up to 34°C. However, in contrast to wild type, RrSP-Dser15/20 exhibited an abrupt increase in susceptibility to degradation after heating to 36°C and was completely degraded by trypsin after heating to 40°C (Fig. 4). Based on densitometric measurements of bands corresponding to undigested protein, RrSP-D has a Tm of approximately 40°C, while the mutant RrSP-Dser15/20 has a Tm of 37°C (Fig. 4). Unpublished experiments demonstrated that natural SP-Ds are highly resistant to degr"

https://openalex.org/W2029081158,"The transcription factor CREB (AMP esponsive lement inding protein) is activated by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of a single serine residue. To investigate possible mechanisms of CREB regulation by phosphorylation, we initiated a structural and biophysical characterization of the full-length, wild-type CREB protein, an altered CREB protein (CREB/SER) in which the three cysteine residues in the DNA-binding domain were replaced with serine residues and a truncated protein (ACT265) which encompasses the entire activation domain of CREB. Circular dichroism (CD) reveals that CREB and CREB/SER have identical secondary structures and contain approximately 20%α-helix, 9%β-strand, 34%β-turn, and 37% random coil structures. PKA phosphorylation does not alter the CD spectra, and therefore the secondary structure, of CREB or of CREB bound to DNA. Protease cleavage patterns indicate that PKA phosphorylation does not induce a global conformational change in CREB. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylation does not change the DNA binding affinity of CREB for either canonical or non-canonical CRE sequences as measured by a fluorescence anisotropy DNA binding assay. Since PKA phosphorylation of CREB results in its specific binding to the transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein and p300, we suggest that the PKA activation of CREB occurs by the production of specific, complementary interactions with these proteins, rather than through the previously proposed mechanisms of a phosphorylation-dependent conformational change or increased DNA binding affinity.

Eukaryotic gene transcription employs a number of phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms that regulate the assembly and activity of the transcription machinery. Phosphorylation regulates the nuclear localization, DNA binding affinity, and/or the activation potential of many transcription factors (for review, see Refs. 1Hunter T. Karin M.

Phosphorylation can alter protein function either by introducing an allosteric conformational change in the protein or, more commonly, by allowing (or blocking) specific electrostatic interactions with other molecules. Both of these mechanisms are thought to occur in the regulation of transcription; however, the structural consequences of phosphorylation are poorly understood. We are investigating both the overall structure and the regulation by phosphorylation of the CREB/CREM/ATF 1The abbreviations used are: CREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinCREMcAMP-responsive element modulatorATFactivating transcription factorPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase AbZIPbasic leucine zipperCREcAMP-responsive elementSSCREsomatostatin CRETATCREtyrosine aminotransferase CREKIDkinase-inducible domainQglutamine-richCBPCREB-binding proteinDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidEndoendoproteinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTRE12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element. family of transcription factors. These proteins are important for a variety of biological functions, such as neuroendocrine peptide production (4Goodman R.H. Annu. Rev.

CREB/CREM/ATF family members share several similarities, including a highly homologous basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain, an ability to homo- and heterodimerize in specific combinations, a similar gene structure, and the presence of conserved activator regions and phosphorylation sites (for review, see Refs. 8Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar and 9Lee K.A.W. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).

CREB consists of an NH2-terminal activation domain and a smaller, COOH-terminal bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization domain. Like most transcription factors, the activation domain of CREB can be further divided into several subdomains of various activation and regulatory functions. CREB has been extensively mapped by both deletion and “gain of function” analysis (Fig. 1A) (10Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell.

Although the exact roles and boundaries of the different regions vary among cell lines, reporter systems, and laboratories, several general conclusions can be drawn. The activation domain of CREB contains two glutamine-rich regions (Q1 and Q2), which are important to basal activity. The kinase-inducible domain (KID) includes several phosphorylation sites and confers the phosphorylation-induced activity to CREB. CREB activity is directly regulated by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A) phosphorylation of a single serine residue, Ser133 (10Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CREB is also an effector of calcium signaling pathways, and the same serine residue is a substrate for calcium-calmodulin kinase II and IV (15Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 16Nguyen T.V. Kobierski L. Comb M. Hyman S. J.

Models of CREB activation by PKA frequently include structural changes following phosphorylation. The original model proposed that an allosteric conformational change in CREB enables a site distal to Ser133, the Q2 region, to interact directly with the preinitiation complex (11Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 12Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M.

A related model suggested that PKA phosphorylation induces α-helix or β-sheet secondary structures in the regions neighboring the Ser133 site, thus allowing specific protein-protein interactions (8Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Rivier J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A separate model proposed that phosphorylation leads to an increase in DNA binding, at least for the non-canonical class of CRE (cAMP-responsive element) (21Merino A. Buckbinder L. Mermelstein F.H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21266-21276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Weih F. Stewart F. Boshart M. Nitxch D. Schütz G.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, recent data for CREB activation suggests a different role for PKA phosphorylation, i.e. that phosphorylation simply creates a high-affinity binding site for other proteins. In particular, phosphorylation of Ser133 allows the high-affinity binding of CREB to the co-activators CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 (24Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M.

Despite this abundance of models, no structural or biophysical data have been presented that investigate the effect of phosphorylation on CREB structure. We have initiated a biophysical characterization of CREB to study transcription activation by the CREB/CREM/ATF family of transcription factors. Our goals are, first, to characterize the structure of CREB and, second, to understand the structural mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent activation. Toward this end we have developed purification protocols and designed an altered CREB protein, CREB/SER, with improved solubility. We performed circular dichroism studies to characterize the secondary structure of both the full-length CREB protein and ACT265, a 265-amino acid polypeptide of the activation domain in which the bZIP domain and a small amino-terminal extension were deleted. Finally, we tested various structural models of phosphorylation-dependent CREB activation by comparing the CD spectra, protease cleavage patterns, and DNA binding affinity of CREB and PKA-phosphorylated CREB. Rat CREB341 (29Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fisher W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a Novagen pET15b expression system using the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. The NcoI site in CREB341 encompasses the second ATG of the initial Met-Thr-Met sequence, hence all of our constructs are initiated at residue 3. The ACT265 expression plasmid was derived from the CREB341 vector by introducing a stop codon in place of Val266 using site-directed mutagenesis (Promega). The CREB/SER mutant was derived by replacing the cysteine residues 300, 310, and 337 with serine residues using site-directed mutagenesis (Promega). The mutagenesis was performed on a CREB327 cDNA that was isolated from a λgt11 human hypothalamic library and subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of p-SELECT (Promega; 30). Human CREB327 and rat CREB341 have identical bZIP amino acid sequences, although they differ slightly in the nucleotide sequence. The substituted bZIP domain of CREB327 was subcloned into the rat CREB341 pET15b expression plasmid using Asp718 and BamHI sites. The resulting CREB/SER clone is a rat CREB341/human CREB327 cDNA hybrid, which contains an amino acid sequence identical to rat CREB341 with the three cysteines in the bZIP domain substituted with serines. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Bacteria were grown in Luria broth plus 4 g/liter glucose at 37°C to an optical density (595 nm) of 0.60 and induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3.5 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for wild type CREB341 or in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for ACT265 and CREB/SER. The bacteria were lysed by passage through a French press at 14,000 p.s.i. The bacterial extracts of full-length, wild-type CREB341 were heated to 75°C for 10 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g to remove the particulate fraction. The CREB supernatant was applied to a DE53 anion exchange column (Whatman) equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 30 mM KCl. Proteins were eluted using a step gradient of 30, 70, 120, and 200 mM KCl, with CREB eluting at 120 mM KCl. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and each step ranged from 100-400 ml. The eluate was concentrated using an Amicon YM30 membrane. Each liter of bacterial culture yielded about 2 mg of purified CREB, which was greater than 95% of the total protein as estimated by Coomassie-based Fast Stain (Zoion) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). ACT265 was purified from the bacterial extract without a heat treatment step. The protein was precipitated from the bacterial extract with 10% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The extract was further purified by DE53 column chromatography using a 0-500 mM KCl gradient, followed by HPLC sizing column chromatography (Waters Protein-Pak 125). One liter of bacterial culture yielded 5 mg of greater than 95% pure ACT265 protein (Fig. 1C). CREB/SER was purified both with and without a heat treatment step. The protein (either with or without a 10 min, 75°C heat treatment) was precipitated from the bacterial extract with 15% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography using either DE53 resin (Whatman) or a Mono Q FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein was eluted using a 0-300 mM NaCl gradient. The non-heat-treated protein was further purified over an HPLC sizing column (Waters Protein-Pak 125). One liter of bacterial culture yielded about 5 mg of greater than 95% pure CREB/SER protein (Fig. 1D). CREB341 and ACT265 were phosphorylated using the purified catalytic subunit (C-subunit) or purified recombinant C-subunit of PKA (kindly supplied by John D. Scott and Richard A. Maurer, Oregon Health Sciences University). The phosphorylation reaction was carried out in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 6.8, containing 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP with a molar C-subunit to CREB ratio of 1:100 and was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. To measure the incorporation of phosphate, trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP were added to the reaction. Percent incorporation was determined by pipetting 5 µl of the reaction onto Whatman glass microfiber filters and washing extensively with 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 5% trichloroacetic acid and finally 70% ethanol. The incorporation of γ-32P was quantitated in a scintillation counter following the addition of fluor (Beta-max). Under these conditions, phosphorylation of CREB by PKA had been previously demonstrated to occur only on Ser133 (31Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 32Sun P. Schoderbek W.E. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1858-1866PubMed Google Scholar), and assuming one PKA phosphorylation per CREB monomer, phosphate incorporation was consistently stoichiometric. For spectroscopic studies, the ATP was removed by extensive dialysis against the CD buffer. The purified proteins were concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The protein concentration ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/ml as determined by amino acid analysis. The CD spectra were taken on a Jasco J-500A spectrapolarimeter using a 0.01-cm path length cell (Helma) thermostatted at 20°C. The instrument was calibrated by using (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (Δε = +2.37 M−1 cm−1 at 290.5 nm and −4.95 at 192.5 nm). Data were collected on an IBM/PC-AT using the IF-500 interface and software provided by Jasco. Spectra and buffer base lines were the average of 8-10 scans recorded at 0.1-nm intervals. A scanning rate of 10 nm/min and a 2-s time constant were used. Before spectral deconvolution for secondary structure analysis, the buffer base line was subtracted, and the spectra were smoothed using software provided by Jasco. The CD spectra were deconvoluted for secondary structure content using the variable selection methods described elsewhere (33Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 34Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). For this analysis combinations from a set of 33 basis spectra (kindly provided by W. Curtis Johnson, Jr., Oregon State University) were used to find those that result in the best fit using criteria described by Compton et al. (35Compton L.A. Mathews C.K. Johnson Jr., W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13039-13043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All secondary structure values resulting from each combination that met these criteria were averaged to give the final secondary structure values for each experimental spectra. The standard error for each structure value was typically less than 3%. The protein spectra in the presence of DNA are difference spectra. The CD spectra of the DNA oligonucleotide alone was subtracted from the spectra of CREB bound to DNA. The specific oligonucleotide used was a 14-base pair, double-stranded palindrome of the somatostatin CRE (5′-GGCTGACGTCAGCC-3′), where the consensus CRE site is in bold. The nonspecific DNA-binding site was a palindromic 16-base pair consensus oligonucleotide derivative of the E. coli purF operator (5′-ACGCAAACGTTTGCGT-3′). Protein and DNA were mixed at concentrations of 30 µM each to ensure that all CREB could be DNA bound. Approximately 10 µg of CREB and P-CREB in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM KCl were digested with 100 ng of trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Endo Glu-C protease (Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease). The samples were incubated from 0 to 10 min for trypsin and chymotrypsin and from 0 to 40 min for Endo Glu-C protease (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The reactions were stopped at various points by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were immediately separated by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with the Coomassie-based Fast Stain (Zoion). Fluorescence polarization measurements were collected on a PanVerra Beacon Fluorescence Polarization System. Samples were excited at 490 nm, and emission was measured at 530 nm. 5′-Fluoresceinated oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies and purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column. The sequences are presented in Fig. 6A. Only the upper strands were labeled with fluorescein. Oligonucleotides were annealed by combining equimolar amounts of each strand, heating to 95°C and cooling slowly. Annealing was confirmed by native PAGE, and double-stranded oligonucleotides amounted to 95% or greater of the total oligonucleotide present (data not shown). The binding reactions contained 1 ml of 0.5 nM fluoresceinated oligonucleotide in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 10 µg/ml poly(dI-dC). Bovine serum albumin at 1 µM was included in the experiments to reduce nonspecific association. CREB (10-20 µM as determined by amino acid analysis) was serially diluted and titrated into the cuvette such that the total sample volume increased no more than 10%. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature. Samples were incubated in the fluorimeter for 2 min prior to each measurement to allow thermal and binding equilibrium. Under these conditions, the maximum change in anisotropy occurs within 15-30 s. Each point represents the average of four anisotropy measurements with a 10-s integration time for each reading. The standard deviation for each point was consistently less than 2% of the measured anisotropy value. The curves were fit with a nonlinear least squares regression analysis assuming a bimolecular model such that the apparent Kd values represent the protein concentration of half-maximal DNA binding. A nonspecific component was included in the model to account for the linear increase in anisotropy at higher protein concentrations. The structural principles of the bZIP dimerization and DNA-binding motif are well characterized; however, little is known about the structure of the full-length CREB protein and, in particular, of the activation domain. The first step in obtaining such information is to develop an overexpression and purification system that provides sufficient quantities of properly folded and active protein. We first developed a bacterial expression and purification scheme for wild-type CREB341. Our purification involves a 10-min, 75°C heat step followed by anion exchange chromatography. Each liter of bacterial culture yields about 2 mg of greater than 95% pure CREB (Fig. 1B). However, oxidation, aggregation, and poor solubility hampered purification efforts and structural characterization. These problems appear to arise primarily from the bZIP domain, which aggregates as a result of random disulfide bond formation (three of CREB's four cysteines reside in the bZIP domain), and nonspecific interactions between the basic regions in the absence of DNA (36Santiago-Rivera Z.I. Williams J.S. Gorenstein D.G. Andrisani O.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To circumvent solubility problems and to simplify our structural analysis of CREB, we engineered two proteins. The first, ACT265 (residues 3-265), consists of the entire activation domain minus the bZIP DNA-binding domain. Purification did not require heat treatment and included an ammonium sulfate precipitation step and anion exchange chromatography. One liter of bacterial culture yields about 5 mg of greater than 95% pure ACT265 (Fig. 1C). The second engineered protein consists of full-length CREB in which the three cysteines (Cys300, Cys310, and Cys337) in the DNA-binding domain were substituted with serine residues (Fig. 1A and Fig. 7). There is a fourth cysteine in the activation domain that was not changed (Cys90). This protein, referred to as CREB/SER, has significantly improved solubility as observed by analytical ultracentrifugation. 2J. P. Richards, unpublished results. Purification was similar to that for wild-type CREB and ACT265 and was performed both with and without the heat treatment step. One liter of bacterial culture yields about 5 mg of greater than 95% pure CREB/SER (Fig. 1D). Boiling cellular extracts is a previously reported method for purifying CREB for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (37Hoeffler J.P. Lustbader J.W. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38de Groot R.P. Delmas V. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). Heating appeared an effective purification step for CREB, and several lines of evidence suggested that CREB is stable to this treatment: (i) CREB remains soluble after boiling (37Hoeffler J.P. Lustbader J.W. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38de Groot R.P. Delmas V. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) heat-purified CREB is highly active in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (30Loriaux M.M. Rehfuss R.P. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Hoeffler J.P. Lustbader J.W. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38de Groot R.P. Delmas V. Sassone-Corsi P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) heat-purified, phosphorylated CREB binds specifically to CBP (24Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montiminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar); and (iv) peptides of the CREB leucine zipper or of its bZIP domain refold after thermal denaturation (36Santiago-Rivera Z.I. Williams J.S. Gorenstein D.G. Andrisani O.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, heat-purified CREB retains two critical functions, DNA binding and CBP binding, which are located in two separate structural domains. Since boiling is an unorthodox method for purifying proteins and can cause irreversible modification, such as deamidation, we empirically determined the lowest effective temperature for purification of both the full-length protein and the truncated activation domain to be 75°C. ACT265 and CREB/SER were also purified without a heat treatment step, and we used circular dichroism to monitor the effects of our heat purification. The CD spectra of non-heat-purified ACT265 and CREB/SER were determined from 260-180 nm at 20°C. Aliquots of these protein preparations were heated to 75°C for 10 min, allowed to cool, and the CD scan was repeated. The spectra of the heated and non-heated ACT265 and CREB/SER proteins are compared in Fig. 2, A and B. The heat treatment did not alter the CD spectra for either protein, indicating that the native secondary structure is stable to heat purification. We were unable to purify sufficient quantities of spectroscopic quality wild-type CREB without a heat step. However, the CD spectra of heat-purified, wild-type CREB overlay with the spectra of heat-treated and non-heat-purified CREB/SER (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it appears that the structure is most likely native, and neither the heat treatment nor the cysteine to serine substitutions alter the secondary structure of CREB. In addition, CREB/SER retains DNA and CBP binding properties and protease cleavage patterns that are indistinguishable from wild-type CREB (data not shown). Therefore, CREB/SER, with its increased solubility and yield, provides an excellent model for studying the structure of full-length, wild-type CREB. cAMP-dependent CREB activation requires phosphorylation of Ser133 by PKA, and one proposed mechanism of this activation is via induced secondary structural changes in CREB (8Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Rivier J. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To test whether PKA phosphorylation grossly altered the secondary structure of CREB, we compared the CD spectra of both CREB and phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) as well as of ACT265 and phosphorylated ACT265 (P-ACT265). The purified proteins were phosphorylated stoichiometrically with the catalytic subunit of PKA. The CD spectra of CREB and ACT265 do not change following PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 3). We extended our CD analysis to examine the spectra of CREB in the presence of DNA. Previous CD studies had shown that DNA binding induced a coil to helix transition in the bZIP peptides of GCN4, CREB, Fos/Jun"
https://openalex.org/W1994729983,"Immunocytochemistry was carried out on sections of rat pancreas to localize the expression of glutamate receptor subunits and the major pancreatic peptide hormones. Glutamate receptor expression was concentrated in pancreatic islets, and each islet cell type expressed different neuronal glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate classes. AMPA receptor subunits were expressed in alpha, beta, and pancreatic polypeptide cells, whereas kainate receptors were found predominantly in alpha and delta cells. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the functional properties of islet cell glutamate receptors. L-glutamate and other glutamate receptor agonists evoked currents in islet cells that were blocked by the selective AMPA receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and potentiated by cyclothiazide in a manner indistinguishable from that of neuronal AMPA receptors. Activation of islet cell AMPA receptors produced steady-state cation currents that depolarized the cells an average of 20.7 +/- 5.4 mV (n = 6). Currents mediated by functional kainate receptors were also observed in a line of transformed pancreatic alpha cells. Thus, L-glutamate probably regulates islet physiology via actions at both AMPA and kainate receptor classes. The pattern of receptor expression suggests that glutamate receptor activation may have multiple, complex consequences for islet physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2048653605,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) binds to the somatomedin B (SMB) domain of vitronectin (VN), a domain present in at least seven other proteins. In this study, we investigate the PAI-1 binding activity of these SMB homologs and attempt to more specifically localize the PAI-1 binding site within this domain. SMBVN and several of its homologs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and tested for PAI-1 binding activity in a competitive ligand binding assay. Although recombinant SMBVN was fully active in this assay, none of the homologs bound to PAI-1 or competed with VN for PAI-1 binding. These inactive homologs are structurally related to SMBVN, having 33-45% sequence identity and containing all 8 cysteines at conserved positions. Thus, homolog-scanning experiments were conducted by exchanging progressively larger portions of the NH2- or COOH-terminal regions of active SMBVN with the corresponding regions of the inactive homologs. These experiments revealed that the minimum PAI-1-binding sequence was present in the central region (residues 12-30) of SMBVN. Alanine scanning mutagenesis further demonstrated that each of the 8 cysteines as well as Gly12, Asp22, Leu24, Try27, Tyr28, and Asp34 were critical for PAI-1 binding and were required to stabilize PAI-1 activity. These results indicate that the PAI-1 binding motif is localized to residues 12-30 of SMBVN and suggest that this motif is anchored in the active conformation by disulfide bonds.

Plasmin is the primary enzyme of the fibrinolytic system and may also function in ovulation, embryonic development, inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis, and neoplasia. The activities of t-PA and urokinase-type plasminogen activator in vivo are regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (3Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Coller B.S.

Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Coller B.S. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. W. B. Saunders Co mpany, Philadelphia1989: 87Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the active to latent transition is caused by the insertion of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A (9Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). For example, variants of PAI-1 constructed to reduce the rate of exchange between the reactive center loop and β-strands 3C/4C have a significantly lower rate of transition into the latent form (i.e., they are more stable; Ref. 10Tucker H.M. James M. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Berkenpas et al. (11Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used random mutagenesis to demonstrate that a combination of mutations greatly prolongs the half-life of active PAI-1. Besides possibly reducing strand 4A insertion, these mutations result in markedly increased thermal stability of the resulting active recombinant inhibitor relative to that of active native PAI-1. Interestingly, the binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin (VN) significantly stabilizes this labile inhibitor in its active conformation (12Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P.

Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 269Google Scholar). It appears to regulate a variety of processes including cell adhesion, complement activation, and fibrinolysis. This 75-kDa adhesive glycoprotein is composed of an NH2-terminal somatomedin B domain (SMB), a region containing a number of hemopexin-like repeats, and the heparin binding domain. Residues 1-40 of the SMB domain have been shown to contain the primary high affinity binding site in VN for active PAI-1 (14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

SMB homologs also were identified in placental-specific protein 11 (PP11) (27Grundmann U. Romisch J. Siebold B. Bohn H. Amann E.

A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). There is no information in the literature to indicate whether these SMB homologs also bind to PAI-1 with high affinity. Moreover, the structural requirements for the interaction between the SMB domain of VN (SMBVN) and PAI-1 are not known, and the actual PAI-1 binding motif within SMBVN has not been defined. In the present study, we express and purify the SMB domains of VN and several of its homologs and examine their PAI-1 binding activities. We show that the recombinant SMB domain of MSF does not bind to PAI-1. Based on this observation, we developed a domain swapping (i.e., homolog-scanning) approach and used it to localize the PAI-1 binding site to the central region of SMBVN. The essential residues for PAI-1 binding in SMBVN were further identified by site-directed mutagenesis, and a consensus PAI-1 binding motif was derived. These findings provide insights into the unique structure of SMB and suggest that this domain may mediate the binding of other proteins to cell surfaces and extracellular matrices. Bovine serum albumin, casein, Triton X-100, Tween 80, Tris base, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, and ampicillin were obtained from Sigma.

Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protein expression, DNA was cloned into the pET22b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the NcoI and XhoI sites to eliminate vector encoded residues. In this way, the expressed protein contained only the signal peptide and 6 histidines. The SMBVN domain was amplified from VN cDNA (30Jenne D. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by using the 5′ oligonucleotide primer, 5′-GGCGATGGCCATGGACCAAGAGTCATGCAAGGGC-3′, and the 3′ oligonucleotide primer, 5′-GGCGCGCACTCGAGCATGGGCTTGCACTCAGCCGTATAG-3′. PCR amplified products were digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into pET22b previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The DNA for the SMB domain of MSF exon 3 (SMBMSF) was synthesized using the DNA sequence inferred from the published amino acid sequence (22Merberg D.M. Fitz L.J. Temple P. Giannotti J. Murtha P. Fitzgerald M. Scaltreto J. Kelleher K. Preissner K. Kriz R. Jacobs K. Turner K. Rosenblatt S. Preissner K.R. Wegerhoff J. Mosher D.F. Biology of Vitronetins and Their Receptors.

The coding strand was 5′-GCCATGGAACTCAGTTGTAAAGGGCGGTGTTTTGTGAAAGTTTTGAACGGGGGCGGGAATGTGATTGCGACGCGC-3′, and the complementary strand was 5′-CACTCGAGCATCTCTCGACAGAAACTTTACTAATCCGGACAACAACATTTATCATATTTTTTACATTGCGCGTCGCAATC-3′. These two oligonucleotides have overlapping 3′ ends and were extended by PCR to yield the full-length gene for SMBMSF. The PCR product was then cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For protein expression, the cloned SMBMSF gene was released from the pCRII vector by NcoI and XhoI digestion and cloned into the pET22b expression vector. The DNA for the SMB homolog of PC-1 (SMBPC-1) and other homologs were also cloned into pET22b using the published sequence and expressed as above. Mutagenesis was performed either by PCR with mutations incorporated into PCR primers or by transformer site-directed mutagenesis (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the various expression plasmids and grown at 37°C in 2 × YT medium (15 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) to a density of approximately 2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were transferred to 30°C, induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM) for 8 h, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in one-fourth volume of 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20% (w/v) sucrose and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in one-tenth of the original volume of ice-cold 5 mM MgSO4, and stirred for 10 min in an ice bath. The supernatant after centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C) was the cold osmotic shock fluid from which the target peptide was purified with the His·Bind Resin and Buffer kit (Novagen). The eluted peptide was further dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated (approximately 10-fold) with Centriprep-3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentration of the purified protein was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The PAI-1 binding activities of VN and recombinant SMB peptides were measured using a competitive binding assay as described (14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing amounts of VN or related peptides were added to VN-coated wells in the presence of active PAI-1 (0.6 nM active PAI-1). After incubation overnight at 4°C, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound PAI-1 was detected using rabbit anti-PAI-1 IgG followed by biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and avidin-phosphatase (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA). The reaction was developed using the PNPP substrate (Zymed), and the change in color was determined at 405 nm. The OD reading from duplicate wells was corrected by subtracting values for the binding of the antibodies to VN-coated wells incubated in the absence of PAI-1. Active PAI-1 (50 ng/ml) was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin/Tween for increasing lengths of time at 37°C in the presence of an excess of SMB or mutant peptides (100 µg/ml). At the end of the incubation periods, the samples were analyzed for remaining PAI-1 activity by using the t-PA binding assay (31Schleef R.R. Sinha M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1985; 106: 408-415PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were added to t-PA-coated wells (1 µg/ml), and after incubation for 1 h at 37°C, the amount of PAI-1 bound to the well was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only active PAI-1 binds to t-PA. Thus, the extent of binding represents the percentage of PAI-1 activity remaining in the sample at the end of each incubation period. Double-stranded plasmid DNA sequencing was performed by using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). The upper stacking gel contained 4% acrylamide, whereas the lower resolving gel contained 15% acrylamide. Chemical reduction of samples was accomplished by adding dithiothreitol to the sample to a final concentration of 50 mM and boiling it for 3 min. The Rainbow-colored protein (low range) from Amersham Corp. was used as a molecular standard for SDS-PAGE. Reverse phase HPLC was performed using a C-18 column on a Waters 501 Unit. The active fraction was directly used for mass spectrometry analysis. In these experiments, the peptides were recovered in approximately 24% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometry was performed by the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The SMBVN domain (residues 1-41) and the domain from one of its homologs (the SMBMSF domain; residues 42-83; see Table I) were cloned into the pET22b vector by fusing their NH2 termini to the pelB signal peptide and their COOH termini to a stretch of 6 histidines. The expressed products contained the pelB signal peptide and were thus directed to the periplasm of E. coli, facilitating proper folding of these cysteine-rich peptides. The recombinant peptides were purified from the periplasm of E. coli on a nickel-charged column. The majority of purified SMBVN peptide migrated as a single band when analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 8 kDa (data not shown). However, varying amounts of SMBVN dimers and trimers were also apparent. The molecular mass of SMBVN was also determined by mass spectrometry after further purification by HPLC, and the measured molecular mass was identical to the calculated molecular mass of 6 kDa (i.e., 5180 Da for SMB plus 822 Da for the 6 histidines). These results indicate that the signal peptide was cleaved correctly. The purified peptide was recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against human VN purified from plasma. 1The abbreviations used are: t-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatorPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1VNvitronectinSMBsomatomedin B domainMSFmegakaryocyte-stimulating factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. These results suggest that the recombinant peptide was properly folded. Under identical conditions, SDS-PAGE revealed that the majority of the SMBMSF peptide migrated in bands of approximate molecular masses 13 and 20 kDa (data not shown), corresponding to the molecular mass of dimerized and trimerized SMBMSF. Comparison of the sequences of SMBVN and SMBMSF (Table I) predicted that they would have similar structures because the 8 cysteines in each peptide are identically positioned, they share greater than 40% homology, and most of the charged residues are conserved (Table I).Table IComparison of the SMB sequence in various VNs and homologs tissue-type plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 vitronectin somatomedin B domain megakaryocyte-stimulating factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography. The PAI-1 binding activities of the recombinant peptides were tested in the competitive ligand binding assay (14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, a constant amount of PAI-1 was added to VN-coated microtiter wells in the presence of increasing amounts of the recombinant SMB domains. After incubation, the amount of PAI-1 bound to the immobilized VN was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fig. 1 shows that the purified recombinant SMBVN peptide competed with VN for PAI-1 binding, with half-maximal inhibition at approximately 0.04 µg/ml or 6.6 nM. This concentration compares favorably with the concentration of plasma-derived VN or SMB required to inhibit PAI-1 binding to VN (i.e., 2-3 nM for 50% inhibition) (14Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sigurdardottir O. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to these results with SMBVN, the related peptide (i.e., SMBMSF) had no detectable PAI-1 binding activity in the competitive ligand binding assay under the conditions employed. Because dimeric and trimeric SMBVN continue to bind PAI-1,2 these differences in activity do not appear to result from the different forms of the domain present in the two preparations. Thus, although structurally related to SMBVN, the SMBMSF homolog lacks the specific residues necessary to bind to PAI-1 with high affinity. To more precisely identify the PAI-1 binding site in SMBVN, a domain swapping strategy was adopted (Fig. 2). In these experiments, portions of the inactive SMBMSF domain were exchanged for the corresponding regions of active SMBVN. The sequence homology and conserved cysteines in these two peptides (Table I) suggest that domain swapping in this way will not lead to gross structural alterations in the resulting peptides. A two-step PCR method (34Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 35Horton R.D. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. GeneAmst. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar) was used to create the fusion genes in these domain swapping experiments, and each of the resulting constructs was sequenced prior to use to verify that it contained the correct sequence. Again, all peptides were purified from the periplasmic fluid using a nickel column, and then each was tested for PAI-1 binding activity in the competitive ligand binding assay (Fig. 3). When residues 1-20 of SMBVN were replaced with the corresponding residues of SMBMSF, the resulting fusion peptide (i.e., SMBMSF1-20VN) no longer bound to PAI-1 (Fig. 3A). Negative results also were obtained when residues 21-41 of SMBVN were exchanged with the corresponding SMBMSF sequences to create SMBVN1-20MSF (Fig. 3B). The lack of activity in both constructs indicates that neither the NH2-terminal nor the COOH-terminal half of the SMBVN molecule is sufficient for PAI-1 binding activity. This domain swapping approach was therefore expanded by systematically exchanging progressively larger fragments of the amino-terminal (Fig. 3A) or carboxyl-terminal (Fig. 3B) regions of SMBVN for SMBMSF and monitoring changes in activity. For example, replacing residues 1-9 of SMBVN with equivalent residues of SMBMSF (i.e., SMBMSF1-9VN) did not destroy PAI-1 binding activity (Fig. 3A). Although this activity remained when residues 1-11 were exchanged, the hybrid peptide containing residues 1-12 of SMBMSF (SMBMSF1-12VN) showed no PAI-1 binding activity (Fig. 3A). Because the only difference between SMBMSF1-11VN and SMBMSF1-12VN is the substitution of Gly12 with a serine, this glycine must be critical for PAI-1 binding. Hybrid molecules containing residues 1-14, 1-16, and 1-18 of SMBMSF also were inactive. Thus, these initial studies establish that residues 1-11 at the NH2 terminus of SMBVN are not required for PAI-1 binding when replaced with the corresponding sequence from another SMB homolog. Residue 12 (Gly) appears to be essential for the PAI-1 binding activity of SMBVN.Fig. 3PAI-1 binding activity of hybrid peptides containing regions from both SMBVN and SMBMSF. A, domain swapping of the NH2-terminal region of SMBVN with the NH2-terminal region of SMBMSF. The competitive ligand binding assay was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 using the competitors SMBVN (○), SMBMSF1-20VN (▪), SMBMSF1-9VN (•), SMBMSF1-11VN (▵), and SMBMSF1-12VN (□). B, domain swapping at the COOH-terminal region of SMBVN.

In these experiments, hybrid peptides were constructed by exchanging residues in the COOH terminus of SMBVN with corresponding regions of SMBMSF. Fig. 3B shows that swapping SMBVN residues 31-41 (i.e., SMBVN1-30MSF) or residues 29-41 (i.e., SMBVN1-28MSF) with SMBMSF sequences created hybrid peptides that retained PAI-1 binding activity, although the latter peptide had somewhat lower affinity for PAI-1. In contrast, replacing residues 26-41 created a hybrid peptide (SMBVN1-25MSF) that completely lacked PAI-1 binding activity. Thus, residues 31-40 at the COOH terminus of SMBVN are not required for PAI-1 binding when replaced with the corresponding region of another SMB homolog. Residue 29 is necessary for full PAI-1 binding activity. The importance of residue 28 cannot be established from these experiments because it is conserved in both molecules (see below). Although the above results suggest that the PAI-1 binding site is located in the central region of SMBVN, it is also possible that the loss of activity in the inactive hybrid molecules reflects conformational changes in the molecule and not the loss of specific sequences. To distinguish between these possibilities, gain of function experiments were performed. In these experiments, the central region of SMBVN was inserted into the non-PAI-1 binding homolog SMBMSF in an attempt to convert it into a PAI-1 binder. When residues 12-30 of SMBVN were exchanged with the corresponding sequences of intact but inactive SMBMSF, the resulting peptide (i.e., SMBMSF1-11VN12-30MSF) was indeed converted into an active PAI-1-binding protein (Fig. 4). To further confirm these results, SMBVN12-30 was introduced into the first SMB domain of PC-1, another inactive SMB homolog, creating the hybrid protein SMBPC-11-11VN12-30PC-1. Again the resulting peptide demonstrated full PAI-1 binding activity (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the 19 residues in the central region of active SMBVN contain the sequences necessary to convert the non-PAI-1-binding homologs into fully active PAI-1-binding proteins. Approximately 20% of the residues in SMBVN are cysteines. Because free cysteines were not detected in recombinant SMBVN domain using Ellman's method (36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21368) Google Scholar),2 and because 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide did not interfere with the binding of SMBVN to PAI-1 (data not shown), the 8 cysteines appear to be arranged in disulfide bonds. Complete chemical reduction of VN2 or of SMB itself (33Sigurdardottir O. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) abolished PAI-1 binding activity. Thus, the cysteines in SMBVN appear to be essential for PAI-1 binding. To determine whether all 8 cysteines were required for PAI-1 binding, we systematically changed each cysteine to alanine and then determined the PAI-1 binding activity of the resultant mutant peptides. Recombinant peptides with Cys9, Cys19, Cys21, Cys31, Cys32, or Cys39 replaced by alanine were completely inactive (Fig. 5A). However, the mutants with Cys5 or Cys25 replaced by alanine exhibited detectable PAI-1 binding activities, although their activities were significantly decreased compared to the control. These latter results raise the possibility t"

Studies using AUXB1 cells transfected with Escherichia coli folC gene (FPGS) constructs that target the expressed protein to the cytosol or mitochondria have demonstrated that cytosolic FPGS activity is required for cytosolic folate accumulation and purine and thymidylate biosynthesis, while mitochondrial FPGS activity is required for mitochondrial folate accumulation and glycine biosynthesis (23Lin B.-F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9705-9713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of E. coli FPGS solely in the mitochondria of AUXB1 cells restored normal folate accumulation and metabolism in the cytosol as well as in the mitochondria, demonstrating that pteroyltriglutamates synthesized in the mitochondria can be released into the cytosol, although these polyglutamate species cannot enter the mitochondria (14Kim J.-S.

We previously isolated a human FPGS cDNA (30Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) which encoded cytosolic FPGS and suggested that it might lack 5′ sequences that could also encode the mitochondrial isozyme. Recently, Freemantle et al. (31Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have described the organization of the 5′ region of the human FPGS gene and have shown that the isolated cDNA lacks the 5′ region of the mitochondrial leader sequence and that cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes could be generated by alternate transcription start sites. In this report, we describe the expression of human cytosolic FPGS in E. coli and the purification and properties of the enzyme. As a prelude to studying factors regulating the expression of FPGS in mammalian tissues and the role of the different isozymes, we have isolated and characterized the human gene. In this report, we describe the organization of the complete human FPGS gene, its localization, and splicing variants, and present a rationale for the role and need for mitochondrial and cytosolic FPGS isozymes. L-[U-14C]Glutamate (specific activity 270 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham, (6S)-5-formyltetrahydro[3H]folate (folinate, 5-formyl-H4PteGlu, specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek, and [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Folic acid, methotrexate, and aminopterin were obtained from Sigma and (6ambo)-H4PteGlu from Fluka. Reduced and oxidized folylpolyglutamates were synthesized as described previously (17Cichowicz D.J. Shane B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Cichowicz D.J. Shane B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or were obtained from Schirck Laboratories. Concentrations of folate derivatives were calculated from their absorption spectra (33Blakley R.L. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. The Biochemistry of Folic Acid and Related Pteridines. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1969: 92Google Scholar). Deficient α-minimal essential medium lacking purines, glycine, thymidine, and folate was obtained from JRH BioSciences. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes and RNase A were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Promega, or New England Biolabs. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. Nitrocellulose was obtained from Schleicher and Schuell. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the UC Berkeley Microchemical Facility. E. coli strain JM109(λDE3) was obtained from Promega. All other materials were obtained from commercial vendors. An NdeI restriction site was introduced at the first ATG in the human FPGS cDNA (pTZ18U-25 (30Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), accession number M98045) by mutagenesis using the procedure of Nakamaye and Ecksteine (34Nakamaye K. Ecksteine F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9679-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The antisense primer 5′-CTGGTACTCCATATGCTCGGCTCCTG-3′ introduced an AT dinucleotide between bases 70 and 71 of the cDNA (Fig. 1). A 2117-bp NdeI-BamHI fragment from pTZ18U-25-NdeI, containing the entire open reading frame of human FPGS, was ligated into similarly treated pET3A (Novagen). Plasmid pET3A has the bacteriophage T7 gene 10 promoter and transcriptional termination sequences. This new construct, pET3A-25 was transformed into E. coli JM109(λDE3) for the production of unfused human FPGS. To improve expression in E. coli, 12 of the first 27 codons in the cDNA ORF were modified for optimal codon usage (35de Boer H.A. Kastelein R.A. Reznikoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworths, Boston1986: 225Crossref Google Scholar). The complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TATGGAATACCAGGACGCTGTTCGCATGCTGAACACCCTGCAGACCAACGCTGGCTACCTGGAACAGGTTAAACGCCAGCGCG-3′ and 3′-ACCTTATGGTCCTGCGACAAGCGTACGACTTTGTGGGACGTCTGGTTGCGACCGATGGACCTTGTCCAATTTGCGGCGCGCCACTG-5′ were lyophilized, resuspended in 90% formamide, and purified by PAGE. Each primer was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the primers were annealed to each other by heating at 100°C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature in 60 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 400 µM ATP. Five micrograms of pET3A-25 was digested with NdeI and BstEII and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Approximately 0.5 µg of this DNA was ligated with 10 µl of the annealed oligonucleotides in a total volume of 20 µl. Half of this reaction mixture was transformed into JM109(DE3) and 4 transformants, whose inserts lacked an NaeI restriction site, were subjected to double-stranded sequencing (Sequenase, version 2) to verify the new primary structure at the 5′ end of the cDNA (pET3A-25*). Two different constructs of the human FPGS cDNA in plasmid pSVK-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were prepared as shown in Fig. 1. Plasmid pSVK-hFPGScyt was constructed by ligating the 2130-bp EcoRI fragment from pSE936-25 (30Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) into similarly treated pSVK-3. In some constructs, most of the 3′-untranslated region was deleted by digesting the plasmid with XbaI and religating (Fig. 1). Plasmid pSVK-hFPGSmit was made by ligating an 1860-bp XbaI fragment from pSE936-3 (30Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which contained the human FPGS cDNA with the longest 5′ region, into similarly treated pSVK-3. This construct adds an in-frame ATG upstream of the cDNA sequence (Fig. 1). Plasmids were purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation. These plasmid constructs insert the human FPGS cDNA downstream from an SV40 early promoter and transcriptional start region and upstream from a small tumor antigen splice site and a poly(A) signal. The inserts provide the first ATG for translational initiation. CHO AUXB1 cells were cultured in deficient α-minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, glycine, thymidine, and hypoxanthine as described previously (29Lin B.-F. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9705-9713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pSVK-hFPGScyt or pSVK-hFPGSmit (10 µg), and transfectants were selected by their ability to grow in medium containing folate and glycine but lacking thymidine and purines, and individual transfectants were cloned as described previously (36Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the cloned transfectants to grow in the absence of glycine was assessed as described previously (28Lowe K.E. Osborne C.B. Lin B.-F. Kim J.-S. Hsu J.-C. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21665-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Procedures for the subcellular fractionation of CHO cells, the measurement of subcellular distributions of FPGS and marker enzyme activities, and the measurement of intracellular folate accumulation and folylpolyglutamate chain length distributions have been previously described (23Lin B.-F. Huang R.-F.S. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lin B.-F. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9705-9713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Osborne C.B. Lowe K.E. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21657-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FPGS activity was monitored during enzyme purification procedures and in CHO cell extracts by the incorporation of [14C]glutamate (250 µM) into folylpolyglutamate products using (6ambo)-H4PteGlu as the substrate, as described previously (23Lin B.-F. Huang R.-F.S. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21674-21679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were normally conducted for 1 h at 37°C. In kinetic studies with pure enzyme, the assay mixtures contained various concentrations of the substrate under investigation and fixed concentrations of (6ambo)-H4PteGlu (40 µM), ATP (1 mM), and L-glutamate (2 mM), as appropriate. The amount of FPGS was adjusted to ensure that less than 10% of the limiting substrate was converted to product at the lowest substrate concentration used. All buffer solutions were adjusted to the indicated pH at room temperature. Extracts were maintained at 0°C, and all other procedures were performed at 0-4°C. JM109(λDE3) harboring plasmid pET3A-25 was grown to midlog phase in Luria media containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glycerol (15 liters). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min. The cell paste (114 g) was resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (300 ml), containing 2.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cells were disrupted using a Branson sonicator (power setting 8 using a 50% duty cycle for 3 × 8 min). The extract was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was decanted through a double layer of cheesecloth to give the crude extract (fraction 1). The crude extract (325 ml) was applied to a hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) column (7.5 × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 50 mM mercaptoethanol (Buffer A). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer (1000 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient (1500 ml) of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (0-150 mM) in the same buffer. Fractions containing FPGS activity were pooled (fraction 2). Fraction 2 enzyme (450 ml) was applied to an Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column (20 × 1.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 150 mM KCl (300 ml) and a linear gradient (500 ml) of KCl (0.15-1 M) in the same buffer was used to elute the enzyme. Fractions containing FPGS activity were pooled (fraction 3). Fraction 3 enzyme (224 ml) was applied to a phenyl-agarose (BRL) column (20 × 1 cm) that had been equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, 600 mM KCl, and 50 mM mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer (180 ml), and enzyme activity was eluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mM EDTA and 50 mM mercaptoethanol (2 × 12 liter). The dialyzed enzyme (fraction 4; 213 ml) was applied to a heparin-agarose (BRL) column (20 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with 150 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a linear gradient (300 ml) of KCl (0-500 mM) in the same buffer. Fractions containing FPGS activity were pooled and dialyzed against 2 × 4 liters of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM mercaptoethanol, and 10% ethylene glycol (fraction 5). Fraction 5 enzyme (20 ml) was applied to a DE52 (Whatman) column (20 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 50 mM mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with equilibration buffer (150 ml) and eluted with a linear gradient (300 ml) of KCl (0-500 mM) in the same buffer. Fractions containing FPGS activity were pooled giving fraction 6 (11 ml). Protein purity was analyzed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) using a 4% stacking gel and a 12.5% separating gel (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204908) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by a silver staining procedure. Total protein was determined on pooled fractions by a modified Lowry procedure (38Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7049) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A human lung fibroblast cell line W138 genomic library in the Lambda FIX II vector (obtained from Stratagene), was screened (106 plaques) with [32P]dCTP-labeled primers generated using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and a human FPGS cDNA (30Garrow T.A. Admon A. Shane B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as the template. Following plaque purification, 3 positive clones were obtained. The phage DNA from these clones were purified and characterized by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization using an EcoRI-BamHI 375-bp fragment of the 5′ region and a 355-bp XbaI-EcoRI 3′ region fragment of the human cDNA. XbaI fragments of the genomic clones, and the entire clones bordered by NotI sites, were subcloned into pBKS+ (Stratagene) for further analysis. DNA was sequenced by the method of Sanger et al. (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52101) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.). Exon-intron junctions were determined by direct sequencing across the junctions using oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence. Intron sizes were determined by sequencing through the region or by PCR using flanking primers. The FPGS gene sequence, with the exception of parts of 4 introns, was determined and verified by sequencing both DNA strands. Total RNA was isolated from human HepG2 cells with guanidinium thiocyanate followed by cesium chloride centrifugation (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used in this study are shown in Table I. cDNA corresponding to the 5′ end of HepG2 mRNA was synthesized and amplified (41Apte A.N. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 890-893PubMed Google Scholar) using a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) and following kit instructions with the following modifications. Antisense primer L5 was used, instead of oligo(dT), to synthesize the first strand cDNA. After the anchor (Clontech) ligation, the cDNA was first PCR-amplified with the anchor primer (Clontech) and an inner gene specific antisense primer (L4). One µl of the resulting PCR product was reamplified with the anchor primer and another nested gene-specific antisense primer (L2). PCR was carried out at 94°C for 5 min, and for 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 57°C for 0.5 min, and 72°C for 0.5 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 2.0% agarose gel with φX174/HaeIII-digested DNA (Promega) as size standards. Bands of interest were excised, and the DNA was purified using a QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega). In other studies, a 5′AmpliFINDER RACE kit (Clontech) was used. Primer L5 was used to initiate first strand cDNA synthesis. Anchor primer from the kit and primer L4 were used to amplify the cDNA with the same cycling profile as described above. The resulting PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and directly cloned into the pGEM-T vector. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened with a probe generated by amplification of the human FPGS cDNA using primers U2 and L2 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Positive colonies were further analyzed by hybridization with 32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotides L5A1, L5B1, or L5C1 which are specific for human FPGS exons 1 plus 1B, 1A, and 1C, respectively (Fig. 3). Positive colonies recognized by each probe were further characterized by restriction enzyme digestion, and clones with larger size inserts were sequenced. The 5′ transcriptional ends of fetal liver FPGS mRNA was also assessed by RACE using human fetal liver 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA (Clontech). Antisense primers 2J, L5, L4, and L2 were used successively to PCR-amplify the 5′ transcriptional end. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 5′ end of the human FPGS cDNA sense strand sequence (PR1, PR2, L5A1, L51, L52, L5B1, L5B2, T-1, and L5C1) were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on Sephadex G-25 Quick Spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim). Labeled probe (2 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to 50 µg of HepG2 total RNA in 1 × reverse transcriptase buffer (BRL) at 75°C for 10 min and 30°C for 60 min. Primer and RNA were coprecipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of reaction solution containing 1 × reverse transcriptase buffer, avian myeloblastosis virus or Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (40 units), 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM concentration of each dNTP with or without 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (26Taylor R.T. Hanna M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Foo S.K. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13587-13592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer was first extended at 42°C for 30 min. Additional reverse transcriptase (40 units) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 52°C for 30 min. The RNA was digested with 20 µg of DNase-free RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. Ammonium acetate (final concentration 2 M) was added, and the samples were extracted with 50 µl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Following ethanol precipitation, the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 5 µl of DNA sequencing stop solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel and compared to DNA sequence reaction products obtained with human FPGS genomic DNA (clone 9-4) using the same 32P-labeled oligonucleotide as the sequencing primers (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The 4.5-kb XbaI fragment of genomic clone 9 (Fig. 3) corresponding to the 5′ end of the cDNA, was subcloned into pBKS+ (Stratagene). The 2.7-kb fragment of the 5′-region of this insert, from the NotI site of the vector to the SacII site of the insert, was ligated to the SacII-NotI 3′-fragment (17 kb) of genomic clone 5 to construct the entire FPGS gene. The FPGS gene was subcloned into the NotI site of pBKS+. A FPGS cDNA probe were labeled with biotin-11-dUTP by nick translation and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes prepared from normal male peripheral blood by the bromodeoxyuridine synchronization method (43Zabel B.U.

Chem. 268, 1132-1140), we found that an antibody termed anti-pepY antibody causes a severalfold activation of bovine brain c-Src. The anti-pepY antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 410-428 of chicken c-Src, one of the most conserved regions among the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. In this study, we have used this antibody as an in vitro activator and purified a c-Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase from the particulate fraction of Xenopus laevis oocytes. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 7-26 of fission yeast Cdc2 was used as substrate. Immunoreactivity toward the antibody was also monitored during the purification. The purified kinase displayed a single polypeptide of 57 kDa on SDS-gel electrophoresis and showed a specific activity of 2.37 and 20.1 nmol/min/mg protein in the absence and the presence of the anti-pepY antibody, respectively. The purified enzyme underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated actin and the Cdc2 peptide exclusively on tyrosine residues. Specific antibodies against c-Src, Fyn, c-Yes, c-Fgr, Lck, Lyn, Hck, and Blk proteins did not recognize the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase. The kinase activity of the Xenopus enzyme was not affected by oocyte maturation but was found to be elevated severalfold upon fertilization. Fertilization also caused a translocation of the activated enzyme from the particulate fraction to the cytosolic fraction. The activation and translocation was observed within 1 min after fertilization. These results suggest a possible involvement of the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase in the signal transduction of fertilization. In the previous study (Fukami, Y., Sato, K.-I., Ikeda, K., Kamisango, K., Koizumi, K., and Matsuno, T. (1993) J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONThe protein-tyrosine kinase activity was initially found to be associated with v-Src, the product of Rous sarcoma virus oncogene, and then with the products of several retroviral oncogenes and their cellular counterparts, proto-oncogenes (1Bishop J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 301-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Soon after the discovery, the same activity was demonstrated for some growth factor receptors (2Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). It is now established that the protein-tyrosine kinase activity plays an important role not only in the cell transformation but also in the processes of normal cell growth and differentiation. c-Src, the 60-kDa normal cellular homologue of v-Src, is a prototype of the cellular members of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases and is associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane by virtue of its myristoylated amino terminus (3Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 191Google Scholar, 4Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 86Google Scholar, 6Hesketh R. Hesketh R. The Oncogene Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 448Google Scholar). Like other members of the Src family, c-Src shares a related structural feature including unique amino-terminal region, Src homology 3 and Src homology 2 domains, and the catalytic domain (also referred to as Src homology 1 domain), as well as the noncatalytic regulatory sequence in the carboxyl terminus (5Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 86Google Scholar). c-Src is found in virtually all higher eukaryotes and many cell types, and its predominant expression has been found in cells such as differentiating neurons, platelets, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (4Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 86Google Scholar, 6Hesketh R. Hesketh R. The Oncogene Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 448Google Scholar). However, its mode of regulation and physiological function in the cell remain unclear.In the present study, we have used oocytes of Xenopus laevis in order to investigate the physiological function of the members of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. To date, it has been suggested that the Src family kinases may be involved in the signal transduction mechanisms of Xenopus oocytes. For example, microinjection of v-Src or activated c-Src causes an acceleration of the rate of progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (7Spivack J.G. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Unger T.F. Steele R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Identification of Src-like tyrosine kinase activity in the frog has been done initially by Schartl and Barnekow (9Schartl M. Barnekow A. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Steele et al. reported cDNA cloning of three members of the Src family kinases in oocytes, c-Src (10Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10649-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fyn (11Steele R.E. Deng J.C. Ghosn C.R. Fero J.B. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar), and c-Yes (12Steele R.E. Irwin M.Y. Knudsen C.L. Collet J.W. Fero J.B. Oncogene Res. 1989; 1: 223-233Google Scholar). However, the advancement of knowledge regarding the function and regulation of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases in oocytes has been limited by the lack of purification of native enzymes and their detailed characterization.In the previous study, we proposed a model in which the c-Src activity is negatively regulated by the intramolecular interaction between the amino terminus of Src homology 2 domain and the region containing the autophosphorylation site, named the inter-(Asp-Phe-Gly)-(Ala-Pro-Glu) (IDA) 1The abbreviations used are: IDAinter-(Asp-Phe-Gly)-(AlaPro-Glu)APMSF(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. region (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that an antibody, termed anti-pepY antibody, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 410-428 in the IDA region of chicken c-Src causes a severalfold activation of bovine brain c-Src (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence in the IDA region is almost completely conserved among the Src family members. Thus, we thought that the anti-pepY antibody might be useful as a tool for the identification of Xenopus Src family kinases. As a standard protein-tyrosine kinase substrate, we used a synthetic Cdc2 peptide that corresponds to the tyrosine phosphorylation site of the fission yeast cdc2 gene product (residues 7-26). This peptide and related peptides have been used as phosphate acceptors for several protein-tyrosine kinases, such as v-Src (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gould K.L. Nurse P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2557-2566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a cytosolic tyrosine kinase from HeLa cells (16Feller S.M. Wong T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In this paper, we describe the purification of a Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase from the particulate fraction of Xenopus oocytes. Kinase activity of the enzyme was elevated severalfold by the addition of anti-pepY antibody. A 57-kDa polypeptide was identified in the immunoblot analysis using anti-pepY antibody and found to be copurified with the kinase activity. Significant activation and translocation of the enzyme was observed as early as 1 min after fertilization of the eggs, suggesting a possible role of the enzyme in the fertilization events of Xenopus.DISCUSSIONIn Xenopus oocytes, the presence of mRNAs of three Src family kinases, c-Src, Fyn, and c-Yes, has been demonstrated (10Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10649-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steele R.E. Deng J.C. Ghosn C.R. Fero J.B.

Oncogene Res. 1989; 1: 223-233Google Scholar). cDNAs of receptor/tyrosine kinases for fibroblast growth factor (31Musci T.J. Amaya E. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8365-8369Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (32Jones S.D. Ho L. Smith J.C. Yordan C. Stiles C.D. Marcola M. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have also been obtained. In addition, more than 30 clones representing partial sequences of tyrosine kinase family members have been identified by the polymerase chain reaction method (33Islam N. Guimond A. Sanchez A. Moss T. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, the biochemical identification and characterization of protein-tyrosine kinase activity in oocytes has been limited to the studies on the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptor/kinase done by Hainaut et al. (34Hainaut P. Kowalski A. Giorgetti S. Baron V. Obberghen E.V. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase purified in this study is the first Src-related kinase biochemically characterized in oocytes. The enzyme was found exclusively in the particulate fraction of oocytes and identified as a Cdc2 peptide kinase activity that was stimulated in the presence of anti-pepY antibody (Fig. 1A). The antibody was originally raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 410-428 in the IDA region of chicken c-Src and has been found to activate the bovine c-Src (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the IDA region is one of the most conserved regions among the Src family kinases, we thought that the anti-pepY antibody might be useful for isolation of the Src family kinases, providing not only immunochemical detection but also highly specific in vitro activation of the enzymes. In fact, the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase was purified to near homogeneity by using this activating antibody and found to have a limited activity in the absence of the antibody (Fig. 3 and Table II). To our surprise, however, we could not identify the c-Src protein or its activity in oocytes. The c-Src protein(s), which may be translated from either of the two mRNAs present in oocytes (10Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10649-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would have been detected in the first DEAE-cellulose chromatography fractions by anti-pepY antibody or by the anti-Src monoclonal antibody (mAb327). Actually, by using mAb327, we have been able to identify the Xenopus c-Src in the DEAE-cellulose chromatography fractions prepared from brain. 2K.-I. Sato, S. Akasofu, and Y. Fukami, unpublished observations. Therefore, we think expression level of c-Src in oocytes is very low and beyond the detection limit, in spite of the reported presence of mRNAs. The p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase did not react with mAb327 antibody (Fig. 4) or with other Src family-specific antibodies tested. This result suggests that the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase is not c-Src itself or the product of its partial proteolysis but yet an unidentified Src family member in oocytes. Direct protein sequencing of the purified kinase and its cDNA cloning will allow us to define the molecular structure of the enzyme.We have used the anti-pepY antiboby as an in vitro activator of the Xenopus tyrosine kinase. Similar anti-IDA peptide antibodies have been used to identify and analyze Src-related tyrosine kinases. Casnellie et al. (35Casnellie J.E. Gentry L.E. Rohrschneider L.R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6676-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) identified Lck, the 56-kDa Src family protein-tyrosine kinase in T cells, by using an antibody against the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 409-421 of v-Src. Litwin et al. (15Litwin C.M.E. Cheng H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2557-2566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the purification of a Src-related tyrosine kinase from bovine spleen by using a similar antibody. The purified enzyme displayed three closely spaced protein bands of 50-55 kDa on SDS-gel electrophoresis, implying that the enzyme is a member of the Src family proteins. As to the effect of the antibody on the kinase activity, Casnellie et al. (35Casnellie J.E. Gentry L.E. Rohrschneider L.R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6676-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that the Lck activity was inhibited by their antibody. Recently, Peaucellier et al. (36Peaucellier G. Shartzer K. Jiang W. Maggio K. Kinsey W.H. Develop. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 199-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) identified a 57-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase in sea urchin eggs. The enzyme was identified by an antibody against the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues Thr-Tyr-Thr-Ala-Gln-Ala-Gly-Ala-Lys-Asn-Pro-Ile-Lys-Trp (a part of the IDA region) of the sea urchin c-Abl. They also found that the binding of the antibody completely inhibited the kinase activity (36Peaucellier G. Shartzer K. Jiang W. Maggio K. Kinsey W.H. Develop. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 199-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These conflicting results concerning the effect of antibody on the kinase activity might be explained by the difference in the epitopes that are recognized by these anti-IDA antibodies. Our recent experiments showed that the binding of the antibody to the carboxyl-terminal half of the IDA region of c-Src results in the activation of c-Src, whereas the binding to the amino-terminal half results in the inhibition. 3K.-I. Sato and Y. Fukami, manuscript in preparation. The major epitope for the anti-pepY antibody is shown to reside in the the carboxyl-terminal half of the IDA region of Src (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody used by Casnellie et al. (36Peaucellier G. Shartzer K. Jiang W. Maggio K. Kinsey W.H. Develop. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 199-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was raised against a peptide that lacks seven carboxyl-terminal amino acids when aligned with our pepY. Thus, the resulting antibody would not be able to bind to the carboxyl-terminal half of the IDA region of Lck. This might be a critical difference between the two anti-IDA antibodies that possess apparently opposite effects on the kinase activity.Kinetic analysis of p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase (Table II) revealed that Km for Cdc2 peptide of this enzyme (360 µM) is comparable with those of the Src-related protein-tyrosine kinase from bovine spleen (380 µM) (15Litwin C.M.E. Cheng H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2557-2566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 94-kDa cytosolic tyrosine kinase from HeLa cells (270 µM) (16Feller S.M. Wong T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Km value for ATP (71 µM) indicated that the nucleotide affinity of the Xenopus tyrosine kinase seems quite low when compared with those of c-Src (2.2 µM) (37Feder D. Bishop J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8205-8211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and v-Src (14.3 µM) (38Sato K.-I. Miki S. Tachibana H. Hayashi F. Akiyama T. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1152-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is lower than those reported for c-Yes (32 µM) (39Azuma K. Ariki M. Miyauchi T. Usui H. Takeda M. Semba K. Matsuzawa Y. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lck (30 µM) (40Watts J.D. Wilson G.M. Ettehadieh E. Clark-Lewis I. Kubanek C.-A. Astell C.R. Marth J.D. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, anti-pepY antibody did not have any significant effect on Km for either ATP or Cdc2 peptide, but it caused a significant increase in Vmax (Table II). This result is consistent with the idea that the antibody activates inactive form of the kinase and increases a population of active enzyme without affecting the affinity constants.It is well known that protein kinase activity plays an important role in oocyte maturation (41Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As to the role of Src family kinases, Spivack et al. (7Spivack J.G. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Unger and Steele (8Unger T.F. Steele R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated the acceleration of the rate of progesterone-induced oocyte maturation by the microinjection of v-Src protein and by the expression of activated c-Src, respectively. Furthermore, much attention has been focused on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation that occurs upon fertilization of sea urchin eggs (42Peaucellier G. Veno P.A. Kinsey W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13806-13811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ciapa B. Epel D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 430-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have examined the activity of the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase in the course of oocyte maturation and fertilization. Although we could not detect any activation of the enzyme during the oocyte maturation, we found a significant activation and translocation of the enzyme after fertilization (Figs. 5, 6, 7). The time course analysis (Fig. 7) showed that the process is very fast and almost completed within 1 min. In sea urchin eggs, a quick increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins has been observed after fertilization (42Peaucellier G. Veno P.A. Kinsey W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13806-13811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ciapa B. Epel D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is of special interest that the 350-kDa sperm receptor protein is shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated within 5 s after fertilization (44Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 430-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cDNA for the sperm receptor has been cloned (45Foltz K.R. Partin J.S. Lennarz W.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and it is evident that the sperm receptor itself is not a protein-tyrosine kinase. Thus, it is likely that one or more protein-tyrosine kinase(s) is activated upon fertilization and phosphorylates the sperm receptor. Such a signal transduction system including functional and physical interaction between the receptor proteins without kinase activity and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases has been well established for T cell receptor complex (46Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of tyrosine kinase activity in fertilization is still obscure, Moore and Kinsey (47Moore K.L. Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not block the early events of fertilization such as elevation of the fertilization envelope, but they blocked the later events such as pronuclear migration, DNA synthesis, and cell division in sea urchin eggs. Their observations indicate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation for the ongoing of fertilization. As a candidate for the protein-tyrosine kinase being responsible for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at fertilization, a 57-kDa tyrosine kinase (36Peaucellier G. Shartzer K. Jiang W. Maggio K. Kinsey W.H. Develop. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 199-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and an Abl-related 220-kDa tyrosine kinase (48Moore K.L. Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been reported. Both kinases are localized to the egg cortex (36Peaucellier G. Shartzer K. Jiang W. Maggio K. Kinsey W.H. Develop. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 199-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 48Moore K.L. Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, Kinsey reported a transient kinase activation and time-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the 57-kDa kinase on both tyrosine and threonine residues after fertilization (49Kinsey W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the biological properties and its apparent molecular size, it may be supposed that the sea urchin 57-kDa tyrosine kinase is homologous to the p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase.The fertilization-dependent activation of p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase suggests that this enzyme might be under the regulatory mechanism of early embryogenesis. Further studies on the mechanism by which p57 Xenopus tyrosine kinase is activated upon fertilization may contribute to the understanding of the role of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in early embryogenesis of Xenopus. INTRODUCTIONThe protein-tyrosine kinase activity was initially found to be associated with v-Src, the product of Rous sarcoma virus oncogene, and then with the products of several retroviral oncogenes and their cellular counterparts, proto-oncogenes (1Bishop J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 301-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Soon after the discovery, the same activity was demonstrated for some growth factor receptors (2Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). It is now established that the protein-tyrosine kinase activity plays an important role not only in the cell transformation but also in the processes of normal cell growth and differentiation. c-Src, the 60-kDa normal cellular homologue of v-Src, is a prototype of the cellular members of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases and is associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane by virtue of its myristoylated amino terminus (3Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 191Google Scholar, 4Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev.

Hesketh R. The Oncogene Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 448Google Scholar). Like other members of the Src family, c-Src shares a related structural feature including unique amino-terminal region, Src homology 3 and Src homology 2 domains, and the catalytic domain (also referred to as Src homology 1 domain), as well as the noncatalytic regulatory sequence in the carboxyl terminus (5Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 86Google Scholar). c-Src is found in virtually all higher eukaryotes and many cell types, and its predominant expression has been found in cells such as differentiating neurons, platelets, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (4Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Cooper J.A. Kemp B. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 86Google Scholar, 6Hesketh R. Hesketh R. The Oncogene Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 448Google Scholar). However, its mode of regulation and physiological function in the cell remain unclear.In the present study, we have used oocytes of Xenopus laevis in order to investigate the physiological function of the members of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. To date, it has been suggested that the Src family kinases may be involved in the signal transduction mechanisms of Xenopus oocytes. For example, microinjection of v-Src or activated c-Src causes an acceleration of the rate of progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (7Spivack J.G. Erikson R.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Unger T.F. Steele R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5485-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Identification of Src-like tyrosine kinase activity in the frog has been done initially by Schartl and Barnekow (9Schartl M. Barnekow A. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Steele et al. reported cDNA cloning of three members of the Src family kinases in oocytes, c-Src (10Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10649-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fyn (11Steele R.E. Deng J.C. Ghosn C.R. Fero J.B. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 369-376PubMed Google Scholar), and c-Yes (12Steele R.E. Irwin M.Y. Knudsen C.L. Collet J.W. Fero J.B. Oncogene Res. 1989; 1: 223-233Google Scholar). However, the advancement of knowledge regarding the function and regulation of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases in oocytes has been limited by the lack of purification of native enzymes and their detailed characterization.In the previous study, we proposed a model in which the c-Src activity is negatively regulated by the intramolecular interaction between the amino terminus of Src homology 2 domain and the region containing the autophosphorylation site, named the inter-(Asp-Phe-Gly)-(Ala-Pro-Glu) (IDA) 1The abbreviations used are: IDAinter-(Asp-Phe-Gly)-(AlaPro-Glu)APMSF(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. region (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that an antibody, termed anti-pepY antibody, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 410-428 in the IDA region of chicken c-Src causes a severalfold activation of bovine brain c-Src (13Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The results demonstrate that Arg-233 and Gln-451 have important roles in determining agonist binding affinity and transmembrane signaling. Furthermore, the finding that residues in TM 2 and TM 7 are functionally linked suggests that the TM domain topology of the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor may resemble that of receptors in the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family, for which structural and mutagenesis data suggest interactions between TMs 2 and 7. Polar residues within the transmembrane domains (TMs) of G protein-coupled receptors have been implicated to be important determinants of receptor function. We have identified mutations at two polar sites in the TM regions of the rat parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor, Arg-233 in TM 2 and Gln-451 in TM 7, that caused 17-200-fold reductions in the binding affinity of the agonist peptide PTH-(1Jüppner H.

Furthermore, the finding that residues in TM 2 and TM 7 are functionally linked suggests that the TM domain topology of the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor may resemble that of receptors in the rhodopsin/β-adrenergic receptor family, for which structural and mutagenesis data suggest interactions between TMs 2 and 7."

Here we explore the capacity of complementary peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to invade the CAG triplets of the AR and TBP genes in human prostatic cancer cells and show that the PNAs readily entered the nuclei of lysolecithin-permeabilized cells and effectively inhibited sense transcription of unique AR and TBP DNA sequences downstream of the site of PNA·;DNA hybridization, but not upstream of that site. These PNAs had little or no effect on transcription of the c-myc gene, which lacks a CAG triplet domain. Conversely, a PNA complementary to a unique sequence of the c-myc gene did not inhibit transcription of the AR or TBP genes but did inhibit c-myc transcription. Comparisons of PNA effects on sense and antisense transcription of the AR, TBP, and c-myc genes confirm that progression of the RNA polymerase complex beyond the site of PNA·;DNA hybridization is impaired in both directions.

PNA invasion of DNA duplex strands to form specific and stable PNA·;DNA hybrids has profound implications for both positive and negative control of transcription.

We have tested the effects of PNAs complementary to the CAG triplet repeats that occur in many genes involved in transcriptional control. More than 33 transcription factors, including the human TATA-binding protein (TBP) (15Hoffman A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy A. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G.

Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1600-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), are characterized by the presence of polyglutamine tracts containing more than 20 residues encoded by tandem CAG triplet repeats. We have shown previously that a biotinylated PNA targeted to CAG repeats will strand invade those DNA sequences in their transcriptionally active states in intact chromatin (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By combining the use of the biotinylated CAG-specific PNA with techniques that permit a clear separation of transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin restriction fragments (22Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it became possible to capture the active chromatin fragments containing the stable PNA·;DNA hybrids on streptavidin-agarose magnetic beads. Those chromatin fragments were shown to contain the transcriptionally active DNA for the TBP of human colonic cancer cells. Moreover, the selectivity of the PNA probe for the CAG triplet repeats was confirmed by the fact that the streptavidin-bound chromatin fragments did not contain DNA for the c-myc protooncogene, which is amplified and actively transcribed in the same cells, but lacks a domain of tandem CAG triplets (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have now tested the effects of CAG-specific and c-myc-specific PNAs on AR, TBP, and c-myc transcription in human prostatic cancer cell lines, and we now show that each PNA can selectively target its complementary DNA sequence in the intact chromatin of permeabilized cells. Detailed comparisons of PNA inhibitions of sense and antisense transcription of the AR, TBP, and c-myc genes confirm that progression of the RNA polymerase complex beyond the site of PNA·;DNA hybrid formation is impaired in both directions. Human prostatic carcinoma cell lines LNCaP and DU-145 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and 20 ng/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. DU-145 prostatic cancer cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. In all cases, cells in log phase growth were harvested at 5 × 105 cells/ml. An 18-mer PNA, 5′-CAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAG-Lys-CONH2-3′, complementary to the transcribed strand of the AR triplet repeat domain was synthesized and linked to biotin at its amino-terminal through two 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl linkers to create a distance between the PNA and the biotin label. A second PNA, with the same sequence, but lacking the biotinylated linker was also tested, with identical results on transcription of the AR and TBP genes (custom synthesis by Per-Septive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The purity of the biotinylated PNAs was confirmed by reverse phase chromatography and mass spectrographic analysis (Mr 5,568 and 6,325.5, respectively). The PNA used for strand invasion of the c-myc gene was the 17-mer biotinylated sequence 5′-Bio-O-O-TCAACGTTAGCTTCACC-Lys-NH2-3′, complementary to the sense strand of the unique sequence (4528-4544) in the second exon. LNCaP and DU-145 cells were harvested and washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 mM Na+ butyrate. The cells were suspended at 108 cells/ml in buffer A (35 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Na+ butyrate, 150 mM sucrose). Five hundred units of RNase Guard (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) were added to 200-µl aliquots of cell suspension in 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and the cells were then permeabilized to nucleotides by treatment for 1 min at 0°C with one-third volume of a 1 mg/ml solution of lysolecithin in buffer A. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min and resuspended in sufficient buffer B (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na+ butyrate, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose) to provide four or five 200-µl aliquots (final volume) for each run-on transcription experiment. 500 units of RNase Guard were added to each of the multiple 200-µl samples, some of which served as controls for measuring AR gene transcription in the absence of PNAs, while others received appropriate aliquots of a 500 µM PNA stock solution to bring the final PNA concentration to 1, 5, 10, or 20 µM, respectively. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min to permit PNA entry into the nuclear chromatin (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), each sample received 200 µl of buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 M KCl, 5 mM Na+ butyrate) containing 1 mM ATP, 1 mM CTP, and 1 mM GTP. 500 µCi of [α-32P]UTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) was added, and transcription was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C. Following incubation the samples were digested with RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) and proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim), and total RNA was extracted and purified as described (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Unit 4.9. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar); or alternatively, the RNAs were precipitated by lysing the cells in a cationic detergent (Catrimox-14; Iowa Biotechnology Corp., Corville, IA) and converting the RNA to the ethanol-insoluble lithium salt (24Dahle C.E. MacFarlane D.E. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1102-1105PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled RNA samples were dissolved in buffer D (1 mM TES, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 0.3 M NaCl) and hybridized to DNA probes for AR, TBP, and c-myc blotted on Nytran Plus filters, as described below. Four DNA probes, specific for unique AR gene sequences, were employed in order to compare PNA effects on sense and antisense transcription in regions downstream and upstream of the targeted CAG triplet domain. The 23-mer oligonucleotide 5′-dCTCTTTTGAAGAAGACCTTGCAG-3′ was used to detect sense transcripts of the unique sequence (1890-1912) of human AR cDNA (25Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), located downstream of the site of PNA·;DNA hybridization. The probe for the corresponding antisense transcripts was 5′-dCTGCAAGGTCTTCTTCAAAAGAG-3′. The oligo-DNA probes for the sense and antisense transcripts of the unique AR sequence (163-185) upstream of the PNA·;DNA hybridization site were 5′-dCCCAGCCCTAACTGCACTTCCAT-3′ and 5′-dATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGCTGGG-3′, respectively. Five probes were used for the detection of c-myc transcripts. The first was a 9-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment in plasmid pHSR, which encodes the full human c-myc gene. The DNA oligonucleotide probes for sense and antisense transcripts of the unique c-myc sequence (7177-7213) downstream of the myc-targeting PNA hybridization site (4528-4544) were 5′-dCGCACAAGAGTTCCGTAGCTGTTCAAGTTTGTGTTTC-3′ and 5′-dGAAACACAAACTTGAACAGCTACGGAACTCTTGTGCG-3′, respectively. The DNA probes for sense and antisense transcripts of the unique c-myc upstream sequence (2303-2333) were 5′-dGGGGGTCCTCAGCCGTCCAGACCCTCGCATT-3′ and 5′-dAATGCGAGGGTCTGGACGGCTGAGGACCCCC-3′, respectively. In tests for the effects of PNAs targeting the CAG domain (270-371) of the human TBP gene, the probes for sense and antisense transcripts of the unique downstream sequence (905-932) were 5′-dACTACTAAATTGTTGGTGGGTGAGCACA-3′, and 5′- dTGTGCTCACCCACCAACAATTTAGTAGT-3′, respectively. The corresponding probes for transcripts of the unique TBP sequence (99-126) upstream of the CAG domain were 5′-dGTAAGGTGGCAGGCTGTTGTTCTGATCCAT-3′ and 5′-dATGGATCAGAACAACAGCCTGCCACCTTAC-3′ (15Hoffman A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy A. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In all experiments, 2 nmol of each DNA oligonucleotide were blotted onto Nytran Plus filters, pore size 45 µm (Schleicher & Schuell) and exposed to the radioactive RNA samples for 36 h at 65°C, as described (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Unit 4.9. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). After exposure for appropriate periods and development of the films in Kodak X-Omat M4 developer, the autoradiograms were scanned with a laser densitometer and peak areas corresponding to each slot-blot were integrated. In all experiments, the relationship between 32P activity of the RNA in individual slot-blots and the intensity of the corresponding autoradiogram were determined by comparison with standard curves in which photographic density is plotted for a series of dilutions of a standard 32P-labeled salmon sperm DNA solution applied to the same membrane as the experimental samples. This established the range of linear response and clearly indicated where reblotting or correction for overexposure was needed. All procedures were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and washed three times in calcium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 mM Na+ butyrate to suppress histone deacetylase activity during cell lysis and isolation of the nuclei (26Boffa L.C.

Cell. 1978; 14: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To lyse the cells, they were suspended in buffer E (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM Na+ butyrate, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 0.1 mM 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane) (EPNP, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 5 min at 0°C, with gentle mixing by pipetting. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in buffer E, and recentrifuged. They were then suspended in buffer F (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Na+ butyrate, 0.35 M sucrose, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM EPNP). After centrifugation as before, the cells were resuspended in buffer F and broken by shearing in a glass Dounce-type homogenizer with a type B pestle (Kontes, Inc., Vineland, NJ). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the nuclear pellet was washed three times by resuspension and centrifugation in buffer F. The nuclei were suspended in buffer F at a concentration of 1 mg DNA/ml and equilibrated at 37°C for 10 min. Micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) was added at 10 units/ml, and the reaction was started by the addition of CaCl2 to 0.5 mM. After incubation at 37°C for 7 min, endonuclease action was halted by rapid chilling and addition of Na2EGTA to a final concentration of 2.5 mM. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant, containing the nucleosomes released by endonuclease digestion, was analyzed for its DNA content by measuring the A260/ml and by the Hoechst dye-binding assay (28Cesarone C.F. Bolognesi C. Santi L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 11% of the total DNA of the LNCaP nuclei was released into the supernatant (average of 4 experiments). To separate the transcriptionally active from inactive nucleosomes, the supernatant was brought to 5 mM in Na2EDTA, and applied to an organomercurial-agarose column (Affi-Gel 501, Bio-Rad). Elution of the unbound nucleosomes was carried out in buffer G (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM Na+ butyrate, 5 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM EPNP, 2% sucrose) until the A260 of the eluate returned to base line. The remaining nucleosomes, which were bound to the Hg+ column through their accessible SH groups, were released by elution in buffer G containing 20 mM dithiothreitol. DNA was purified from the unbound and Hg+-bound nucleosome fractions and analyzed for AR gene content by slot-blot hybridizations (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for the unique downstream AR sequence 5′-dCTTTTGAAGAAGACCTT as described (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mRNA of the androgen receptor gene is characterized by a series of tandem CAG triplets that encode a tract of glutamine residues in the receptor protein. To test whether a PNA targeted to the sense strand of the CAG domain (nucleotides 334-390) (i.e. the tandem CTG sequence serving as template for the CAG repeats in AR mRNA) would inhibit transcription beyond the site of PNA·;DNA hybridization, we selected a prostatic cancer cell line, LNCaP, which had been shown to contain both the androgen receptor protein and its mRNA (30Tilley W.D. Wilson D.M. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5382-5386PubMed Google Scholar). Run-on transcription experiments were carried out on cells that were gently permeabilized with lysolecithin under conditions shown to preserve nuclear RNA synthetic activity during nuclear transplantation experiments (31Gurdon J.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The permeabilized cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of an 18-mer biotin-free PNA complementary to the CAG-encoding DNA strand. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min to permit PNA entry into nuclear chromatin (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), ATP, CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP were added, and run-on transcription experiments were carried out as described (see “Materials and Methods”). Total RNA was purified from each sample and analyzed for its content of 32P-labeled transcripts of a unique AR downstream sequence (nucleotides 1890-1912) by slot-blotting to the complementary DNA oligonucleotide probe. The results for cells exposed to 0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 µM PNA show a progressive inhibition of AR transcript elongation at PNA concentrations starting at 5 µM, reaching 71% at 10 µM, and 81% inhibition at 20 µM PNA, as determined by densitometric analysis of the slot-blots (Fig. 1A). As expected, PNA invasion of the CAG domain of the AR gene strongly inhibited transcription at the binding site, reducing CAG-repeat transcripts by 93% at 20 µM PNA (average of eight determinations). Other genes containing CAG triplet repeats were also affected by the same PNA. For example, PNA invasion of the tandem CAG triplets at nucleotides 270-371 of the human TATA-binding protein gene inhibited transcription of a unique TBP DNA sequence (nucleotides 905-932) downstream of the hybridization site by 80% at 10 µM and by 88% at 20 µM PNA (Fig. 1B). The specificity of PNA targeting to different genes was confirmed in two ways. First, it was shown that sense transcription of the c-myc gene, which lacks a domain of CAG triplet repeats, was not inhibited in the same cells under identical conditions, only minor variations (±7%) were observed in four determinations of [α-32P]UMP incorporation into transcripts of two unique c-myc DNA sequences (nucleotides 2303-2333 and 7177-7213). In similar experiments, using both LNCaP and DU-145 prostatic cancer cells, a 21-mer PNA targeted to the antisense strand of the AR CAG-repeat domain was found to have no inhibitory effect on c-myc transcription (Fig. 3A). Conversely, exposure of the LNCaP cells to a PNA complementary to a unique sequence in the second exon of the c-myc gene had little or no effect on transcription of a unique sequence (nucleotides 1890-1912) of the AR gene but did inhibit transcription of a unique DNA sequence in the third c-myc exon (Fig. 2C). Such specificity in PNA interactions with intact chromatin is in accord with earlier results on the selective binding and recovery of PNA·;DNA hybrids of the TBP gene in colonic cancer cells (21Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Allfrey V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).Fig. 2Contrasting effects of PNAs specifically targeted to the sense strands of the AR, TBP, and c-mycgenes on sense and antisense transcription downstream and upstream of the PNA binding sites. Equal numbers of LNCaP cells were exposed to one of three PNAs. Two were 18-mer CAG PNAs with the same base sequence, but differing in their modification by biotin, are shown. Both were targeted to the CAG triplet domains of the AR gene (A) and TBP gene (B). The third PNA was complementary to a unique DNA sequence of the c-myc gene (C). After run-on transcription experiments, the 32P-labeled RNA samples were isolated and slot-blotted to appropriate oligo-DNA probes for sense and antisense transcripts of unique sequences downstream and upstream of their PNA binding sites. Intensities of the hybridization signals are compared for control cells (solid bars), for cells treated with the unmodified 18-mer CAG PNA (lightly striped bars), or its biotinylated form (darkly striped bars), and for cells treated with the 17-mer c-myc PNA (stippled bars). Note that in every case, the PNA inhibited transcription of the sense strand downstream of its binding site on the gene, while transcription was stimulated upstream of the PNA block. The opposite effect was observed for antisense transcription, in which progression of the RNA polymerase complex was not impaired until it reached the PNA binding site, and upstream transcription was inhibited.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The previous experiments were focused on the inhibitory effects of PNAs complementary to the sense strand of the AR CAG triplet domain on sense transcription of a unique sequence downstream of the PNA·;DNA hybridization site (Fig. 1A). More detailed studies of PNA effects on AR transcription were initiated when run-on transcription experiments revealed the presence of 32P-labeled transcripts of the AR antisense strand in cells that had never been exposed to PNA. The antisense transcripts were clearly evident in slot-blot hybridizations of the 32P-labeled RNA samples to complementary DNA oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 2A). To determine whether PNA binding to the sense strand of the AR gene also affected antisense transcription, we compared the synthesis of sense and antisense transcripts at unique AR DNA sequences located downstream and upstream of the CAG-repeat domain. The results confirmed that 20 µM PNA inhibited transcription of the downstream sense strand by 88%, but they also revealed that PNA binding to the sense strand led to an increase in 32P-labeled transcripts of a unique AR sequence upstream of the PNA binding site (Fig. 2A). The opposite results were obtained for antisense transcription in which PNA binding to the CAG triplet domain inhibited transcription of the upstream AR sequence by 82-86% but stimulated downstream transcription (Fig. 2B). Simultaneous assays for transcripts of the CAG triplet domain show that 20 µM PNA effectively inhibited both sense and antisense transcription of the tandem repeats by 93% (average of nine determinations). The contrasting effects of PNAs on sense and antisense transcription were also evident in the TBP gene, where PNA invasion of the CAG triplet domain inhibited downstream transcription of the sense strand by 88% (average of seven determinations) but stimulated transcription of a unique TBP sequence upstream of the PNA·;DNA hybrid (Fig. 2B). These results are fully compatible with a model in which PNA binding to the CAG triplet domain impedes progression of the RNA polymerase complex in both directions. Further support for this view is provided by experiments using a 17-mer complementary PNA to ta"

We took advantage of this phenotypic difference to identify the domain responsible for the selective recognition of PHI by rat and human receptors which display >80% sequence identity. After transfection of human and rat receptors in COS cells, the ratio of IC50 for PHI/IC50 for VIP (referred to as P/V) in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding was shown to be >1,000 and <40, respectively. Construction of eight rat/human receptor chimerae by overlap polymerase chain reaction and determination of their P/V ratios demonstrated that the critical domain for PHI recognition is present within a sequence comprising part of the first extracellular loop and third transmembrane domain. This domain contains three different amino acids numbered according to human and rat sequences, respectively, e.g. Gln207 (human) versus His208 (rat), Gly211 versus Ala212 and Met219 versus Val220. Site-directed mutagenesis introducing individual, double, or triple mutations in a chimeric construct revealed that all three amino acids were involved in the recognition of PHI. Triple mutations were then introduced in the wild-type receptors i.e. Q207H, G211A, M219V human VIP1 receptor and H208Q, A212G, V220M rat VIP1 receptor, resulting in a complete change in their phenotype from human to rat and from rat to human, respectively.

The construction of chimerae between the rat VIP1 receptor and the secretin receptor further demonstrated the key role of the amino terminus of the VIP receptor in VIP recognition (15Holtmann M.H.

Although these studies provided interesting insights into the VIP binding domain of the VIP1 receptor, they gave no clue to the structural determinants in the receptor which are responsible for the peptide selectivity toward VIP-related peptides. Both human and rat VIP1 receptors recognize several naturally occurring VIP-related peptides as VIP agonists including PHI, PACAP, GRF, and secretin (see Ref. 2Laburthe M. Kitabgi P. Couvineau A. Amiranoff B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 106: 133-176Crossref Google Scholar for review). They discriminate VIP and VIP-related peptides in a similar way with the notable exception of PHI which displays a high affinity for the rat receptor but a low affinity for the human receptor (2Laburthe M.

In the present work, we took advantage of this clear-cut phenotypic difference between the human and the rat VIP1 receptor, known to be >80% identical in sequence (6Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K.

Other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma. Eight chimerae were constructed including portions of wild-type human and rat VIP1 receptors. The composition of wild-type and chimeric receptors is shown schematically in Fig. 1 with the following nomenclature in which amino acids are numbered according to the human and rat receptor sequences: Hwt, human wild-type VIP1 receptor (1-457); Rwt, rat wild-type VIP1 receptor (1-459); R/H1, rat receptor (1-145), human receptor (145-457); R/H2, rat receptor (1-180), human receptor (180-457); R/H3, rat receptor (1-206), human receptor (206-457); R/H4, rat receptor (1-222), human receptor (222-457); R/H5, rat receptor (1-276), human receptor (276-457); R/H6, rat receptor (1-297), human receptor (296-457); R/H7, rat receptor (1-354), human receptor (353-457); R/H8, rat receptor (1-381), human receptor (380-457). Chimeric receptors were constructed using the two-step overlap polymerase chain reaction approach (20Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach.

Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of 125I-VIP bound in the absence and the presence of 1 µM unlabeled VIP. Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 197: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). The concentration of peptide that elicited half-maximal inhibition of specific 125I-VIP binding (IC50) was determined by computer analysis and the ratio IC50 for PHI/IC50 for VIP was calculated and is referred to as P/V. Cellular cAMP content was assayed as described previously (22Voisin T. Lorinet A.M. Maoret J.J. Couvineau A. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Transfected cells in 12-well trays were incubated in the presence or absence of VIP in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 30 min at 20°C. At the end of the incubation, the medium was rapidly removed, cells were washed, and 1 ml of 1 M perchloric acid was added. cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay as described elsewhere (19Laburthe M.

Life Sci. 1985; 36: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), VIP1 receptors display a distinct pharmacological profile in humans and rats with regard to affinity of the naturally occurring peptide PHI. 4The human counterpart of PHI, peptide histidine methionineamide, is indistinguishable from PHI for binding to native (8Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and recombinant (A. Couvineau, C. Rouyer-Fessard, J.-J. Maoret, P. Gaudin, P. Nicole, and M. Laburthe, unpublished results) human and rat VIP1 receptors. Therefore, only PHI has been used in this study. This was confirmed when human and rat VIP1 receptor cDNAs were expressed in COS cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In contrast, VIP and other VIP-related peptides including PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and hGRF exhibited no significant difference in IC50 values for inhibiting 125I-VIP binding to COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding human and rat VIP1 receptors (Fig. 1). Taking advantage of the clear-cut phenotypic difference between rat and human VIP1 receptor with respect to PHI binding (IC50 values are 19 ± 4 and 1420 ± 340 nM, respectively), we investigated its genotypic basis by constructing rat/human VIP1 receptor chimerae. Eight chimerae were constructed consisting of substitution of increasingly large rat receptor fragments into the human receptor as described in Fig. 1. The ligand binding properties of these chimeric receptors were studied following transient expression in COS cells. All chimeric constructions displayed a very similar affinity for VIP as assessed by the measurement of IC50 for inhibition of 125I-VIP binding (Fig. 1). Likewise, VIP stimulated cAMP production with very similar EC50 (0.5-2 nM) in COS cells transfected with all chimeric constructions (not shown). These data demonstrated that construction of receptor chimerae did not alter the function of the VIP binding site. In order to characterize the phenotype of chimeric and wild-type receptors, we measured the IC50 of VIP and PHI in inhibiting 125I-VIP binding to receptors and calculated the ratio IC50 for PHI/IC50 for VIP which is referred to as P/V (Fig. 1). It appeared that two sets of chimeric receptors could be identified (Table I). One set consisted of receptor chimerae, R/H1 to R/H3, having P/V ratios >1,000 which were similar to the P/V ratio of the wild-type human receptor Hwt. A second set consisted of receptor chimerae, R/H4 to R/H8, having P/V ratios <100 which were similar to the P/V ratio of the wild-type rat receptor Rwt. These variations of P/V ratios were clearly related to changes in the IC50 values for PHI with no significant modification in the IC50 values for VIP (Fig. 1) as indicated above.Table IPeptide specificity of wild-type human (Hwt) and rat (Rwt) VIP1 receptors and the mutated chimeric receptor Q207H,G211A,M219V R/H3PeptidesConstructsHwtRwtQ207H,G211A, M219V R/H3IC50, nMVIP0.87 ± 0.140.52 ± 0.171.00 ± 0.11PACAP-271.05 ± 0.170.55 ± 0.121.12 ± 0.24PACAP-3810.00 ± 1.526.46 ± 0.9215.43 ± 1.02PHI1420 ± 34019 ± 428 ± 5hGRF1560 ± 4151267 ± 1701633 ± 136 Open table in a new tab These data supported the notion that the structural determinant responsible for the different phenotypes of rat and human receptors with regard to PHI binding lies within a receptor segment consisting of parts of the first extracellular loop and the third transmembrane domain. In accordance with a >80% sequence identity between rat and human VIP1 receptors (6Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 8Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), alignment in this region revealed very few different amino acid residues, e.g. Gln207, Gly211, and Met219 in the human receptor corresponding, respectively, to His208, Ala212, and Val220 in the rat receptor (Fig. 3). Further studies were conducted in order to determine which residues in this region were concerned with the selectivity toward PHI. For that purpose His208, Ala212, and Val220 in the R/H3 chimera were mutated individually into the corresponding residues in the human receptor, i.e. Gln, Gly, and Met, respectively. The P/V ratio was measured after expression of each of the mutated R/H3 chimerae into COS cells (Fig. 3). The three individual mutations Q207H R/H3, G211A R/H3, and M219V R/H3 did not modify the P/V ratios which were >1,000 as seen in the R/H3 chimera. It was therefore necessary to investigate all the combinations of possible mutations in the R/H3 chimera. Among double mutants, G211A,M219V R/H3 did not exhibit significant changes in the P/V ratio whereas Q207H,G211A R/H3 and Q207H,M219V R/H3 showed a significant decrease in P/V ratio, e.g. 500 ± 40 and 175 ± 50, respectively. However, the two P/V ratios remained significantly higher than that of the wild-type rat receptor Rwt (Fig. 2) emphasizing the need to construct the triple mutant Q207H,G211A,M219V R/H3. This triple mutant exhibited a P/V ratio which was not significantly different from that of Rwt (Fig. 3), indicating that all three amino acid residues were involved in the selective recognition of PHI. As a control, we verified that the triple mutation in the R/H3 chimera did not alter the binding of other VIP-related peptides, the affinity of which was similar in human and rat VIP1 receptors (Table I). In order to demonstrate that the three above identified amino acid residues are necessary and sufficient to ensure selectivity of rat and human VIP1 receptors toward PHI, triple mutants were generated from the wild-type receptors, e.g. Q207H,G211A,M219V human VIP1 receptor and H208Q, A212G,V220M rat VIP1 receptor. As shown in Fig. 2, the triple mutation in the human VIP1 receptor changed its phenotype into that of the wild-type rat receptor with respect to PHI recognition. Likewise the triple mutation in the rat VIP1 receptor changed its phenotype into that of the wild-type human receptor. In this paper we demonstrate that the different phenotype of human and rat VIP1 receptors with regard to PHI recognition is due to a genotypic change affecting three nonadjacent amino acid residues located in the first extracellular loop and third transmembrane domain. This is the first report regarding the VIP/secretin/parathyroid hormone family of receptors (11Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) in which the role of distinct amino acid residues in ligand selectivity is documented. The genotypic change affecting PHI recognition does not alter the affinity of receptors for VIP. In fact, previous work has demonstrated that the major determinant for VIP binding resides within the NH2-terminal extracellular domain which comprises several amino acids that are crucial for VIP binding and are highly conserved within the VIP/secretin family of G protein-coupled receptors (13Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In that respect, it is worth noting that the three amino acids involved in the selective recognition of PHI by rat and human VIP1 receptors are not conserved in this family of receptors (11Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A chimera in which the amino terminus of the rat secretin receptor had been replaced with that of the rat VIP1 receptor was previously shown to result in a biological responsiveness typical of the VIP receptor with regard to recognition of VIP versus secretin (15Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the selectivity toward secretin may reside in the NH2-terminal extracellular domain of the rat VIP1 receptor (15Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas the species selectivity of the VIP1 receptor toward PHI resides in the first extracellular loop and third transmembrane domain (this paper). It may thus be suggested that different receptor domains are critical for the selective recognition of VIP-related peptides by VIP1 receptors. This is in line with the fact that the genotypic difference between rat and human VIP1 receptors affects PHI recognition but does not result in significant change between the two species in the binding affinity of PACAP or GRF (Table I and Refs. 17Laburthe M. Amiranoff B. Boige N. Rouyer-Fessard C. Tatemoto K. Moroder L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 159: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Moroder L. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, and 23Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary data reported for the PACAP type I receptor, a receptor closely related to VIP and secretin receptors, indicate that its amino terminus functions as the major binding site for PACAP (24Cao Y.J. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but is not a major determinant for peptide selectivity of this receptor (28Svoboda, M., Van Rampelbergh, J., Gourlet, P., Waelbroeck, M., Robberecht, P., (1995) International Society for Neurochemistry Satellite Symposium: The VIP/PACAP Family of Neuropeptide Receptors, Osaka, Japan, July 1995 (abstr.).Google Scholar). Another issue in the interpretation of the data is the question of how three nonadjacent amino acid residues located in the first extracellular loop and third transmembrane domain of VIP1 receptors confer PHI selectivity. Is it due to an alteration of direct PHI-receptor interactions, to a local conformational change within that region of the receptor, or to a more global, long-range conformational change? This can be discussed in the light of data regarding all combinations of possible mutations of the three residues (see Fig. 3). Substituting single residues at each position in the critical R/H3 chimera does not alter PHI affinity, nor does the double mutant G211A,M219V. On the other hand, the two other double mutants exhibit an increase in the affinity for PHI but only the triple mutation Q207H,G211A,M219V restores the high affinity for PHI which is the typical phenotype of the wild-type rat receptor. One possible explanation of these data is that the three residues are required to maintain a local binding site conformation that participates in the affinity for PHI. In this hypothesis, each mutation alone does not modify the probability of attaining this conformation. This interpretation of the results would suggest that the side chains of the concerned residues are not likely to interact directly with PHI as, in that case, some effect of single substitutions would be expected. Consistent with this view is the fact that the glycine to alanine exchange can induce such a conformational modification of a protein domain (25Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). A strong argument against a more global, long-range conformational change of the VIP1 receptor is that the affinity for VIP and other VIP-related peptides including PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and hGRF is not modified by the triple mutation (see Table I) and that all chimeric receptors regardless of their affinity for PHI mediate similar VIP-stimulated cAMP production. Altogether, the present data and the few previous studies of structure-function relationship of the VIP1 receptor (12Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M.

Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) play a dominant role in the high affinity recognition of VIP (12Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) while secondary local domains such as the one evidenced in this work for PHI may contribute to selectivity toward natural peptide agonists of VIP. While the domains of VIP1 receptors which interact with VIP and VIP-related peptides are now emerging, the nature of the interactions still remains obscure. This is due in part to the absence of extensive study of the structure-function relationship of VIP. Of course, the same holds true for the structure-function relationship of VIP-related peptides, including PHI, with regard to their interaction with VIP1 receptors. In this context, it may be instrumental to consider the interaction of PHI with receptors of the VIP/secretin/parathyroid hormone family of receptors. At the present time, no specific PHI receptor has been characterized (2Laburthe M. Kitabgi P. Couvineau A. Amiranoff B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 106: 133-176Crossref Google Scholar, 4Laburthe M.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 333-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) or other members of this receptor family. In particular, PHI binds to VIP1 (see “Results”) but also VIP2 (7Lutz E.M. Sheward W.J. West K.M. Morrow J.A. Fink G. Hamar A.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) receptors. When comparing the interaction of PHI with human recombinant receptors, we observed that PHI has a higher affinity for VIP2 than for VIP1 receptors. 5A. Couvineau, C. Rouyer-Fessard, J.-J. Maoret, P. Gaudin, P. Nicole, and M. Laburthe, unpublished data. In that respect, with regard to PHI binding the human VIP2 receptor has a phenotype which resembles that of the rat VIP1 receptor. When considering the three amino acids involved in selectivity toward PHI in human and rat VIP1 receptors, it is particularly interesting to note that the human VIP2 receptor (9Svoboda M. Tastenoy M. Van Rampelbergh J. Goossens J.F. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) has a genotype more closely related to that of rat VIP1 receptor (6Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) than to human VIP1 receptor (8Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In particular, His208 and Val220 in rat VIP1 receptor are aligned with His193 and Leu205 in the human VIP2 receptor. This observation suggests that amino acid residues critical for the recognition of PHI by rat and human VIP1 receptors are also instrumental in VIP2 receptors. In summary, the present findings identify a receptor domain comprising three nonadjacent amino acids involved in the selective recognition of PHI by human and rat VIP1 receptors. They pinpoint for the first time the genotype to phenotype relationship for a pharmacological selectivity within the new subfamily of seven membrane spanning receptors to which belong VIP receptors. We thank Prof. S. Nagata for his kind gift of rat VIP1 receptor cDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2035397287,"The relaxase (TraI) of plasmid RP4 (IncPα) plays a key role in initiation and termination of transfer DNA replication during conjugative transmission of the plasmid. TraI functions as a DNA strand transferase that cleaves a unique phosphodiester bond at nic of the transfer origin. The cleavage reaction consists in a reversible transesterification that leads to transfer of the 5′ phosphoryl at nic to the hydroxyl group of TraI Tyr-22. Hence, cleavage results in the covalent attachment of TraI to the 5′ terminus of the plasmid strand destined for transfer. To investigate the protein's ability to function in a “second cleavage” reaction proposed to terminate rolling circle mode transfer DNA replication, single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the nic region were immobilized at their 3′ ends on magnetic beads and cleaved by TraI. The resulting covalent TraI-oligonucleotide adducts were active in the joining reaction but unable to cleave oligonucleotides containing an intact nic region, indicating that second cleavage probably requires a TraI dimer, since a monomer is insufficient. The covalently attached oligonucleotide determines the affinity of the relaxase for the 3′ terminus of the T-strand. To further the biochemical characterization of TraI-catalyzed reactions, we used specific TraI mutants, showing that amino acid residues in each relaxase motif are involved in substrate binding. To uncouple substrate binding and cleaving-joining, we applied partially biotinylated TraI mutant proteins that were immobilized to magnetic beads.

Bacterial conjugation is defined as the transmission of genetic material from a bacterium to another cell by a process requiring intimate cell contact. DNA is transmitted unidirectionally as a single strand in 5′ to 3′ polarity. The site of initiation lays within the origin of transfer (oriT) at the nic site, a phosphodiester group within a specific dinucleotide sequence subject to cleavage in the course to prepare the DNA for transfer. Proteins involved in this process belong to the DNA processing functions of a transfer system and one of the key enzymes catalyzing the cleavage reaction, known as relaxase, is a site- and strand-specific DNA strand transferase (for review articles, see 11Lanka E. Wilkins B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar and 16Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation of DNA processing has been studied intensively in vivo and in vitro using plasmids of the incompatibility group P as a model system (20Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H.

The generation of the single DNA strand to be transferred requires the assembly of a relaxosome, the initiation complex of DNA transmission. The complex nucleoprotein structure is formed in a cascade-like process, the first step of which is the binding of the TraJ protein to the 19-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)dsDNAdouble-stranded DNARCRrolling circle replicationssDNAsingle-stranded DNA. inverted sequence repetition in oriT (Fig. 1A). TraJ binds asymmetrically by recognizing a 10-bp palindromic sequence (srj) in the right half of the imperfect inverted repeat (32Ziegelin G. Fürste J.P. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11989-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second assembly step the relaxase (TraI) binds to TraJ·;srj probably by protein-protein interaction between TraI and TraJ and recognition of sri by TraI; sri consists of a 6-bp sequence in the nic region in between the right end of the 19-bp repeat and nic. The nic region was characterized by its necessity for cleavage at oriT and by its sequence conservation among distantly related conjugative DNA transfer systems, particularly by its similarity to the T-DNA border sequences of Ti and Ri plasmids (15Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The ternary complex of TraJ, TraI, and negatively supercoiled oriT DNA was sufficient to demonstrate site- and strand-specific cleavage at nic (17Pansegrau W. Balzer D. Kruft V. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87 (a): 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and covalent attachment of the 5′ moiety of the T-strand to TraI (17Pansegrau W. Balzer D. Kruft V.

Two coexisting forms of the complex were observed, containing oriT DNA cleaved and uncleaved, indicating the maintenance of a balanced equilibrium. Since the degree of the negative superhelicity of the input DNA was retained in the complexed, cleaved DNA, TraI was proposed to interact non-covalently with the 3′ end of the T-strand, holding the ends at nic of the T-strand tightly together. Two additional proteins encoded by the relaxase and leader operon, TraH and TraK, are known to participate in relaxosome formation and to influence cleavage at oriT. TraH, an acidic oligomeric protein, stabilizes relaxosomes by protein-protein interaction by forming a complex with both, TraJ and TraI (16Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TraH does not bind to DNA by itself. TraK, is a basic tetrameric protein, that interacts specifically with oriT by wrapping srk, a 180-bp region downstream of nic, around a core of TraK (33Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17279-17286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of TraK in vivo and in vitro increases the fraction of plasmid molecules that can be captured cleaved at nic (5Fürste J.P. Pansegrau W. Ziegelin G. Kröger M. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar; 29Waters V.L. Hirata K.H. Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Guiney D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The induction of additional supercoiling by the TraK·;srk structure may influence the local oriT topology in a way that helps to expose the nic region single-stranded facilitating interaction of TraI with its target site. These data are in agreement with the finding that TraI specifically cleaved and joined single-stranded nic region oligonucleotides (19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The TraI-mediated cleavage reaction at nic of oriT consists of a transesterification initiated by nucleophilic attack of the phosphodiester moiety at nic by the hydroxyl group of TraI tyrosine 22 (19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A new phosphodiester bond is formed between TraI tyrosine 22 and the deoxycytidyl-5′-phosphoryl at nic resulting in the covalent attachment of the protein to the DNA (Fig. 1, A and B); the second reaction product ends with a deoxyguanosyl residue carrying a free 3′ hydroxyl. The equilibrium between joined and cleaved products of single-stranded substrates in a TraI-mediated reaction indicates the reversibility of the reaction and suggests that the relaxase is not only involved in initiation of conjugative DNA transfer but also in termination. Currently, two versions of the DNA transmission mode are discussed: (i) unwinding of the cleaved strand, the T-strand, and transfer of just one unit length-equivalent to the plasmid, or (ii) unwinding of the T-strand in the presence of elongation at the free 3′ hydroxyl. The latter corresponds to a rolling circle type of replication (RCR) generating T-strands of greater than unit length. Hence, recircularization of a one unit lengthplasmid strand would require a second cut or direct reaction between the reoccurring oriT sequence and the 5′ bound TraI molecule to release a fully restored monomeric circular T-strand. The process is called “second cleavage” mechanism (31Wilkins B.M. Lanka E. Clewell D.B. Bacterial Conjugation. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 105Crossref Google Scholar). Genetic evidence for a RCR-like mechanism was recently presented for two plasmid systems, the conjugative plasmid F and the small mobilizable plasmid RSF1010 (6Gao Q. Luo Y. Deonier R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; 22Rao X.M. Meyer R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5958-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay system measures RecA-independent, intramolecular recombination at oriT sites during mobilization (4Erickson M.J. Meyer R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The gene A protein of phage φX174, acting in RCR as a cleaving-joining protein, provides an intriguing economic possibility of DNA strand transfer (10Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1992: 553Google Scholar). The gene A protein contains two tyrosines, interspaced by three amino acids, which alternate in catalyzing the cleaving-joining reaction (28van Mansfeld A.D.M. van Teeffelen H.A.A.M. Baas P.D. Jansz H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4229-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; 7Hanai R. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleaving-joining domain of TraI protein consists of at least three motifs: I, II, and III (Fig. 1B) (21Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (b): 2782-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 1Balzer D. Pansegrau W. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4285-4295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Motif I is thought to be involved in target binding, motifs I and III are part of the protein's active center. Active site characterization indicated that both relaxases, RP4 TraI and RSF1010 MobA, rely on only one active site tyrosine for DNA strand transfer (19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; 26Scherzinger E. Kruft V. Otto S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, one question to be answered is how many relaxase molecules are involved in one round of transfer? Here we report the mechanistic dissection of the relaxase catalyzed cleaving-joining reaction by the use of immobilized TraI protein. 3′-Biotinylated oligodeoxynucleotides and randomly biotinylated TraI and TraI mutant proteins were synthesized and were bound to magnetic beads via streptavidine. The compounds served to develop a novel assay system for studying the properties of relaxases, particularly to analyze target binding and catalytic activity in one and the same experiment. Immobilized oligonucleotides were applied to demonstrate that the monomeric form of relaxase is insufficient for second cleavage and hence for termination of conjugative transfer DNA replication. Implications for the mechanism of conjugative DNA processing and additional possible applications of the method will be discussed. TraI, TraJ, TraK, and mutant derivatives of TraI were purified as described previously (32Ziegelin G. Fürste J.P. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11989-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Biol.

Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purified by ion exchange chromatography using a PE TSK DEAE-NPR column (4.6 × 35 mm, Perkin-Elmer) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. In the following, the term “oligonucleotide” refers to oligodeoxyribonucleotides, unless stated otherwise. Oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ ends by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 68Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the second cleavage assay were: 28-mer, CTACTTCACCTATCCTGCCCGGCTGACG; 26-mer, CGGGTGGGCCTACTTCACCTATCCTG; 30-mer, CGGGTGGGCCTACTTCACCTATCCTGCCCG. The construction of the RP4 oriT-containing plasmid pJF142n, which is based on the vector plasmid pBR329, has been described previously (5Fürste J.P. Pansegrau W. Ziegelin G. Kröger M. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Superhelical form I plasmid DNA was isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation. The DNA was stabilized by extraction with phenol and chloroform. Prior to biotinylation, aliquots of TraI-preparations were subjected to gel filtration on Superose 12 using Pharmacia FPLC equipment. 1 mg of protein in a volume of 250 µl (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50% (w/v) glycerol) was loaded onto the column (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM sodium borate, pH 9.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.025% Brij 58). Gel filtration was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing TraI or TraI derivatives were adjusted to a final concentration of 50% glycerol in buffer B and stored at −20°C until use. For biotinylation, the protein (250 µg) was brought to a volume of 600 µl by addition of buffer B. Sodium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8.0, final concentration: 100 mM) and sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate (Calbiochem, 30 nmol) were added. Thus, the molar ratio of protein and biotinyl cross-linker was 0.1. Following incubation for 16 h at 4°C biotinylation was stopped by addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.6, final concentration: 100 mM), and the samples were concentrated to a final volume of 200 µl by spin filtration in a Centricon 30 cartridge (Amicon). The biotinylated protein was separated from by-products by gel filtration on Superose 12. The column was equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol) and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The pooled peak fractions (1 ml) were adjusted to 50% (w/v) glycerol in buffer C and stored at −20°C. Streptavidinconjugated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) were washed and resuspended in buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and biotinylated TraI derivatives were added at a ratio of 10 pmol of protein/6.7 × 106 beads in a final volume of 50 µl. Following incubation for 30 min at 25°C, the beads were washed three times and resuspended in buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). TraI-conjugated beads (equivalent to 10 pmol of TraI) were incubated with 0.5 pmol of the labeled oligonucleotide and 50 pmol of an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide in buffer E (30 min, 37°C, final volume: 20 µl). Following magnet separation, the supernatant was removed (non-binding fraction of oligonucleotides) and the beads were washed once in 20 µl of buffer E. The beads were then washed in buffer E + 1% SDS (20 µl, binding fraction of oligonucleotides). Supernatant and SDS wash were analyzed by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. The reaction products were quantified by autoradiography of the gels with the storage phosphor technology (9Johnston R.F. Pickett S.C. Barker D.L. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (28-mer, 300 pmol) were 3′-biotinylated by incubation with biotinyl-16-ddUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, 1 nmol) in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Amersham Corp., 10 units) and under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer of the enzyme (1 h, 37°C, final volume: 50 µl). The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA (pH 8.2, final concentration: 50 mM), and the oligonucleotides were ethanol-precipitated. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in buffer A (20 mM triethyl ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and separated from nonincorporated nucleotides by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Waters, Delta-Pak HPI, 3.9 × 150 mm) applying a linear gradient of acetonitrile (10-30% in buffer A, 1 ml/min, total volume 20 ml). Fractions containing the biotinyl-oligonucleotides (biotinyl-29-mer) were lyophilized, and the compounds were redissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA (final concentration: 2 µM). For coupling of biotinylated oligonucleotides, Dynabeads M-280 were washed twice and resuspended in the original volume of buffer D. The biotinylated oligonucleotide was added at a ratio of 40 pmol/1.34 × 108 beads in a final volume of 250 µl. Following incubation for 30 min at 25°C with shaking, the beads were washed three times in buffer E and resuspended in 200 µl of buffer E. Immobilized TraI-oligonucleotide adducts were formed by addition of 8 pmol of TraI (10 µl) and incubation for 1 h at 37°C with shaking. TraI-oligonucleotide adducts were captured by addition of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.2) to a final concentration of 50 mM. After 5 min, 5 M NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 M. The beads were washed two times in 200 µl buffer D. Aliquots (50 µl) were washed twice in buffer E and were resuspended in 25 µl of buffer E with or without MgCl2. Oligonucleotides (40 pmol) labeled with 32P at their 5′ ends were added (final volume: 50 µl), and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with shaking. Reactions were stopped by washing the beads three times in buffer D. Reaction products were released from the Dynabeads by incubation for 10 min at 90°C in 90% (w/v) formamide, 2 mM EDTA. Following magnet separation, the supernatants were directly applied to electrophoresis in a 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. Reaction products were quantified by autoradiography of gels with the storage phosphor technology (9Johnston R.F. Pickett S.C. Barker D.L. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). TraI is known to interact specifically with single-stranded oligonucleotides carrying the nic region (sri/nic) of the transfer origin (T-strand) (Fig. 1A). The reaction consists in the cleavage of the oriT oligonucleotide at nic by transesterification via the active-site tyrosine (Tyr-22) of TraI resulting in a covalent protein-oligonucleotide adduct. The remaining part of the oligonucleotide, the sri oligonucleotide carries a free terminal 3′ hydroxyl (19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine the first step of this interaction, recognition of sri and binding by TraI, we have developed an assay that involves immobilized protein, taking advantage of the use of magnetic beads as a matrix (Fig. 2). The set of substrates used in the binding assay consists of 5′-labeled oligonucleotides: the T-strand of oriT containing 15 nucleotides upstream of the nic site, carrying sri, and six nucleotides downstream; a T-strand oligonucleotide that was known to be inert to cleavage, containing a G → A transition at the −1 position of nic; the 15-mer cleavage product; and two non-cleavable substrates as controls (Fig. 3). Substrate oligonucleotides were incubated with the immobilized relaxase at a molar ratio of 0.05. Additionally, the assay mixtures contained a 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides over the labeled substrate oligonucleotide, resulting in an overall molar ratio of oligonucleotides and relaxase of about 5. The competitor oligonucleotide was included in the assay since TraI was found to have a considerable general affinity for ssDNA. This might be explained by the high pI (10.78) of the protein (20Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D. Helinski D.R. Schwab H. Stanisich V.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239 (a): 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To evaluate the enzymatic activity of immobilized TraI, the cleavage ability was checked. It was found that TraI attached to the beads was still perfectly active and specific, indicating that recognition and binding are unaffected by the chemical immobilization procedure (see Fig. 5, lane a).Fig. 3Oligonucleotides used in binding assays. The position of the cleavage site (nic) is marked by a wedge. A bracket indicates the extension of the region that is specifically recognized by TraI (sri). The sequence of the 21-mer wild type oligonucleotide corresponds to RP4 kb-coordinates 51.221-51.241 (GenBank accession number L27758; 20Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G.

Lanes a-g, following magnet separation, the supernatants were analyzed on a 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel; lanes h-n, the beads were then washed with buffer E containing 1% SDS and the resulting supernatant was analyzed on a 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The oligonucleotide cleaving-joining reaction mediated by the TraI relaxase is known to be an equilibrium reaction (17Pansegrau W. Balzer D. Kruft V. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87 (a): 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (b): 2782-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the process can be subdivided in at least three independent equilibria: (i) binding and release of the substrate oligonucleotide; (ii) cleaving and joining of the bound oligonucleotide and (iii) release and binding of the 5′ terminal moiety of the cleaved oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). To dissect these processes, we initially planned to omit Mg2+ ions from the reaction to prevent cleaving-joining and hence to study the binding equilibrium separately. However, when we omitted the Mg2+ ions, the characteristics of the oligonucleotide binding reaction changed considerably. Binding was not specific for sri/nic-containing oligonucleotides anymore (data not shown), suggesting that Mg2+ ions, which are not required for relaxosome formation (17Pansegrau W. Balzer D. Kruft V. Lurz R. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87 (a): 6555-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) are nevertheless involved in specific recognition of sri when it is offered in form of an oligonucleotide. In contrast, binding of the wild type 21-mer was highly specific in the presence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 4). Even a single nucleotide exchange at the nic −1 position (G → A) resulted in an at least 10-fold reduction of affinity (Fig. 4, second column). We therefore decided to study the binding reaction only in the presence of Mg2+, since it obviously provided a better approximation to the in vivo situation. The affinity of immobilized TraI to the oligonucleotides tested was highest for the wild type 21-mer of oriT (Fig. 4, first column). The TraI binding specificity for sri became obvious by comparing the 30-fold lower affinity of the control oligonucleotide (competitor) with that of the 21-mer wild type (Fig. 4, first and fifth columns). The complementary sequence of the 21-mer wild type binds 3-fold better to TraI than the competitor, which has a similar AT/GC content as the 21-mer of oriT (Fig. 4, fourth and fifth columns). The cleavage product, the 15-mer, of the TraI-catalyzed reaction that corresponds to the 3′ end of the T-strand also shows a rather low affinity for TraI (Fig. 4, third column), unless TraI is already attached covalently to the 5′ moiety of the T-strand (Fig. 4, first column). This 5-fold increased affinity for the 15-mer to the relaxase indicates that the protein-bound 5′ terminus of the T-strand plays an important role in the recognition/binding and probably in the adjustment of the 3′ end of the T-strand in the active center of the enzyme. The relaxase contains at least three motifs that are conserved among other relaxases and proteins predicted to possess relaxase activity (15Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; 8Ilyina T.V. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar; 21Pansegrau W.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4285-4295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The motifs arranged within the N-terminal protein portion form the cleaving-joining domain of the enzymes (Fig. 1B). Motif I belongs to the catalytic center, which contains the active-site tyrosine Tyr-22 (19Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2925-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (b): 2782-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of conserved residues of the motifs suggested participation of motifs II and III in binding of sri and catalysis of cleaving-joining, respectively (21Pansegrau W. Schröder W. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (b): 2782-2789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 1Balzer D. Pansegrau W. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4285-4295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of each of the motifs to sri binding, we examined a selected set of immobilized TraI mutant proteins with the binding assay (Figs. 1B, 2, 5, and 6A). Each of the motifs contains at least one crucial residue, which, if substituted, reduces the TraI affinity for sri binding strongly, at least 10-fold, i.e., Y22L, H70S, S74A, and H116S (Fig. 5, lanes b/i, c/j, d/k, and g/n), indicating that these residues are indeed involved in recognition and b"

However, this enzyme does not require flavin or nicotinamide cofactors for its cyclase activity. The 643-amino acid native enzyme contains three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, Asn-Xaa-Thr or Asn-Xaa-Ser. The cDNA and genomic clones of versicolorin B synthase were isolated by screening the respective libraries with random-primed DNA probes generated from an exact copy of an internal vbs sequence. This probe was created through polymerase chain reaction by using nondegenerate polymerase chain reaction primers derived from the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments of the enzyme. The 1985-base genomic vbs DNA sequence is interrupted by one intron of 53 nucleotides. Southern blotting, nucleotide sequencing, and detailed restriction mapping of the vbs-containing genomic clones revealed the presence of omtA, a methyltransferase active in the biosynthesis, 3.3 kilobases upstream of vbs and oriented in the opposite direction from vbs. The presence of omtA in close proximity to vbs supports the theory that the genes encoding the aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes in A. parasiticus are clustered.

INTRODUCTIONAflatoxin B1 (see Scheme I, 1), the principal member of the aflatoxin family, is one of the most potent mycotoxins known to man. The imperfect fungi Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus nomius produce aflatoxins, and these fungi are known to infect corn, grains, and nuts during their growth and during storage leading to the introduction of aflatoxin into primary foodstuffs (2Lillehoj E.B.

A direct connection between DNA damage and the incidence of human cancer has been established to originate at mutational hot spots of the p53 gene, a tumor suppressor gene whose altered sequence has been associated with approximately 50% of all human cancers (15Hollstein M.

Although the formation of polyketide natural products is initiated normally by acetate, a specialized fatty acid synthase apparently acts in the case of aflatoxin to generate a six-carbon hexanoyl starter unit. This primer is homologated by successive malonyl condensations to give, after intramolecular aldol condensation, cyclization, and oxidation, norsolorinic acid (3) (19Brobst S.W. Townsend C.A. Can. J.

The absolute configuration installed in this cyclase-catalyzed step is preserved in the bisfuran throughout the remainder of the biosynthetic pathway to AFB1.

The localization of two genes, a ketoreductase (nor-1) acting immediately after the formation of norsolorinic acid (3) and ver-1, whose gene product participates in the oxidative cleavage of versicolorin A (9), has been determined by gene disruption and complementation (48Skory G.D.

Combined with the cloning of one of the purified O-methyltransferases (omtA), the direct linkage of these genes has been determined to be within 45 kb of one another (see Fig. 5) (51Yu J. Chang P.-K.

In this paper we describe the isolation of the gene encoding versicolorin B synthase (vbs) from both cDNA and gDNA libraries derived from A. parasiticus. Comparison of the sequences reveals the presence of a single intron in the latter. Translation of the mature mRNA gives a protein of 70,226 Da, in modest agreement with the 78-kDa apparent molecular mass of wild-type VBS as judged by its relative electrophoretic mobility.2 Alignment of the translated amino acid sequence of VBS with protein sequences compiled in protein data bases revealed a marked homology to several flavin-dependent oxidases and dehydrogenases. This relationship was unexpected because VBS does not catalyze a redox reaction. Finally, mapping of vbs gDNA clones has allowed the locus of this gene to be established about 3.3 kb upstream of omtA and separated from it by an apparent cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 3R. E. Minto and C. A. Townsend, unpublished results. approximately 1400 bp in length of unknown function. These findings expand the experimentally determined dimensions of the apparent aflatoxin gene cluster and unambiguously define the function and location of the gene encoding versicolorin B synthase.Fig. 5Further characterization of the A. parasiticus partial gene cluster for the aflatoxin B1 biosynthetic pathway. a, recently published gene cluster of AFB1 biosynthetic genes of approximately 60 kb. b, lambda clone λ62b, approximately 15 kb, extending the existing AFB1 gene cluster to include versicolorin B synthase (vbs), and an apparent cytochrome P450 by amino acid homology of the translated mRNA sequence. c, lambda clone λ52a, approximately 18 kb, where vbs is truncated at the 5′ end (·).

VBS was purified to homogeneity from A. parasiticus SU-1 (ATCC 56775) by methods established in this laboratory,2 but failed to give amino-terminal sequence data by automated methods. Although homogenous enzyme was submitted for amino acid sequence analysis (250 pmol), amino acid intensities corresponding to ≤10 pmol of enzyme were observed, suggesting that the amino terminus of the native protein was post-translationally modified. To circumvent this problem, the protein was digested with Lys-C endopeptidase and two of approximately 20 VBS peptide fragments were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC. These two peptide fragments both gave reproducible amino acid sequence data and credible stoichiometry (Fig. 1).The two peptide sequences were used to design seven oligonucleotide probes for hybridization and PCR experiments. The degeneracy of these probes was minimized by comparing codon usage in A. nidulans and A. niger structural genes to compile a table of codon biases.4 Plaque hybridization experiments did not provide reproducible results using the partially degenerate probes 7NC, 8NC, 9NC, 10C, 13C, 14C, and 15C synthesized by automated methods (Fig. 1). However, PCR-generated nondegenerate probes were later substituted for these degenerate probes in the hybridization experiments, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to lead to the successful cloning of VBS.A vbs cDNA gene fragment, obtained from the reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR, was amplified using PCR primers 8NC and 10C and estimated to be approximately 750 bp in length. No PCR product was obtained using any other primer combination from the set of primers shown in Fig. 1. PCR amplification of the approximately 750-bp fragment was observed using both 48- and 60-h mRNA. This gene fragment was subcloned into pBluescriptII SK(−) generating clones with the insert oriented in both directions (pRPF1-17C and pRPF1-13NC). Single-stranded DNA was prepared by infecting the plasmid-borne XL1-Blue cells with R408 helper phage. Direct sequencing was performed using dideoxy sequencing methods in both directions using clones containing inserts in opposite orientations. Partial nucleotide sequences from the coding (pRPF1-17C) and the noncoding strands (pRPF1-13NC) can be seen in Fig. 4. Translation of the two nucleotide sequences of both pRPF1-17C and pRPF1-13NC concurred with the amino acid sequence data obtained from each of the two peptide fragments isolated from the Lys-C endopeptidase treatment of VBS (Fig. 4, pRPF1-13NC, and pRPF1-17C nucleotide sequences).From these nucleotide sequences, nondegenerate primers 21C and 22NC were prepared to serve as oligonucleotide primers for PCR experiments with both the gDNA and cDNA libraries (Fig. 4). A 615-bp internal fragment was successfully amplified by PCR from both the cDNA and gDNA libraries. This PCR fragment was used to generate oligonucleotide probes for plaque hybridizations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Further PCR analysis of the gDNA and cDNA clones with primers 8NC and 10C afforded two discrete gene products from each set of clones approximately 800 and 750 bp in length, respectively. The approximately 50-bp difference between the PCR fragments derived from cDNA and gDNA templates was attributed to the presence of an intron within the gene fragment, which was later verified by DNA sequence comparison. From the lambda Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library prepared from 48-h A. parasiticus mRNA, approximately 150,000 plaques were screened. Sixteen positive cDNA clones were isolated and verified to be identical through restriction mapping. Approximately 150,000 plaques were screened from the lambda FixII gDNA library of A. parasiticus yielding six positive gDNA clones. Each was verified to contain vbs by PCR analysis, restriction mapping, Southern analysis, and/or nucleotide sequencing.Further investigations were undertaken with the genomic lambda clones, which successfully assigned the orientation of vbs and a probable cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (cyp) with respect to earlier portions of the putative aflatoxin gene cluster. Southern and PCR analysis positively identified the presence of omtA in two clones (λ56a and λ62b) and the absence of ver1 in all of the isolated gDNA clones. Although the vbs gene was verified by PCR to be present in each clone following library screening, subsequent examinations attested to a significant truncation of the 5′ terminus of vbs in two clones (λ52a and λ55c). Together, the genomic clones λ52a and λ62b contained approximately 30 kb of overlapping genomic sequence, as measured by restriction mapping (Fig. 5). The distance between vbs and omtA was measured by PCR and verified by DNA sequence analysis. Primer combinations Omt1-2NC + 56NC and Omt1-4NC + 56NC (Table II) gave 2.78- and 4.35-kb PCR products, respectively, which are in agreement with the known 1.49-kb separation between the Omt1 primers (66Yu J. Cary J.W. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Keller N.P. Chu F.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3564-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Employing the four omtA primers (Table I., Table II) of known orientations with primer 56NC (0.56 kb upstream of vbs), vbs and omtA were determined to be located within approximately 3.3 kb of each other, in opposite orientations (Fig. 5). Nucleotide sequence data from a 1.3-kb XbaI/KpnI genomic DNA fragment overlapping with the reported 5′ upstream region of omtA (J. Yu, 1993,) and an apparent cytochrome P450 monoxygenase,3 approximately 1400 bp in length, established the clustered nature of the three genes.The genomic nucleotide sequence of versicolorin B synthase has been determined and is contained within 2610 bp of phage clone λ62b. The transcribed cDNA clone possessed a continuous open reading frame of 1932 bp, as well as 20 bp of 5′-nontranslated and 161 bp of 3′-nontranslated regions. Comparison of the combined cDNA and genomic DNA sequences revealed that the coding region is interrupted by a single 53-bp intron (Fig. 6). The intervening sequence, which has been observed in other eukaryotic genes, shared the consensus regions 5′-(exon)/GTARGY … NRCTRAN … YAG/(exon)-3′ (68Boel E. Hansen M.T. Hjort I. Hpegh I. Fiil N.P.

https://openalex.org/W2075402058,"Abstract The fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis, which causes the major root disease of wheat known as “take-all,” can metabolize linoleic acid to (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. The enzyme linoleate 8-dioxygenase abstracts hydrogen and introduces molecular oxygen in an antarafacial way at C-8. We have now purified the enzyme 1000-fold to a specific activity of 1.8 μmol/min/mg of protein. Acetone powder of mycelia of G. graminis was subjected to extraction and ammonium sulfate precipitation with solubilization. The 8-dioxygenase was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography, and immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The active enzyme appeared to consist of four subunits since the active enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 520 kDa determined by gel filtration, while SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a protein band of 130 kDa. Spectroscopy indicated the presence of heme. The characteristic pyridine ferrohemochrome α-band was found at 557 nm and the β-band at 525 nm. The purified protein showed an absorption maximum at 408 nm (γ, Soret). The absorption maximum shifted to 429 nm after reduction with dithionite and to 421 nm after treatment of the reduced enzyme with carbon monoxide. BW A4C, a hydroxamic acid derivative, inhibited the enzyme by >90% at 10 μM. The pH optimum was 7.2-7.4, the isoelectric point was 5.2 by chromatofocusing, and the Km values were 8 μM for linoleic acid and 30 μM for oxygen. We conclude that linoleate 8-dioxygenase appears to be a tetrameric hemoprotein distinct from other fatty-acid dioxygenases."

https://openalex.org/W1993441524,"We showed previously that type I interferon causes a down-regulation of mitochondrial gene expression. We show here that IFN treatment leads to functional impairment of mitochondria. Western blot analysis indicated that interferon treatment reduces the steady-state level of cytochrome <i>b</i> in murine L-929 cells. Interferon produced a reduction in cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase and NADH-cytochrome <i>c</i> reductase activities of isolated mitochondria as well as inhibiting electron transport in isolated mitochondria and in intact cells. Several mitochondrial mRNAs are affected by interferon treatment in human Daudi lymphoblastoid cells, which are highly sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of interferon. Electron transport in Daudi cells was also inhibited by interferon both in intact cells and isolated mitochondria with a dose response identical to that for the antiproliferative response. In contrast, a Daudi strain resistant to the antiproliferative effects of interferon showed no down-regulation of mRNA expression and no inhibition of electron transport. Possibly as a consequence of the inhibitory effect on mitochondrial gene expression, treatment with interferon causes a reduction in cellular ATP levels. The inhibition of cellular growth by interferon may thus be partly a consequence of a reduction in cellular ATP levels."

All of these proteins are monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular mass of ~80 kDa (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 31Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Jolles J. Mazurier J. Schoertger F. Legrand D. Spik G. Montreuil J. Jolles P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 659-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of lactoferrin (32Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and transferrin (33Lindley P.F. Mydin A. Sarra R. Watson J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5804-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have been precisely defined by x-ray crystallographic analysis. The proteins are folded into two globular lobes corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein. This bilobal structure, with ~40% conservation between the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves, is thought to have evolved by intragenic duplication from a common ancestral gene (34Williams J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 394-397Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Each of these lobes can reversibly bind iron with high affinity and with the concomitant binding of an anion, usually carbonate (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The amino acids required for iron-binding by lactoferrin are highly conserved between members of the transferrin family (35Baker E.N. Lindley P.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Specifically, the iron atom in each lobe of lactoferrin is coordinated to Asp-61, Tyr-93, Tyr-193, and His-254 in the NH2-terminal lobe and the corresponding Asp-396, Tyr-436, Tyr-529, and His-598 in the COOH-terminal lobe (32Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, despite their structural similarities, lactoferrin displays much more avid iron-binding properties than its serum counterpart, transferrin. In particular, the release of iron from lactoferrin displays greater pH stability than does transferrin, the latter releasing iron over a pH of 6-4, while the former releases iron over a pH of 4-2 (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is likely that the unique iron-binding properties of lactoferrin contribute to some of the diverse functional activities proposed for this protein.We have previously reported the high level production and characterization of recombinant human lactoferrin in the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus awamori (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was shown to be indistinguishable from human breast milk lactoferrin by several criteria including iron and receptor binding and antimicrobial activity. Hence, the availability of this expression system has now enabled the production of lactoferrin mutants in sufficient quantities to address the structure/function role of this protein.In the present study, the contribution of the two-lobe structure of lactoferrin to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein were addressed. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human lactoferrin cDNA was used to selectively mutate the two tyrosine residues involved in iron binding in either or both halves of the protein. The resulting three iron binding-defective mutants were expressed and purified from A. awamori (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Iron-binding analysis using 59FeCl3 confirmed that mutation of the two tyrosine residues, involved in iron binding in either lobe, resulted in selective loss of iron binding to the mutated lobe. In addition, pH-dependent iron release studies demonstrated a differential iron-binding stability of the two halves of lactoferrin, the NH2-terminal lobe being much more acid-labile than the COOH-terminal lobe. More importantly, we show that a functional iron-binding COOH-terminal lobe is necessary for the pH stability of iron binding to the NH2-terminal lobe which is characteristic of wild-type lactoferrin. These results support the conclusion that cooperative interactions between the two lobes of lactoferrin contribute to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to investigate the contribution of the bilobal structure of lactoferrin to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein. The two tyrosines involved in iron binding in either or both lobes of lactoferrin were mutated to corresponding alanine residues in order to produce three iron binding-defective mutants. These mutants were expressed and purified from A. awamori as described previously for the wild-type protein (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The size, immunoreactivity, and functional activity of these mutants, as determined by silver stain, Western immunoblotting, and enteric receptor binding analysis were similar to wild-type recombinant human lactoferrin, indicating that the amino acid substitutions had no adverse effect on the protein. Iron saturation analysis using 59FeCl3 showed that while the mutant with an intact COOH-terminal iron-binding lobe saturated at the expected 1:1 ratio of iron to protein, the mutant with an intact NH2-terminal iron-binding function consistently saturated at less than 1:1, suggesting a reduced stability of iron binding to this mutant at pH 7.0. In addition, iron-binding studies demonstrated that mutation of the tyrosine residues in both lobes effectively disrupted the iron-binding capacity of the complete protein.Interestingly, pH-dependent iron release studies from the nonmutated lobes showed that the stability of iron binding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of lactoferrin were dissimilar. The release of iron from the mutant containing an intact COOH-terminal iron-binding function was similar to that observed for the native lactoferrin. In contrast, the mutant with an intact NH2-terminal iron-binding site was much more acid-labile, releasing all of its bound iron between a pH of 7 and 5. Hence, despite the overall structural homology between these two lobes (~40%), we demonstrate that the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of lactoferrin differ in their pH stability of iron binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functional iron-binding COOH-terminal lobe is required to impart the iron-binding stability to the NH2-terminal lobe which is characteristic of the wild-type protein.The nonequivalence of iron binding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal lobes of lactoferrin has been reported previously (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 41Day C.L. Stowell K.M. Baker E.N. Tweedie J.W. J. Biol.

Tweedie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13857-13862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a proteolytically derived COOH-terminal fragment from bovine lactoferrin (42Shimazaki K.-I. Tanaka T. Kon H. Oota K. Kawaguchi A. Maki Y. Sato T. J. Dairy Sci. 1993; 76: 946-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown a similar disparity in pH dependence of iron binding as reported in this study. However, while the previous reports did indicate that the COOH-terminal lobe, or part thereof, was required to stabilize the NH2-terminal lobe iron-binding function, these studies were limited as it remained to be determined whether the structural presence of the COOH-terminal lobe or a functional COOH-terminal iron-binding activity was required for stabilization of iron binding to the NH2-terminal lobe. In the present report, we extend these studies and show that cooperative interactions, driven primarily by a functional COOH-terminal lobe are necessary for iron-binding stabilization.The bias for selection of a bilobal structure in the evolution of the transferrin family is unknown. The studies described here provide a functional rationale for this selection in the case of lactoferrin. We show that the evolution of a two-lobe structure has endowed lactoferrin with unique iron-binding properties which are likely to impinge on the unique functional activity of this protein. Interestingly, transferrin differs from lactoferrin in that it has been shown that the pH-dependent iron-release properties of this protein and a proteolytically derived NH2-terminal fragment are similar (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 43Lineback-Zins J. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 708-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While inconclusive, these findings may suggest that a lack of cooperativity between the two lobes of transferrin may be a critical factor accounting for the characteristically weaker iron-binding stability of this protein. Taken together with the studies described herein, we suggest that the different iron-binding properties of lactoferrin and transferrin may be due, at least in part, to the evolution of a carboxyl-terminal iron-binding lobe of lactoferrin that has increased acid stability and functions cooperatively with the NH2-terminal lobe to confer a pH stability to this lobe that is characteristic of the bilobal protein.

All of these proteins are monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular mass of ~80 kDa (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and transferrin (33Lindley P.F. Mydin A. Sarra R. Watson J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5804-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have been precisely defined by x-ray crystallographic analysis. The proteins are folded into two globular lobes corresponding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein. This bilobal structure, with ~40% conservation between the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves, is thought to have evolved by intragenic duplication from a common ancestral gene (34Williams J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 394-397Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Each of these lobes can reversibly bind iron with high affinity and with the concomitant binding of an anion, usually carbonate (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The amino acids required for iron-binding by lactoferrin are highly conserved between members of the transferrin family (35Baker E.N. Lindley P.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Specifically, the iron atom in each lobe of lactoferrin is coordinated to Asp-61, Tyr-93, Tyr-193, and His-254 in the NH2-terminal lobe and the corresponding Asp-396, Tyr-436, Tyr-529, and His-598 in the COOH-terminal lobe (32Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, despite their structural similarities, lactoferrin displays much more avid iron-binding properties than its serum counterpart, transferrin. In particular, the release of iron from lactoferrin displays greater pH stability than does transferrin, the latter releasing iron over a pH of 6-4, while the former releases iron over a pH of 4-2 (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is likely that the unique iron-binding properties of lactoferrin contribute to some of the diverse functional activities proposed for this protein.We have previously reported the high level production and characterization of recombinant human lactoferrin in the filamentous fungus, Aspergillus awamori (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was shown to be indistinguishable from human breast milk lactoferrin by several criteria including iron and receptor binding and antimicrobial activity. Hence, the availability of this expression system has now enabled the production of lactoferrin mutants in sufficient quantities to address the structure/function role of this protein.In the present study, the contribution of the two-lobe structure of lactoferrin to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein were addressed. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human lactoferrin cDNA was used to selectively mutate the two tyrosine residues involved in iron binding in either or both halves of the protein. The resulting three iron binding-defective mutants were expressed and purified from A. awamori (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Iron-binding analysis using 59FeCl3 confirmed that mutation of the two tyrosine residues, involved in iron binding in either lobe, resulted in selective loss of iron binding to the mutated lobe. In addition, pH-dependent iron release studies demonstrated a differential iron-binding stability of the two halves of lactoferrin, the NH2-terminal lobe being much more acid-labile than the COOH-terminal lobe. More importantly, we show that a functional iron-binding COOH-terminal lobe is necessary for the pH stability of iron binding to the NH2-terminal lobe which is characteristic of wild-type lactoferrin. These results support the conclusion that cooperative interactions between the two lobes of lactoferrin contribute to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein. Lactoferrin is a member of the transferrin family of non-heme iron-binding glycoproteins (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) which includes transferrin, the major iron-transport protein in blood (2MacGillivray R.T.A. Mendez E. Shewale J.G. Sinha S.K.

DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to investigate the contribution of the bilobal structure of lactoferrin to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein. The two tyrosines involved in iron binding in either or both lobes of lactoferrin were mutated to corresponding alanine residues in order to produce three iron binding-defective mutants. These mutants were expressed and purified from A. awamori as described previously for the wild-type protein (17Ward P.P. Piddington C.S. Cunningham G.A. Zhou X. Wyatt R.D. Conneely O.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The size, immunoreactivity, and functional activity of these mutants, as determined by silver stain, Western immunoblotting, and enteric receptor binding analysis were similar to wild-type recombinant human lactoferrin, indicating that the amino acid substitutions had no adverse effect on the protein. Iron saturation analysis using 59FeCl3 showed that while the mutant with an intact COOH-terminal iron-binding lobe saturated at the expected 1:1 ratio of iron to protein, the mutant with an intact NH2-terminal iron-binding function consistently saturated at less than 1:1, suggesting a reduced stability of iron binding to this mutant at pH 7.0. In addition, iron-binding studies demonstrated that mutation of the tyrosine residues in both lobes effectively disrupted the iron-binding capacity of the complete protein.Interestingly, pH-dependent iron release studies from the nonmutated lobes showed that the stability of iron binding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of lactoferrin were dissimilar. The release of iron from the mutant containing an intact COOH-terminal iron-binding function was similar to that observed for the native lactoferrin. In contrast, the mutant with an intact NH2-terminal iron-binding site was much more acid-labile, releasing all of its bound iron between a pH of 7 and 5. Hence, despite the overall structural homology between these two lobes (~40%), we demonstrate that the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of lactoferrin differ in their pH stability of iron binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a functional iron-binding COOH-terminal lobe is required to impart the iron-binding stability to the NH2-terminal lobe which is characteristic of the wild-type protein.The nonequivalence of iron binding to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal lobes of lactoferrin has been reported previously (36Mazurier J.

Tanaka T. Kon H. Oota K. Kawaguchi A. Maki Y. Sato T. J. Dairy Sci. 1993; 76: 946-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown a similar disparity in pH dependence of iron binding as reported in this study. However, while the previous reports did indicate that the COOH-terminal lobe, or part thereof, was required to stabilize the NH2-terminal lobe iron-binding function, these studies were limited as it remained to be determined whether the structural presence of the COOH-terminal lobe or a functional COOH-terminal iron-binding activity was required for stabilization of iron binding to the NH2-terminal lobe. In the present report, we extend these studies and show that cooperative interactions, driven primarily by a functional COOH-terminal lobe are necessary for iron-binding stabilization.The bias for selection of a bilobal structure in the evolution of the transferrin family is unknown. The studies described here provide a functional rationale for this selection in the case of lactoferrin. We show that the evolution of a two-lobe structure has endowed lactoferrin with unique iron-binding properties which are likely to impinge on the unique functional activity of this protein. Interestingly, transferrin differs from lactoferrin in that it has been shown that the pH-dependent iron-release properties of this protein and a proteolytically derived NH2-terminal fragment are similar (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 43Lineback-Zins J. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 708-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While inconclusive, these findings may suggest that a lack of cooperativity between the two lobes of transferrin may be a critical factor accounting for the characteristically weaker iron-binding stability of this protein. Taken together with the studies described herein, we suggest that the different iron-binding properties of lactoferrin and transferrin may be due, at least in part, to the evolution of a carboxyl-terminal iron-binding lobe of lactoferrin that has increased acid stability and functions cooperatively with the NH2-terminal lobe to confer a pH stability to this lobe that is characteristic of the bilobal protein. In the present study, we have used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to investigate the contribution of the bilobal structure of lactoferrin to the unique iron-binding properties of this protein. The two tyrosines involved in iron binding in either or both lobes of lactoferrin were mutated to corresponding alanine residues in order to produce three iron binding-defective mutants.

However, while the previous reports did indicate that the COOH-terminal lobe, or part thereof, was required to stabilize the NH2-terminal lobe iron-binding function, these studies were limited as it remained to be determined whether the structural presence of the COOH-terminal lobe or a functional COOH-terminal iron-binding activity was required for stabilization of iron binding to the NH2-terminal lobe. In the present report, we extend these studies and show that cooperative interactions, driven primarily by a functional COOH-terminal lobe are necessary for iron-binding stabilization. The bias for selection of a bilobal structure in the evolution of the transferrin family is unknown. The studies described here provide a functional rationale for this selection in the case of lactoferrin. We show that the evolution of a two-lobe structure has endowed lactoferrin with unique iron-binding properties which are likely to impinge on the unique functional activity of this protein. Interestingly, transferrin differs from lactoferrin in that it has been shown that the pH-dependent iron-release properties of this protein and a proteolytically derived NH2-terminal fragment are similar (36Mazurier J. Spik G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 629: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 43Lineback-Zins J. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 708-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While inconclusive, these findings may suggest that a lack of cooperativity between the two lobes of transferrin may be a critical factor accounting for the characteristically weaker iron-binding stability of this protein. Taken together with the studies described herein, we suggest that the different iron-binding properties of lactoferrin and transferrin may be due, at least in part, to the evolution of a carboxyl-terminal iron-binding lobe of lactoferrin that has increased acid stability and functions cooperatively with the NH2-terminal lobe to confer a pH stability to this lobe that is characteristic of the bilobal protein."

The family of compounds included 3′ADP, 3′ATP, 2′-deoxy-3′ADP, 2′-deoxy-3′ATP, 2′,5′-dideoxy-3′ADP, and 2′,5′-dideoxy-3′ATP. Potency as inhibitors of adenylyl cyclases followed the order: 3′-mono- < 3′-di- < 3′-triphosphate and adenosine (Ado) < 2′-d-Ado < 2′,5′-dd-Ado derivatives, with 2′,5′-dideoxy-3′ATP exhibiting an IC50 of ∼40 nM. This order was maintained with purified and recombinant forms of the type I enzyme. The nucleoside 3′-phosphates caused noncompetitive inhibition of the type I adenylyl cyclase from bovine brain, consistent with inhibition via the P-site. Inhibition was not due to hydrolytic products because this was minimal and inhibition kinetics by inorganic polyphosphates were inconsistent with those caused by the nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates. Only 3′ATP underwent cation-catalyzed, nonenzymatic hydrolysis, with the primary product being 2′:3′-cAMP. Because 3′-ADP and 3′-ATP are naturally occurring, this class of compounds may physiologically regulate adenylyl cyclases and possibly other enzymes, mediating responses that include a reduction in 3′:5′-cAMP levels and consequent reductions in protein kinase A-activated pathways.

Regulation of this pathway can be achieved through changes in the activities of 3′:5′-cAMP-phosphodiesterases (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Google Scholar), 3′:5′-cAMP-dependent protein kinases (2Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Google Scholar), or adenylyl cyclases. Adenylyl cyclase is a family of membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the formation of 3′:5′-cAMP from 5′ATP and is regulated by numerous neurotransmitters and hormones via cell surface receptors and guanine nucleotide-dependent regulatory proteins (G-proteins). In an isozyme-dependent manner, enzyme activity is also regulated directly, by forskolin, by Ca2+/calmodulin, and by certain adenosine derivatives via a site that is distinct from the catalytic site. Whereas numerous drugs have been developed that act on the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, those that act directly on adenylyl cyclases have been less well explored; the main class of such pharmacological agents comprises forskolin and its analogs (3De Souza N.J.

Although the biology and biochemistry of nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates are essentially unexplored in eukaryotic systems, inhibition of adenylyl cyclases by this class of compound may well imply roles as intracellular regulators of this transmembrane signaling system. Both detergent-solubilized and particulate preparations of adenylyl cyclase from rat and bovine brains were prepared and assayed as described previously (8Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D.

Bovine brain adenylyl cyclase was purified as described by Pfeuffer et al. (18Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3675-3679Google Scholar). Inhibition kinetics were determined on enzyme assayed with concentrations of divalent cation fixed in excess of the 5′ATP concentration as described previously (19Garbers D.L. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8449-8456Google Scholar). Nucleotides were quantified after HPLC as areas under peaks determined with a Waters 996 photo-diode array detector and the accompanying Millennium software (v.2.10). Chromatography was on a DEAE-5PW column (Altex, 5 µm, 7.5 × 75 mm) developed with sequential step gradients of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, to separate the nucleoside 3′-mono-, 3′-di-, and 3′-triphosphates and 2′:3′-cAMP and 3′:5′-cAMP. Recombinant type I enzyme was generously supplied by Drs. R.Taussig and A. G. Gilman. Membranes and membrane extracts were from fall army worm ovarian (Sf9) cells infected with a type I adenylyl cyclase encoding baculovirus. THF was distilled from benzophenone ketyl before use. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AC250 at 250 MHz for proton spectra and at 101 MHz for 31P spectra, with a 85% solution of H3PO4 as external standard. FAB mass spectra were recorded with a glycerol matrix. To a suspension of 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine 1a (20Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A.

After stirring for 5 min, 2,2,2-tribromoethyl phosphoromorpholinochloridate 2 (2.25 g, 5 mmol) was added, and stirring was continued for 1.5 h. The mixture was then concentrated in vacuo, diluted with EtOAc (30 ml), quenched with water (60 ml), and then extracted with EtOAc (30 ml × 2). The combined organic layers were washed with a saturated solution of NaCl, were dried over Na2SO4, and then were evaporated to give a gum.

The reaction mixture was then centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was evaporated in vacuo and purified by QAE-Sephadex (HCO−3 form) with a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (0.01-0.4 M). The appropriate fractions were lyophilized and then coevaporated several times with methanol, yielding 1.16 mmol (77%) of 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine 3′-triphosphate4a. The nucleotide 4a was isolated as its sodium salt by the addition of 1 M sodium iodide in acetone to a methanol solution of the triethylammonium nucleotide.

Wreesmann C.T.J. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3635-3649Google Scholar, 30den Hartog J.A.J. Lawson M.P. de Jong E.W.P. van Boom J.H. Recl. Trav. Chim.

Unfortunately, such a procedure cannot be applied when the base of the nucleotide is adenine, the 6-amino group being more reactive toward phosphorylating agents than is the 3′-hydroxyl of the nucleoside moiety (32Charubala R. Pfleiderer W. Heterocycles (Tokyo). 1981; 15: 761-776Google Scholar, 33Uchiyama M. Aso Y. Noyori R. Hayakawa Y. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 373-379Google Scholar). Recently Uchiyama et al. (33Uchiyama M. Aso Y. Noyori R. Hayakawa Y. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 373-379Google Scholar) reported that a facile 3′-O-phosphorylation of N-unprotected nucleosides could be achieved via magnesium alkoxide formation. We wish to report here that sequential treatment of N-unprotected 2′-deoxyadenosine derivatives 1 (20Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 1453-1460Google Scholar, 21Ti G.S. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 1316-1320Google Scholar) with an equimolar amount of tert-butylmagnesium chloride and tribromoethyl phosphoromorpholinochloridate 2 (34van Boom J.H. Crea R. Luyten W.C. Vink A.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1975; 32: 2779-2782Google Scholar) in THF at 20°C afforded the phosphotriesters 3 in good yields (57 and 82%) (Scheme 1). The phosphotriester derivative 3a was reacted with bis-(tri-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate in the presence of activated zinc (22van Boom J.H. Burgers P.M.J. van der Marel G.A. Verdegaal C.H.M. Wille G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1047-1057Google Scholar), affording 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP 4a in 77% yield. 2′-d-3′ATP 4b was prepared similarly from 3b with an additional detritylation step in 22% yield. This method can also be applied to the synthesis of nucleoside 3′-diphosphates, since 2′,5′-dd-3′ADP 5a and 2′-d-3′ADP 5b also were prepared by reaction of 3a with tributylammonium phosphate in 54% and 49% yield, respectively. In conclusion, the utility and efficiency of the method of the alkoxide activation combined with the use of the phosphorylating agent 2 has been demonstrated by its application to the syntheses of various adenosine 3′-polyphosphates in only two steps, avoiding additional steps generally required for such syntheses (protection and deprotection of the exocyclic amino group and condensation of morpholine with the nucleoside monophosphate). The adenosine 3′-polyphosphates and the deoxy derivatives (Fig. 1) are a family of inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase in which potency increased with the number of 3′-phosphates and with the removal of the 2′-OH and 5′-OH groups (Fig. 2). IC50 values for inhibition of rat brain adenylyl cyclase by the three series of adenosine 3′-phosphates are presented in Table I and compared with those of the parent nucleosides and with three cyclic nucleotides. The cyclic nucleotides were poor inhibitors. For each parent nucleoside, inhibitory potency increased with the number of 3′-phosphates. Inhibitory potency of the 3′-phosphates followed the order Ado < 2′d-Ado < 2′,5′-dd-Ado. The greatest effects were those caused by the removal of the 2′-hydroxyl group and by the sequential addition of phosphates at the 3′ position, each increasing potency many-fold. The combined effects of the removal of the 2′- and 5′-hydroxyl groups and the addition of the 3′-polyphosphate are incorporated in 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP, which exhibited an IC50∼40 nM (Table I and 13Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Google Scholar). This potency is almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of previous ligands and makes 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP the most potent nonprotein regulator of adenylyl cyclases thus far described. It approaches the potency of the stimulatory effect of rGsα on the type I adenylyl cyclase and the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of Gβγ on αs-activated-types II and I, respectively (35Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Google Scholar). The observation that adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-polyphosphates are also very potent inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase is important in that these 3′-nucleotides are known to occur naturally, whereas the 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine 3′-polyphosphates are not. Consequently, the adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-polyphosphates are potentially important and unexplored intracellular regulatory nucleotides. The rank order presented in Table I was maintained with the purified native bovine type I and with the recombinant wild type I adenylyl cyclases, though with these enzymes each of the 3′-nucleotides was noticeably less potent than with the enzyme in the cruder detergent-dispersed rat brain preparation (13Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Google Scholar). This is consistent with the loss of potency of 2′-d-3′AMP and 2′,5′-dd-Ado we had previously noted upon purification of the bovine brain adenylyl cyclase (8Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688Google Scholar). This may reflect the loss of membrane phospholipid important for tertiary structure or loss of calmodulin in the purified preparations, because Ca2+/calmodulin enhances sensitivity to P-site ligands (36Stübner D. Johnson R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 155-161Google Scholar).Fig. 2Inhibition of rat brain adenylyl cyclase by several adenosine 3′-phosphates. All 3′-nucleotides were added as their sodium salts.

We reported previously that 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP and 2′,5′-dd-3′ADP elicited linear noncompetitive inhibition of both purified and crude, detergent-extracted preparations of adenylyl cyclases (13Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Google Scholar). This behavior was fully consistent with inhibition occurring at the P-site (15Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-polyphosphates also caused noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 3). Thus, all of the adenine 3′-nucleotides synthesized and tested here constitute a class of substantially more potent P-site inhibitors of adenylyl cyclases. Typical adenylyl cyclase preparations contain a number of phosphohydrolyses and substantial degradation of the adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates might be expected (37Johnson R.A. Welden J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 216-227Google Scholar, 38Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8252-8258Google Scholar). However, when these 3′-nucleotides were incubated with a detergent-dispersed adenylyl cyclase from rat brain under conditions known to elicit excellent sensitivity to P-site-mediated inhibition, with the exception of 3′ATP, there was no significant breakdown of any of the adenosine or 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-polyphosphates or of 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP (Table II). 3These experiments on nucleotide stability were conducted in the absence of 5′ATP, which is present in adenylyl cyclase reactions. 5′ATP was omitted because it partially comigrates with the 3′-triphosphates we tested, making the quantification of nucleoside 3′-triphosphates more difficult. In other experiments we found no evidence that 5′ATP altered the small appearance of 3′-di- and 3′-monophosphate breakdown products, implying that 5′ATP did not affect the hydrolysis of the 3′-triphosphates. Notably, there was some conversion of 3′ADP to 3′ATP (as well as to breakdown products of 3′ATP) and of 2′,5′-dd-3′ADP to 2′,5′-dd-3′ATP. This phosphorylation of 3′ADP and 2′,5′-dd-3′ADP was found to be due to contaminating kinase(s) in the incubation and did not occur in the absence of enzyme. 3′ATP breakdown led to the formation of 3′AMP and 2′AMP in variable ratios, and this occurred also in the absence of enzyme. The hydrolysis of 3′ATP implies its potency (IC50∼2 µM) was likely an underestimation. In the absence of the adenylyl cyclase preparation, the principal product of 3′ATP hydrolysis was 2′:3′-cAMP (Table III) and was found to be catalyzed by divalent cation alone. It occurred with Mn2+, Mg2+, and to a slightly lesser extent with Ca2+ (Table III). Because the inclusion of the adenylyl cyclase preparation led to the formation of 3′AMP or 2′AMP (cf. Table II) but to no measurable 2′:3′-cAMP, the sequence 3′ATP → 2′:3′-cAMP → 3′AMP + 2′AMP is suggested. The latter step would be catalyzed by enzymes in the rat brain extract. This reaction sequence was obviously not possible with the 2′-deoxyribosides, and with them significant breakdown did not occur and the consequences of the little breakdown of the 3′-polyphosphates that does occur could be ignored.Table IIStability of adenosine 3′-polyphosphates during reaction with detergent-extracted adenylyl cyclase from rat brainNucleotideNucleoside3′∼P3′∼PP3′∼PPP%2′d3′AMP2.697.42′d3′ADP1.23.095.82′d3′ATP1.42.05.391.32′,5′dd3′AMP21.478.62′,5′dd3′ADP1.77.8<0.689.92′,5′dd3′ATP1.4<0.1<0.198.63′ADP2.72.073.122.23′ATP2.372.96.118.8 Open table in a new tab Table IIICation-induced hydrolysis of 3′ATPCation (5 mM)Nucleoside (3.7 min)2′:3′cAMP (10 min)3′AMP (17 min)3′ADP (22 min)3′ATP (25 min)Unknown (26 min)%None1.44.2<0.16.887.6<0.1Mn2+1.984.4<0.14.95.83.1Mg2+1.881.3<0.15.38.23.5Ca2+1.872.5<0.15.120.7<0.1 Open table in a new tab Because possible products of nucleoside 3′-polyphosphate hydrolysis would include inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) or inorganic triphosphate (PPPi), we determined the potency and nature of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by these agents (Fig. 4)"

https://openalex.org/W2106280254,"Earlier work has shown that RNase E cleaves RNAI, the antisense repressor of replication of ColE1-type plasmids, producing pRNAI<sub>−5</sub>, whose further decay is mediated by the poly(A)-dependent activity of polynucleotide phosphorylase and other 3′ to 5′ exonucleases. Using a poly(A) polymerase-deficient strain to impede exonucleolytic decay, we show that RNAI is additionally cleaved by RNase E at multiple sites, generating a series of decay intermediates that are differentially retained by the RNA binding domain (RBD) of RNase E. Primer extension analysis of RNAI decay intermediates and RNase T<sub>1</sub> mapping of the cleavage products of RNAI generated <i>in vitro</i> by affinity-purified RNase E showed that RNase E can cleave internucleotide bonds in the bubble regions of duplex RNA segments and in single-stranded regions. Chemical <i>in situ</i> probing of a complex formed between RNAI and the RBD indicates that binding to the RBD destabilizes RNAI secondary structure. Our results suggest a model in which a series of sequential RNase E-mediated cleavages occurring at multiple sites of RNAI, some of which may be made more accessible to RNase E by the destabilizing effects of its RBD, generate RNA fragments that are further degraded by poly(A)-dependent 3′ to 5′ exonucleases."

ER chaperones, such as BiP and calnexin, bind transiently to polypeptide chains during the folding and assembly of oligomeric complexes. These interactions prevent inappropriate folding or assembly, and once a certain folding state, or stage of complex assembly, has been reached the chaperone is no longer needed and dissociates. This dissociation often correlates with the acquisition of “transport competence” by the newly synthesized protein, allowing it to exit the ER and be transported to later compartments of the secretory pathway. In this way chaperones such as calnexin and BiP function to ensure “quality control” of proteins during transit through the ER (3Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev.

Three glucose residues are present on the oligosaccharide side chain when it is added to the emerging polypeptide chain by the oligosaccharyl transferase (18Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The first two are rapidly removed by glucosidases I and II, and it is the resulting monoglucosylated form that associates tightly with calnexin (17Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The final glucose residue is slowly removed by glucosidase II, but reglucosylation can occur catalyzed by UDPglucose-glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. This enzyme only acts on unfolded or misfolded proteins (19Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); hence, it is thought to be part of the quality control mechanism of the ER. In this hypothesis, unfolded proteins are reglucosylated and bind to calnexin, whereas properly folded proteins are not reglucosylated and therefore are not good substrates for calnexin binding (18Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The specificity of calnexin may be more complex than implied above since, in certain cases, proteins that are not glycosylated can associate with calnexin. These include the CD3ε subunit of the T-cell receptor complex and thyroglobulin (9Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The significance of such cases is not clear. BiP (heavy chain binding protein) is an ER luminal chaperone, which shares some substrates, for example vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (22Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and thyroglobulin (21Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), with calnexin. In the case of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein it has been shown that BiP binds to early folding intermediates and calnexin binds to later folding intermediates. The opposite sequence of binding, first calnexin and then BiP, occurs for thyroglobulin. This indicates that calnexin is part of an integrated chaperone system in the ER involving other proteins such as BiP and protein disulfide isomerase. In this study we have investigated the interaction of calnexin with a truncated form of the human glucose transporter (Glut 1), a multispanning membrane protein. Our results show that both calnexin and calreticulin interact with the truncated Glut 1 polypeptide. Restriction endonucleases and endoglycosidase Hf (Endo H) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Herts, United Kingdom). T7 RNA polymerase, transcription buffers, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were supplied by Promega (Southampton, UK). Cycloheximide, proteinase K, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1-deoxymannojirimycin were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK). The cross-linking reagents 4-4′-diazidodiphenyl ether (DADE) and bis[β-(4-azidosalicylamido)ethyl] disulfide (BASED) were purchased from Prochem, Inc.

L-[35S]-Methionine was purchased from Amersham International (Bucks, UK). Polyclonal rabbit anti-calreticulin serum was from Affinity BioReagents (Neshanic Station, NJ). Anti-calnexin serum raised against the carboxyl terminus of calnexin was a gift from Dr. Ari Helenius (Department of Cell Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT). DNA encoding the human glucose transporter, Glut 1, as a BamHI/HindIII fragment in pGEM11Zf(−) was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Baldwin (Department of Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, UK). The pH 9-washed microsomes were kindly provided by Dr. Neil Bulleid (Division of Biochemistry, University of Manchester, UK). The Glut 1 plasmid was linearized with ApaI, which cleaved the DNA within the coding sequence. This linear DNA was used as a template in a T7 RNA polymerase transcription system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The resulting mRNA was translated for 30 min in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) or a wheat germ lysate translation system as described previously (23Stueber D. Ibrahimi I. Cutler D. Dobberstein B. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3143-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in the presence of L-[35S]methionine to label the translation products. Canine pancreatic microsomes were added prior to commencement of translation. Translation was terminated after 30 min by the addition of 2.5 mM cycloheximide and subsequent incubation on ice. Following translation the membrane-associated fraction was isolated by centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion (250 mM sucrose, 500 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9) at 130,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in a low salt/sucrose cushion (250 mM sucrose, 100 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9). Following translation of GT155 in the wheat germ lysate system, samples were treated by the addition of either reticulocyte lysate prior to centrifugation or DADE or BASED subsequent to centrifugation through a high salt/sucrose cushion. Following translation of GT155 in the reticulocyte lysate system no additions were made. UV irradiation was carried out using a Spectroline model B-100/F black light lamp equipped with a 100-W mercury bulb and a 365-nm filter (Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY). Irradiation was for 10 min (Fig. 2) or 30 min (Figs. 3A, 4, 5, and 6) on ice. DADE and BASED are homobifunctional cross-linking agents that contain azido groups and generate reactive nitrenes when irradiated with UV. BASED is a thiol-cleavable reagent. Cross-linking with DADE and BASED involved the addition of a stock solution of the reagent (at 50 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide) to the resuspended membrane pellet to 1 mM final concentration followed by irradiation with UV for 10 min where indicated. Following cross-linking the samples were subjected to either trichloroacetic acid precipitation to yield the total membrane-associated fraction or immunoprecipitation. For “native” immunoprecipitation the resuspended membrane pellet was diluted with 4 volumes of IP buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). For “denaturing” immunoprecipitation 1% SDS was added to the samples followed by heating to 95°C for 5 min and dilution with 4 volumes of IP buffer as above. Methionine was added to 1 mM, and the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.2 mg/ml. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. To aliquots of the resulting supernatant 1 µl of control (preimmune or nonrelated) serum or antiserum was added as indicated. The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with mixing. Protein A-Sepharose, which had been preincubated with 20% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then washed 5 times with IP buffer, was added to the samples, and the incubation continued for 2 h. The samples were washed 5 times with IP buffer. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to samples followed by heating to 95°C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed on 8-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as indicated and subjected to autoradiography. With the aim of studying the interactions of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER, we chose the Glut 1 glucose transporter as a model membrane glycoprotein. Full-length Glut 1 has 12 membranespanning domains; however, following preliminary work, we decided to use a truncated version encoding only the amino-terminal 155 residues (GT155). This construct contains a site for N-glycosylation and should be sufficiently long to allow the first two membrane-spanning domains to insert into the microsomal membrane. In addition, due to the absence of a stop codon we were able to study the interactions of GT155 while it was still attached to the ribosome (24Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GT155 was translated in the absence and presence of microsomes (Fig. 1A). A shift in mobility occurred equivalent to an increase of approximately 4 kDa upon addition of microsomes (Fig. 1A, lane 2 compared with lane 1). Endo H digestion of the larger species confirmed that it was due to the addition of an oligosaccharide side chain to GT155, this process being almost 100% efficient (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Glut 1 has a single site for glycosylation at asparagine residue 45. The observation that this residue was glycosylated in the in vitro system indicated that it was correctly located on the luminal side of the membrane. Further evidence that membrane insertion of GT155 occurred in this system was provided by the resistance of the polypeptide to protease digestion (Fig. 1A, lane 4 compared with lane 5). A model of the putative structure of the translocation intermediate GT155 is given in Fig. 1B. An “aglyco” mutant of GT155, AGGT155, in which asparagine 45 had been mutated to a threonine with the aim of preventing glycosylation (25Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was translated in this system (Fig. 1A, lane 6). AGGT155 was not glycosylated and migrated with an identical mobility to GT155 following incubation in the absence of microsomes (Fig. 1A, lane 1). AGGT155 was also proteaseresistant and therefore membrane-inserted (data not shown). The membrane chaperone calnexin interacts with many glycoproteins in the ER (6Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), so we tested whether GT155 associated with this chaperone. Following translation of GT155 and centrifugation through a sucrose cushion to isolate the membrane-associated fraction, immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-calnexin antibody. Glycosylated GT155 was found to be co-immunoprecipitated by the calnexin antibody, suggesting that there was an interaction between calnexin and GT155 (Fig. 2, lane 2). A further product, which migrated at approximately 25 kDa, was also co-precipitated by calnexin antiserum (Fig. 2, band X). This product was sensitive to Endo H treatment (data not shown). We believe this product to be the result of a post-translational modification to glycosylated GT155 causing a change in mobility. Preliminary experiments had demonstrated a difference between in vitro translation systems with regard to the products immunoprecipitated by the anti-calnexin antibody. This was investigated further using the wheat germ lysate translation system. A product of approximately 110 kDa, which was barely visible in the absence of additions, was immunoprecipitated by the anti-calnexin antibody following the post-translational addition of reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2, lane 6). UV irradiation of the reticulocyte lysate-treated samples led to the appearance of an additional product of approximately 80 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 8). These findings indicated that reticulocyte lysate could promote the formation of adducts between GT155 (approximately 20 kDa) and two different species of approximately 90 and 60 kDa. The effect of reticulocyte lysate in this system could be duplicated by using two homobifunctional photoactivable cross-linking reagents, DADE and BASED. Both compounds were able to mimic the effect of reticulocyte lysate addition to GT155 translated in the wheat germ system (Fig. 2, lanes 9-16). This evidence supports the existence of an endogenous cross-linking factor present in reticulocyte lysate and reinforces our observation that GT155 interacts with two species, of approximately 90 and 60 kDa, both products being immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibodies. Calnexin migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 90 kDa in the SDS-PAGE system, suggesting that the 110-kDa product was a complex of GT155 and calnexin. Treatment of the membrane fraction with 1% SDS and heating to 95°C prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin confirmed that the 110-kDa product was recognized under these denaturing conditions and therefore was a calnexin-derived complex (data not shown, and Fig. 5, lane 5). The 80-kDa product was not immunoprecipitated under these denaturing conditions, indicating that the protein involved was not calnexin but remained associated with calnexin under “native” conditions. This protein was designated a calnexin-associated protein of 60 kDa, CAP-60. UV irradiation of the membrane fraction was not required in order to obtain the calnexin adduct (Fig. 2, lane 8 compared with lane 6). Thus the 110-kDa product is not a true cross-linking product but does represent an SDS-stable complex or adduct formed between calnexin and GT155. A comparison of samples solubilized in sample buffer with and without dithiothreitol was performed, and N-ethylmaleimide was used to treat samples after solubilization in the presence of dithiothreitol. In all cases a similar amount of the 110-kDa product was observed, indicating that the product is not the result of aberrant disulfide bond formation (data not shown). The CAP-60-GT155 product was observed only after UV irradiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that calnexin requires glycosylation of the substrate protein for binding and also that calnexin interacts with the glucose-trimmed monoglucosylated form of proteins such as influenza hemagglutinin and not the triglucosylated form of the protein (17Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The effect of glycosylation and glucose-trimming on the interactions between GT155 and calnexin and CAP-60 was investigated. First, the GT155 products immunoprecipitated by anticalnexin were treated with Endo H to confirm that the glycosylated form of GT155 was present in the products. The apparent molecular weight of the GT155-calnexin adduct and the GT155-CAP-60 cross-link decreased following Endo H treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 3 compared with lane 2). This indicated the presence of at least one glycosylated side chain in each product. Since calnexin is not glycosylated, the GT155 in the GT155-calnexin adduct must be glycosylated. The nonglycosylated mutant AGGT155 was translated in the presence of microsomes. The membrane-associated fraction of AGGT155 was subjected to UV treatment. The calnexin adduct and CAP-60 cross-link observed with the wild type (Fig. 3A, lane 2) were both absent with the nonglycosylated mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 8) indicating that glycosylation is essential for these interactions. The glucose-trimming enzymes glucosidase I and glucosidase II were inhibited by 1-deoxynojirimycin (dNM) treatment, leading to a small increase in the apparent molecular weight of GT155 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 5, and 8). The GT155-calnexin adduct and GT155-CAP-60 cross-link were no longer immunoprecipitated by calnexin antibodies following dNM treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, inhibition of glucose trimming was sufficient to prevent association of GT155 with calnexin. The nature of the GT155-CAP-60 cross-link was further investigated by replacing the microsomes used thus far with pH 9-washed microsomes. The alkaline extraction of microsomes has been shown to deplete the luminal components such as protein disulfide isomerase and BiP although producing microsomes that can still support translocation, membrane insertion, and glycosylation (26Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When the GT155 cross-linking experiments were carried out in the presence of pH 9-washed microsomes, the calnexin adduct was still immunoprecipitated, but the GT155-CAP-60 cross-link was absent (Fig. 4, lane 2). This result indicates that CAP-60 is a luminal protein that is removed during pH 9-washing of the microsomes. Interestingly, the unidentified product X was absent following immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin after translation in the presence of pH 9-washed microsomes (Fig. 4, lane 2). This indicated that product X may be the result of a post-translational modification requiring luminal factors. Western blotting analysis of the pH 9-washed microsomes verified that calnexin (an integral membrane protein) was still present while calreticulin (a luminal protein) was greatly decreased in comparison (data not shown). Calreticulin shows strong sequence similarity to calnexin and has been implicated as a potential chaperone in glycoprotein folding (28Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Since calreticulin has an apparent mobility of 60 kDa on SDS-PAGE it was an obvious candidate for being CAP-60. This theory was tested by immunoprecipitation using an anti-calreticulin antibody. Under “native” immunoprecipitation conditions the anti-calreticulin antibody recognized a band of identical mobility to GT155-CAP-60 (Fig. 5, lane 9). This result suggested that CAP-60 may be calreticulin. Denaturing immunoprecipitation with this antibody failed to detect the GT155-CAP-60 cross-linking product. However, this may be due to the overall low efficiency of immunoprecipitation under these conditions (compare GT155-calnexin in Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 11). The need for glycosylation and glucose trimming, already demonstrated for calnexin association, was investigated for the interaction of GT155 with CAP-60. The UV-dependent 80-kDa product was absent when the total membrane-associated fraction was analyzed in the aglyco mutant (Fig. 6, lane 1). As previously observed, following immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin, the calnexin adduct and CAP-60 cross-link observed in the wild type (Fig. 6, lane 9) were both absent in the aglyco mutant (Fig. 6, lane 6). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with calreticulin antiserum demonstrated a cross-linking product between wild type GT155 and calreticulin (Fig. 6, lane 10) that was absent in the aglyco mutant (Fig. 6, lane 7), confirming that glycosylation is essential for this interaction. Inhibition of glucose-trimming by dNM treatment followed by analysis of the total products in the membrane-associated fraction showed that the 80-kDa product was absent following dNM treatment (Fig. 6, lane 3). Likewise, an 80-kDa cross-linking product was no longer immunoprecipitated by calreticulin antibodies following dNM treatment (Fig. 6, lane 13). In addition, the co-immunoprecipitation of glycosylated GT155 with calreticulin was greatly decreased following dNM treatment. Thus, the inhibition of glucose trimming was sufficient to prevent the association of GT155 with calreticulin. As a control, the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin was also tested. No effect on calnexin, CAP-60, or calreticulin interactions was observed with this drug (Fig. 6, lanes 4, 15, and 16). These data suggest that the CAP-60 component closely associated with calnexin is either calreticulin or a novel protein of identical mobility that binds specifically to glycoproteins with trimmed, N-linked, carbohydrate side chains. The interaction between calnexin and nascent glycoproteins has been studied in various ways. To date, the majority of studies have analyzed the interaction between newly synthesized glycoproteins and calnexin by co-immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled cells (6Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), from virally infected and metabolically labeled cells (16Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and after in vitro translation with pancreatic microsomes (17Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Stable complexes formed between calnexin and nascent proteins have been identified by these approaches. In this study we have used a cross-linking approach to stabilize interactions prior to solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Calnexin (p88) had previously been shown to cross-link to the transmembrane region of the heavy chain of the class I MHC complex (11Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki G.L. Degen E. Flavell R.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A glycosylated, truncated translocation intermediate of the multispanning membrane protein Glut 1 was chosen as a target protein for analyzing calnexin interactions. Immunoprecipitation with calnexin antibodies co-immunoprecipitated the truncated, glycosylated, GT155 polypeptide, together with two high molecular weight products that were candidates for calnexin-containing cross-linking products. Further investigation revealed one product to be a calnexin-GT155 complex, which was recognized by the calnexin antibody even following SDS denaturation. The calnexin-GT155 interaction required glycosylation and glucose trimming, a feature consistent with many calnexin interactions (6Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 10Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 17Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A model for calnexin action has developed in which calnexin acts as a lectin, binding to the oligosaccharide side chains of glycoproteins (18Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This model involves cycling of the glucosylation state of the protein involving the action of glucosidase I and glucosidase II, which remove glucose residues, and UDPglucose-glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which adds a single glucose residue to a nonglucosylated oligosaccharide side chain. The folding sensor in this cycle seems to be the glucosyl transferase, which only acts on incompletely folded proteins (19Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 20Parker C.G. Fessler L.I. Nelson R.E. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence, the only escape from this cycle, and therefore from calnexin binding, is correct folding. Evidence has been presented by Ware et al. (31Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) indicating that endoglycosidase H treatment of calnexin-glycoprotein complexes does not dissociate the complex as would be expected if calnexin associations were solely via interaction with the carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein. Our data confirm the requirement for a correctly modified oligosaccharide side chain on GT155 in order to see calnexin binding; the specific molecular details remain to be established. Co-immunoprecipitated with the calnexin-GT155 product, a smaller complex was observed. This complex, of approximately 80 kDa, behaves as a genuine cross-linking product mediated by UV-activation of an unidentified reticulocyte lysate factor. The 20-kDa GT155 was cross-linked to a 60-kDa protein (CAP-60), an interaction confirmed in a wheat germ lysate system, using two homobifunctional photoactivable cross-linking agents, DADE and BASED. The co-precipitation of the CAP-60-GT155 cross-linking product with anti-calnexin is very efficient, suggesting CAP-60 and calnexin may be in a complex. Indeed, a high molecular weight product (~190 kDa) was seen in some experiments (for example Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 15), which may represent cross-linking between all the components of such a ternary complex. At this point we cannot exclude the possibility that the co-precipitation of calnexin and CAP-60 is due to an indirect interaction, via either GT155 or an as yet unidentified molecule. Further investigation using pH 9-washed microsomes demonstrated CAP-60 to be an ER luminal protein. A good candidate for CAP-60 was calreticulin, and we found that anti-calreticulin antibodies do recognize a product of identical size to the GT155-CAP-60 complex under native conditions, although not under denaturing conditions. Thus CAP-60 is either calreticulin or a protein of identical mobility with similar properties. A chaperone function for calreticulin has been proposed by other groups (28Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 29Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is a 46-kDa soluble ER calcium-binding protein, which has an apparent mobility on SDS-PAGE close to 60 kDa (reviewed in Refs. 32Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar and 33Nash P.D. Opas M. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Considerable sequence homology is observed between calreticulin and several luminal domains of calnexin (34Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the binding of calreticulin to GT155 also requires both glycosylation and processing of that glycosylation (see also Ref. 29Peterson J.R. Ora A. Van P.N. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the absence of these events the 80-kDa cross-linking product is absent from both total products and after immunoprecipitation with anti-calnexin and anti-calreticulin. In all cases the cross-linking between GT155 and calreticulin can occur from any region of GT155 since the photoactivable reagent has not been biosynthetically incorporated (i.e. during translation) and does not have restricted reactivity for only certain amino acid side chains. We are therefore unable to address the question of exactly which region of GT155 is cross-linked to calreticulin. Since calreticulin is a luminal ER protein and the interaction is sensitive to the glycosylation of the luminal domain of GT155, we assume calreticulin is cross-linked somewhere within this portion of GT155. Our analysis with pH 9-washed microsomes showed that GT155 glycosylated can interact with calnexin in the absence of most luminal components. Thus, the presence of calreticulin and/or CAP-60 is not essential for the interaction per se. However, our results do suggest that calnexin and CAP-60 may function as a protein complex that specifically binds to nascent glycoproteins. CAP-60 could influence the activity of calnexin or have a distinct role in modulating glycoprotein folding. In the latter case such a complex would facilitate a coordinated transfer of glycoprotein folding intermediates between subunits (cf. Ref. 36Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Our current aim is to establish the identity of CAP-60 conclusively. We have recently shown that CAP-60 is distinct from calreticulin and may represent a new glycoprotein-specific ER component (J. D. Oliver, N. J. Bulleid, and S. High, manuscript in preparation)."

We have purified lipoyl-AMP:Nε-lysine lipoyltransferase I and II from bovine liver mitochondria employing apoH-protein as an acceptor of lipoic acid (Fujiwara, K., Okamura-Ikeda, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16605-16609). In this study, we demonstrated the lipoylation of the lipoyl domains of the mammalian pyruvate (LE2p), α-ketoglutarate (LE2k), and branched chain α-keto acid (LE2b) dehydrogenase complexes using the purified lipoyltransferase I and II. Lipoyltransferase I and II lipoylated LE2p and LE2k as efficiently as H-protein, but the lipoylation rate of LE2b was extremely low. Comparison of amino acid sequences surrounding the lipoylation site of these proteins shows that the conserved glutamic acid residue situated 3 residues to the N-terminal side of the lipoylation site is replaced by glutamine (Gln-41) in LE2b. When Gln-41 of LE2b was changed to Glu, the rate of lipoylation increased about 100-fold and became comparable to that of LE2p and LE2k. The replacement of the glutamic acid residue of LE2p (Glu-169) and LE2k (Glu-40) by glutamine resulted in decrease in the lipoylation rate more than 100-fold. These results suggest that the glutamic acid residue plays an important role in the lipoylation reaction possibly functioning as a recognition signal. Gly-27 and Gly-54 of LE2k are also well conserved among the lipoyl domains of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes and H-protein. The mutagenesis experiments of these residues indicated that the glycine residue situated 11 residues to the C-terminal side of the lipoylation site (Gly-54 of LE2k) is important for the folding of lipoyl domain, and that existence of a small residue such as Gly or Cys at the position is essential for the lipoylation of these proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2053617528,"A well known difference in nucleotide binding characteristics between heterotrimeric G proteins and small GTP binding proteins of the Ras superfamily is that the former bind GTP or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) with a much lower affinity (Kd ~10−8-10−7M) than the latter (Kd ~10−11-10−10M). We report here that the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin (Gt) binds GTPγS with an affinity comparable to that of Ras. High affinity binding was suggested by GTPγS titrations of rod outer segment samples with Gt concentrations in the range of 7 nM to 300 nM; the results were more consistent with a dissociation constant for GTPγS in the subnanomolar range, than with one in the 10−8-10−7M range typically reported for heterotrimeric G proteins. Equilibrium binding experiments with G protein concentrations in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range confirmed this conclusion and revealed a dissociation constant of 50 pM. Thus, transducin's affinity for GTPγS, and by inference, for GTP, appears to be approximately three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. These results raise the possibility that some results obtained with high concentrations of nucleotide analogues may be due to minute traces of contaminants such as GTP, GTPγS, or GTPαS, that have high affinities for Gtα.

Photoisomerized rhodopsin (R*) catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit of transducin, and Gtα-GTP activates PDE (see Refs. 1Pugh E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 111-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar and 2Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for reviews of phototransduction). Because of its abundance in rod outer segments (ROS) and the relative ease of its purification, Gt has served as a paradigm for many studies of G protein function. Obviously, one of the most important properties of G proteins is their ability to bind GTP with sufficiently favorable energetics to allow rapid and dramatic changes in their functional properties, so they can switch from inactive to active states when stimulated to release GDP by activated receptors. In the case of Gt, the differences between the GDP and GTP forms and the speed with which the switch occurs are remarkable. The GTP form shows a dramatic decrease in affinity for R* and Gtβγ as compared to the GDP form (3Kühn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 4Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Activation by GTP can occur on a millisecond time scale at physiological levels of GTP (5Vuong T.M. Chabre M. Stryer L. Nature. 1984; 311: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Kahlert M. Hofmann K.P. Biophys.

Most importantly, perhaps, while the GDP form of Gtα appears to be capable of activating the effector PDE only at concentrations on the order of 50 µM (8Kutuzov M. Pfister C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the GTP or GTPγS form interacts with it much more efficiently, with an apparent affinity for membrane-bound holo-PDE of <0.2 nM determined by activation (9Malinski J.A. Wensel T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), or of 2.5 nM determined by light scattering (7Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Kd of Gtα-GDP for the inhibitory PDEγ subunit of PDE has been reported to be 3 nM, while the GTPγS form binds with a Kd of ≤0.1 nM (10Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Chardin P. Chabre M.

The observation of Kd values for Gtα-GTPγS binding PDE or PDEγ in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range seems hard to reconcile with earlier reports of Kd values for formation of the Gtα-GTPγS complex itself (i.e. Gtα-GTPγS) on the order of 50-100 nM (4Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Kelleher D.J. Dudycz L.W. Wright G.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 603-608PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent paradox raised the question of whether the Gtα complex with GTPγS could be capable of activating its effector at a concentration so dilute that the activator itself should fall apart. Furthermore, titrations measuring PDE activity in rod outer segments as a function of added GTPγS yielded curves whose shapes were more consistent with stoichiometric binding of a very high affinity ligand than with reversible association of a ligand with a Kd value similar to those reported for Gt and other G proteins (9Malinski J.A. Wensel T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A noteworthy feature of the literature on affinities of GTPγS and other GTP analogues for G proteins (including several reports that are conveniently tabulated in Ref. 4Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is that most of the experiments reported have been conducted at concentrations of total G protein on the same order as the apparent Kd values that were determined. Lower Kd values have tended to be reported from experiments at lower protein concentrations, while higher Kd values have been reported at higher protein concentrations. For example Gs at concentrations of 12 nM was reported to bind GTPγS with a Kd of 5-10 nM (12Asano T. Pedersen S.E. Scott C.W. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5460-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), while for the same protein assayed at 400 nM (13Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a Kd of 700 nM was reported. In addition, in most cases where plots of bound versus added nucleotide have been presented, no attempt has been made to distinguish between total and free (i.e. not bound to protein) ligand. It has been well established in the case of the small GTP-binding proteins of the p21ras superfamily that Kd values in the picomolar range were mistaken for values in the high nanomolar range when total protein concentrations in the nanomolar range were assayed (reviewed in ref. 14Goody R.S. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 327-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From a comparison of the three-dimensional structures of p21ras (15Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and Gtα (16Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues bound, it is far from obvious why the affinity for GTPγS of the former should be 1000 times stronger than that of the latter. High affinity interactions frequently go unrecognized because the low concentrations of binding sites (near Kd) required to measure them accurately often present experimental difficulties. However, even at higher than ideal concentrations of binding sites, these interactions can be recognized by careful analysis of the shapes of binding curves, and least squares analysis of fits of the curves to either simplified or more complete binding equations (17Malinski J.A. Zera E.M. Wensel T.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 304Google Scholar). We present here a reexamination of the affinity of GTPγS for Gtα using experimental conditions that allow determination of low (picomolar) values of Kd. These consist principally of the use of low Gtα concentrations and direct measurement, rather than calculation or assumption, of the values of free [GTPγS]. In addition we present a comparison of the χ2 surfaces obtained from least-squares fitting of data obtained at high and low protein concentrations. The dependence of this measure of goodness of fit, on the parameters used to calculate theoretical binding curves, reveals that important information about high affinity interactions can be obtained even at higher-than-ideal protein concentration. This analysis also reveals the limits of such information. GTPγS was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (purity of 85% estimated by supplier). GTPγ35S was obtained from DuPont NEN, and its radiochemical purity by TLC (18Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 939-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was verified to be >95% for experiments reported here. Stocks were routinely checked for degradation, which was often found to be >90% in stored samples. Rod outer segments (19Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Ramdas L. Disher R.M. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11637-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were prepared as described; Gtβγ was used to test its effects on GTPγS binding. Equilibrium binding experiments were carried out using Buffer A consisting of 20 mM MOPS, pH 8.2, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin (for comparison to conditions used in pH-based PDE assays), or Buffer B consisting of 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 60 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin (for comparison to previous studies done at similar pH values). No significant differences were detected in binding results obtained with these two buffers. Samples of freshly bleached rod outer segments (3-150 nM R*) were mixed with GTPγ35S (~100 Ci/mmol) to various final concentrations and incubated on a rotating mixer at 23°C (1 or 2 ml, final volume) for periods of time ranging from 3 to 17 h. Then they were filtered through 0.22-µm pore-size nitrocellulose filters, in a vacuum filter manifold, and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer. Filters were removed with the vacuum on to remove solution from the edges. The solution passing through the filters was collected using funnels and scintillation vials positioned below the filters. Radioactivity bound to the filters and in the flow-through solutions was measured by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding 1 µM nonradioactive GTPγS to the ROS 30 min prior to addition of GTPγ35S, and the average radioactivity bound to filters in these samples (typically 0.95%± 0.05% of the total radioactivity added) was subtracted from the total radioactivity bound to the other filters to calculate specific binding. The sum of the radioactivity in the filter and flow-through samples was found to correspond to essentially all the radioactivity added. Three different approaches were taken to test whether thiophosphorylation of Gtβ (21Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Wieland T. Ronzani M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) might contribute to the filter-bound radioactivity. 1) In equilibrium binding experiments such as those described above, control samples were treated with 8% (final, w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 0°C just prior to filtration to denature the protein and release noncovalently bound radioactivity. 2) Identical samples to those used in binding assays (not treated with acid) were washed from nitrocellulose filters with SDS sample buffer, applied to a gel for SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and subjected to fluorography, along with standards of known amounts of GTPγ35S to estimate detection limits. 3) In an attempt to force the thiophosphorylation reaction, ROS (5, 15, or 29 µM R) were treated with GTPγ35S (1000 Ci/mmol) at a concentration of 100 nM for 40 min at 23°C. The membranes were separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation, and both supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography to locate radiolabeled bands. Radioactivity incorporated into protein was quantitated on dried gels using a Beta Scope 603 Blot Analyzer (βetagen). PDE assays were carried out as described previously (9Malinski J.A. Wensel T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using suspensions of freshly bleached rod outer segments and Buffer A with ovalbumin and DTT omitted. Activity was measured before and after the addition of GTPγS to the indicated concentrations, and GTPγS-induced activity is expressed as a percentage of the maximal activity observed at the highest [GTPγS]. To determine the Gt content of ROS, a titration with GTPγS was performed, using PDE activity to monitor formation of the Gtα-GTPγS complex at an R concentration of at least 5 µM to ensure stoichiometric complex formation. The concentration of added GTPγS giving maximal PDE activity was taken as the concentration of total Gtα competent to bind GTPγS. GTPγS concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using ε254 nm = 13,700 M−1 cm−1. Previous studies (9Malinski J.A. Wensel T.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Ramdas L. Disher R.M. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11637-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that spontaneous exchange of GTPγS for GDP on transducin, and R*-catalyzed exchange give rise to the same product at equilibrium, and that Gtα-GTPγS is capable of fully activating PDE without the presence of R*. In these studies and many unpublished experiments in this laboratory, we have consistently found agreement between Gt concentrations determined by nucleotide titrations and those determined by dye binding assays to be typically within ±20%, and in the very worst cases to differ by a factor of two. The activation and direct binding titrations (Figs. 1, 2, 3) were analyzed using two equations for equilibrium binding. In the full equation (Equation 1), the amount of bound radioactivity or PDE activity (Y) for any values of Kd and total added ligand is calculated using the expressions for equilibrium binding and conservation of mass. Only total ligand concentration (CL), and St, the total concentration of ligand binding sites (i.e. total Gtα in this case), need to be known independently. Y=(Ymax/St)−b−(b2−4StCL)1/2/2(Eq.1) where b is defined as b (−Kd− St− CL), Ymax is activity or binding at saturating ligand, St is as described above and CL is the total concentration of ligand.Fig. 2GTPγ35S binding at 30 nM R.

Reduced χ2 values are plotted as function of Kd at the best fit values for total binding sites for Equation 1 (short dashed line), Equation 2 using measured free [GTPγ35S] (continuous curve), or Equation 2 assuming free [GTPγ35S] = total GTPγ35S (long dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Equation 2, the standard equilibrium binding equation, can be used instead of Equation 1 when the free ligand concentration, L, is known explicitly, or can be used as an approximation to Equation 1 for the special case when free ligand is approximated by total ligand i.e. L ~ CL> St Y=YmaxL/(L+Kd)(Eq.2) Here L is the concentration of free ligand and Ymax is as described above. Note that calculated Kd values can be in error by orders of magnitude if total ligand is substituted for free ligand, L. These equations provide three alternative ways to determine a Kd value from any data set: using total ligand concentration and Equation 1, using measured free ligand concentration and Equation 2, or using total ligand concentration and Equation 2 with the assumption that total ligand and free ligand are equivalent. This last procedure, although not valid in many cases, is the method that has been most commonly used for measuring GTPγS binding to G proteins. To determine values of Ymax, St and Kd that best fit the data for each method, nonlinear least squares fitting was used with all parameters varied to minimize the sums of the squared deviations of the calculated from the measured values, or equivalently, to minimize χ2. Parameter space was searched using a manual or automated grid search, or using the method of Marquardt (24Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar, 25Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 237Google Scholar). Plots of χ2 versus parameter values were examined either as three-dimensional representations, or as two-dimensional cross-sectional plots, to determine the steepness of the surfaces near minima, and to verify that the fitting routines were not trapped in local minima. Values reported for the fit parameters were those giving the minimum χ2 values for each equation used. Fig. 1 shows the characteristic response of cGMP phosphodiesterase activity in bleached rod outer segments to the addition of GTPγS: a linear increase to a plateau, with a good correspondence between the total GTPγS concentration required to reach the plateau, and the estimated total transducin. Because only a fraction (<50%) of PDE is activated at saturating [GTPγS] in ROS suspensions, and PDE can be further activated by addition of exogenous activated Gtα, it is reasonable to assume that PDE activity in this curve reports in a linear way on the fraction of Gt activated by GTPγS. There are two important features of this curve. One is that the concentration of GTPγS at which a half-maximal response is observed is 3.5 nM, a value more than an order of magnitude lower than the previously reported Kd for binding of GTPγS to Gt. The other is that a good fit to the data is obtained with Equation 1 by assuming that Kd is much lower than the total concentration of binding sites (i.e. total Gt> Kd, Fig. 1A), while assuming that free GTPγS is equal to the GTPγS added and using Equation 2 gives a much poorer fit (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1, C-F, shows the results of nonlinear least squares analysis using these two approaches; the best χ2 value for the “low affinity model” (Equation 2) is an order of magnitude higher than that for the “high affinity model” (Equation 1). However, Fig. 1C shows that a reliable estimate of Kd cannot be obtained from a fit to Equation 1, exactly because Gt> Kd. While the best fit value is 33 pM, any value below ~150 pM fits about as well. In fact, simply drawing two straight lines through the data points in Fig. 1A, which is equivalent to assuming an infinitely tight binding (Kd = 0), gives a curve that fits the data quite well. The fit does make it possible to establish an upper limit for a Kd value consistent with these data; 200 pM would be a conservative estimate. The obvious solution to the problem of determining Kd when its value is apparently much lower than the concentration of Gt commonly assayed is to carry out assays at much lower concentration. While PDE assays are not as convenient at low concentrations of ROS, direct binding assays using radiolabeled GTPγS can be used instead. The kinetics in this case might be much slower (although not necessarily so for membrane-confined reactants) so we carried out long incubations to ensure that equilibrium was reached. Fig. 2 shows the results of a titration carried out at 30 nM R. It shows unequivocally that Kd is on the order of 50 pM. A technical difficulty with this type of experiment is that prolonged incubations under dilute conditions tend to lead to some loss of total binding activity (20Ramdas L. Disher R.M. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11637-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); in these earlier studies it was confirmed, however, that Gtα-GTPγS formed by spontaneous nucleotide exchange or by R*-catalyzed exchange are functionally indistinguishable. In this particular experiment, about half (51%) of the GTPγS binding activity observed at higher ROS concentrations using PDE assays like the one described above, was retained after a 3 h incubation at 23°C and 30 nM R. Fig. 2B shows that at appropriate protein concentrations, the method of analyzing the data is not nearly as critical as at protein concentrations well above Kd. Roughly equivalent estimates of Kd with similar χ2 values are obtained using either Equation 1 (short dashes in Fig. 2A, inset, and in Fig. 2B), which implicitly calculates the value of free [GTPγS] from the total, or using Equation 2 (solid lines in Fig. 2, A and B) with the measured free [GTPγS] as the independent variable. Simply making the invalid but common assumption that free and total ligand are the same (long dashes in Fig. 2A, inset, and in Fig. 2C), again gives a much poorer fit, but in this case, the value of Kd obtained, 280 pM, is somewhat more realistic than the one estimated using this technique at higher [ROS]. An experiment at even lower [ROS], 3 nM R, is shown in Fig. 3. A very similar value of Kd, 30 pM is obtained, regardless of the method of analysis. In this case, even using Equation 2 and the assumption that free and total ligand are equal (long dashes, Fig. 3) gives the correct result. Because the binding we observe is so much stronger than has been reported previously for any heterotrimeric G protein, we were concerned that covalent attachment of 35S might be mistaken for high affinity noncovalent binding. It has been reported (21Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Wieland T. Ronzani M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Gtβ is covalently labeled by GTPγS in bleached ROS. Brief treatment (<1 min) with trichloroacetic acid at 0°C resulted in nearly complete release of the tightly bound GTPγ35S (data not shown). When autoradiography was performed on gels from SDS-PAGE of samples of bleached ROS incubated with GTPγ35S under the conditions used for measuring binding, no labeling of transducin subunits was observed; from estimates of the detection limits of this procedure, less than 10% of the radioactivity should have been readily detected if covalently incorporated into proteins. Attempts to force thiophosphorylation by using high [ROS] and high specific activity GTPγ35S, resulted in no detectable thiophosphorylation of transducin subunits. However, in the membrane pellet fraction, thiophosphorylation of R, probably catalyzed by rhodopsin kinase, could be detected at trace levels. It is important to ask how reliable is the 50 pM value of Kd estimated for the reaction: Gtα+ GTPγS Gtα-GTPγS. There are two kinds of artifacts or errors that must be considered: those that cause an underestimation of Kd and those that cause an overestimation. Those that could cause overestimation of Kd include inhibition of GTPγS binding by GDP, R*, Gtβγ, and membranes, all of which favor either the GDP or nucleotide-free states of Gtα. However, corrections for these competing ligands are probably not very significant. As we report in a companion study (26Zera E.M. Molloy D.P. Angleson J.K. Lamture J.B. Wensel T.G. Malinski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12925-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), GDP competes extremely poorly with GTPγS for Gtα binding; it must be present in at least 200-fold excess for significant inhibition of GTPγS binding to be observed. High affinity binding to R* requires association of Gtα and Gtβγ, which have been estimated to bind one another with a Kd 150-300 nM as detected by fluorescence intensity changes or resonance energy transfer (27Mittal R. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This estimate is consistent with the dependence on Gtβγ concentration of pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gtα (28Fukada Y. Matsuda T. Kokame K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Akino T. Yoshizawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the dependence on Gtα concentration of 125I-Gtβγ binding to illuminated ROS membranes (29Yoshida T. Willardson B.M. Wilkins J.F. Jensen G.J. Thornton B.D. Bitensky M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24050-24057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, under the conditions of Fig. 2, Fig. 3 essentially no Gtαβγ (with GDP or GTPγS bound) or R*-Gtαβγ should be present, although the latter presumably exists in small amounts as a transient intermediate in nucleotide exchange. If there were significant amounts of these complexes, then the measured Kd would be higher than the actual value, as these complexes favor the GDP form or the nucleotide-free form, respectively, of Gtα. The effect of Gtβγ on the equilibrium was tested directly under the conditions of Fig. 2A, by varying the added Gtβγ from 0 to 238 nM at 85 pM free GTPγS. The average value of bound 35S at 238 nM added Gtβγ was within 1% of the value at 0 added Gtβγ and the maximum range of variation over the whole range of added Gtβγ (total of 10 measurements) was ±5% (data not shown). The presence of phospholipids may also affect the results, as there are differences in membrane binding of Gtα-GDP and Gtα-GTPγS even to dark-adapted ROS membranes. 2Z. Yang and T. Wensel, unpublished results. Phospholipids present in the assays also probably do not influence GTP"

Eucaryotic cilia and flagella are complex organelles consisting of a core structure, the axoneme, which is composed of nine microtubule doublets forming a cylinder that surrounds a pair of central singlet microtubules. This ultrastructural arrangement seems to be one of the most stable microtubular assemblies known and is responsible for the flagellar and ciliary movement of a large number of organisms ranging from protozoan to mammals (1Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The movements of ciliary and flagellar axonemes are generated by an ATP-dependent sliding of adjacent microtubule doublets produced by the intermittent interaction of the dynein arms on the A-subfiber with the adjacent B-subfiber triggered by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP (1Gibbons I.R.

White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that another mAb, mAb D405-14, inhibits axonemal motility at low concentrations and recognizes a 33-kDa polypeptide from sea urchin axonemes. The purification, cloning, and sequence analysis of this 33-kDa protein reveal a high degree of homology to a dynein light chain from Chlamydomonas axoneme, suggesting that these molecules may be involved in the generation of flagellar motility. monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Axonemes from the sea urchins Lytechinus pictus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus spermatozoa were isolated as described previously (11Gagnon C. White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The final axoneme pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) (TED buffer) at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml and used immediately for the fractionation studies or was resuspended in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.05%β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol and stored at −80°C until use. The storage did not significantly affect the fractionation profile or the reactivity of mAbs against axonemal proteins for up to 1 month (not shown). The production, screening, and cloning of hydridomas producing mAbs against sea urchin sperm axonemes from L. pictus were performed as described previously (11Gagnon C. White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Axonemal proteins were fractionated essentially as described by Multigner et al. (12Multigner L. Gagnon J. Van Dorsselaer A. Job D. Nature. 1992; 360: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by sequential incubations with 0.6 M NaCl for 20 min, at 40°C for 5 min and with 0.5% Sarkosyl for 60 min. For the NaCl-soluble form, the 0.6 M NaCl extract was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). Proteins were then applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a 2-ml column of the cationic exchanger S-Sepharose previously equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins were washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base-line values, bound proteins were eluted from the column using a linear NaCl gradient (0.1 M/ml), and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing the 33-kDa protein (p33) recognized by mAb D405-14 were determined by immunodot blot. For the Sarkosyl-soluble form, the 0.5% Sarkosyl extract was made detergent-free by passing the extract on a 5-ml column containing the detergent-trapping matrix Calbiosorb (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), previously equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions containing UV (280 nm)-absorbing material were collected. The p33-containing fractions were then applied to the S-Sepharose column and eluted as described for the NaCl-soluble form. mAb D405-14, a mouse IgG1, was coupled to Protein G-Sepharose beads using dimethylpimelimidate as the cross-linker (13Harrow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511Google Scholar). Active fractions from the S-Sepharose chromatographies were incubated overnight at 4°C with the mAb D405-14 coupled beads in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Unbound proteins were removed by low speed centrifugation, and the beads were transferred to a 1-ml chromatographic column. The beads were washed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with 10 column volumes of PBS and 5 column volumes of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). Proteins bound to the column were eluted by dropping the pH of the eluent to pH 2.5 with 100 mM glycine-Cl. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated either by reversed dialysis against 20% polyethylene glycol (8000 Da) in PBS or using a Speed Vac concentrator after elution on a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Vydac C4, 2 × 150 mm). The amount of p33 in the various fractions was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (14Tijssen P. Practice and Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1985: 329Google Scholar), using purified p33 as the standard. Partially purified p33 from the NaCl extract (S-Sepharose pool) was subjected to SDS-PAGE. For NH2-terminal sequence analysis, p33 was electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the area containing the protein was excised and loaded in a vertical cross-flow reaction cartridge (Blott™ cartridge, Applied Biosystems). Edman degradation was performed on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 492). Internal sequences of p33 were obtained after an “in-gel” digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase, essentially as described elsewhere (15Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or following cleavage with 70 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (Sigma) in 70% formic acid for 40 h in the dark at room temperature and under argon atmosphere. mAb D405-14 was used to screen a S. purpuratus testis cDNA library made in the λZAP vector (kindly provided by V. Vacquier, Scripps Marine Institute, San Diego). 4 × 105 plaques were screened in duplicate, and two positive clones were purified. The cDNA-containing phagemids were rescued using helper phage, and the inserts were sequenced on both strands using the automated DNA sequencing unit from the Sheldon Biotechnology Institute (Montréal, Canada). BLAST server (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (67552) Google Scholar) was used to search for sequence homologies in PDB, Swiss-Prot, PIR, and GenPept protein data bases. A DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of p33 was prepared by the polymerase chain reaction, using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The reaction mixture contained 5 mM MgSO4, 200 µM of each dNTP, and 100 pmol of each primer. The primers were 5′-CGATGATTCCACCAAACGCA-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-CCTACTTCTTGTTCGGAGC-3′ (primer 2), where the underlined nucleotides represent BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Cycling parameters were 4 min at 94°C, followed by 25 cycles of 1.5 min at 94°C, 1.5 min at 50°C (hybridization temperature), and 2 min at 72°C. The 800-base pair product was purified using Geneclean (Bio 101, Vista, CA), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated to a pGEX-F vector digested with the same enzymes. The construction was sequenced to insure that it was free of polymerase chain reaction mistakes and that the insert was in frame with the glutathione S-transferase moiety. The expression, purification, and thrombin cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase-p33 fusion protein were performed as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205131) Google Scholar), using 11% polyacrylamide gels. Electrotransfer of proteins from SDS gels to 0.22-µm nitrocellulose sheets was described elsewhere (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44604) Google Scholar). The resulting blots were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h with 3 µg/ml of mAb D405-14 in the same buffer. Immunoreactive primary antibodies were revealed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indol phosphate (Bio-Rad). Immunodot blots were performed by spotting 30-µl aliquots in a 96-well Hybri-Dot plate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and revealed using the same procedure. Protein was determined using the Coomassie Blue assay from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Incubation of demembranated-reactivated sea urchin spermatozoa with one of the mAbs developed against sea urchin sperm axonemes, mAb D405-14, resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in motility over the 60-min reactivation period studied (Fig. 1). In contrast, incubation of the axonemes with unrelated mouse IgGs or with the commercial mAb Tub2.1 (Sigma), which recognizes β-tubulin, had no significant effect on motility. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of mAb D405-14 was not related to a nonspecific bulkiness effect on the axoneme. On immunoblots of sea urchin axonemes separated by SDS-PAGE, mAb D405-14 reacted with a single polypeptide of 33 kDa (Fig. 2A), while proteins secreted from the Sp2/0 cells used in the fusion with spleen cells of immunized mice or unrelated mouse IgGs did not recognize any sea urchin axonemal proteins. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of mAb D405-14 on sperm motility is related to its binding to this 33-kDa protein of the axoneme. The 33-kDa polypeptide (p33) recognized by mAb D405-14 was found in axonemes isolated from various sea urchin species as well as in those from carp spermatozoa (Fig. 2B). The intensity of labeling was similar for L. pictus, S. purpuratus, Paracentrotus lividus, and Arbacia lixula axonemes, while a lower intensity of labeling was observed for the carp axonemes. Interestingly, the electrophoretic mobility of the immunoreactive protein of A. lixula axoneme was slightly slower than that observed in the other urchin species, while that of carp was at similar molecular mass. No immunoreactive protein was observed on immunoblots of axonemes from wild-type C. reinhardtii (not shown). A sequential fractionation procedure was used to solubilize p33 from the sea urchin axonemes. Axonemes were first extracted with 0.6 M NaCl, a procedure known to solubilize the outer dynein arms (1Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in the solubilization of a number of high molecular weight proteins as well as in a substantial extraction of the p33 (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 1). The thermal treatment of the salt-extracted axonemes, known to selectively solubilize most of the B tubules (19Stephens R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), did not solubilize significant amounts of p33 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The pellet, enriched in A tubules, was then extracted with 0.5% Sarkosyl, a treatment that resulted in the solubilization of a large amount of axonemal proteins as well as the remainder of the 33-kDa protein. The Sarkosyl pellet predominantly contained tubulins, tektins, and two proteins of 73 and 83 kDa but was devoid of p33. This extraction pattern of the p33 was observed in all sea urchin species studied with the exception of A. lixula axoneme, where most of the p33 was extracted by the Sarkosyl treatment with a very low level of extraction by NaCl. These results thus suggest that the p33 is associated with most sea urchin sperm axonemes in two distinct manners: one that is readily extractable by high salt solutions and another, more tightly associated, that requires solubilization of most of the remaining axonemal proteins. The NaCl and Sarkosyl extracts were used as source materials for the purification of p33. For the NaCl-soluble fraction, the dialyzed salt extract was first fractionated by cation exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose beads at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4). At this pH value, most of the proteins were acidic and did not bind to the column, resulting in their elution in the flow-through. However, a significant proportion of the proteins, and the majority of the p33, were adsorbed to the column and eluted with 0.3-0.35 M NaCl. The Sarkosyl extract was fractionated according to the same procedure since most Sarkosyl-solubilized proteins remain in solution even after detergent removal. S-Sepharose chromatography of the detergent-free extract (Fig. 4) gave a nearly identical elution profile, where most of p33 was bound to the column and was separated from the bulk of the proteins of the extract that flowed through the column. The p33 was further purified by affinity chromatography using mAb D405-14 cross-linked to Protein G-Sepharose beads (Fig. 5). Active fractions from the S-Sepharose step were pooled and incubated with the beads, and bound proteins were eluted by lowering the pH of the eluent to 2.5. This treatment resulted for both the NaCl- and Sarkosyl-soluble forms in the elution of single symmetrical peaks of protein, which reacted with mAb D405-14. This procedure resulted in the purification to apparent homogeneity of the p33 from the NaCl and Sarkosyl extracts, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). The combination of S-Sepharose and mAb D405-Sepharose chromatographic steps resulted in a 320-fold enrichment of p33 with a 45% recovery from the crude NaCl extract and in a 410-fold enrichment with 23% recovery from the Sarkosyl extract (Table I).Table I.Purification of p33 from sea urchin sperm axonemesStepVolumeProteinp33ap33 was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified p33 as a standard.

Open table in a new tab Partial amino acid sequence analysis performed on the protein purified from the NaCl extract resulted in the identification of four distinct sequences. NH2-terminal sequencing of p33 yielded the sequence MIPPNASLVKYDNPVLVSRNTEK, and fragmentation of the protein with Lys-C endoproteinase yielded the sequences (K)XAEEIQFLK and (K)TQLEGIIAPXK, while fragmentation with CNBr yielded the peptide XKXITALGQE(S)REL(L)RQVNELXA. The p33 23-amino acid-long N-terminal sequence has a high homology to the N terminus of the p28 light chain of an axonemal inner arm dynein of C. reinhardtii (20LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This sequence is 78% homologous to that of p28. However, comparison of the three other sequences with those in the data base failed to reveal any significant homology to p28 or to any known proteins. Identical results were obtained by N-terminal sequencing and Lys-C endoproteinase fragmentation of the Sarkosyl form of p33 (results not shown). A search for the complete amino acid sequence of p33 was thus undertaken to examine the extent of similarity existing between this protein and p28. mAb D405-14 was used to screen a sea urchin testis cDNA library, and two positive clones were found and purified. The complete sequence of one of these clone is shown in Fig. 7. The first ATG codon is located at nucleotide position 39 and is followed by nucleotides encoding the 22 amino acids determined from purified p33, thereby confirming that this methionine is indeed the translation initiation site. The three other peptides derived from the purified protein were also found in the predicted sequence (Fig. 7, underlined), although some mismatches, probably related to protein sequencing errors, were observed. Since these peptides were not used to obtain the cDNA clone, this clearly indicates that this clone encodes the p33 protein. The coding sequence is ended by a stop codon at nucleotide position 819, followed by an untranslated 3′ region containing several in-frame stop codons. The protein is predicted to contain 260 amino acids and to have a mass of 29,730 Da. The protein is very basic (pI = 9.3), as might be expected from its behavior on S-Sepharose chromatography. Secondary structure analysis predicts that the protein forms several β-turns in its N-terminal portion (1-100), followed by a large α-helical domain from residue 150 to the C terminus. This domain also has a high probability of forming a coiled-coil structure. To compare the cloned and native proteins, the cloned protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, and the glutathione S-transferase moiety was removed by thrombin cleavage. On immunoblots, the bacterially expressed cloned protein had the same reactivity toward mAb D405-14 as that of the native protein (Fig. 8). However, the cloned protein migrated as a 30-kDa protein, in agreement with the molecular weight deduced from its nucleotide sequence, compared with 33 kDa for the purified native protein. This suggests that in its native form, the sea urchin p33 may undergo some post-translationnal modifications that shift its mobility on SDS gels. Sequence comparison of the protein revealed a high homology of its primary amino acid sequence with that of the p28 light chain of axonemal inner dynein arm from Chlamydomonas flagella (Fig. 9A). Overall, the two proteins are 66% identical and 74% similar, the similarity being more extensive for the N-terminal region (residues 1-18) and for the central domain of the protein (residues 70-190). However, one region of p33 (residues 19-53) is absent from p28. This region is extremely basic (pI = 11.5) and shows a high content of proline residues (25%). Interestingly, this sequence showed some homology (42% identical) to a C-terminal proline-rich region of the microtubule-dependent GTPase dynamin (21Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9B). This similarity is more striking for the proline residues with eight identities on 11 residues. The use of antibodies raised against axonemal proteins to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in flagellar beating has provided important information regarding the biological function of some of the axonemal proteins (22Gibbons B.H. Ogawa K. Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Asai D.J. Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Okuno M. Asai D.J. Ogawa K. Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To date, most antibodies have been directed toward previously identified structural components of the axoneme such as tubulins (23Asai D.J. Brokaw C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Asai D.J. Brokaw C.J. Thompson W.C. Wilson L. Cell Motil. 1982; 2: 599-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), radial spoke proteins (26Williams B.D. Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 101: 2085-2094Google Scholar), and outer dynein arms (22Gibbons B.H. Ogawa K. Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4717-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using these proteins in purified forms for immunization. In this work, we used a strategy involving immunization with whole axonemes and screening of the hybridoma for both their inhibition of motility and their recognition of specific axonemal proteins by immunoblotting. This approach resulted in the identification of mAbs that recognize antigens with molecular masses distinct from those of proteins described to date. One of these antibodies, mAb D405-14, was selected for its strong inhibitory effect on flagellar motility in demembranated-reactivated sperm models. This inhibition induced by mAb D405-14 appears highly specific since it was obtained by low concentrations of mAb, but it was not reproduced by control IgGs at similar or higher concentrations or by a mAb reacting with tubulin molecules (Tub2.1), even though this antibody binds tubulin with high affinity and was found to decorate the entire length of the flagellum by immunochemical techniques. 2D. Gingras, J. Cosson, P. Huitorel, and C. Gagnon, unpublished results. It is thus clear that the simple binding of an IgG molecule (present work) or IgM molecules (11Gagnon C. White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to the axoneme is not sufficient to inhibit flagellar motility. On immunoblots of axonemal proteins isolated from a variety of sea urchin and carp spermatozoa, mAb D405-14 specifically recognized a single 33-kDa polypeptide (p33), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of the antibody is related to its specific interaction with the p33. This molecular mass is distinct from that of most sea urchin axonemal proteins described to date, with the exception of flagellar histone H1, which has a mass of 34 kDa (12Multigner L. Gagnon J. Van Dorsselaer A. Job D. Nature. 1992; 360: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, p33 is definitely distinct from this protein because p33 migrates ahead of histone H1 on SDS gels, mAb D405-14 does not react with purified axonemal histone H1 on immunoblots, and antihistone polyclonal antibodies do not react with purified p33.2 Proteins from sea urchin axonemes fractionated by successive treatments with salt, heat, and detergent were used as the starting material for the purification of the protein. p33 was distributed into NaCl- and Sarkosyl-soluble fractions, where it represents about 0.3% of the total protein mass present in these extracts; since the NaCl and Sarkosyl extracts contain approximately 70% of the proteins from the axoneme, p33 can be estimated to represent 0.2% of the total axonemal proteins. Although of low abundance, the protein was purified from both extracts to apparent homogeneity by a simple 2-step procedure involving cation exchange and immunoaffinity chromatographies. The use of mAb D405-14 cross-linked to Sepharose beads represented the key step in the purification since it resulted in a high enrichment as well as in a good recovery of p33. The presence of p33 in salt-extractable and salt-resistant forms is unclear, but differences in the degree of association of proteins to the axoneme have also been observed for proteins such as inner dynein arm ATPases (28Sale W.S. Fox L.A. Milgram S.L. Warner F.D. Satir P. Gibbons I.R. Cell Movement. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 89Google Scholar) and histone H1 (12Multigner L. Gagnon J. Van Dorsselaer A. Job D. Nature. 1992; 360: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These differences are more likely to reflect differences in their association with distinct axonemal structures or proteins rather than differences in their molecular nature (28Sale W.S. Fox L.A. Milgram S.L. Warner F.D. Satir P. Gibbons I.R. Cell Movement. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 89Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA clone encoding the sea urchin p33 predicts a 30-kDa basic protein that shows extensive homology to p28, a light chain of inner dynein arm from Chlamydomonas flagellar axoneme (20LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The two proteins share similarities throughout the majority of their sequences, with the exception of a 35-amino acid stretch adjacent to the conserved N-terminal portion that is absent in the p28 light chain. This highly basic and proline-rich sequence (residues 21-53) is related to a C-terminal domain of dynamin, a microtubule-dependent GTPase (21Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in dynamin, this region has been shown to be involved in the binding of the protein to the SH3 domains of key signal-transducing proteins such as Grb2 and phospholipase Cγ (29Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The presence of this sequence in p33 may thus underlie a role in the binding of the protein to other proteins or to microtubules. However, in contrast to the Chlamydomonas p28, which associates with a subset of inner arm dynein heavy chains (20LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we have not been able to date to detect an association of p33 with dynein heavy chains or other proteins neither by sucrose gradient sedimentation or by immunoprecipitation,2 and p33 did not copurify with other proteins despite the very mild conditions used in the purification scheme. Although light chains have long been recognized as components of dynein arm complexes, their functional role in motor activity still remains unclear. The recently cloned p28 has, however, been suggested to play a critical role in the stable assembly of the heavy chains or for the binding of inner dynein arms to the axoneme (30LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An important function of light chains has also been suggested in Paramecium tetraurelia, where the phosphorylation of a 29-kDa light chain associated with the outer dynein arm appears to regulate motor activity (31Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on the high inhibitory effect of the anti-p33 on sea urchin flagellar motility, the potential relationship of p33 to a dynein light chain raises the interesting possibility that these chains may be involved in the regulation of the flagellar motility process. Whether this involvement is related to an association with other axonemal proteins or to a direct interaction with the dynein motor domain remains to be investigated. We are grateful to V. Vacquier for the kind gift of the sea urchin testis library, to R. Billard and G. Perchec for providing us with carp axonemes, and to G. Piperno for the Chlamydomonas axonemes."

Conservation of the SRP RNA binding activity of EF-G from Bacillus subtilis suggests that the binding of EF-G to SRP RNA is essential for its function."
https://openalex.org/W2047281965,"Human cytoplasmic antiproteinase (CAP) is an intracellular serpin that has been reported to utilize Arg341 as the reactive site P1 residue to neutralize a broad variety of extracellular serine proteases with trypsin-like specificity. Both native CAP and recombinant CAP purified from Escherichia coli were observed to form SDS-stable complexes not only with 125I-thrombin and 125I-urokinase, but also with 125I-chymotrypsin. Kinetic studies indicated that the amidolytic activity of chymotrypsin is inhibited efficiently and rapidly by CAP in a two-step process with a dissociation constant Ki of an initial loose complex of 3.3 nM, a forward isomerization rate constant k2 to the tight complex of 0.014 s−1, and an overall second order association rate constant of 6 × 106M−1 s−1, similar to the kinetic constants obtained for the formation of the trypsin-CAP complex. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry indicated that chymotrypsin interacts with CAP at Met340, in contrast to thrombin, which interacts as expected at Arg341. Thus, CAP is the first serpin that has been shown to be capable to inhibit efficiently and with similar association rate constants different proteases at distinct reactive site residues, strongly supporting the notion of a highly mobile and flexible serpin reactive site loop and suggesting that this inhibitor may have evolved separate reactive sites for the specific regulation of different proteolytic activities.

Serine proteinase inhibitors or serpins are a ubiquitous superfamily of homologous proteins that resemble α1-proteinase inhibitor in overall structure and include antithrombin III, α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP), 1The abbreviations used are: α2-APα2-antiplasminBSAbovine serum albuminCAPcytoplasmic antiproteinaserCAPrecombinant fusion protein of a peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues and CAPDTTdithiothreitolPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Google Scholar). In general, serpins contain a highly exposed reactive site loop near the carboxyl terminus of the molecule that interacts as a pseudosubstrate for the target protease. The inhibitory specificity of the serpin is in part defined by the P1 amino acid residue in the reactive site loop, e.g. proteases of trypsin-like specificity attack efficiently peptide bonds after arginine and lysine residues, whereas chymotrypsin favors large hydrophobic amino acids in the P1 position (2Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; : 1249-1253Google Scholar). Interaction of the P1 amino acid with the active site of the target protease triggers a conformational change in the serpin that results in a stoichiometric 1:1 inhibitory complex with the protease generally detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (3Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Google Scholar). In this manner, serpins play crucial roles in regulating proteolytic enzymes that are involved in a wide variety of vital processes including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement activation, inflammation, and cell migration (3Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Google Scholar). In addition to the serpins that regulate protease activity, several members of this superfamily lack a protease-inhibitory capability and have other physiological roles. These latter proteins were originally identified as serpins by data base searching and include thyroxine binding globulin, angiotensinogen, and ovalbumin (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Google Scholar, 4Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Google Scholar). Ovalbumin represents the prototype of a unique family of proteins within the serpin superfamily, which have several structural features in common, including the absence of a typical cleavable signal sequence, but have been found to reside extracellularly, intracellularly, or both (5Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Google Scholar). Initial members of this ovalbumin family of serpin proteins (ov-serpins) include the human proteins plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (6Ye R.D. Wun T.C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3718-3725Google Scholar), monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (7Remold-O'Donnell E. Chin J. Alberts M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5635-5639Google Scholar), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (8Suminami Y. Kishi F. Sekiguchi K. Kato H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 51-58Google Scholar). More recently identified members of the human ov-serpins include a tumor suppressor called maspin (9Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Google Scholar), which is presumably not a protease inhibitor (10Hopkins P.C.R. Whisstock J. Science. 1994; 265: 1893-1894Google Scholar, 11Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Google Scholar), a bone marrow-associated inhibitory serpin, designated bomapin (12Riewald M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26754-26757Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic antiproteinase or CAP (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar), also known as protease inhibitor 6 (14Sun J. Rose J.B. Bird P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16089-16096Google Scholar) or as placental thrombin inhibitor (15Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Google Scholar). α2-antiplasmin bovine serum albumin cytoplasmic antiproteinase recombinant fusion protein of a peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues and CAP dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CAP is an intracellular, probably cytoplasmic serpin that is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues including platelets (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A.

Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of CAP with other serpins indicated that the P1 reactive site loop residue in this inhibitor is Arg341 (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar, 15Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Google Scholar), consistent with the observation that CAP forms SDS-stable complexes with and inhibits several trypsin-like proteases including thrombin, trypsin, urokinase, plasmin, and factor Xa (16Morgenstern K.A. Henzel W.J. Baker J.B. Wong S. Pastuszyn A. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21560-21568Google Scholar, 20Eaton D.L. Baker J.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 175-182Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H.H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic proteases play a key role in a variety of cellular functions (22Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar, 23Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Google Scholar), and our recent observations indicate that platelet CAP may interact with an endogenous protease upon platelet activation (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). However, the identity of intracellular target proteases for CAP or any other ov-serpin remain currently elusive. In order to obtain sufficient quantities of CAP for analyzing its interaction with different classes of proteases, we decided to generate large quantities of this inhibitor in recombinant form. This report details the expression of functionally active CAP in bacterial cells, and we demonstrate that CAP rapidly inhibits chymotrypsin at Met340, suggesting that this inhibitor may have evolved separate reactive sites for the specific regulation of different proteolytic activities. Moreover, in contrast to the previously observed dissociation of complexes between CAP and trypsin-like proteases, no release of active chymotrypsin from the chymotrypsin/CAP complex was detected. The cDNA encoding CAP was isolated using the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was extracted from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated human erythroleukemic cells, reverse transcribed, and amplified utilizing CAP-specific primers that were designed based on the published nucleotide sequence (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar), i.e. GTA CTG CTC GAG GTC TGC CAT CAT GGA TGT TC (sense; base position 179–198) and GAT GAC GAA TTC CTG CCC TGT CCT CAC GGA GA (antisense; base position 1330-1311). Primers included 12-base pair 5′ overhangs containing the unique restriction sites XhoI and EcoRI, respectively. Amplification products were cloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and both strands of the CAP coding region were sequenced completely by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Subsequently, the entire coding region for CAP was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) utilizing the XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. This construct leads to the synthesis of CAP fused to a 39-amino acid N-terminal peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues as an affinity tag for purification (i.e. MGGSH HHHHH GMASM TGGQQ MGRDL YDDDD KDPSS RSAI). After transformation into Escherichia coli XL-1 blue, rCAP expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactoside to a plasmid-carrying clone growing in log phase (optical density at 600 nm = 1.0) in the presence of 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C. The bacterial cells were grown for an additional 4 h (37°C), harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, and resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold sonication buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol) per liter of culture volume, frozen in liquid nitrogen, slowly thawed in cold water, and kept at 4°C for all subsequent purification steps. The freeze-thawed cells were extensively sonicated (Astrason Ultrasonic Processor XL; Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY), cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a column containing 1 ml of Ni2+ charged Sepharose (Invitrogen) per liter of culture volume. The column was washed at a flow rate of 30 ml/h with 100 ml of sonication buffer followed by 500 ml of wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 ml of wash buffer without Triton X-100. Bound proteins were subsequently eluted utilizing a 30-ml gradient of 0-0.5 M imidazole in wash buffer, optical density at 280 nm in 2-ml column fractions was determined, the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by either silver staining or immunoblotting (described below), and the fractions containing recombinant CAP were pooled. After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 6.4 mM Na2HPO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.33) containing 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, aliquots of the rCAP preparation were stored at −80°C. Consistent with earlier reports (15Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Google Scholar, 16Morgenstern K.A. Henzel W.J. Baker J.B. Wong S. Pastuszyn A. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21560-21568Google Scholar), we observed that rCAP activity is stabilized in the presence of 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. High purity human α-thrombin (Sigma T6759; 3000 units/mg protein), high molecular weight human urokinase (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT), and 3 × crystallized bovine α-chymotrypsin (Sigma C3142, Type VII) were used in the kinetic studies. Proteases were radiolabeled with 125I utilizing immobilized chloramine T (Iodo-Beads; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Specific radioactivities between 0.8 × 104 and 1.4 × 104 cpm/ng of protein were routinely obtained. Suspensions of washed human platelets were prepared as described previously (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Briefly, blood from normal individuals was collected into acid-citrate-dextrose, and platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation followed by three washing steps (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Samples were incubated in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) either at 100°C for 3 min or at 65°C for 5 min, as stated in the figure legends. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using 4% stacking and 9% separating polyacrylamide slab gels unless stated otherwise. Protein molecular weight standards were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Following electrophoresis, the gels were analyzed by silver staining, dried, and exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24–48 h utilizing intensifying screens as described (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Alternatively, protein A-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-CAP immunoglobulin G was prepared and used for immunoblotting as described previously (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Corp.) was utilized as the secondary antibody followed by detection using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). The chromogenic substrates S-2238 (for thrombin and trypsin) and S-2586 (for chymotrypsin) were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Catalytic constants for hydrolysis of these chromogenic substrates were determined (Lineweaver-Burke plots) in PBS containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma A-7906) at 23°C. Km values under these conditions were 10 µM for thrombin and S-2238, 34 µM for trypsin and S-2238, and 37 µM for chymotrypsin and S-2586. Thrombin and trypsin were active site-titrated with p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate (26Chase T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Google Scholar), and chymotrypsin was titrated with p-nitrophenyl acetate (27Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 3-20Google Scholar). The concentration of active inhibitor in preparations of rCAP was determined by incubating 25 nM thrombin, trypsin, or chymotrypsin in a total volume of 100 µl of PBS, 0.01% BSA with increasing concentrations of rCAP for 60 min at 23°C in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The wells were in all experiments previously blocked with 200 µl of PBS, 0.1% BSA for 60 min at 23°C. Residual amidolytic activity was analyzed after the addition of 50 µl 0.5 mM S-2238 (for thrombin and trypsin) or S-2586 (for chymotrypsin) in PBS, 0.01% BSA by monitoring the rate of p-nitroaniline release for 10 min at 405 nm using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Inc., Menlo Park, CA). The rate of substrate hydrolysis was plotted as a function of the molar amount of rCAP added to the individual reaction wells, and extrapolation to the x-intercept allowed the calculation of the precise concentration of rCAP capable of forming an inhibitory complex with the specific protease. Overall inhibition rates of thrombin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin by rCAP were measured under second order rate conditions by allowing equimolar concentrations of protease and inhibitor (0.5 nM) in 100 µl of PBS, 0.01% BSA to react for increasing periods of time before the addition of 50 µl of S-2238 or S-2586 in PBS, 0.01% BSA to a final concentration of 1 mM, which stops the association reaction and measures the residual amidolytic activity (28Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Google Scholar). The variation of the residual free protease concentration [E] with time (t) obeys the equation, [E]=[E]0/(1+[E]0kat)(Eq. 1) where [E]0 is the initial protease concentration. Estimates for the apparent second order rate constants ka were determined by fitting the observed data to Eq. 1 by nonlinear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot software package (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). All experiments were performed in duplicate wells and included controls where protease or rCAP had been replaced with assay buffer. A continuous assay method was utilized to analyze the interaction of rCAP with chymotrypsin in more detail (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar, 29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar, 30Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Google Scholar). The onset of inhibition was monitored by adding chymotrypsin (final concentration, 0.35 nM) to a mixture of rCAP and S-2586 (final concentration, 0.33 mM). The generation of p-nitroaniline in the presence of different rCAP concentrations (0–24 nM) was measured over time (t) for up to 8 h. Values of the determined absorbance at 405 nm (A) were fitted to the integrated rate equation for slow binding inhibition (29Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar), A=vst+(v0−vs)(1−e−k′t)/k′+A0(Eq. 2) by nonlinear regression analysis, generating values for v0 (initial rate), vS (final steady-state rate), k′ (apparent pseudo-first order rate constant for the transition from v0 to vS) and A0 (the initial absorbance at 405 nm) for each of the inhibition curves. Kinetic constants for the inhibition of chymotrypsin by rCAP were derived from these values by various methods (see “Results”). Automated Edman degradation was carried out using the Procise Protein Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, Uppsala, Sweden) with on-line analysis of the phenylthiohydantoins by microgradient high pressure liquid chromatography. Mass spectra were acquired by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry in a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a 2-m flight tube and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Spectra were sampled at a laser repetition rate of 20 Hz and a sampling rate of 250 MHz using sinapinic (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic) acid as matrix. Because current information indicates that native CAP is expressed as a cytoplasmic, presumably nonglycosylated protein without intramolecular disulfide bonds (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar, 15Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Google Scholar), we investigated the applicability of utilizing a prokaryotic expression system for the preparation of large quantities of this inhibitor. The complete coding region of CAP (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using CAP-specific primers and reverse transcribed RNA from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated human erythroleukemia cells as the template. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHisB, and DNA sequencing confirmed sequence identity of a polymerase chain reaction product with the published CAP sequence (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar) preceded in frame by the coding region for an N-terminal peptide containing six consecutive histidine residues. Following growth and induction of E. coli XL-1 blue carrying this pTrcHisB/CAP expression construct, the cells were lysed, and recombinant fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-charged Sepharose. Approximately 500 µg of purified rCAP were obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture, and the preparation exhibited a single major band at 45 kDa upon SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 1A; Fig. 3, lane 1). The apparent molecular mass of this protein corresponds to the combined calculated masses of the N-terminal fusion peptide (4.1 kDa) and CAP (42.6 kDa). A minor additional band at 42 kDa may represent reactive site cleaved rCAP. In order to determine the functional activity of rCAP, we tested its ability to form SDS-stable complexes with two known target proteases. Fig. 1B (lanes 4 and 7) demonstrates formation of appropriately sized complexes following incubation of rCAP with either 125I-thrombin or 125I-urokinase, respectively. We have previously shown (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar) that human platelets contain relatively large quantities of CAP and that complexes of native platelet CAP and several trypsin-like proteases including thrombin and urokinase unfold to a higher apparent molecular mass upon boiling in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). 125I-thrombin·rCAP and 125I-urokinase·rCAP complexes undergo a similar temperature-dependent unfolding transition (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 6 and 7, respectively), suggesting similar conformational stability of native CAP- and rCAP-containing complexes.Fig. 3Effect of increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin and trypsin on the detection of SDS-stable complexes with rCAP. rCAP (10 pmol based on trypsin-inhibiting activity) was incubated alone (lane 1) or in the presence of 6 pmol (lanes 2 and 6), 8 pmol (lanes 3 and 7), 10 pmol (lanes 4 and 8), and 12 pmol (lanes 5 and 9) of chymotrypsin (lanes 2–5) or trypsin (lanes 6–9) in a volume of 50 µl of PBS (23°C, 30 min). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer (100 mM DTT), and the samples were heated to 100°C for 3 min followed by SDS-PAGE and staining with silver nitrate. Molecular mass markers are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CAP is known to form SDS-stable complexes with a broad spectrum of trypsin-like proteases (16Morgenstern K.A. Henzel W.J. Baker J.B. Wong S. Pastuszyn A. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21560-21568Google Scholar, 20Eaton D.L. Baker J.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 175-182Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H.H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Google Scholar), and consistent with these observations arginine has been identified by sequence alignment as the reactive site loop P1 residue in this inhibitor (13Morgenstern K.A. Sprecher C. Holth L. Foster D. Grant F.J. Ching A. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3432-3441Google Scholar, 15Coughlin P. Sun J. Cerruti L. Salem H.H. Bird P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9417-9421Google Scholar). To understand the interaction of CAP with other classes of proteases, we investigated the interaction of CAP with chymotrypsin, a protease that cleaves substrate proteins preferentially after large hydrophobic amino acids, but not after arginine residues (2Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; : 1249-1253Google Scholar). Purified rCAP (Fig. 2, A and C) and whole platelet lysates (Fig. 2B) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-chymotrypsin, subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a membrane. The membrane was first analyzed by Western blotting utilizing specific antibodies against CAP (19Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Google Scholar) and a chemiluminescent detection system (Fig. 2, right lanes), followed by autoradiography to detect 125I-chymotrypsin-containing bands (Fig. 2, left lanes). In this manner, CAP and chymotrypsin were localized independently on the same membrane, allowing unambiguous identification of SDS-stable complexes between these proteins. Active chymotrypsin contains either two (1.3 + 23.7 kDa) or three (1.3 + 13.5 + 10.1 kDa) disulfide-linked polypeptide chains with the active site serine residue located in the C-terminal 23.7-kDa and 10.1-kDa fragments of the two- and three-chain forms, respectively (31Sharma S.K. Hopkins T.R. Bioorg. Chem. 1981; 10: 357-374Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that rCAP (panel A) and native platelet CAP (panel B) form SDS-stable complexes with chymotrypsin. Other SDS-stable complexes with 125I-chymotrypsin in platelet lysates (panel B) may contain α1-proteinase inhibitor and α2-AP, which are known to be present in platelets (32Nachman R.L. Harpel P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4514-4521Google Scholar, 33Gogstad G.O. Stormorken H. Solum N.O. Thromb. Res. 1983; 31: 387-390Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin-CAP complexes unfold only upon boiling to an apparent molecular mass corresponding to the combined molecular masses of the serpin and the C-terminal chymotrypsin chains (panel C), as observed for complexes of trypsin-like proteases and either native or recombinant CAP (Fig. 1B). We next analyzed whether chymotrypsin is actually inhibited in the complex with CAP. Active site titrated proteases were used to determine the concentration of rCAP in our preparation with inhibitory activity. Based upon the total protein content, 97, 93, and 75% of the rCAP inhibited the amidolytic activities of thrombin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, respectively. These data indicate that the rCAP preparation is predominantly in an active form and that rCAP not only forms SDS-stable complexes with chymotrypsin but also inhibits this protease. However, the reduced inhibitory activity of the rCAP preparation against chymotrypsin suggested that this protease may also be capable of cleaving a portion of rCAP into an inactive form. To examine this possibility, the molecular species of rCAP that result following its incubation with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin were compared with the profile following the incubation of rCAP with comparable concentrations of trypsin. Fig. 3 indicates that the amounts of chymotrypsin-rCAP (lanes 2–5) and trypsin-rCAP (lanes 6–9) complexes detected by SDS-PAGE decrease as the enzyme:inhibitor ratio approaches or exceeds 1:1 on a molar basis. More specifically, incubation of chymotrypsin and rCAP at 0.6:1 and 0.8:1 ratios (lanes 2 and 3) results in the appearance of 55- and 69-kDa complexes and the detection of a 42-kDa cleavage product, whereas incubation of chymotrypsin-rCAP at 1.0:1 and 1.2:1 ratios (lanes 4 and 5) results in the formation of lower molecular mass species (i.e. 44 and 39 kDa). Similarly, increasing the trypsin:rCAP ratio to 1.2:1 (lane 9) results in a loss of 67-kDa trypsin-rCAP complexes and the appearance of a number of lower molecular mass species. Thus, incubation of rCAP with a molar excess of either chymotrypsin or trypsin results in a decrease in the detection of SDS-stable complexes and the appearance of lower molecular mass species, presumably representing proteolytic degradation of protease-rCAP complexes. Importantly, these observations are consistent with our analysis of inhibition of amidolytic activity (reported above) indicating that approximately 80% of the rCAP with trypsin-inhibiting activity inhibits chymotrypsin under the current assay conditions. To further define the interaction of chymotrypsin with rCAP, second order rate constants were calculated following the incubation of rCAP with equimolar concentrations of chymotrypsin as well as with equimolar concentratio"

Recruitment of gp130 by IL-6 associated to its receptor leads to the dimerization of the transducing component. In the present study we did characterize the B-S12 monoclonal antibody raised against gp130 and able to elicit IL-6 type biological activities. B-S12 antibody triggered strongly the proliferation of TF1 and XG1 hematopoietic cell lines and was able to increase the synthesis of acute phase proteins in HepG2 hepatoma cell line. B-S12 also behaved as a synergistic factor with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for both proliferation and differentiation of CD34-positive hematopoietic cell progenitors. By using a symmetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, allowing the detection of dimeric forms of soluble gp130, we found that addition of B-S12 to gp130 led to its dimerization. Analysis of the tyrosine phosphorylation events in gp130 and Jak kinase family members revealed that B-S12 quickly induced the phosphorylation of gp130 in a neural derived cell line, and that Jak1 and Jak2 were also recruited. In conclusion, we show that gp130 cross-linking with the B-S12 monoclonal antibody was sufficient to generate functional IL-6 type responses in hematopoietic, neural, and hepatic cells. gp130 transducing receptor is involved in the formation of high affinity receptors for the cytokines of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family.

Blood. 1989; 73: 517-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the culture medium was supplemented, respectively, with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF and 1 ng/ml IL-6. Purified human recombinant LIF (108 units/mg) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell line, Escherichia coli recombinant GM-CSF (108 units/mg), and human soluble IL-6 receptor were kindly donated by Drs. K. Turner and M. Stahl (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA). IL-6 (107 units/mg) and OSM (106 units/mg) were purchased from Peprotech (Canton, MA). Soluble human gp130 was bought from R& Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Purified B-S12 monoclonal antibody (IgG1) obtained as described previously 2S. Chevalier, M. Fourcin, O. Robledo, J. Wijdenes, A. Pouplard-Barthelaix, and H. Gascan, submitted for publication. was kindly provided by Dr. John Wijdenes from Diaclone (Besançon, France). B-S12 and control IgG1 Fab fragments were generated by using immobilized papain from Pierce, following the manufacturer's instructions. Fab fragments were then separated from Fc fragments on a protein A column.BioassaysSerial dilutions of antibodies or cytokines were added to 15 × 103 TF1 or XG1 cells in triplicate in the assay(39.Fourcin M.

The cells were then incubated for 72 h before being pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]Tdr for the last 4 h of the culture. HepG2 hepatoma cell line was plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at a concentration of 50 × 103 cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10-6M dexamethasone, and serial dilutions of IL-6 or antibodies (40.Gauldie J.C.

After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested and the haptoglobin content determined by ELISA as described previously(41.Lecron J.C. Roblot P. Chevalier S. Morel F. Alderman E. Gombert J. Gascan H. Clin. Exp.

Purity of the cells was controlled on a FACScan by using an anti-CD34 phycoerythrin-labeled antibody (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and was routinely >97% CD34-positive cells. One hundred CD34-positive purified cells were seeded in 24-well plates in triplicate in Iscove's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 0.8% methylcellulose, 5 × 10-5M β-mercaptoethanol, and the indicated combination of cytokines or antibodies. After a 14-day culture period, the colony number was scored.Soluble gp130 Symmetric ELISADetection of the dimeric form of soluble gp130 was achieved by coating the ELISA plates with the B-T12 monoclonal antibody2 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 100 mM carbonate buffer, pH 8.6. After washing and a saturation step, 2 nM soluble gp130 supplemented with 2 nM IL-6 plus 2 nM soluble IL-6 receptor, or 6 nM B-S12 anti-gp130 antibody were added to the wells for an overnight incubation at 4°C. Biotinylated B-T12 mAb was used as tracer antibody at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After a 6-h incubation at 37°C, streptavidin peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was added at a 1/20,000 dilution for an additional 1-h incubation step. ABTS was used as substrate and the reading performed at 405 nM.Tyrosine Phosphorylation AnalysisCells were stimulated with OSM or antibodies before being lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors. After pelleting insoluble material and protein standardization, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated in the presence of B-T2 antibody raised against gp1302, anti-Jak1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI), Lake Placid, NY), or anti-Jak2 antibody (UBI). The complexes were then isolated with beads coupled to protein A, submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated in the presence of 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, followed by an incubation with a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin polyclonal antibody labeled with peroxidase (Tago, Camarillo, CA). The reaction was visualized on a x-ray film with ECL reagent (Amersham, Les Ulis, France) following the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONB-S12 Antibody Triggered the Proliferative Response of Hematopoietic Cell Lines and Increased Protein Transcription in HepG2 Hepatoma Cell LineWe recently characterized a set of new monoclonal antibodies raised against the gp130 transducing protein.2 During the time course of the antibody screening, we did identify the B-S12 mAb, which, in contrast to most other identified antibodies, displayed agonistic properties in several bioassays. The stimulatory properties of the B-S12 antibody were first analyzed by using two human hematopoietic cell lines, XG1 and TF1, respectively, known to be sensitive to the cytokines activating the gp130 transduction pathway and both gp130 and gp190/LIF receptor systems(38.Klein B. Zhang X.G. Jourdan M. Content J. Houssiau F. Aarden L. Piechaczyk M. Bataille R. Blood. 1989; 73: 517-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Lebrun J.J. Kelly P. Pouplard A. Wijdenes J. Gascan H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). B-S12 mAb was found to strongly trigger the proliferation of TF1 erythroleukemia cell line and XG1 multiple myeloma cell line, whereas a control IgG1 did not support the proliferation of these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). This result indicates that the B-S12 antibody can bypass the cytokine requirement to activate the gp130 pathway, and that recruitment of an α binding component was not necessary to generate a functional response. A series of reports had shown that the integrity of two proximal motifs in the intracellular part of gp130, and known as box 1 and 2, were sufficient to generate a proliferative response(33.Stahl N.

Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that regulation of gene transcription in hepatoma or neuroblastoma cell lines was under the dependence of an additional gp130 motif called box 3, and implicating the recruitment of STAT3 shuttle transducing protein(33.Stahl N. Farrugella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 42.Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Asukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, we have tried to further characterize the functional properties of the B-S12 antibody in order to know, if in addition to its ability to stimulate cell proliferation, the antibody could also increase gene transcription. The experiments were performed in HepG2 hepatoma cell line where the induction of haptoglobin secretion was monitored. Fig. 1C shows that B-S12 antibody was able to up-regulate the induction of haptoglobin secretion, whereas an IgG1 control antibody was without effect. Nevertheless, B-S12 was about a thousandfold less potent than IL-6 used as positive control. This result shows that gp130 activation pathway by the B-S12 antibody led not only to a proliferative response, as observed in the hematopoietic cell lines, but also to an increase gene transcription in hepatic cells.B-S12 Antibody Induced Both Proliferation and Differentiation of CD34 Hematopoietic ProgenitorsSeveral IL-6-related cytokines were reported to display synergistic activities on both proliferation and differentiation processes of hematopoietic cells. To examine the potential role of the B-S12 anti-gp130 antibody on the expansion of hematopoietic cell progenitors, its effect was tested in combination with GM-CSF on purified human CD34-positive cells by using a methylcellulose clonal assay. B-S12 antibody alone, like the IgG1 isotype control did not induce colony formation (Table 1). Addition of 1 ng/ml GM-CSF to the culture stimulated the generation of 11 ± 1.4 colonies after a 2-week culture period. To assess the synergistic effect of IL-6 type cytokines in the culture system, LIF was preferred to IL-6 because this latest cytokine only displayed weak effects in human CD34 cell culture and the adjunction of soluble IL-6 receptor was usually required to observe a response(43.Sui X. Tsuji K. Tanaka R. Tajima S. Muraoka K. Ebihara Y. Ikebuchi K. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakahata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2859-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Addition of LIF to GM-CSF doubled the score of colonies in the cultures in agreement with the published studies(10.Leary A.G. Wong G.G. Clark S.C. Smith A.G. Ogawa M. Blood. 1990; 75: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Verfaillie C. McGlave P. Blood. 1991; 77: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained by introducing B-S12 antibody in combination with GM-CSF in the CD34-positive cell cultures. Moreover, the average size of the observed colonies generated in the presence of B-S12 and GM-CSF was twice larger than those detected in the presence of GM-CSF alone. 3In the present study, the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, blast cell colonies, and mixed colonies has been cumulated; the phenotypic detail of the generated colonies will be presented in another study. These experiments show that B-S12 antibody, like most of the cytokines belonging to the IL-6 family, synergistically promoted potent expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro.Tabled 1B-S12 Antibody-induced Dimerization of the gp130 Transducing ProteinFab fragments were generated from the B-S12 antibody and tested in the proliferative TF1 assay to determine whether the observed agonistic properties of the antibody were dependent on the presence of the two functional sites expressed by the immunoglobulin. Fig. 2A shows that B-S12-derived Fab fragments failed to trigger the proliferation of the TF1 cell line. Cross-linking of the Fab fragments by using a second antibody recognizing the mouse immunoglobulins did not allow the restoration of a functional signal, indicating that a very precise configuration of the antibody was likely required to bring the proliferative information. In addition, coating of Fab fragments to a plastic dish did not restore the signal (data not shown). The lost of biological properties of the Fab fragments indicates that B-S12 might induce a dimerization of gp130 transducing protein to generate a biological response. To assess this hypothesis, induction of gp130 dimerization was analyzed in a symmetric ELISA where the same B-T12 anti-gp130 mAb was used as coating and tracer antibody. In these conditions the detection of an increased optical density value will be a reflection of the dimerization of the soluble form of gp130. As shown in Fig. 2B, addition of 2 nM soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 to 2 nM soluble gp130 conducted to an increased signal in the symmetric gp130 ELISA. This result sustains the notion that IL-6, IL-6 receptor and gp130 can reassociate together in solution to generate a trimeric, or an hexameric complex as reported before(45.Paonessa G. Graziani R.

Hammacher J. Moritz R. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23286-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar manner introduction of the B-S12 antibody, instead of IL-6 and its soluble receptor, led to a dimerization of the soluble form of gp130 transducing protein. Interestingly B-S12 antibody failed to inhibit IL-6-driven proliferation of the TF1 cell line and did not interfere with the binding of radiolabeled IL-6 to its high affinity receptor (data not shown). These results indicate that the antibody and the cytokine recruited gp130 through different functional sites.Figure 2:B-S12 anti-gp130 antibody-induced dimerization of the receptor transducing component. In A, 15,000 TF1 cells were cultured in the presence 20 μg/ml B-S12 mAb (black bars), IgG1 control mAb (hatched bars), or 20 μg/ml Fab-derived fragments from B-S12 antibody and IgG1 isotype control, or a combination Fab-derived fragments (20 μg/ml) plus 20 μg/ml goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Gam). After a 72-h culture period, a [3H]Tdr pulse was performed and the incorporated radioactivity determined by using a β counter. In B, soluble gp130-induced dimerization was measured in a symmetric ELISA using the same B-T12 anti-gp130 mAb as coating and tracer antibody. After coating and plate saturation, 2 nM soluble gp130, 2 nM IL-6, 2 nM soluble IL-6 receptor, or 6 nM B-S12 mAb were added to the wells as indicated for an overnight incubation step. Biotinylated B-T12 mAb was used as second antibody and peroxidase-labeled avidin used for the detection. Reading was carried out at 405 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)gp130 and Jak Family Members Were Tyrosine-phosphorylated in Response to B-S12 StimulationReceptor activation by the IL-6 family of cytokines results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the transducing receptor subunits and downstream regulatory proteins(32.Stahl N.

Functional activation of gp130 transducer by B-S12 antibody was assessed by analyzing tyrosine phosphorylation of the transducing protein. The experiments were performed by using the SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell line, since IL-6-related cytokines displayed many effects in neuronal tissue and, in addition, gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation was readily detectable in this cell line. Fig. 3A shows that the recruitment of gp130, and its tyrosine phosphorylation by the B-S12 antibody was dose-dependent. After a 5-min interaction with the agonistic antibody tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 could already be detected (Fig. 3B). The observed signal peaked after a 20-min contact, but remained weaker than the one observed by incubating the SK-N-MC cell line in the presence of OSM. A control antibody added in the culture for 20 min did not activate gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation underlining the specificity of the detected signal. Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 kinases have been shown to be implicated in the activation of gp130 and gp190/LIF receptor(32.Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farrugella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W.

The Ca2+-induced suppression of c-myb mRNA could be inhibited by the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, as well as by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin). KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, did not antagonize the Ca2+-mediated decrease in c-myb mRNA. In cyclosporin A-treated ELM-I-1 cells, a close correlation could be demonstrated between the antagonization of the Ca2+ effect on c-myb mRNA levels and inhibition of the calcineurin phophatase activity. On the other hand, FK506, which did not inhibit calcineurin activity in ELM-I-1 cells, failed to prevent the Ca2+-mediated decrease in c-myb mRNA. The erythropoietin-induced down-regulation of c-myb mRNA levels could be demonstrated also in the presence of EGTA and was resistant to calmodulin antagonists and cyclosporin A. In addition, no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed in ELM-I-1 cells in response to erythropoietin. Cyclosporin A inhibited the Ca2+-induced hemoglobin production, while the erythropoietin-mediated increase in hemoglobin synthesis was not affected. The results indicate that the Ca2+-induced decrease in c-myb mRNA and increase in hemoglobin synthesis is mediated by calcineurin, while these effects of erythropoietin occur independently of Ca2+ in ELM-I-1 cells. Calcineurin may be involved in the regulation of c-myb expression in erythroid precursor cells and Ca2+ signals via calcineurin may positively modulate the differentiation inducing action of erythropoietin.

We investigated whether K3L can inhibit the activity of the yeast eIF-2α kinase GCN2. Expression of K3L protein in yeast reduced the level of eIF-2α phosphorylation by GCN2 and blocked the stimulation of the general amino acid control pathway in response to starvation conditions. Accompanying in vitro studies showed that recombinant K3L protein reduced GCN2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation eIF-2α. In agreement with the hypothesis that K3L inhibits eIF-2α kinases by functioning as a pseudosubstrate, we observed that K3L directly interacted with the kinase catalytic domain of GCN2. Together, these results indicate that K3L is a specific inhibitor of eIF-2α kinases from mammals and yeast and suggest that the kinases contain common structural features important for recognition of their substrate eIF-2α.

https://openalex.org/W2059813020,"The present study was undertaken to determine kinetic and inhibition parameters and the mechanism of S-adenosyl-L-methionine:calmodulin-L-lysine N6-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.60, CLNMT), an enzyme for which calmodulin is a substrate. Partially purified CLNMT isolated from rat testes had a Vmax of 540 pmol/min/mg and Km values for mushroom demethylcalmodulin and S-adenosyl-L-methionine of 230 nM and 2.0 microM, respectively. Kinetic analysis indicated a complex Bi Bi sequential kinetic mechanism for CLNMT where S-adenosyl-L-methionine binds initially and is followed by demethylcalmodulin binding. When the effects of 20 different compounds that are either inhibitors of calmodulin-specific or methylation-specific functions were examined, CLNMT displayed a pattern of inhibition which differs from that seen with calmodulin-activated enzymes. The product of calmodulin methylation, fully trimethylated calmodulin, and nonmethylatable VU-3 calmodulin acted as competitive inhibitors of CLNMT, with Ki values of 310 and 400 nM, respectively. Of the 13 compounds tested, which are inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, only the calmodulin-binding domain from Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, melittin, and calmidazolium were effective inhibitors of CLNMT and each exhibited a complex pattern of inhibition with Kis values of 21, 50, and 65 nM, respectively. The only potent methylation-specific inhibitor was S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, which also displayed a complex pattern of inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1983585149,"We have examined the effects of three commonly used classes of guanine nucleotide analogues on the retinal G protein, transducin (Gt), and found them to be quite different from those that might be expected from results with other GTP-binding proteins. The most surprising results were with guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS); rather than inhibiting activation of Gt, GDPβS addition activated Gt as a result of a trace contaminant. Even when the contaminant levels were reduced 5-fold by chromatography, its effects dominated those of GDPβS, which binds Gt at least 1500-fold more weakly than guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS). The affinity of Gt for GDP was found to be at least 300-fold weaker than for GTPγS, while the affinities of GTP and GTPγS were similar. Ribose-modified GTP analogues, including 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) GTP (mantGTP), 2′(3′)-O-[(2-aminoethyl)carbamyl] GTP (edGTP), and adducts of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate and rhodamine B-isothiocyanate with edGTP, interacted extremely weakly, if at all, with the GTP binding site of the α subunit of Gt. They were neither effective activators of Gt nor effective inhibitors of activation by GTP or GTPγS. A γ-phosphoryl-modified analogue, an adduct of GTPγS and (5-(2(iodoacetyl)aminoethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (dnsGTP), also activated Gt weakly, if at all, and did not inhibit its activation. The exclusion of these analogues points to the highly restrictive and specific nature of the GTP binding site of Gt, in contrast to those of numerous other GTP-binding proteins which are potently activated or inhibited by these analogues."
