https://openalex.org/W2085875957,"The mucosal vascular addressin, MAdCAM-1, is an immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecule for lymphocytes that is expressed by mucosal venules and helps direct lymphocyte traffic into Peyer's patches (PP) and the intestinal lamina propria. We demonstrate that the lymphocyte integrin alpha 4 beta 7, also implicated in homing to PP, is a receptor for MAdCAM-1. Certain antibodies to alpha 4 and beta 7 integrin chains but not to the beta 2 integrin LFA-1 inhibit lymphocyte binding to purified MAdCAM-1 and to MAdCAM-1 transfectants. Lymph node lymphocytes, alpha 4 beta 7+ TK1 lymphoma cells, and a beta 7-transfected variant of an alpha 4+ B cell line, 38C13, bind constitutively to MAdCAM-1. Binding is enhanced by Mn(++)-induced integrin activation. The related integrin alpha 4 beta 1 supports efficient binding to VCAM-1 but not to MAdCAM-1, even after integrin activation, indicating that MAdCAM-1 is a preferential ligand for alpha 4 beta 7. Alpha 4 beta 7 can also bind VCAM-1, but this requires greater integrin activation than binding to MAdCAM-1. The findings imply a selective role for the interaction of alpha 4 beta 7 and MAdCAM-1 lymphocyte in homing to mucosal sites."

It is thought that engagement of the CD28 molecule with its ligand B7 provides an essential costimulatory signal without which full activation of T cells cannot occur. A mouse strain with a defective CD28 gene was established. Development of T and B cells in the CD28-deficient mice appeared normal. However, T lymphocytes derived from CD28-/- mutant mice had impaired responses to lectins. Lectin stimulation did not trigger interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, IL-2 receptor α expression was significantly decreased, and exogenous IL-2 only partially rescued the CD28 defect. Basal immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations in CD28-deficient mice were about one-fifth of those found in wild-type controls, with low titers of IgG1 and IgG2b but an increase in IgG2a. In addition, activity of T helper cells in CD28-/- mice was reduced and immunoglobulin class switching was diminished after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. However, cytotoxic T cells could still be induced and the mice showed delayed-type hypersensitivity after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Thus, CD28 is not required for all T cell responses in vivo, suggesting that alternative costimulatory pathways may exist."

https://openalex.org/W2137583122,"P selectin, expressed on surfaces of activated endothelial cells and platelets, is an adhesion receptor for leukocytes. We report that P selectin-deficient mice, generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, exhibit a number of defects in leukocyte behavior, including elevated numbers of circulating neutrophils, virtually total absence of leukocyte rolling in mesenteric venules, and delayed recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity upon experimentally induced inflammation. These results clearly demonstrate a role for P selectin in leukocyte interactions with the vessel wall and in the early steps of leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation. These mutant mice should prove useful in deciphering the contributions of P selectin in various inflammatory responses as well as in platelet functions."
https://openalex.org/W2005920135,"Direct gene transfer into adult animals resulting in generalized or tissue-specific expression would facilitate rapid analysis of transgene effects and allow precise in vivo manipulation of biologic processes at the molecular level. A single intravenous injection of expression plasmid:cationic liposome complexes into adult mice efficiently transfected virtually all tissues. In addition to vascular endothelial cells, most of the extravascular parenchymal cells present in many tissues including the lung, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow expressed the transgene without any apparent treatment-related toxicity. The transgene was still expressed in large numbers of cells in multiple tissues for at least 9 weeks after a single injection. Expression could be targeted to specific tissues and cell types, depending on the promoter element used."

https://openalex.org/W2005178989,"Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from mSlo, a gene encoding calcium-activated potassium channels, were isolated from mouse brain and skeletal muscle, sequenced, and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The mSlo-encoded channel resembled ""maxi"" or BK (high conductance) channel types; single channel conductance was 272 picosiemens with symmetrical potassium concentrations. Whole cell and single channel currents were blocked by charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, and tetraethylammonium ion. A large number of variant mSlo cDNAs were isolated, indicating that several diverse mammalian BK channel types are produced by a single gene."

https://openalex.org/W2140491527,"Estrogen receptor-negative Hs578T human breast cancer cells secrete insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGFBP-4 as major binding protein (BP) species. Our previous immunohistochemical studies (Oh, Y., Muller, H. L., Pham, H., Lamson, G., and Rosenfeld, R. G. (1992) Endocrinology 131, 3123-3125) have demonstrated the existence of cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 and release of cell surface-associated IGFBP-3 into conditioned media by addition of IGF peptide in Hs578T cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that IGFBP-3 binding on the cell surface is specific and receptor-mediated, by showing: 1) a dose-dependent increase of IGFBP-3 binding by addition of divalent cations (CaCl2 and MnCl2); 2) dose-dependent competition of 125I-IGFBP-3E. coli by unlabeled IGFBP-3E.coli (> 80% competition at 100 nM), but not by IGFBP-1 or fibronectin. In addition, exogenous IGFBP-3 treatment resulted in a significant inhibitory effect on monolayer growth of Hs578T cells. This inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 was shown to be specific and IGF-independent by demonstrating: 1) dose-dependent inhibition on cell growth (60% inhibition at 20 nM) and inhibition on DNA synthesis (10 nM; p"

https://openalex.org/W1977869187,"Neutrophil recruitment into tissues is a multistep process involving sequential engagement of adhesion molecules, including selectins (E,P,L), which are reactive with oligosaccharides, and the family of beta 2 integrins which are reactive with endothelial intercellular adhesion molecules. These processes result in the initial rolling of leukocytes along the endothelial surfaces, followed by the firm attachment of leukocytes to the endothelium. The intravenous infusion of cobra venom factor into rats results in acute lung injury that is neutrophil-dependent, oxygen radical mediated and P-selectin-dependent. Here we report that infusion of sialyl-Lewis X, a ligand for P-selectin, dramatically reduced lung injury and diminished the tissue accumulation of neutrophils, whereas irrelevant oligosaccharides had no such effects. These results suggest that sialyl-Lewis X carbohydrates may be used as a new strategy for anti-inflammatory therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2012533002,"The Ca2+ fraction of the ion current flowing through glutamatergic NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor channels was determined in forebrain neurons of the medial septum. The neurons were overloaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 (1 mM) via the recording patch pipettes. This approach allowed the direct determination of the Ca2+ influx from changes in the Ca2+-sensitive fura-2 fluorescence. We found that, at negative membrane potentials and at an extracellular free Ca2+ concentration of 1.6 mM, the Ca2+ fraction of the current through the NMDA receptor channels is only 6.8%, about 2-fold lower than previously estimated from reversal potential measurements. Interestingly, a quite high fractional Ca2+ current of 1.4% was determined for the linearly conducting AMPA/kainate receptor channels found in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1555579413,"Mechanisms involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signal transduction are incompletely understood. In some circumstances, TNF may use a signal transduction pathway involving hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase. In HL-60 cells, TNF rapidly activates this pathway and induces monocytic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with TNF selectively increases tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42mapk) and stimulates its enzymatic activity. Induction of p42mapk phosphorylation was time- and dose-dependent and closely paralleled activation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Direct engagement of the sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway by addition of bacterial sphingomyelinase led to MAP kinase activation. The time course of p42mapk phosphorylation in the sphingomyelinase-treated cells was similar to that of TNF, with maximal response occurring at 5 min. A maximal concentration of sphingomyelinase (0.01 unit/ml) was more potent than TNF at inducing MAP kinase enzymatic activity (2.6-fold) and phosphorylation of MAP kinase and tyrosine. The cell-permeable ceramide analogs, C2- and C6-ceramide, which mimic effects of TNF, also induced p42mapk phosphorylation within seconds. These studies indicate that the sphingomyelin pathway can regulate MAP kinase activity and suggest that MAP kinase activation by this mechanism may be involved in TNF-induced signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1605080122,"Brain NO (nitric oxide) synthase contains FAD, FMN, heme, and tetrahydrobiopterin as prosthetic groups and represents a multi-functional oxidoreductase catalyzing oxidation of L-arginine to NO and L-citrulline, formation of H2O2, and reduction of cytochrome c. We show that substrate analogues and inhibitors interacting with the heme block both the reductive activation of oxygen and the oxidation of L-arginine without affecting cytochrome c reduction. We further demonstrate that N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine is an intermediate in enzymatic NO synthesis. The ratio of L-citrulline to free N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine was > or = 50 under various assay conditions, but could markedly be reduced down to 4 by redox active inhibitors. Brain NO synthase is shown to utilize both L-arginine and N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine for the formation of stoichiometric amounts of NO and L-citrulline. Tetrahydrobiopterin equally enhanced reaction rates from either substrate (approximately 5-fold), but its rate accelerating effects were only observed at NADPH concentrations > or = 3 microM. In the absence of L-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin, brain NO synthase catalyzes the generation of H2O2. We now show that, in contrast to L-arginine, N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine fully blocked H2O2 formation in the absence of exogenous tetrahydrobiopterin, indicating that N omega-hydroxy-L-arginine is a direct inhibitor of enzymatic oxygen activation. Based on these data, a hypothetical mechanism of enzymatic NO formation is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2049033330,"Endonuclease G (Endo G) is widely distributed among animals and cleaves DNA at double-stranded (dG)n.(dC)n and at single-stranded (dC)n tracts. Endo G is synthesized as a propeptide with an amino-terminal presequence that targets the nuclease to mitochondria. Endo G can also be detected in extranucleolar chromatin. In addition to deoxyribonuclease activities, Endo G also has ribonuclease (RNase) and RNase H activities and specifically cleaves mouse mitochondrial RNA and DNA-RNA substrates containing the origin of heavy-strand DNA replication (OH). The cleavage sites match those found in vivo, indicating that Endo G is capable of generating the RNA primers required by DNA polymerase gamma to initiate replication of mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2059257370,"The zeta subunit of the T cell antigen receptor complex is required for targeting nascent receptor complexes to the cell surface and for receptor-mediated signal transduction. To examine the significance of the zeta subunit in T cell development, mice deficient for zeta expression were generated by gene targeting. These zeta-/- mice had few CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and the generation of CD4+ and CD8+ single positive T cells was impaired but not completely abrogated. Peripheral T cells were present but were unusual in that they expressed small amounts of CD5 and few T cell receptors. Thus, zeta chain expression influences thymocyte differentiation but is not absolutely required for the generation of single positive T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972730346,"L-Selectin is a calcium-dependent mammalian lectin that mediates lymphocyte trafficking by recognizing sialylated ligands on high endothelial venules in lymph nodes. Although L-selectin probably mediates neutrophil extravasation into nonlymphoid tissues, no corresponding ligand has been characterized. Staining of cultured endothelial cells with an L-selectin chimera (LS-Rg) showed an internal pool of ligands. Metabolic labeling with sulfur-35-labeled sulfate revealed heparin lyase-sensitive ligands that bound LS-Rg in a calcium-dependent, sialic acid-independent manner. A fraction of commercial heparin bound to LS-Rg and LS-Rg bound to heparin-agarose, both in a calcium-dependent manner. Thus, L-selectin recognizes endothelial heparin-like chains, which could be physiological ligands mediating leucocyte trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1490629978,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) causes a marked increase in the cellular binding of beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) to a large receptor compatible with the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (alpha 2MR)/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Beisiegel, U., Weber, W., and Bengtsson-Olivecrona, G. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 8342-8346). Here we demonstrate that LPL binds to the alpha-chain of purified alpha 2MR/LRP immobilized on microtiter plates. The binding, apparently to multiple sites, was blocked by heparin and inhibited by the alpha 2MR-associated protein (alpha 2MRAP) and by EDTA. Immobilized LPL bound alpha 2MR/LRP in solution as well as beta-VLDL prepared from cholesterol-fed rabbits. Both binding reactions were dependent on an intact carboxyl-terminal folding domain of LPL, but were independent of its dimeric structure and intact catalytical function. Dimeric LPL could mediate binding of beta-VLDL to immobilized alpha 2MR/LRP and to cells, e.g. monocytes. In contrast, LPL monomers were not able to mediate binding to immobilized alpha 2MR/LRP, presumably because of cross-inhibition due to close relation between the binding regions for the lipoprotein and for the receptor in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the LPL monomer. Heparin, but not alpha 2MRAP, inhibited cellular binding of 125I-LPL or 125I-beta-VLDL supplemented with LPL. However, alpha 2MRAP inhibited degradation of the two ligands by about 90% and 40-50%, respectively. The results show that LPL is a ligand for alpha 2MR/LRP and, because of its affinity for lipoprotein particles, dimeric LPL can mediate or strengthen binding of beta-VLDL to this receptor. It is proposed that LPL binds primarily to cell surface heparan sulfate in monocytes and is presented for endocytosis and degradation by alpha 2MR/LRP. Moreover, beta-VLDL may be further supplemented with LPL at the cell surface and achieve affinity for alpha 2MR/LRP."
https://openalex.org/W1659608558,"The quinoline U-78036 represents a new class of non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The agent possesses excellent antiviral activity at nontoxic doses in HIV-1-infected lymphocytes grown in tissue culture. Enzymatic kinetic studies of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)-catalyzed RNA-directed DNA polymerase function were carried out in order to determine whether the inhibitor interacts with the template-primer or deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding sites of the polymerase. The data were analyzed using steady-state or Briggs-Haldane kinetics assuming that the template-primer binds to the enzyme first followed by the dNTP and that the polymerase functions processively. The calculated rate constants are in agreement with this model. The results show that the inhibitor acts as a mixed to noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both the template-primer and the dNTP binding sites of the enzyme. Hence, U-78036 inhibits the RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity of RT by interacting with a site distinct from the template-primer and dNTP binding sites. Moreover, the potency of U-78036 is dependent on the base composition of the template-primer. The equilibrium constants for various enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes were at least seven times lower for the poly(rC).(dG)10-catalyzed system than the one catalyzed by poly(rA).(dT)10. In addition, the inhibitor does not impair the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and the RNase H function of HIV-1 RT nor does it inhibit the RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity of the HIV-2, avian myoblastoma virus, and murine leukemia virus RT enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1583997555,"Chloride channels were previously purified from bovine kidney cortex membranes using a drug affinity column. Reconstitution of the purified proteins into artificial liposomes and planar bilayers yielded chloride channels. A 64-kDa protein, p64, identified as a component of this chloride channel was used to generate antibodies which depleted solubilized kidney membranes of all chloride channel activity. This antibody has now been used to identify a clone, H2B, from a kidney cDNA library. Antibodies, affinity-purified against the fusion protein of H2B also depleted solubilized kidney cortex from all chloride channel activity. The predicted amino acid sequence of p64 shows that it contains two and possibly four putative transmembrane domains and potential phosphorylation sites by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II. There was no significant homology to other protein (or DNA) sequences in the data base. The protein is expressed in all cells tested. Expression of its mRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes led to the insertion of a protein with the appropriate molecular mass in microsomes but not in the plasma membrane. It is likely that p64 represents the chloride channel of intracellular organelles."

https://openalex.org/W1495130493,"A renal cDNA clone (rBAT) that induces system bo,+-like amino acid transport activity in Xenopus oocytes has recently been isolated (Bertran, J., Werner, A., Moore, M. L., Strange, G., Markovich, D., Biber, J., Testar, X., Zorzano, A., Palacin, and Murer, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 5601-5605). Here we show the isolation of a cDNA clone by screening a human kidney cortex cDNA library for expression of sodium-independent transport of L-[3H]arginine in Xenopus oocytes. The cRNA of this clone induces in oocytes, in addition to the uptake of L-arginine, that of L-[35S]cystine and L-[3H]leucine. Expressed uptake of these amino acids is mutually cis-inhibitable by the other 2 amino acids. Expressed uptake of L-cystine is saturable and shows an apparent Km in the micromolar range. All these characteristics resemble induction of system bo,+ related to rBAT in the oocytes. Human rBAT mRNA (approximately 2.5 kilobases) is found in kidney, small intestine (i.e., jejunum), pancreas, and liver. Human kidney poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) induces sodium-independent uptake of L-cystine, L-arginine, and L-leucine in Xenopus oocytes. Hybrid depletion with an antisense oligonucleotide of the isolated clone greatly prevents (80-97%) human kidney mRNA-dependent induction of the uptake of these amino acids (i.e., L-cystine, L-arginine, and L-leucine). The isolated clone (2304 base pairs in length) contains a poly(A) tail and encodes a predicted 78.8-kDa protein which is 85 and 80% identical to the rabbit and rat rBAT, respectively. This predicted protein corresponds to a membrane glycoprotein, and contains six potential N-glycosylation sites which might be functional in the oocyte: [35S] methionine labeling of oocytes shows a specific band of 94 kDa in crude membranes of these human cRNA-injected oocytes; treatment of these oocytes with tunicamycin shifts the cRNA-specific translation product to approximately 72 kDa. We conclude that we have isolated a functional cDNA corresponding to human rBAT. The isolation of this human cDNA would lead to the study of the possible involvement of rBAT in human hyperaminoacidurias."
https://openalex.org/W1630792128,"The use of non-hydrolyzable analogues of GTP in permeabilized secretory cells suggests that guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) may be involved in regulated exocytosis. Because GTP analogues are known to modulate both monomeric low molecular mass G proteins and heterotrimeric G proteins, we have examined the effect of mastoparan, an activator of heterotrimeric G proteins, on secretion from intact and permeabilized chromaffin cells. In intact cells, mastoparan inhibited catecholamine secretion evoked by nicotine but had no effect on release induced by other secretagogues. In permeabilized cells, mastoparan inhibited calcium-dependent secretion providing that the pores created in the plasma membrane allow the penetration of the peptide into the cytoplasm. These results indicate that mastoparan blocks the exocytotic machinery through an intracellular target protein that may not be located just beneath the plasma membrane. Accordingly, mastoparan was able to stimulate G proteins associated with purified chromaffin granule membranes, in a range of concentration and Mg2+ requirement that was similar to its inhibitory effect on secretion. Mas 17, a mastoparan analogue inactive on purified G proteins, neither modified catecholamine secretion nor stimulated chromaffin granule G proteins. The substance P-related peptide, GPAnt-2, known to antagonize the effects of mastoparan on G(o), blocked both the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on secretion and the mastoparan-stimulated GTPase activity in chromaffin granule membranes. Moreover, specific antibodies raised against the carboxyl terminus of G(o) alpha reversed in a dose-dependent manner the inhibition by mastoparan on catecholamine release and the stimulation by mastoparan of chromaffin granule-associated G proteins. These results suggest that the secretory machinery in chromaffin cells can be blocked by activating a G(o) protein. Consistent with this finding, two other known activators of heterotrimeric G proteins, aluminum fluoride and benzalkonium chloride, inhibited calcium-evoked catecholamine secretion in streptolysin O-permeabilized chromaffin cells. We conclude that an inhibitory G(o) protein, possibly located on the membrane of secretory granules, is involved in the final stages of exocytosis in chromaffin cells."

https://openalex.org/W1554089382,"Abstract The role of extracellular superoxide in the pathogenesis of vasogenic edema was studied using transgenic mice expressing a 5-fold increase in extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) activity in their brains. Increased EC-SOD expression offered significant protection against edema development after cold-induced injury (44% less edema than nontransgenic littermates, p < 0.05). Since iron may contribute to vasogenic edema by catalyzing the production of hydroxyl radical from superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, the effects of the chelator deferoxamine were studied. Deferoxamine reduced edema formation after cold-induced injury (43% less edema than controls, p < 0.05); however, treatment with iron-saturated deferoxamine also reduced edema development in mice (32-48% less edema, p < 0.05). This suggested that the protection offered by deferoxamine was independent of its ability to chelate iron. An iron-independent mechanism by which superoxide can contribute to vasogenic edema is via reaction with nitric oxide to produce the potentially toxic peroxynitrite anion, which is also scavenged by deferoxamine. Mice treated with an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase were protected against cold-induced edema (37% less edema, p < 0.05). EC-SOD transgenic mice received no additional protection by inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis, supporting this novel alternative mechanism of edema formation."
https://openalex.org/W1520181846,"We have identified 41 novel and many previously known growth response genes induced in regenerating liver and insulin-treated Reuber H35 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line that grows in response to physiologic concentrations of insulin and retains some properties of regenerating liver. Although many genes are expressed similarly in the two systems, there are important differences in the kinetics of induction of some genes. These differences allowed us to identify and characterize novel genes that are highly insulin-induced and expressed as delayed-early genes in regenerating liver. Sequence analysis of CL-6, the most abundant insulin-induced gene, resulted in the identification of a highly hydrophobic hepatic protein. Sequence analysis of HRS, a highly insulin-induced delayed-early gene, demonstrated that it is a member of the family of regulators of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Different forms of HRS mRNA are temporally regulated during the growth response, suggesting that HRS could autoregulate processing of its pre-mRNA. Given the dramatic increase in RNA production during late G1, proteins induced by mitogens like insulin that control RNA processing are likely to have important roles in cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1987866787,"Regions of Escherichia coli ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA in proximity to a bound transfer RNA (tRNA) substrate were mapped by photoaffinity. A photoaffinity cross-linking reagent was introduced at specific sites in the interior of the native tRNA structure by modification of the 5′ ends of circularly permuted tRNAs (cptRNAs). The polymerase chain reaction was used for the production of cptRNA templates. After the amplification of a segment of a tandemly duplicated tRNA gene, the cptRNA gene was transcribed in vitro to produce cptRNA. Modified cptRNAs were cross-linked to RNase P RNA, and the conjugation sites in RNase P RNA were determined by primer extension. These sites occur in phylogenetically conserved structures and sequences and identify regions of the ribozyme that form part of the tRNA binding site. The use of circularly permuted molecules to position specific modifications is applicable to the study of many inter- and intramolecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1553355802,"To test whether ionized base pairs influence polymerase-catalyzed misinsertion rates, we measured the efficiency of forming 5-bromouracil (B), 5-fluorouracil (F), and thymine base pairs with guanine and adenine as a function of pH using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase. When B, F, and T were present as dNTP substrates, misincorporation efficiencies opposite G, normalized to incorporation of C opposite G, increased by about 20-, 13-, and 7-fold, respectively, as reaction pH increased from 7.0 to 9.5. Incorporation efficiencies to form the correct base pairs, B.A and F.A, normalized to T.A, decreased by 4- and 8-fold, respectively, with increasing pH. The effects of pH on misincorporation efficiencies were about 10-fold greater when B, F, and T were present as template bases. The relative misincorporation efficiencies of G opposite template B, F, and T, normalized to incorporation of A opposite B, F, and T, increased by about 430-, 370-, and 70-fold, respectively, as pH was increased from 6.5 to 9.5, while correct incorporation of A opposite template B and F decreased about 10-fold over the same pH range. Plots depicting incorrect and correct incorporation efficiencies versus pH were fit to a pH titration equation giving the fraction of ionized base as a function of pH. We conclude that avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase forms B.G and F.G mispairs in an ionized Watson-Crick conformation in preference to a neutral wobble structure containing favored keto tautomers of B or F. Although participation of disfavored enol tautomers in enzyme-catalyzed base mispair formation cannot be ruled out, the results are inconsistent with the standard disfavored tautomer model of mutagenesis. Instead, the data support a model in which ionization of halouracil bases is primarily responsible for B- and F-induced mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1949252567,"Expression of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is tightly regulated. Using a panel of cell lines expressing different levels of CFTR mRNA, we investigated the mechanisms mediating control of CFTR transcription. In highly expressing cells, multiple sites of transcription initiation can be identified between positions -95 and +50 of the CFTR gene, and an alternatively initiated splice variant transcript is also present. Nonepithelial cell lines expressing very low levels of CFTR utilize a start site at -32. Promoter sequence elements from -83 to +111 are at least partially responsible for dictating CFTR transcriptional tissue-specificity, while multiple elements located farther 5' augment promoter strength. Analysis of the chromatin structure and methylation status of the CFTR promoter region reveals cell line differences which correlate with expression levels, suggesting that the physical context of the CFTR gene in vivo may contribute significantly to appropriate regulation of CFTR transcription. Taken together, these findings indicate that cellular control of CFTR gene expression is likely to be a complex function of several overlapping regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1975267528,"The c-kit proto-oncogene product is a major regulator of early hematopoiesis in mice. We show here that the avian c-Kit protein, together with the c-erbB protooncogene product, regulates self-renewal and differentiation in two types of normal chick erythroid progenitors. A relatively frequent progenitor expressing only c-Kit transiently proliferated in response to avian c-Kit ligand (stem cell factor [SCF]). A second, rare progenitor coexpressed c-Kit and c-ErbB and was induced to long-term self-renewal by SCF or transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), a c-ErbB ligand. In the absence of SFC or TGF alpha, both progenitors underwent erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent terminal differentiation with indistinguishable kinetics. Interestingly, Epo induced differentiation in the SCF progenitors even when SCF was present. In contrast, the c-ErbB-expressing, TGF alpha-induced progenitors continued to self-renew when treated with Epo plus the growth factors SCF, TGF alpha, or both. Expression of c-ErbB thus may be a dominant determinant for the sustained self-renewal of committed erythroid progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2105924921,"A synthetic 23-mer peptide (M2GlyR) with the amino acid sequence of the putative transmembrane segment M2 of the strychnine-binding alpha subunit of the inhibitory glycine receptor forms anion-selective channels in phospholipid bilayers. The most frequent events show single-channel conductances, gamma, of 25 pS and 49 pS in symmetric 0.5 M KCl with channel open lifetimes, tau o, in the millisecond time range. These properties match those of authentic glycine receptors studied in inside-out patches of cultured rat spinal cord neurons, namely gamma = 27 pS and gamma = 45 pS, and tau o in the millisecond time range. The channel activity of M2GlyR is sequence-specific: 1) a synthetic peptide with the sequence of putative transmembrane segment M1 (M1GlyR), not considered to contribute to the channel lining, does not form channels; 2) an analog of M2GlyR with site-specific substitutions displays distinct channel properties: 2 arginine residues at the N and C termini of M2, postulated to contribute to the anion selectivity of the channel, are substituted by glutamic acids, and the analog peptide ([Glu3,22]M2GlyR) forms cation-selective channels. Further, a four-helix bundle protein (T4M2GlyR) formed by tethering four identical M2GlyR modules to a carrier template forms homogeneous anion-selective channels with gamma = 25 pS in 0.5 M KCl. These channels are blocked by picrotoxin and by the anion channel blockers 9-anthracene carboxylic acid and niflumic acid, but not by an analog of the local anesthetic lidocaine (QX-222), a cation channel blocker. Observed single-channel properties suggest that a pentameric assembly of alpha and beta subunits with a central pore lined by M2 segments would account for conductance properties of the authentic glycine receptor and the 2 arginines at either end of M2 could confer anion specificity to the receptor channel."

Peptides M2 delta and M2 alpha 4 with sequences of M2 from muscle-like Torpedo californica AChR delta subunit and from rat neuronal AChR alpha 4 subunit form cation-selective channels in lipid bilayers with predominant single-channel conductances in 0.5 M KCl of 20 pS and 27 pS, respectively. Corresponding analogs with presumed pore-lining residues serine 8 or phenylalanine 16 specifically substituted by alanine retain the ability to self-assemble into conductive oligomers and form channels with primary conductances of 16 pS and 22 pS for M2 delta analogs and of 14 pS and 26 pS for M2 alpha 4 analogs. In contrast, peptides with randomized sequences and the same amino acid composition as M2 delta do not form channels. Four-helix bundle proteins T4M2 delta and T4M2 alpha 4 exhibit conductances in 0.5 M KCl of 20 pS and 26 pS. Analogs of T4M2 delta with selective replacement of serine 8 for alanine exhibit lower conductances, whereas substitution of phenylalanine 16 for alanine increases the single-channel conductance. T4M2 delta channels are blocked by open channel blockers such as the quaternary derivative of lidocaine QX-222 and by chlorpromazine. Channel open probability is reduced, and open time is abbreviated. Conduction properties of T4M2 delta and analogs are in accord with several properties of authentic AChRs. These comprehensive studies provide insights into the components of the pore-forming structure of nicotinic AChRs."
https://openalex.org/W1540055456,"We have previously reported that the occupancy of P2z purinergic receptors in BAC1.2F5 macrophages stimulates both the formation of nonselective membrane pores/channels and a novel phospholipase D (PLD) activity. In the present study, the relationship between these two P2z receptor-mediated responses was investigated. In [3H]oleic acid-labeled macrophages, isoosmotic replacement of extracellular Na+ with choline completely abolished 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (BzATP)-stimulated [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt) accumulation. This inhibitory effect of choline was mimicked when Na+ was replaced with other amine-containing cations (N-methylglucamine, ethanolamine, Tris+), but not with inorganic cations (K+, Li+). In contrast, substitution of Na+ with choline (or other cationic amines) did not prevent BzATP-induced Ca2+ influx and membrane depolarization. Thus, choline, which enters the cells through the BzATP-induced pores, can act to inhibit P2z receptor-stimulated PLD activity but not pore formation. The two responses also exhibit differential sensitivities to the pH of the incubation medium, to depletion of intracellular ATP, and to chronic phorbol ester treatment. These observations indicate that P2z receptor-mediated pore formation can be functionally uncoupled from the activation of PLD. However, both pore formation and PLD activity are similarly inhibited when the cells are: 1) partially desensitized by previous treatment with P2z agonists and 2) preincubated with 2',3'-dialdehyde-ATP or 4',4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. This suggests that these two distinct responses are mediated by the same, or similar, P2z receptors."
https://openalex.org/W123042318,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl- channel that is regulated by cytosolic nucleotides and by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. In excised membrane patches, CFTR Cl- channel activity requires hydrolyzable nucleotides and Mg2+, and is inhibited by ADP. We examined the interactions between CFTR and nucleotides using 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3-ATP), a photoactivatable ATP analog. Because CFTR functions as a membrane ion channel, we studied CFTR in membranes of Sf9 insect cells. We found that [alpha-32P]8-N3ATP specifically photolabeled CFTR, with half-maximal labeling at 10 microM 8-N3ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and 100 microM in the absence of Mg2+. The 8-N3ATP also substituted for ATP in activating CFTR Cl- channels, indicating that it interacts with the active site(s). Both ATP and GTP prevented photolabeling with half-maximal inhibition at 1 mM. ADP and adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) prevented photolabeling but at much higher concentrations, whereas AMP did not inhibit photolabeling at concentrations of up to 100 mM. Phosphorylation of CFTR was not a prerequisite for nucleotide binding. These results demonstrate that CFTR interacts directly with nucleotides at concentrations that regulate CFTR Cl- channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1527926928,"Thrombospondin (TSP) binds to its cellular receptor, CD36 (glycoprotein IV or IIIb), and participates in many adhesive cell interactions. We have shown that the CD36-TSP interaction occurs in a stepwise, conformation-dependent process. CD36 sequence 139-155 binds TSP and induces a second CD36-binding site, which binds CD36 sequence 93-110 with high affinity. To characterize this high affinity CD36-binding site on TSP, an anti-TSP monoclonal antibody (mAb), 7A-1e, was identified that showed augmentation of TSP binding in the presence of CD36 peptide P139-155. Purified mAb 7A-1e IgG specifically blocked both P139-155-augmented CD36 binding and P139-155-dependent CD36 peptide P93-110 binding to TSP, indicating that the binding sites on TSP for mAb 7A-1e and P93-110 are closely related. mAb 7A-1e IgG inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. SVTCG is a cell adhesive motif in TSP. Both mAb 7A-1e and P93-110 specifically bound to a TSP peptide containing SVTCG, and the binding of mAb 7A-1e or P93-110 to TSP was inhibited by soluble SCTCG peptide. The SVTCG cell adhesive domain in TSP is the conformation-dependent, high affinity binding site for CD36 sequence 93-110."
https://openalex.org/W130755515,"Reversible association of protein S with C4b-binding protein (C4BP) in plasma down-regulates protein S activity, since free protein S but not the protein S.C4BP complex is an anticoagulant cofactor for activated protein C. To identify regions on the surface of protein S that mediate complex formation with C4BP, a number of nonoverlapping synthetic pentadecapeptides comprising protein S sequences were prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit complex formation. The most potent pentadecapeptide, residues 420-434 (PSP-420) (SGIKEIIQEKQNKHC), gave half-maximal effect at 20 microM. A peptide with the reverse sequence, 434-420, did not inhibit. A peptide containing the sequence of protein S residues 408-434 inhibited complex formation by > 95% with 50% inhibition at 5 microM peptide. Biotinylated C4BP bound specifically to plates coated with PSP-420 but not with the 434-420 peptide; and biotinylated PSP-420 bound to plates coated with C4BP. Rabbit antibodies were raised against several keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides, and each was tested for ability to inhibit complex formation. Anti-PSP-420 antibody potently inhibited complex formation with half-maximal effect at 25 nM IgG. A monoclonal antibody (LJ-56) made against PSP-420 showed high affinity for protein S and inhibited complex formation; this monoclonal antibody specifically recognized free protein S but not the protein S.C4BP complex. These results imply that the PSP-420 sequence is surface-exposed, capable of binding to C4BP, and essential for protein S binding to C4BP."
https://openalex.org/W1600940594,"A variety of hormonal agonists activate transmembrane Na+ and Ca2+ flux in hepatocytes, but the responsible mechanisms are poorly understood. We employed microfluorimetric and patch clamp recording techniques in hepatocytes to determine the effect of the hormone vasopressin on cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) and to identify the transmembrane Na+ transport pathways activated by this agonist. Under basal conditions, [Na+]i, measured using the Na(+)-sensitive fluorophore sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, averaged 12.1 +/- 1.6 mM. Exposure to vasopressin rapidly increased [Na+]i by 8.3 +/- 0.9 mM. This increase was attributable to activation of Na+ influx. It occurred in the absence of solutes co-transported with Na+ and was not associated with activation of Na+/H+ antiport. In cell-attached membrane patches, vasopressin activated ion channels that carried inward positive current at the resting membrane potential. Further characterization in excised membrane patches revealed two classes of ion channels, with conductances of 16.0 +/- 2.8 and 30.9 +/- 3.1 picosiemens, respectively. Single channel currents reversed near 0 mV, and ion substitution studies demonstrated that each channel type was permeable to Na+, Ca2+, and K+ but not Cl-. These observations in hepatocytes indicate that vasopressin increases [Na+]i and activates cation-selective channels, which likely accounts for vasopressin-activated Na+ and Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1625745398,"P-selectin, a receptor for neutrophils and monocytes, is an adhesion molecule on the surface of activated platelets that resides in the alpha granule membrane of unstimulated platelets. To determine whether phosphorylation of P-selectin might accompany platelet activation, P-selectin in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets labeled with o-[32P]phosphate was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody AC1.2 directed against P-selectin. SDS-gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates indicated about 10-20-fold higher levels of 32P incorporated into P-selectin from thrombin-activated platelets than in resting platelets, although both sets of platelets contained equivalent amounts of P-selectin. The lower limits of the molar ratio of phosphate to P-selectin in activated platelets is about 0.52 +/- 0.08. Other platelet agonists, including the thrombin receptor peptide (SFLLR), epinephrine, ADP, and collagen, similarly stimulated phosphorylation of P-selectin. The kinetics of P-selectin phosphorylation following thrombin stimulation was rapid, with maximum phosphorylation observed at 15-30 s. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated P-selectin revealed the rapid synthesis of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, but 80-90% of the phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine disappeared within 5 min of platelet activation while the maximal level of phosphoserine remained stable. The rapid phosphorylation and selective dephosphorylation of specific amino acids in P-selectin following platelet activation may be important for P-selectin function and signal transduction within platelets."

https://openalex.org/W1503934268,"Abstract Nevirapine is a highly potent and specific inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) polymerase, but is inactive against HIV-2 and other polymerase. Previous studies demonstrated that residues 176-190 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) can confer nevirapine sensitivity to HIV-2 RT. To better characterize the role of this sequence in HIV-1 RT, we have progressively substituted residues 176-190 of HIV-2 RT for those of HIV-1 RT and monitored the impact on the kinetic properties; inhibitory activity of nevirapine (11-cyclopropyl-5,11-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido[2,3-b:2',3'-e] [1,4]diazepin-6-one), E-BPU (5-ethyl-1-benzyloxymethyl-6-(phenylthio)-uracil), and TIBO-R82150 ((+)-S-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo[4,5,1-j k] [1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione); and inhibitor-induced fluorescence changes of the mutant enzymes. The study revealed that in addition to Try-181 and Tyr-188, a new amino acid residue (Gly-190) plays an important role in determining susceptibility to nevirapine and E-BPU, but not to TIBO-R82150. These data argue that these non-nucleoside inhibitors fit differently, even though they share a common binding pocket. Nevirapine was seen to exert inhibitory activity by altering the interaction of the enzyme with the template-primer. Kinetic parameters were modulated by the template (DNA versus RNA) as well as by some of the mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1503259740,"The insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are a family of six proteins that modulate the biological activity of IGF-I and IGF-II and determine their bioavailability to tissues. One of the IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, is distinctive in the dynamic response of its levels in human plasma to metabolic changes. Parallel changes occur in IGFBP-1 mRNA and IGFBP-1 transcription in rat liver. Using the well differentiated H4-II-E rat hepatoma cell line as a model system, we demonstrated previously that IGFBP-1 transcription is positively regulated by dexamethasone and negatively regulated by insulin. We now examine the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, on the hormonal regulation of IGFBP-1 gene expression. Preincubation of H4-II-E cells with 10.7 microM cycloheximide for 1.5 h did not prevent the induction of IGFBP-1 mRNA and IGFBP-1 transcription (determined in nuclear run-on assays) by dexamethasone. By contrast, cycloheximide treatment abolished the decrease in IGFBP-1 mRNA induced by insulin. Insulin rapidly decreased IGFBP-1 transcription in the absence of cycloheximide (> 50% inhibition in 20 min) and caused a similar decrease in cells pretreated with cycloheximide. Cycloheximide alone also decreased IGFBP-1 transcription. Similar results were observed with a second protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, which also prevented the insulin-induced decrease in IGFBP-1 mRNA without abolishing the insulin-induced inhibition of IGFBP-1 transcription. These results suggest that although insulin decreases IGFBP-1 gene transcription in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, IGFBP-1 mRNA levels are maintained because of stabilization of the mRNA. Stabilization was demonstrated directly in actinomycin D-treated cells, where the t1/2 of IGFBP-1 mRNA increased from approximately 2 to approximately 20 h in the presence of cycloheximide; insulin did not affect IGFBP-1 mRNA turnover. Thus, cycloheximide-sensitive labile proteins contribute to the maintenance of basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity and the rapid turnover of IGFBP-1 mRNA, which determine the dynamic regulation of IGFBP-1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W156527751,"RNA/DNA substrates derived from the 5' ends of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV) genomes were used to study the specificity of the RNase H activities of HIV, AMV (avian myeloblastosis virus), and MMuLV reverse transcriptases. These substrates were selected because they represent the site for the first template switch during proviral DNA synthesis. Variability of cleavage was observed depending on the origin of the enzyme as well as the sequence of the RNA/DNA substrate. The minimal size of hybrid recognized by the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase was also affected by the same parameters, namely, the enzyme and the substrate origin. Moreover, the size of the residual 5'-undigested RNA after completion of the RNase H reaction depended on the position of the DNA annealed to the genomic RNA. When the hybrid was located at the 5' R region of the viral genome, stable hybrids with RNAs of 13-18 nucleotides remained following digestion by HIV reverse transcriptase, and 21-24 nucleotides following digestion by AMV reverse transcriptase and MMuLV reverse transcriptase. On the other hand, with all three enzymes, smaller sized hybrids remained when the DNA was hybridized to internal U5 or R sequences. The reason for this variance in size appears to be the inability of RNase H to efficiently digest at the 5' end of hybrid structures. Surprisingly, hybridization to the RNA template, of a DNA oligomer that extended 15 nucleotides beyond the 5' end of the RNA R region sequences, resulted in further digestion of the RNA. This unexpected mode of action of RNase H at the 5' end of the genomic RNA should be taken in consideration in studies of the first template switch."

https://openalex.org/W1495102280,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase isolated from viral particles contains two subunits, p51 and p66. We have produced both subunits in separate Escherichia coli strains using expression vectors. Stop codons were placed immediately after the codon for the carboxyl-terminal residue of the mature processed p51 and p66 subunits found in viral particles. Insertion of a methionine in front of the HIV protease cleavage site in the recombinant protein enabled synthesis of both subunits with the natural amino-terminal proline, since E. coli methionine aminopeptidase cleaves a Met-Pro amino-terminal linkage. That this occurred to an extent greater than 95% was confirmed by sequencing the purified subunits. Examination of the activities of the individual p51 and p66 subunits on a variety of templates and under solution conditions optimized for each subunit revealed a significant catalytic activity for the natural p51 subunit. This result contrasts to results reported earlier for many recombinant forms without the natural amino and/or carboxyl termini. As expected from earlier work, the optimal homopolymeric template for the p66 subunit was poly(rA). For the p51 subunit, poly(dC) was found to be the optimal template; its activity is 2- to 4-fold greater than p66 on poly(dC). The p51 subunit is 13- to 50-fold less active on poly(rC). These findings are discussed in the context of our earlier hypothesis (McHenry, C. S. (1989) in Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function (Adolph, K., ed) Chap. 5, Springer-Verlag, New York) that the HIV reverse transcriptase might be functionally asymmetric with distinct plus- and minus-strand polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1482214464,"We have exploited the sole tryptophan residue (Trp535) in the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) to study features of the isolated polypeptide (p15 RNase H) by fluorescence spectroscopy. Incubation of purified p15 RNase H with a synthetic RNA/DNA hybrid was accompanied by an alteration in Trp535 fluorescence intensity. This property was used to determine an apparent binding constant (Kapp) of 3.5 x 10(6) M-1 for p15 RNase H complexed with poly(rA)/oligo(dT)12-18 and an occluded site size of 4 nucleotides. A cooperativity coefficient (omega) of 910 was also determined which indicated that nearly three logs of the Kapp were due to cooperativity effects. Recombinant p15 RNase H preparations containing mutations at position 478 (Glu478–>Gln478) or 539 (His539 –>Phe539), which are highly conserved between bacterial and retroviral RNases H, were also analyzed. Under the same conditions, these mutants failed to bind the RNA/DNA hybrid, although they were structurally similar to the wild type polypeptide. Fluorescence spectroscopy thus appears to be an alternative and sensitive means of analyzing functional properties of the purified RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1678563750,"Escherichia coli strains encoding the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin protein are efficiently internalized by mammalian cells. Bacterial uptake into cultured cell lines became defective, however, if invasin was altered by fusion of its carboxyl terminus to E. coli alkaline phosphatase or by the addition of two hydrophobic amino acids to its carboxyl-terminal end. Probing with anti-invasin monoclonal antibodies revealed that the amino-terminal end of invasin was properly localized on the bacterial cell surface in strains encoding invasin with 2 additional amino acids, whereas the carboxyl terminus was not accessible to the monoclonal antibody. Therefore, the 2 additional amino acids interfered with the folding or orientation of the carboxyl terminus in the outer membrane. Alkylation experiments in the absence of reduction indicated that this defect was not caused by a gross inability to form a critical disulfide bond. Revertants were selected from a strain encoding this mutant protein by enriching for organisms able to enter cultured mammalian cells. The vast majority of revertants that were isolated following this enrichment contained a stop codon at the usual position found in the wild type inv gene. The most efficient of the remaining revertants resulted in the introduction of a glycine residue at the site of the wild type stop codon, presumably restoring proper conformation of the carboxyl-terminal region."
