https://openalex.org/W2115524556,"The v-abl protein is known to be a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. However, its normal cellular homolog, c-abl P150, is not detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo or in vitro. The lack of associated tyrosine kinase activity for the c-abl protein seems paradoxical since it is the c-abl-derived sequences of the v-abl protein that encode the kinase activity. We have detected an altered human c-abl protein (P210) with associated tyrosine kinase activity in the K562 leukemia cell line. K562 cells are known to have a 9:22 chromosomal translocation involving the c-abl locus and have amplified the c-able gene 4 to 8 fold. The altered P210 human c-abl is serologically and structurally related to the normal c-abl protein. A structural alteration of the human c-abl protein. K562 cells may have unmasked its associated tyrosine kinase activity. This altered c-abl protein may have important implications for a mechanism of activation of this oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2012430176,"The immunogenic and antigenic determinants of a synthetic peptide and the corresponding antigenic determinants in the parent protein have been elucidated. Four determinants have been defined by reactivity of a large panel of antipeptide monoclonal antibodies with short, overlapping peptides (7-28 amino acids), the immunizing peptide (36 amino acids), and the intact parent protein (the influenza virus hemagglutinin, HA). The majority of the antipeptide antibodies that also react strongly with the intact protein recognize one specific nine amino acid sequence. This immunodominant peptide determinant is located in the subunit interface in the HA trimeric structure. The relative inaccessibility of this site implies that antibody binding to the protein is to a more unfolded HA conformation. This antigenic determinant differs from those previously described for the hemagglutinin and clearly demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides to generate antibodies that interact with regions of the protein not immunogenic or generally accessible when the protein is the immunogen."

https://openalex.org/W2033090330,"The gene for the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The gene encodes a protein of 412 amino acids as deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The protein contains 41 tandem repeats of a tetrapeptide, 37 of which are Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro and four of which are Asn-Val-Asp-Pro. Monoclonal antibodies against the CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum were inhibited from binding to the protein by synthetic peptides of the repeat sequence. The CS protein of Plasmodium falciparum and the CS protein of a simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, have two regions of homology, one of which is present on either side of the repeat. One region contains 12 of 13 identical amino acids. Within the nucleotide sequence of this region, 25 of 27 nucleotides are conserved. The conservation of these regions in parasites widely separated in evolution suggests that they may have a function such as binding to liver cells and may represent an invariant target for immunity."

https://openalex.org/W1497028439,"Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F preparations from Flavobacterium meningosepticum have been found to contain peptide:N-glycosidase activity. Only the second activity, designated as peptide:N-glycosidase F, readily cleaves the beta-aspartylglycosylamine linkage of a fetuin triantennary complex glycopeptide, as shown by the isolation of the corresponding carbohydrate-free peptide containing aspartic acid and of an intact oligosaccharide with a di-N-acetylchitobiosyl moiety at the reducing end. Both activities in the mixture will hydrolyze a high mannose octaglycopeptide from ovalbumin, with the type of product formed being influenced by pH. At pH 4.0, only the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F activity is functional, releasing octapeptide-GlcNAc and oligosaccharide-GlcNAc. At pH 9.3, the predominant cleavage is by peptide:N-glycosidase F at the glycosylamine bond, releasing octapeptide and oligosaccharide-GlcNAc-GlcNAc. This latter oligosaccharide is then hydrolyzed by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F to oligosaccharide-GlcNAc plus GlcNAc."
https://openalex.org/W2006585409,"To study the intracellular sorting of internalized ligands and receptors, we examined the pathways of two ligands: transferrin, which is recycled, and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), which is degraded. In CHO cells the two ligands rapidly segregate into different intracellular compartments. Within 5 min fluorescein-labeled transferrin (F-Tf) is found in a large round juxtanuclear structure. Rhodamine-labeled alpha 2M is found in a punctate pattern. Ultra-structural localization studies demonstrate that colloidal gold-alpha 2M is found predominantly in endocytic vesicles, while ferritin-transferrin is found in small vesicles and tubular structures in a region adjacent to the Golgi complex. Using image intensified fluorescence microscopy and digital image analysis, we determined that the F-Tf containing structure has a pH of 6.4 +/- 0.2, while endocytic vesicles containing F-alpha 2M have a pH of 5.4 +/- 0.1. Our study defines a mildly acidic compartment, distinct from endocytic vesicles, that is involved in the recycling of internalized components back to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2034602099,"In recent years 5methylcytosine residues in DNA have been implicated to have an important role in the control of eucaryotic gene expression (see Razin and Riggs, Science 210,604-610,198O). Consequently, there has been much interest in cytosine analogs such as 5azacytosine (5.azaC) and 5-fluorocytosine (5.fluoro-C), which, when incorporated into DNA, inhibit methylation and profoundly affect gene expression and differentiation (see Taylor and Jones, JMB 162, 679-692, 1982). The degree of hypomethylation far exceeds the levels of such analogs in DNA and is not simply a result of their inability to serve as methyl acceptors It is now clear that DNAs containing low levels of these analogs are potent inhibitors of DNA-cytosine methyltransferase (DCMT), but the mechanism of inhibition is unresolved. In this report, we review pertinent literature and formulate a proposal for the molecular mechanism by which DCMT is inhibited by DNA containing 5-aza-C or 5fluoroC. A similar mechanism explains how small amounts of 5-aza-C or 5-fluoro-C in tRNA cause specific loss of tRNA-cytosine methyltransferase activity (Lu et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 28, 489-495, 1979; Lu and Randerath, Cancer Res. 40, 2701-2705, 1980). A General Mechanism for Enzymes That Catalyze Electrophilic Substitution at the 5 Position of Pyrimidines, and Properties of Inhibitory Analogs Numerous chemical and enzymic studies have revealed that enzymes which catalyze electrophilic substitution reactions at the 5 position of the pyrimidine heterocycle proceed by the general mechanism shown below (Starzyk et al., Nature 298, 136-140, 1982; Pogolotti and Santi, Bioorgan. Chem. 1, 277-31 I, 1977). In this mechanism, a nucleophilic catalyst of the enzyme adds to the 6 position of the heterocycle to produce a negative charge at the 5 position and activates what is otherwise an inert carbon for reaction with an electrophile (R+). Subsequent abstraction of the proton at carbon-5 of intermediate 3 and /3elimination provide the product and the active enzyme. Enzymes proceeding by this mechanism include dTMP synthase, dUMP hydroxymethylase, and dCMP hydroxy-"

https://openalex.org/W1989482194,"We constructed rabbit beta-globin genes with deletions in the large intron, extending from the midpoint toward the 5' or 3' splice sites. Analysis of transcripts in transformed HeLa cells showed that six 5' proximal intron nucleotides allowed normal splicing. Correct splicing at the 3' splice site required 12 or more 3' proximal intron nucleotides; optimal efficiency required 24 nucleotides. Remarkably, a mini-intron comprising six 5' and 24 3' intron nucleotides gave no correctly spliced transcripts; extending the miniintron with polyoma or pBR322 fragments to 80 or more nucleotides restored normal splicing. Thus other than in yeast nuclear genes, no specific internal intron sequences appear to be needed but a minimal intron length is important."
https://openalex.org/W2067835109,"Human beta-globin genes introduced into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells by DNA cotransformation are correctly regulated when erythroid cell differentiation is induced by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In contrast, cloned human alpha-globin genes are efficiently transcribed in MEL cells prior to induction, and no increase in the level of alpha-globin mRNA is observed when the cells differentiate. These observations suggest that the mechanisms by which alpha- and beta-globin genes are activated during erythroid cell differentiation are fundamentally different. Analysis of the transcription of hybrid human alpha/beta-globin genes in MEL cells revealed that the sequences responsible for differences in transcription of the intact alpha- and beta-globin genes are located on the 3' side of the mRNA capping site of the two genes, suggesting that cis-acting regulatory sequences are located within the structural genes."
https://openalex.org/W2080184423,"A clone of complementary DNA encoding the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been isolated by screening an Escherichia coli complementary DNA library with a monoclonal antibody to the CS protein. The DNA sequence of the complementary DNA insert encodes a four-amino acid sequence: proline-asparagine-alanine-asparagine, tandemly repeated 23 times. The CS beta-lactamase fusion protein specifically binds monoclonal antibodies to the CS protein and inhibits the binding of these antibodies to native Plasmodium falciparum CS protein. These findings provide a basis for the development of a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2065979160,"We have used in vitro mutagenesis to explore the functions of the gene products encoded by the pol gene of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Deletions were constructed at a variety of positions in the gene, and the altered DNA copies of the viral genome were introduced into mouse cells by cotransformation. The mutants could be divided into two classes depending on the phenotype and map position of the deletion within the pol gene. Mutants with deletions mapping in the 5' portion of the gene were found to be completely deficient in reverse transcriptase activity. Mutants mapping in the 3' portion of the gene, however, assembled and released virions with normal levels of reverse transcriptase and RNAase H activities. When applied to permissive cells, these virions directed the synthesis of all three forms of unintegrated viral DNA: full-length, double-stranded linear DNA and the two circular forms with one and two copies of the long terminal repeat sequences. The infection was arrested at this point and the infected cells did not become producers of virus. Thus the 3' portion of the pol gene encodes a polypeptide with a function distinct from that of reverse transcriptase, which is not required for synthesis of viral DNA but is essential for establishment of that DNA in a stable, active form in the infected cell. We suggest that this function may be the integration of the proviral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1602075566,"The recurrent nature of equine infectious anemia has been attributed to relatively rapid antigenic variations in equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) during persistent infection under selective immune pressures. This model was tested by serological and biochemical analysis of virus isolates recovered from separate febrile episodes in two experimentally infected ponies. Neutralization assays employing immune sera from the experimentally infected ponies demonstrated that distinct antigenic strains of virus predominate during sequential febrile episodes in a single pony. Analysis of the test strains of EIAV by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed varying electrophoretic mobilities for the respective virion glycoproteins gp90 and gp45. Furthermore, peptide mapping comparisons demonstrated structural variations between the gp90 components of the various strains. In contrast, the respective internal proteins of the virus strains displayed identical electrophoretic mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and, in general, produced identical tryptic peptide maps. The observed differences in glycoprotein electrophoretic mobility and peptide maps were highly reproducible and did not vary with repeated passage of the virus strains in cell culture. Thus, these results demonstrate the occurrence of glycoprotein-specific structural variations during persistent infection by EIAV and support the concept of antigenic variation in this retrovirus. This capacity to alter envelope glycoprotein structure, previously reported for visna virus, may represent an important mechanism of retrovirus persistence in the presence of immune responses by the animal host."
https://openalex.org/W2014458569,"Most of the effort directed at understanding the problems of allergy has focused on the interacting components of the immune system. The possibility that histamine may be released as a learned response has now been tested. In a classical conditioning procedure in which an immunologic challenge was paired with the presentation of an odor, guinea pigs showed a plasma histamine increase when presented with the odor alone. This suggests that the immune response can be enhanced through activity of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1967209412,"Troponin T (TnT) is a major regulatory protein of the striated muscle that exhibits developmental and tissue-specific structural heterogeneity. The molecular basis for this heterogeneity was studied at the level of TnT structural gene organization and RNA expression. Two tissue-specific and developmentally regulated TnT mRNAs, alpha and beta, are derived from a single fast skeletal muscle TnT gene. Although otherwise structurally identical from amino acid 70 to the end of the 3' untranslated region, the alpha and beta TnT mRNAs differ by a small internal oligonucleotide coding for amino acids 229 to 242. These isoform-specific oligopeptides, both spanning the same internal portion of the TnT protein, are encoded by two distinct and adjacent miniexons in the TnT gene. Alternative and mutually exclusive splicing of these two miniexons results in the incorporation of either exon into the mature TnT mRNA and argues persuasively against a processive scanning model of RNA splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W1537531528,"In search for possible intracellular mediators of the mitogenic signal induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), we have investigated tyrosine-specific phosphorylation stimulated by PDGF in intact human fibroblasts. Cells were metabolically labeled, either with [32P] orthophosphoric acid or with [35S]methionine, and thereafter treated with PDGF for various times. Lysates from the cell cultures were then immunoprecipitated with an antiserum specifically recognizing phosphotyrosine. Analysis of the precipitated radioactivity by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or fluorography showed the appearance of a 185-kDa protein in cells stimulated with PDGF; maximum yield was at about 5 min after the addition of PDGF. This component was found to have several characteristics in common with the PDGF receptor, including similar Mr, binding to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, and incorporation of phosphate on tyrosine residues after exposure to PDGF. We conclude that the 185-kDa component probably represents the PDGF receptor proper. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 185-kDa protein/PDGF receptor, precipitated with the antiphosphotyrosine immune serum, revealed that it, in addition to phosphotyrosine, also contained phosphoserine. PDGF also consistently stimulated the phosphorylation of components of Mr values of 300,000 to 200,000, 115,000, 72,000, 54,000, 45,000, and 35,000. Some of these components may be involved in the intracellular transmission of the PDGF-induced mitogenic signal."
https://openalex.org/W1560690111,"Abstract Methotrexate (MTX)-resistant human breast cancer cells (MTXR ZR-75) were obtained following serial passage of the wild-type ZR-75-1 cells (wild-type ZR-75) in MTX. The resistant cell line contains neither quantitative nor qualitative changes in dihydrofolate reductase compared to the parental line. Resistance is associated with a 3-fold decrease in MTX transport into MTXR ZR-75 cells as well as a 3-fold decrease in the activity of thymidylate synthetase in the resistant subline. Moreover, marked differences were observed between the wild-type and MTXR ZR-75 cells in their ability to convert MTX to its polyglutamate derivatives. Wild-type ZR-75 cells accumulate significant intracellular levels of antifolates during prolonged (24 h) exposure to 2 microM MTX, due to the formation of MTX polyglutamates. In contrast, essentially no polyglutamates are formed in the MTXR cells even during conditions which result in a vast excess of free intracellular drug in these cells. This defect is not associated with any apparent change in the activity of the enzyme folylpolyglutamyl synthetase, nor is there any alteration in the apparent Km of this enzyme for MTX in the resistant cells. Further studies demonstrate that the MTXR ZR-75 cells are cross-resistant to antifolate analogues which can be converted to polyglutamate derivatives (aminopterin and dichloromethotrexate), yet they are relatively sensitive to antifolate analogues such as 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine, triazinate, and trimetrexate, which cannot be converted to polyglutamate forms. These studies identify a new mechanism (diminished accumulation of MTX polyglutamates) associated with resistance to MTX and lend additional support to the hypothesis that the formation of these derivatives is an important determinant of MTX cytotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1579211087,"We have observed that intact wild type Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF), when incubated with micromolar sodium orthovanadate for as little as 4 h, results in a 2-3-fold increase in pp60v-src kinase activity as judged by the IgG kinase assay. The addition of sodium vanadate or vanadyl sulfate to transformed cell lysates or the immunoprecipitate assay was without effect on the activity of isolated pp60v-src kinase activity. The increased kinase activity is reflected intracellularly by an increased phosphotyrosine content of a known substrate of pp60v-src, a 36-kDa phosphoprotein, without a change in total phosphate incorporation into cellular proteins. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine indicated that there was no change in the net or rate of biosynthesis of pp60v-src which might have accounted for the elevated kinase activity. Along with this stimulation of pp60v-src kinase activity, we found a parallel increase in the phosphate content of the enzyme and the appearance of an electrophoretic variant after vanadate treatment. The increased phosphorylation of the kinase is accounted for by an increase in phosphotyrosine content without a change in phosphoserine content. The increased phosphotyrosine content is shown to be resident in the carboxyl-terminal fragment and, unexpectedly, in the amino-terminal fragment of the kinase. The phosphotyrosine present in the amino-terminal portion may be a de novo phosphorylation, but could also represent a tyrosine site(s) not easily detected under unstimulated conditions in the absence of vanadate."
https://openalex.org/W2058187175,"(2'-5')(A)n synthetase and RNAase L (a latent endoribonuclease) are among the mediators of interferon action. The product of (2'-5')(A)n synthetase (i.e., (2'-5')(A)n) binds, and thereby activates RNAase L. Interferons induce in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells two mRNAs (sizes 1.5 kb and 3.8 kb), which can be translated in Xenopus oocytes into (2'-5')(A)n synthetases of 20,000 to 30,000 daltons and 85,000 to 100,000 daltons, respectively. (2'-5')(A)n synthetases of corresponding sizes are induced by interferons in EAT cells. In the cell extract the bulk of the larger enzyme is in the cytoplasmic fraction, and the bulk of the smaller one in the nuclear fraction. The only known function of (2'-5')(A)n is the activation of RNAase L, and RNAase L can be selectively crosslinked to a (2'-5')(A)n derivative in a cytoplasmic extract from EAT cells. The same (2'-5')(A)n derivative can be crosslinked to several proteins in the nuclear extract of EAT cells, and some of these proteins are induced by interferon."
https://openalex.org/W1569319782,"Two peptides rich in hydrophobic amino acids have been isolated from venom sacs of the European hornet, Vespa crabro. One peptide (P-2) is structurally and functionally related to the tetradecapeptide mastoparan and has been named mastoparan C. Leu-Asn-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Leu-Ala-Val-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile-LeuNH2. The other (P-1) is a tridecapeptide with a new sequence: Phe-Leu-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Arg-Lys-Ile-Val-Thr-Ala-LeuNH2 which we have named crabrolin. The peptide releases histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells with a threshold of approximately 2.5 micrograms/ml (congruent to 8 microM). Crabrolin also facilitates the action of purified phospholipase A2 from different sources, but it is not quite as active as mastoparan. It is clearly less active than mastoparan in lysing erythrocytes, and it does not release amylase from dispersed guinea pig pancreatic acini. Given its unique sequence, the principal effect of crabrolin may be neither mast cell degranulation nor phospholipase facilitation, but a yet undiscovered action."
https://openalex.org/W1567391238,"Xenopus laevis oocytes contain a 38,000-Da protein which serves both as a 5 S gene-specific transcription initiation factor (TFIIIA) and to stabilize 5 S RNA in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Using an antibody to this protein we have measured the levels of TFIIIA during oogenesis and embryonic development in X. laevis. The maximal steady state level (approximately 10(12) molecules/oocyte) is reached early in oogenesis but drops 10- to 20-fold in later stages and another 10- to 20-fold during ovulation. The reduced amount present in the unfertilized egg remains at a nearly constant level throughout early development, but with cell division the cellular concentration drops from 3 X 10(9) to about 10(4) molecules/cell. An immunoreactive protein of the same size is also found in liver tissues and in cultured kidney cells, which also contain about 10(4) molecules/cell. By both structural (CNBr peptide analysis) and functional (transcription of 5 S genes) analyses the embryonic and kidney cell 38,000-Da factors appear indistinguishable from oocyte TFIIIA. In addition a second antigenically related protein of about 40,000 Da is found in late stage embryos, liver tissues, and adult kidney cells (where it is severalfold more abundant than the 38,000-Da TFIIIA). The chromatographic fractionation and functional analysis of the kidney cell extracts has shown that fractions containing the 38,000-Da protein support 5 S RNA synthesis while fractions containing the 40,000-Da protein do not. The significance of these findings for 5 S gene regulation is discussed with respect to the dual function of TFIIIA, the presence of rate-limiting amounts of TFIIIA, and the possibility of stage-specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W1557747032,"Using a coupled transport assay which detects only those ATPase molecules functionally inserted into the platelet dense granule membrane, we have characterized the inhibitor sensitivity, substrate specificity, and divalent cation requirements of the granule H+ pump. Under identical assay conditions, the granule ATPase was insensitive to concentrations of NaN3, oligomycin, and efrapeptin which almost completely inhibit ATP hydrolysis by mitochondrial membranes. The granule ATPase was inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but only at concentrations much higher than those needed to maximally inhibit mitochondrial ATPase. Vanadate (VO3-) ion and ouabain also failed to inhibit granule ATPase activity at concentrations which maximally inhibited purified Na+,K+-ATPase. Two alkylating agents, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and N-ethylmaleimide both completely inhibited H+ pumping by the granule ATPase under conditions where ATP hydrolysis by mitochondrial membranes or Na+,K+-ATPase was hardly affected. These results suggest that the H+-pumping ATPase of platelet granule membrane may belong to a class of ion-translocating ATPases distinct from both the phosphoenzyme-type ATPases present in plasma membrane and the F1F0-ATPases of energy-transducing membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1586223994,"Polyclonal antisera raised against a single lysosomal enzyme from Dictyostelium discoideum will cross-react with other lysosomal proteins due to the presence of common post-translational modification antigens. We have now isolated hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies that also recognize a shared lysosomal determinant. Although the same proteins are recognized by the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the actual determinants differ. Also, the polyclonal serum contains antibodies which recognize at least one determinant not recognized by the monoclonal antibodies. All of the antigenic proteins are minor cell proteins but represent a majority of the proteins secreted from the cells during axenic growth. Anode-directed nonequilibrium two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cellular and secreted protein indicates that the antigenic proteins have extremely acidic pI values; moreover, most are both sulfated and phosphorylated. Several sulfated polysaccharides, including dextran sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and heparin inhibit binding of the monoclonal but not the polyclonal antibodies, indicating that the shared determinant recognized by the monoclonal antibodies may involve sulfated oligosaccharides. As a step in analyzing the function of the post-translational modification of lysosomal enzymes, we have screened a mutagenized population of amoeba for those lacking the antigenic determinant recognized by one of the monoclonal antibodies. Five cell lines have been isolated that completely lack the determinant. They appear to fall into at least three different classes based upon physical properties of the enzymes. One strain lacks any detectable sulfation of glycoproteins. Several of the strains are capable of forming fruiting bodies indicating that the antigenic determinant plays no crucial role in morphogenesis under laboratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1549766776,"Transcription of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli and other bacterial species is regulated by the formation of alternative secondary structures in the leader segment of the transcript. During in vitro transcription of the trp leader region RNA polymerase pauses at base pair 92 after synthesis of an RNA hairpin secondary structure. We studied the dependence of pausing on hairpin stability by examining mutant trp templates containing base pair substitutions in the region corresponding to the hairpin secondary structure. Base changes that lower the stability of the hairpin were found to reduce both the frequency and half-life of RNA polymerase pausing while base changes that do not affect hairpin stability had little effect on pausing. Pausing was enhanced by the nusA protein; this enhancement was greatly reduced on mutant templates specifying less stable hairpins. The frequency of pausing on some mutant templates was correlated with the extent of read-through transcription beyond the trp attenuator, suggesting a possible role for pausing in the coupling of transcription and translation during transcription of the leader region of the operon."
https://openalex.org/W1553199297,"It has been widely reported that the in vivo administration of glucagon to rats results in the stimulation of calcium influx in subsequently isolated liver mitochondria. The mechanism of this effect is investigated through simultaneous measurements of calcium uptake rate and mitochondrial membrane potential. This allows the measurement of the calcium uniporter conductance independent of hormonal effects on electron transport or respiration. Two experimental approaches are used. The first involves measuring the uptake of 40-50 nmol of Ca2+/mg of mitochondrial protein with the calcium dye antipyrylazo III; the second uses 45Ca2+ to follow uptake in the presence of 0.5 to 1.5 microM free calcium, buffered with HEDTA. In both cases a tetraphenyl phosphonium electrode is used to follow membrane potential, and membrane potential is varied using either malonate or butylmalonate in the presence of rotenone. The relative merits of these two approaches are discussed. The conductance of the calcium uniporter is found not to be stimulated by glucagon pretreatment. Also, the relative glucagon stimulation of both calcium influx and membrane potential is found to increase with increasing malonate concentration. These results imply that there is no direct stimulation of calcium uptake into liver mitochondria following glucagon treatment. The results are consistent with a glucagon stimulation of substrate transport, substrate oxidation, or a stimulation of electron transport resulting in an increased membrane potential and secondary stimulation of calcium uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1983063887,"We show that a protein of 63 amino acids is the product of the rop gene, a gene which negatively regulates the copy number of plasmids of the ColE1 family. Rop protein purified to homogeneity inhibits ColE1 plasmid replication in a bacterial extract. Furthermore, we show that Rop inhibition requires RNA I. In a purified in vitro system that can support primer transcription and processing, Rop affects primer formation in two ways: first, it elicits transcription termination oat nucleotide 220, and second, it increases the ability of RNA I to inhibit RNAase H processing of the primer. The analysis of these data and the comparison with the results obtained in vivo with transcription fusion experiments allow us to propose a tentative model of the molecular mechanism underlying Rop-RNA I inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2112739058,"Abstract Rat liver glutathione S-transferases consist of binary combinations of three major classes of subunits designated as Ya (Mr = 25,600), Yb (Mr = 27,000) and Yc (Mr = 28,000). We have determined the nucleotide sequences of a cDNA insert in pGTR262 containing partial sequence of a Yc subunit. Sequence comparison with a Ya subunit cDNA clone pGTR261 revealed 70% nucleotide sequence homology and 65% amino acid sequence homology in the overlapping coding regions. Approximately 65% of the amino acid substitutions between these two subunits occur in clusters of two to eight residues. The 3' noncoding sequences of these two subunit cDNA clones are highly divergent in length and in sequences. The 3' noncoding region of pGTR262 cDNA contains open reading frames of 23, 39, and 13 amino acids which are in phase with the deduced Yc subunit sequences but interrupted by termination codons. By RNA blot hybridization analysis, we found that this Yc subunit sequence expression is tissue specific. It is expressed at a reduced level in kidney and testis as compared with liver and hardly at all in heart, lung, seminal vesicles, and spleen. We suggest that the mechanism for the tissue-specific expression of the Yc subunit of rat liver glutathione S-transferases may occur at or prior to the level of RNA processing. From the divergent DNA sequences between the Ya and Yc subunits reported in this communication and their differential induction upon acute phenobarbital administration reported by Pickett et al. (Pickett, C.B., Donohue, A. M., Lu, A. Y. H., and Hales, B. F. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 215, 539-543) we propose that the Ya and Yc subunits of rat liver glutathione S-transferases are encoded by separate gene families or transcriptional units."

The association constant for the TnI X TnT (where TnI and TnT are the inhibitory subunit and the tropomyosin-binding subunit, respectively, of troponin) complex was measured with two different probes, IAE-TnI and IAE-TnT. The measured values were not affected by the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+, and the mean values for the three buffer conditions are, respectively, 8.0 X 10(6) and 9.0 X 10(6) M-1 for the two probes. The association constant for TnC-TnI (where TnC is the Ca2+-binding subunit of troponin) interaction was measured with three probes, IAE-TnC, DANZ-TnC, and IAE-TnI. Values of 1.7 X 10(9), 1.2 X 10(8), and 1.0 X 10(6) M-1 were obtained, respectively, in the presence of calcium ion, in the presence of magnesium ion (no calcium), and in the absence of divalent metal ions. A mean value of 4.0 X 10(7) M-1 was obtained for the association constant of TnC X TnT using DANZ-TnC and IAE-TnC as probes in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. A value of 4.5 X 10(6) M-1 was obtained in the absence of divalent metal ions. The results show that the presence of magnesium ion in the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites strengthens the TnC-TnI and the TnC-TnT interactions and suggest that the troponin structure would be stabilized. This likely results from the effect of magnesium ion on the Ca2+-Mg2+ domains of TnC. The presence of calcium ion in the Ca2+-specific sites provides an additional binding free energy for the TnC-TnI interaction which presumably reflects the changes in the subunit interactions required for the calcium regulatory switch."
https://openalex.org/W1517709540,"Association rates have been determined for the interaction of human alpha 2-macroglobulin with human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and human plasma kallikrein. Both of the neutrophil enzymes are rapidly inactivated by this inhibitor; however, the inactivation of plasma kallikrein is much slower. Comparison of the rates of inactivation with those already established for other inhibitors clearly indicate that alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is the controlling inhibitor for neutrophil elastase and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin for cathepsin G, alpha 2-macroglobulin acting only as a secondary inhibitor. The control of plasma kallikrein would appear to be rather poor since neither alpha 2-macroglobulin nor C1-inhibitor appears to react very rapidly with this proteinase. Thus, a primary role for alpha 2-macroglobulin in directly inactivating proteinases in blood, under normal physiological conditions, remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1540101256,"The lysosomal hydrolases of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, possess a common posttranslational modification which is extremely antigenic in rabbits and mice. Rabbit antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize this determinant cross-react with a group of at least 40-50 highly negatively charged proteins which include most or all of the lysosomal enzymes. (Knecht, D. A., Dimond, R. L., Wheeler, S., and Loomis, W. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10633-10640). The present study demonstrates that the determinant is found on certain N-linked oligosaccharides derived from one of these proteins. An esterified sulfate is absolutely required for antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1603021521,"The biochemical and metabolic effects of deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, were investigated using two human T lymphoblastoid cell lines. A dose-response analysis demonstrated that the concentration of deoxycoformycin at which there was 50% inhibition of growth was greater than 1 X 10(-3) M in lymphoblastoid cells. Uptake of deoxycoformycin was biphasic and occurred much more slowly than for natural nucleosides, and lower saturation levels were reached. The intracellular concentration of deoxycoformycin achieved was 0.4 to 0.5 microM when the extracellular concentration was 1 microM. At 10 microM extracellular concentration, the intracellular concentration was 3-4 microM. Although deoxycoformycin at very low concentrations (1 or 10 microM) did not have any detectable effects on the growth of these cells, the nucleoside was found to be metabolized, and was phosphorylated to give the mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives. The triphosphate derivative was incorporated into cellular DNA with little incorporation into cellular RNA. Metabolism of deoxycoformycin in several mutant lymphoblastoid cells deficient in adenosine kinase and/or deoxycytidine kinase was found to be unchanged from wild-type cells, indicating that these major nucleoside kinases do not play a significant role in the phosphorylation of deoxycoformycin. These results may account, at least in part, for the differences that are observed between the pharmacologic inhibition of adenosine deaminase, and the inherited deficiency of adenosine deaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1515712598,"The relative role of various Ca2+ transport systems in the regulation of Ca2+ cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was evaluated using rabbit renal proximal tubules. Intracellular compartmentation was evaluated through Ca2+ releases induced by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), A23187, and ruthenium red (RR) alone and in combination. In a Ca2+-free solution after 1 h of incubation, FCCP released 43 +/- 4%, A23187 54 +/- 3%, and RR 29 +/- 5% of total cellular Ca2+; in addition, RR inhibited the rate of FCCP-induced release, confirming its mitochondrial origin. In 1 mM Ca2+, the releases were 57 +/- 9%, 70 +/- 5%, and 34 +/- 10%, respectively. Therefore, the mitochondrial Ca2+ content is 20-60 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein, sufficiently large to effectively buffer cell Ca2+. To evaluate the role of the plasma membrane Na:Ca exchanger, 10(-4) M ouabain was added and caused a slight decline in total cell Ca2+ content and no change in ionized Ca2+ measured by the null-point method, suggesting that the plasmalemmal Na+:Ca2+ exchanger does not play an important role in Ca2+ extrusion. Cytosolic free Ca2+ increased when 100 mM sodium was replaced with equimolar choline or tetramethylammonium. However, tetramethylammonium replacement released 55% of the mitochondrial Ca2+ content by increasing mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux without affecting the Ca2+ influx pathway. These results suggest that Na+ replacements in this tissue increase ionized Ca2+ by increasing mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux and not by inhibition of Na+:Ca2+ exchange at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2147346525,"The distribution of cytochromes P-450 that catalyze aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase were studied with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1-7-1 which completely inhibits these activities of a purified 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rat liver cytochrome P-450. The degree of inhibition by MAb 1-7-1 quantitatively assesses the contribution of different cytochromes P-450 in the liver, lung, and kidney microsomes from untreated, 3-methylcholanthrene- and phenobarbital (PB)-treated rats, mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters. Enzyme sensitivity to MAb 1-7-1 inhibition defines two types of cytochrome P-450 contributing to aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase. The MAb 1-7-1-sensitive cytochrome P-450 is a major contributor to aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase in rat liver, lung, and kidney of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, C57BL/6 mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters; this type is also present in lesser amounts in the extrahepatic tissues of the control and PB-treated animals, and in the lungs of the relatively noninducible DBA/2 mice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. This form however makes little or no contribution to liver aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase of control or PB-treated animals. 7-Ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase is also a function of both the MAb 1-7-1-sensitive and insensitive classes of cytochrome P-450. The ratio of the classes contributing to aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase differs in the various tissues and species and after inducer treatment. All of the 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity in guinea pigs and hamsters is a function of cytochromes P-450 different than the MAb 1-7-1-sensitive cytochrome P-450 responsible for aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. Thus, the MAb 1-7-1 antigenically defines the type of cytochromes P-450 contributing to each reaction. Cytochromes P-450 can be viewed as paradigmatic for enzyme systems in which the nature and amount of product is regulated by multiple isoenzymic forms. Analyses using monoclonal antibodies to specific isoenzymes may thus have broad application to a variety of other complex systems which are composed of multiple isoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1568841318,"We have examined the tissue-specific expression of three rabbit genes that are closely related members of a subfamily of the phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 gene family. Analysis of the levels of mRNA in liver revealed that (a) cytochrome P-450PBc1 mRNA was not detectable in livers from control animals but was present in livers from animals treated with phenobarbital, (b) cytochrome P-450PBc2 was present in control tissue and was increased by about 3-fold 24 h after phenobarbital treatment, and (c) the levels of cytochrome P-450PBc3 mRNA was the same in livers from control and treated animals. In the kidney, only P-450PBc2 mRNA was detected at a level 15% of that in the liver, and the levels increased about 3-fold after phenobarbital treatment. None of the mRNAs was detected in lung tissue. Multiple species of RNA were observed that hybridized to probes for cytochrome P-450PBc1 and P-450PBc2 cDNAs by Northern blot analysis ranging in size from 2300 to 4000 nucleotides. Differential sites for polyadenylation probably cause the heterogeneity in size. A single species of RNA of 2200 nucleotides that hybridized to cytochrome P-450PBc3 cDNA probes was observed. These data demonstrate that three closely related cytochrome P-450 genes are differentially responsive to phenobarbital treatment and that they exhibit different tissue-specific patterns of expression."
https://openalex.org/W1595292675,"Abstract Immunoglobulin E-binding activity was expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA from rat basophilic leukemia cells which possess abundant immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor. Such activity was demonstrated with intact oocytes by their binding of 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal IgE. Binding activity was specific as shown by the total inhibition of 125I-IgE binding by unlabeled IgE but not by unlabeled IgG1. The relevance of the IgE-binding activity to the IgE receptor was also supported by the absence of this activity in oocytes injected with mRNA from cells lacking surface IgE receptors. mRNA coding for the IgE-binding activity was enriched in fractions sedimenting at 13.5 S in sucrose density gradients. From oocytes injected with rat basophilic leukemia mRNA, two major polypeptides were isolated by affinity purification on IgE immunoadsorbent. One (Mr = 31,000) is equivalent in size to the previously identified receptor-associated protein; the other (Mr = 40,000) is speculated to be a partially glycosylated or unglycosylated form of the alpha subunit of the IgE receptor. The binding of IgE-coated fluorescent microspheres by oocytes injected with rat basophilic leukemia mRNA demonstrated the surface expression of the IgE-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1577726465,"pH changes of the reaction medium (pH 6.35) following addition of MgATP were determined at 4 degrees C with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles in the presence of 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2. With intact vesicles, a pronounced acidification following a slight alkalinization was induced by MgATP, indicating H+ ejection from vesicles. This agrees with previous observations by several investigators that suggested H+ counter-transport coupled to Ca2+ uptake. When vesicles were made leaky, a markedly enhanced alkalinization occurred after addition of MgATP, and then the pH returned to the level before the MgATP addition. The decay of this alkalinization coincided with the disappearance of phosphoenzyme (EP) which was formed from MgATP and the Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The CaCl2 concentration dependence of the alkalinization agreed well with that of EP formation. Furthermore, the alkalinization was prevented by modification of a specific SH group of the enzyme essential for EP decomposition. These findings give evidence that the alkalinization with leaky vesicles represents protonation of the enzyme during ATP hydrolysis. The enhanced alkalinization with leaky vesicles suggests protonation occurring inside vesicles. When CaATP in place of MgATP was added in the absence of MgCl2, neither the H+ ejection from intact vesicles nor the enhanced alkalinization with leaky vesicles occurred. Under these conditions, CaATP did not efficiently support active Ca2+ uptake. These results are compatible with the view that the observed protonation could represent an initial event occurring inside vesicles in the H+ countertransport coupled to Ca2+ uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1525257631,"The colicin Ib gene of the large low-copy-number plasmid Col Ib-P9 has been cloned into the plasmid vector pBR322. Observations of growth characteristics of strains carrying the cloned gene and analysis of insertion and deletion derivatives of the recombinant plasmid have led to the conclusion that colicin Ib production can occur without the colicin Ib immunity system. The direction of transcription for the colicin Ib gene was determined by use of an expression vector and subsequently confirmed by DNA-sequence analysis of the colicin Ib promoter. The physical maps of the cloned colicin Ia and colicin Ib genes exhibit a great deal of similarity which has enabled the construction of hybrid genes consisting of the N terminus of one colicin gene being linked to the C terminus of the other. From an analysis of the chimeric colicins and the locations of the fusions, we conclude that the information necessary for immunity recognition by colicin Ia and colicin Ib resides in the C-terminal half of the colicin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1509260443,"The role of DNA methylation in the expression of the rat growth hormone (rGH) gene was assessed by using a hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, and the iso-schizomeric restriction enzymes MspI and HpaII. 5-Azacytidine increased rGH mRNA 3-8-fold in GH3D6 cells, a subclone of rat pituitary tumor cell lines that expresses one-tenth to one-fifteenth the GH expressed by two other clones, GH3 and GC. The effect was also detected at the level of pre-mRNA. The effect was independent of glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones and was found to be inheritable. The DNA methylation pattern generated by the isoschizomeric restriction enzymes indicated that the HpaII sites in the rGH gene were mostly methylated in GH3D6 cells but mostly unmethylated in GC cells. After treatment with 5-azacytidine, about 22% of these HpaII sites in GH3D6 cells became unmethylated. Thus, DNA methylation correlates inversely with the expression of the rGH gene in these cell lines. However, three other observations indicate that factors in addition to DNA methylation control rGH expression. First, in GC cells, even though most of the HpaII sites are unmethylated, the gene is not fully expressed. Second, in rat hepatoma cells, which do not express GH at all, the GH gene is less methylated than that in GH3D6 cells. Third, within the sensitivities of the assay methods, 5-azacytidine has no effect on the GH gene when it is completely silent. Taken together, the findings indicate that DNA methylation modulates but does not control GH gene expression. It is tempting to speculate that DNA methylation can influence expression only when the gene is committed to express."
https://openalex.org/W1607378819,"Binding kinetics of porcine pancreatic elastase to human alpha 2-macroglobulin was monitored by measuring the enzymatic activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin-bound elastase on succinyltrialanine p-nitroanilide after inhibition of free elastase by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. The association of the two proteins follows second-order kinetics with a rate constant ka = 4.4 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 at pH 8.0 and 25 degrees C. The rate of association strongly increases between pH 5.0 and 8.0, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of binding is the proteolytic cleavage at the bait region of the macroglobulin. The study of the temperature dependence of ka shows that the binding of elastase to alpha 2-macroglobulin is characterized by a positive entropy of activation (delta S* = +35.3 e.u. at 25 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W1482201556,"Addition of a myosin IB polyclonal antibody, which reacts with the heavy chains of both myosins IA and IB, to the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins synthesized in vitro using Acanthamoeba messenger RNA specifically immunoprecipitated radioactive polypeptides that migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels exactly with the heavy chains of purified myosins IA and IB. A myosin II polyclonal antibody specifically immunoprecipitated a radioactive polypeptide which migrated exactly with the heavy chain of myosin II. These results provide strong evidence that Acanthamoeba myosins IA, IB, and II are separate gene products and that the purified proteins contain native, undegraded heavy chains. These results are especially important for myosins IA and IB, because they possess unusually small heavy chains for myosins."
https://openalex.org/W1590183299,"The effect of N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-O-hemiadipate (AD 143), a new derivative of adriamycin, on various steps of the enzymic reaction catalyzed by chicken myeloblastosis RNA polymerase II was studied. AD 143 inhibition of RNA synthesis, which was evident at the beginning of the reaction, could not be reversed by increasing the concentrations of any one of the four nucleoside triphosphate substrates of the reaction. Furthermore, the RNA synthesis inhibition was not affected by varying the concentrations of template DNA. The AD 143-induced inhibition caused a reduction of the frequency of RNA chain initiation, whereas the average chain length of RNA synthesized at the end of the reaction remained unaltered. The susceptible step in the initiation process was found to be the formation of stable complexes between RNA polymerase and the DNA template. While AD 143 causes no inhibition of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase activity, it was found not to affect the E. coli RNA polymerase-template DNA complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1522514867,"Surface-exposed regions of membrane-bound myelin basic protein--the major extrinsic membrane protein of central nervous system myelin--have been implicated as possible antigenic sites in diseased myelin. With the goal of determining the extent and nature of these regions, we have prepared basic protein modified with 13CH3-enriched acetyl groups at 7 of its 13 lysine residues. The resulting protein was placed in a membrane environment and studied by NMR spectroscopy to determine the location and rates of molecular motion of the labeled side chains with respect to lipid bilayers of the membrane. When 13C NMR spectra were obtained of the acetylated protein bound to multilamellar vesicles prepared from dimyristoylphosphatidic acid in the gel state (T = 33 degrees C), conditions under which reduced motion in the lipid bilayer broadens methylene and methyl 13C resonances of the membrane beyond detection (i.e. greater than 75-100 Hz), line widths of membrane-bound protein were measured to be 7.8 Hz, an increase of 4 Hz versus free protein. A reduction of 25-30% in integrated intensity observed in protein acetyl resonances upon membrane interaction was shown to be attributable to a population of protein-aggregated liposomes whose resonances were similarly too broad to be observed. Thus, the epsilon-acetyllysyl probes distributed throughout the protein do not penetrate the dimyristoylphosphatidic acid bilayer, but must reside in the interstitial aqueous spaces at or between membrane surfaces. These findings suggest an overall surface accessibility of membrane-bound myelin basic protein and are therefore incompatible with a model for the protein involving membrane-embedded loops or regions of functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W91159078,"Earlier work had indicated that mitochondrial coupling factor B (FB) could be obtained with differing molecular weights, a highly active 13,000 form, a 29,200 form with low activity, and a partially purified 46,000 form with activity higher than the 29,200 form. We have analyzed FB preparations of different purity and after different types of treatment on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE), followed by silver staining or immunostaining either with rabbit anti-FB serum or monoclonal FB antibody. Highly purified preparations which appear as single bands in SDS-PAGE develop additional higher molecular weight bands (silver staining), including a 48,000 and a 68,000 band, after lyophilization or repeated freezing and thawing or if subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of thiol compounds. FB prepared without addition of dithiothreitol and glycerol for stabilization also shows high molecular weight forms, although the active fractions are obtained consistently in the final gel filtration step of purification at a position corresponding to Mr = 13,000. When FB preparations are analyzed by immunoblots of SDS-PAGE using a monoclonal antibody to FB, fresh preparations of purified FB show a single band, while multiple bands are seen in samples which have been frozen and thawed repeatedly. Preparations made in the absence of dithiothreitol and glycerol also show cross-reactive forms of high molecular weight. Similar immunoblots using rabbit antiserum with mitochondria, its extracts, and partially purified FB preparations, all show the presence of several higher molecular weight forms. It is concluded that FB is probably a monomer in mitochondria, and it appears to undergo oligomerization after extraction and during purification."
