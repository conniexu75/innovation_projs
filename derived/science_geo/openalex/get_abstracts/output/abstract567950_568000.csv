Here, we present the first genome-wide genetic screen of an apicomplexan. We adapted CRISPR/Cas9 to assess the contribution of each gene from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii during infection of human fibroblasts. Our analysis defines ∼200 previously uncharacterized, fitness-conferring genes unique to the phylum, from which 16 were investigated, revealing essential functions during infection of human cells. Secondary screens identify as an invasion factor the claudin-like apicomplexan microneme protein (CLAMP), which resembles mammalian tight-junction proteins and localizes to secretory organelles, making it critical to the initiation of infection. CLAMP is present throughout sequenced apicomplexan genomes and is essential during the asexual stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. These results provide broad-based functional information on T. gondii genes and will facilitate future approaches to expand the horizon of antiparasitic interventions.

Apicomplexans comprise a phylum of over 5,000 obligate parasites whose hosts span the animal kingdom (Levine, 1988Levine N.D. The Protozoan Phylum Apicomplexa. Volume I. CRC Press, Inc., 1988Google Scholar). Several species are leading causes of infant mortality, such as Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium spp., which cause malaria and severe diarrhea, respectively (Checkley et al., 2015Checkley W. White Jr., A.C. Jaganath D. Arrowood M.J. Chalmers R.M. Chen X.-M. Fayer R. Griffiths J.K. Guerrant R.L.

World Malaria Report. http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/en/.Google Scholar). Toxoplasma gondii, predicted to establish lifelong infections in a quarter of the world’s population, can cause life-threatening disease in immune-compromised individuals or when contracted congenitally (Pappas et al., 2009Pappas G. Roussos N. Falagas M.E. Toxoplasmosis snapshots: global status of Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence and implications for pregnancy and congenital toxoplasmosis.Int. J. Parasitol. 2009; 39: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Despite their importance to global health, apicomplexans remain enigmatic. Only a handful of species have been studied, and fewer than half of their genes have been functionally annotated. The ease with which T. gondii can be cultured, along with the genetic tractability that comes with its balanced nucleotide composition and high transfection rates, presents compelling arguments for using this parasite as a model apicomplexan. Scalable methods to assess gene function in T. gondii could therefore greatly extend our understanding of apicomplexan biology. Genetic crosses have long been used to identify loci responsible for phenotypes ranging from drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum (Wellems et al., 1991Wellems T.E. Walker-Jonah A. Panton L.J.

USA. 1991; 88: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) to virulence in T. gondii (Saeij et al., 2006Saeij J.P.J. Boyle J.P. Coller S. Taylor S. Sibley L.D. Brooke-Powell E.T. Ajioka J.W. Boothroyd J.C.

However, completing the sexual cycles of T. gondii or Plasmodium spp. in cats or mosquitoes is challenging, and the traits examined must vary within the species. Spontaneous mutations, or those induced chemically or by transposition, can sample a wider range of phenotypes (Crabb et al., 2011Crabb B.S. de Koning-Ward T.F. Gilson P.R.

Chem. 2013; 56: 7761-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the population size required to achieve saturation is impractical, and causal mutations are often difficult to identify. Gene deletion collections, such as those available for fungi (Winzeler et al., 1999Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. et al.Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar), can aid functional analysis of eukaryotic genomes. With this aim, large-scale efforts have generated collections of knockout vectors for P. falciparum (Maier et al., 2008Maier A.G. Rug M. O’Neill M.T. Brown M. Chakravorty S. Szestak T. Chesson J.

However, similar approaches have not been adapted to T. gondii, despite the advantage of both high transfection rates and a continuous culture system. The recent adaptation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 has further enhanced the genetic tractability of T. gondii (Shen et al., 2014Shen B. Brown K.M.

Hackett C.G. Tran F. Westwood N.J. Lourido S. Efficient genome engineering of Toxoplasma gondii using CRISPR/Cas9.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e100450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This technology has the advantage of being easily reprogrammable by changing the 20 bp of homology between the single guide RNA (sgRNA, or guide) and the genomic target (reviewed in Sander and Joung, 2014Sander J.D. Joung J.K. CRISPR-Cas systems for editing, regulating and targeting genomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). The endogenously high rates of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in T. gondii make it well suited to CRISPR-mediated gene disruption by efficiently creating frame-shift mutations and insertions at the cleavage site (Sidik et al., 2014Sidik S.M. Hackett C.G. Tran F. Westwood N.J. Lourido S. Efficient genome engineering of Toxoplasma gondii using CRISPR/Cas9.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e100450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Several studies have developed CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide genetic screens for mammalian cells (Koike-Yusa et al., 2014Koike-Yusa H. Li Y. Tan E.-P. Velasco-Herrera Mdel.C. Yusa K. Genome-wide recessive genetic screening in mammalian cells with a lentiviral CRISPR-guide RNA library.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, Shalem et al., 2014Shalem O. Sanjana N.E. Hartenian E. Shi X. Scott D.A. Mikkelsen T.S. Heckl D. Ebert B.L. Root D.E.

Lander E.S. Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Science. 2014; 343: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). These screens use lentiviral libraries of sgRNAs to generate pools of mutants that can be exposed to selective pressures. The integrated sgRNAs can be used as barcodes to measure the contribution of targeted genes to cell fitness. Despite the lack of viral transduction, we adapted CRISPR/Cas9 for pooled screening in T. gondii. We present the first genome-wide genetic screen performed in any apicomplexan. We demonstrate the power of this approach using both positive and negative selection strategies. This approach provides the first complete survey of contributions to parasite fitness, cataloguing the ∼40% of genes needed during infection of human fibroblasts. Based on this analysis, we were able to pinpoint previously uncharacterized conserved apicomplexan proteins necessary for the T. gondii lytic cycle. We demonstrate that one of these proteins acts as an essential invasion factor and is also required by the malaria parasite P. falciparum to complete its asexual replication cycle. This protein is conserved throughout the phylum, providing an important molecular link to the invasion process of distantly related apicomplexans. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of genetic screens in T. gondii to uncover conserved biological processes and provides a transformative tool for parasitology. Highly efficient gene disruption and stable integration of the sgRNA are necessary to develop large-scale CRISPR screens. Transient expression of SpCas9 and an sgRNA in T. gondii can disrupt a targeted gene in ∼20% of parasites (Sidik et al., 2014Sidik S.M. Hackett C.G. Tran F. Westwood N.J. Lourido S. Efficient genome engineering of Toxoplasma gondii using CRISPR/Cas9.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e100450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We reasoned that constitutive Cas9 expression, prior to introducing the sgRNA, might increase the likelihood of gene disruption. We transfected parasites with a Cas9-expression plasmid carrying a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) selectable marker (pCas9/CAT; Figure 1A). However, repeated attempts failed to isolate Cas9-expressing parasites, suggesting that Cas9 expression is detrimental to T. gondii, as has been suggested for other microorganisms (Jiang et al., 2014Jiang W. Brueggeman A.J. Horken K.M. Plucinak T.M. Weeks D.P. Successful transient expression of Cas9 and single guide RNA genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Eukaryot. Cell. 2014; 13: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Peng et al., 2014Peng D. Kurup S.P. Yao P.Y. Minning T.A. Tarleton R.L. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated single-gene and gene family disruption in Trypanosoma cruzi.MBio. 2014; 6 (e02097-14)Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that expression of a “decoy” sgRNA (pCas9/decoy; Figure 1A) could prevent toxicity that might arise from unintended Cas9 activity directed by endogenous RNAs. For this purpose, we used an sgRNA that appeared non-functional against the 3′ UTR of NHE1. Co-transfection of pCas9/CAT and pCas9/decoy readily yielded Cas9-expressing parasites, confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 1B) and immunofluorescence (Figure 1C). As predicted, the Cas9-expressing strain retained the decoy locus (Figure 1D), reinforcing its requirement for constitutive Cas9 expression. We assessed the efficiency of gene disruption in the Cas9-expressing strain by expressing an sgRNA against the surface antigen SAG1. Pyrimethamine treatment of the population selected for stable integration of the sgRNA expression vector (pU6-DHFR), which carries the resistant allele of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; Figure 1E). SAG1 provides a reliable measure of gene disruption, because it is dispensable yet stably maintained in cultured parasites (Kim and Boothroyd, 1995Kim K. Boothroyd J.C. Toxoplasma gondii: stable complementation of sag1 (p30) mutants using SAG1 transfection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 3 days after transfection with the sgRNA construct, 70% of Cas9-expressing parasites had lost SAG1 expression. Pyrimethamine selection further improved SAG1 disruption to 97% over the same time period (Figure 1F). The high efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene disruption in Cas9-expressing parasites provided the platform for large-scale genetic screens in T. gondii. We designed a library of sgRNAs containing ten guides against each of the 8,158 predicted T. gondii protein-coding genes using previously described criteria (Wang et al., 2014Wang T. Wei J.J. Sabatini D.M. Lander E.S. Genetic screens in human cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Science. 2014; 343: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The library was cloned into the sgRNA expression vector (Figure 1E). 40% of the parasites that survived transfection integrated the vector into their genomes (data not shown). We could therefore measure the relative abundance of each integrated sgRNA by next-generation sequencing. Since the frequency of a given sgRNA corresponds to the relative abundance of parasites carrying the targeted disruption, the change in relative abundance from the composition of the plasmid library before transfection indicates the enrichment or depletion of a given mutant. We defined the average log2 fold change in abundance for sgRNAs targeting a given gene as the “phenotype” score for that gene (Figure 2A). To determine whether we could maintain diversity over time, we transfected the library into both wild-type and Cas9-expressing parasites and sampled the populations after each of three lytic cycles (Figure 2B, left). The representation of guides against all genes remained stable over the course of the experiment in the absence of Cas9. In contrast, sgRNAs against specific genes were lost from the Cas9-expressing population (Figure 2C), indicating that a diverse set of mutants had been generated. To investigate the compatibility of our screen with positive-selection strategies, we treated pools of mutants with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR), which is toxic to parasites through its incorporation into pyrimidine pools. Three lytic cycles after transfection with the library, we split the Cas9-expressing parasites into cultures with or without FUDR (Figure 2B, right). As expected, FUDR-treated cultures recovered slowly, and untreated cultures were passaged two or three times over the same period. Measuring the sgRNAs in the two populations revealed that FUDR strongly selected against uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) activity, observed as an increased abundance of sgRNAs against UPRT and the highly reproducible phenotype score for the gene (Figures 2D and 2E). Since loss of UPRT—a component of the pyrimidine salvage pathway—is known to confer FUDR resistance (Donald and Roos, 1995Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Insertional mutagenesis and marker rescue in a protozoan parasite: cloning of the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase locus from Toxoplasma gondii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), this experiment demonstrates the power of this approach to rapidly and efficiently identify positively selected mutants from a T. gondii population. Loss of sgRNAs from a population of mutants can serve to identify genes that contribute to cellular fitness (Wang et al., 2015Wang T. Birsoy K. Hughes N.W. Krupczak K.M. Post Y. Wei J.J. Lander E.S. Sabatini D.M. Identification and characterization of essential genes in the human genome.Science. 2015; 350: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In the context of our T. gondii screen, the changes in sgRNA representation observed after the third lytic cycle provided a convenient measure of a gene’s contribution to fitness. This time point resembled the gene rankings of later cycles (Figure 2F) while minimizing the chance of stochastic guide loss. We calculated the mean phenotype score for each parasite gene from four biological replicates of the screen. Genes that contribute to parasite fitness, represented by negative scores, were distributed throughout the genome and did not segregate by gene length or position on the chromosome (Figure 3A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Croken et al., 2014Croken M.M. Qiu W. White M.W. Kim K. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of Toxoplasma gondii expression datasets links cell cycle progression and the bradyzoite developmental program.BMC Genomics. 2014; 15: 515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26559) Google Scholar) showed that genes predicted to be essential, like those encoding ribosomal and proteasomal constituents, were enriched in low phenotype scores (Figure 3B). Genes that encode components of the apicoplast—a plastid common to most apicomplexans—showed a similar enrichment, in accordance with the essential metabolic functions performed by this organelle (Seeber and Soldati-Favre, 2010Seeber F. Soldati-Favre D. Metabolic Pathways in the Apicoplast of Apicomplexa. Elsevier, 2010: 161-228Google Scholar). In contrast, specialized secretory organelles like the micronemes, dense granules, and rhoptries had fewer genes with low phenotype scores, possibly reflecting functional redundancy or dispensability in cell culture (Figure 3C). We analyzed the screen results for 81 genes previously reported to be either dispensable or essential for T. gondii growth in human fibroblasts (Table S1). The two groups of genes were clearly segregated on the basis of their phenotype scores (p = 6.7 × 10−16), with lower scores for the essential genes (Figure 3D). The most prominent outlier was RAB4, which appeared to be essential based on overexpression of a dominant-negative allele (Kremer et al., 2013Kremer K. Kamin D. Rittweger E. Wilkes J. Flammer H. Mahler S. Heng J. Tonkin C.J. Langsley G. Hell S.W. et al.An overexpression screen of Toxoplasma gondii Rab-GTPases reveals distinct transport routes to the micronemes.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003213-e1003216Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, we readily obtained RAB4 knockouts that grew normally (Figure S1), demonstrating its dispensability in cell culture. We therefore excluded RAB4 and, for consistency, other genes classified by overexpression experiments from subsequent analyses. To predict which genes might contribute to parasite fitness, we compared the phenotype score and distribution of sgRNAs for each gene to the values of 40 known dispensable genes. Using 10-fold cross validation on the set of control genes, we estimate this method can classify genes with >95% accuracy. Based on these results, we expect ∼40% of T. gondii genes significantly contribute to parasite fitness under the conditions tested. To further classify the fitness-conferring genes, we compared our predictions to other measures of gene function. Genes that are not expressed during the examined developmental stage are more likely to appear dispensable. Accordingly, only 6.9% of the fitness-conferring genes were found in the lowest quartile of expression, in contrast to 38.6% of genes predicted to be dispensable (Figure 3E). Genes under purifying selection are also more likely to be essential (Jordan et al., 2002Jordan I.K. Rogozin I.B. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Essential genes are more evolutionarily conserved than are nonessential genes in bacteria.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Low ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous mutation rates (dN/dS) are consistent with purifying selection. Comparison of syntenic genes between related species or other T. gondii strains revealed the expected enrichment for low phenotype scores among genes with low dN/dS values (Figures 3F and S2). As an extension of the same principle, genes found in a greater proportion of eukaryotic genomes are more likely to be essential. To test this prediction, we assessed the depth of conservation of T. gondii genes using ortholog groupings of 79 eukaryotic genomes available through OrthoMCL DB (Chen et al., 2006Chen F. Mackey A.J. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Roos D.S. OrthoMCL-DB: querying a comprehensive multi-species collection of ortholog groups.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D363-D368Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The distribution of phenotype scores within each category followed the predicted trend, which correlated depth of conservation with contribution to fitness and functional annotation (Figure 3G). The strong agreement of our results with published observations and expected trends allows us to confidently predict which genes will contribute to parasite fitness. We focused our efforts on the ∼200 fitness-conferring genes that lacked functional annotation and were only present in apicomplexans, which we called indispensable conserved apicomplexan proteins (ICAPs). We examined the subcellular localization of 28 ICAPs using CRISPR-mediated endogenous tagging to introduce a C-terminal Ty epitope into each targeted gene (Figure 4A). 3 days post-transfection, ∼60% of the populations displayed Ty expression in 5%–20% of parasite vacuoles (Figures 4B and 4C). Several proteins displayed characteristic structures including secretory vesicles like the micronemes (ICAPs 1 and 12), organelles like the mitochondrion (ICAPs 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, and 15), and compartments like the nucleolus (ICAP7) and conoid (ICAP16) (Figure 4C). Overlap with a known marker of the mitochondrion (MacRae et al., 2012MacRae J.I. Sheiner L. Nahid A. Tonkin C. Striepen B. McConville M.J.

Both micronemal proteins co-localized with the microneme markers MIC8 (Kessler et al., 2008Kessler H. Herm-Götz A. Hegge S. Rauch M. Soldati-Favre D. Frischknecht F. Meissner M. Microneme protein 8--a new essential invasion factor in Toxoplasma gondii.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and PLP1 (Kafsack et al., 2009Kafsack B.F.C. Pena J.D.O. Coppens I. Ravindran S. Boothroyd J.C. Carruthers V.B. Rapid membrane disruption by a perforin-like protein facilitates parasite exit from host cells.Science. 2009; 323: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Figure 4E). ICAP1 was shown to be essential for regulated exocytosis during the preparation of this work (Bullen et al., 2016Bullen H.E. Jia Y. Yamaryo-Botté Y. Bisio H. Zhang O. Jemelin N.K. Marq J.-B.

To assist the functional characterization of ICAPs, we engineered parasites that stably expressed both Cas9 and a nuclear YFP marker (H2B-YFP) (Hu et al., 2004Hu K. Roos D.S. Angel S.O. Murray J.M. Variability and heritability of cell division pathways in Toxoplasma gondii.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5697-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for fluorescence microscopy. This strain exhibited a high rate of sgRNA-mediated gene disruption, comparable to the strain used in the screen (Figure S3). As controls, we selected several genes known to be either indispensable (MYOA and CDPK1) or dispensable (SAG1, PLP1, and MYOC) and five uncharacterized genes predicted to be dispensable by the screen (controls 1–5; Figure 5A). Examining populations of parasites three days after transfection with guides against selected controls showed high rates of on-target mutations (Figure 5B) and significant loss of the target proteins (Figure 5C). Therefore, we can study the effect of a given sgRNA without isolating clonal populations, allowing us to analyze a large set of candidate genes in arrayed, secondary screens.Figure 5Functional Characterization of Indispensable Conserved Apicomplexan ProteinsShow full caption(A) Position of analyzed genes within the phenotypic ranking of all T. gondii genes.

https://openalex.org/W2513249090,"The HIF-2 antagonist PT2399 is tested in mice bearing tumourgrafts derived from human renal cell cancers to demonstrate its efficacy, identify markers of sensitivity and characterize its effects. The transcription factor HIF-2, an important driver of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, has been called 'undruggable'. However, in this issue of Nature, two groups report on the development and testing of a novel HIF-2α inhibitor, termed PT2399. William Kaelin and colleagues show that PT2399 causes tumour regression in preclinical mouse models of primary and metastatic pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma. James Brugarolas and colleagues tested the compound in mice with tumour grafts generated from human renal cell cancers. PT2399 decreased tumour growth in 10 out of 18 cell lines and was well tolerated. The authors identify potential markers of sensitivity and provide initial characterization of the effects and mechanisms of resistance acquisition in vivo. Both groups report variable sensitivity to PT2399 in some pVHL-defective cell lines, highlighting a need for predictive biomarkers to be developed for use of this approach in the clinic. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL)1,2. Because no other gene is mutated as frequently in ccRCC and VHL mutations are truncal3, VHL inactivation is regarded as the governing event4. VHL loss activates the HIF-2 transcription factor, and constitutive HIF-2 activity restores tumorigenesis in VHL-reconstituted ccRCC cells5. HIF-2 has been implicated in angiogenesis and multiple other processes6,7,8,9, but angiogenesis is the main target of drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib10. HIF-2 has been regarded as undruggable11. Here we use a tumourgraft/patient-derived xenograft platform12,13 to evaluate PT2399, a selective HIF-2 antagonist that was identified using a structure-based design approach. PT2399 dissociated HIF-2 (an obligatory heterodimer of HIF-2α–HIF-1β)14 in human ccRCC cells and suppressed tumorigenesis in 56% (10 out of 18) of such lines. PT2399 had greater activity than sunitinib, was active in sunitinib-progressing tumours, and was better tolerated. Unexpectedly, some VHL-mutant ccRCCs were resistant to PT2399. Resistance occurred despite HIF-2 dissociation in tumours and evidence of Hif-2 inhibition in the mouse, as determined by suppression of circulating erythropoietin, a HIF-2 target15 and possible pharmacodynamic marker. We identified a HIF-2-dependent gene signature in sensitive tumours. Gene expression was largely unaffected by PT2399 in resistant tumours, illustrating the specificity of the drug. Sensitive tumours exhibited a distinguishing gene expression signature and generally higher levels of HIF-2α. Prolonged PT2399 treatment led to resistance. We identified binding site and second site suppressor mutations in HIF-2α and HIF-1β, respectively. Both mutations preserved HIF-2 dimers despite treatment with PT2399. Finally, an extensively pretreated patient whose tumour had given rise to a sensitive tumourgraft showed disease control for more than 11 months when treated with a close analogue of PT2399, PT2385. We validate HIF-2 as a target in ccRCC, show that some ccRCCs are HIF-2 independent, and set the stage for biomarker-driven clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2507486477,"Mitochondrial complex I (also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) contributes to cellular energy production by transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. It is the largest protein assembly of the respiratory chain with a total mass of 970 kilodaltons. Here we present a nearly complete atomic structure of ovine (Ovis aries) mitochondrial complex I at 3.9 Å resolution, solved by cryo-electron microscopy with cross-linking and mass-spectrometry mapping experiments. All 14 conserved core subunits and 31 mitochondria-specific supernumerary subunits are resolved within the L-shaped molecule. The hydrophilic matrix arm comprises flavin mononucleotide and 8 iron-sulfur clusters involved in electron transfer, and the membrane arm contains 78 transmembrane helices, mostly contributed by antiporter-like subunits involved in proton translocation. Supernumerary subunits form an interlinked, stabilizing shell around the conserved core. Tightly bound lipids (including cardiolipins) further stabilize interactions between the hydrophobic subunits. Subunits with possible regulatory roles contain additional cofactors, NADPH and two phosphopantetheine molecules, which are shown to be involved in inter-subunit interactions. We observe two different conformations of the complex, which may be related to the conformationally driven coupling mechanism and to the active-deactive transition of the enzyme. Our structure provides insight into the mechanism, assembly, maturation and dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I, and allows detailed molecular analysis of disease-causing mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2509318050,"Motivated behaviors are critically dependent upon arousal but little is known about the neuronal mechanisms that coordinate motivational processes with sleep–wake regulation. The authors demonstrate that VTA dopaminergic neurons, which are central regulators of motivational processes, bidirectionally regulate sleep–wake states and sleep-related nesting behavior. Dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons are critically involved in a variety of behaviors that rely on heightened arousal, but whether they directly and causally control the generation and maintenance of wakefulness is unknown. We recorded calcium activity using fiber photometry in freely behaving mice and found arousal-state-dependent alterations in VTA dopaminergic neurons. We used chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations together with polysomnographic recordings to demonstrate that VTA dopaminergic neurons are necessary for arousal and that their inhibition suppresses wakefulness, even in the face of ethologically relevant salient stimuli. Nevertheless, before inducing sleep, inhibition of VTA dopaminergic neurons promoted goal-directed and sleep-related nesting behavior. Optogenetic stimulation, in contrast, initiated and maintained wakefulness and suppressed sleep and sleep-related nesting behavior. We further found that different projections of VTA dopaminergic neurons differentially modulate arousal. Collectively, our findings uncover a fundamental role for VTA dopaminergic circuitry in the maintenance of the awake state and ethologically relevant sleep-related behaviors."

Here we show that a small molecule (PT2399) that directly inhibits HIF-2α causes tumour regression in preclinical mouse models of primary and metastatic pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma in an on-target fashion. pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines display unexpectedly variable sensitivity to PT2399, however, suggesting the need for predictive biomarkers to be developed to use this approach optimally in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2509948508,"P granules are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein compartments that are involved in germline development in C. elegans. They are liquids that condense at one end of the embryo by localized phase separation, driven by gradients of polarity proteins such as the mRNA-binding protein MEX-5. To probe how polarity proteins regulate phase separation, we combined biochemistry and theoretical modeling. We reconstitute P granule-like droplets in vitro using a single protein PGL-3. By combining in vitro reconstitution with measurements of intracellular concentrations, we show that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can regulate the formation of PGL-3 droplets. Using theory, we show that, in a MEX-5 gradient, this mRNA competition mechanism can drive a gradient of P granule assembly with similar spatial and temporal characteristics to P granule assembly in vivo. We conclude that gradients of polarity proteins can position RNP granules during development by using RNA competition to regulate local phase separation."

https://openalex.org/W2518349977,"Adaptive evolution plays a large role in generating the phenotypic diversity observed in nature, yet current methods are impractical for characterizing the molecular basis and fitness effects of large numbers of individual adaptive mutations. Here, we used a DNA barcoding approach to generate the genotype-to-fitness map for adaptation-driving mutations from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae population experimentally evolved by serial transfer under limiting glucose. We isolated and measured the fitness of thousands of independent adaptive clones and sequenced the genomes of hundreds of clones. We found only two major classes of adaptive mutations: self-diploidization and mutations in the nutrient-responsive Ras/PKA and TOR/Sch9 pathways. Our large sample size and precision of measurement allowed us to determine that there are significant differences in fitness between mutations in different genes, between different paralogs, and even between different classes of mutations within the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W2514879313,"Sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) in the hippocampus are implied in memory consolidation, as shown by observational and interventional experiments. However, the mechanism of their generation remains unclear. Using two-dimensional silicon probe arrays, we investigated the propagation of SPW-Rs across the hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions. Synchronous activation of CA2 ensembles preceded SPW-R-related population activity in CA3 and CA1 regions. Deep CA2 neurons gradually increased their activity prior to ripples and were suppressed during the population bursts of CA3-CA1 neurons (ramping cells). Activity of superficial CA2 cells preceded the activity surge in CA3-CA1 (phasic cells). The trigger role of the CA2 region in SPW-R was more pronounced during waking than sleeping. These results point to the CA2 region as an initiation zone for SPW-Rs."

Tuberculosis is classically divided into states of latent infection and active disease. Using combined positron emission and computed tomography in 35 asymptomatic, antiretroviral-therapy-naive, HIV-1-infected adults with latent tuberculosis, we identified ten individuals with pulmonary abnormalities suggestive of subclinical, active disease who were substantially more likely to progress to clinical disease. Our findings challenge the conventional two-state paradigm and may aid future identification of biomarkers that are predictive of progression."

https://openalex.org/W2516502922,"A small-molecule antagonist of the P2X3 receptor reduces blood pressure in hypertensive rats via its action on the carotid body, pointing to a new drug target for treating hypertension. In view of the high proportion of individuals with resistance to antihypertensive medication and/or poor compliance or tolerance of this medication, new drugs to treat hypertension are urgently needed. Here we show that peripheral chemoreceptors generate aberrant signaling that contributes to high blood pressure in hypertension. We discovered that purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2rx3, also known as P2x3) mRNA expression is upregulated substantially in chemoreceptive petrosal sensory neurons in rats with hypertension. These neurons generate both tonic drive and hyperreflexia in hypertensive (but not normotensive) rats, and both phenomena are normalized by the blockade of P2X3 receptors. Antagonism of P2X3 receptors also reduces arterial pressure and basal sympathetic activity and normalizes carotid body hyperreflexia in conscious rats with hypertension; no effect was observed in rats without hypertension. We verified P2X3 receptor expression in human carotid bodies and observed hyperactivity of carotid bodies in individuals with hypertension. These data support the identification of the P2X3 receptor as a potential new target for the control of human hypertension."

Simultaneous imaging of pre- and postsynaptic structures in ACx in vivo revealed an increased rate of synapse formation in this pathway after auditory fear conditioning. Neural circuits underlying auditory fear conditioning have been extensively studied. Here we identified a previously unexplored pathway from the lateral amygdala (LA) to the auditory cortex (ACx) and found that selective silencing of this pathway using chemo- and optogenetic approaches impaired fear memory retrieval. Dual-color in vivo two-photon imaging of mouse ACx showed pathway-specific increases in the formation of LA axon boutons, dendritic spines of ACx layer 5 pyramidal cells, and putative LA–ACx synaptic pairs after auditory fear conditioning. Furthermore, joint imaging of pre- and postsynaptic structures showed that essentially all new synaptic contacts were made by adding new partners to existing synaptic elements. Together, these findings identify an amygdalocortical projection that is important to fear memory expression and is selectively modified by associative fear learning, and unravel a distinct architectural rule for synapse formation in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2515631058,"The neural circuit mechanisms underlying the integration and functions of adult-born dentate granule cell (DGCs) are poorly understood. Adult-born DGCs are thought to compete with mature DGCs for inputs to integrate. Transient genetic overexpression of a negative regulator of dendritic spines, Kruppel-like factor 9 (Klf9), in mature DGCs enhanced integration of adult-born DGCs and increased NSC activation. Reversal of Klf9 overexpression in mature DGCs restored spines and activity and reset neuronal competition dynamics and NSC activation, leaving the DG modified by a functionally integrated, expanded cohort of age-matched adult-born DGCs. Spine elimination by inducible deletion of Rac1 in mature DGCs increased survival of adult-born DGCs without affecting proliferation or DGC activity. Enhanced integration of adult-born DGCs transiently reorganized adult-born DGC local afferent connectivity and promoted global remapping in the DG. Rejuvenation of the DG by enhancing integration of adult-born DGCs in adulthood, middle age, and aging enhanced memory precision."

https://openalex.org/W2512809683,"Cortico-basal ganglia circuits are critical for speech and language and are implicated in autism spectrum disorder, in which language function can be severely affected. We demonstrate that in the mouse striatum, the gene Foxp2 negatively interacts with the synapse suppressor gene Mef2c. We present causal evidence that Mef2c inhibition by Foxp2 in neonatal mouse striatum controls synaptogenesis of corticostriatal inputs and vocalization in neonates. Mef2c suppresses corticostriatal synapse formation and striatal spinogenesis, but can itself be repressed by Foxp2 through direct DNA binding. Foxp2 deletion de-represses Mef2c, and both intrastriatal and global decrease of Mef2c rescue vocalization and striatal spinogenesis defects of Foxp2-deletion mutants. These findings suggest that Foxp2-Mef2C signaling is critical to corticostriatal circuit formation. If found in humans, such signaling defects could contribute to a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2508806705,"The use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated with an increased risk of bone fracture, raising concerns about their increasingly broader usage. This deleterious effect is poorly understood, and thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive. We show here that fluoxetine (Flx), one of the most-prescribed SSRIs, acts on bone remodeling through two distinct mechanisms. Peripherally, Flx has anti-resorptive properties, directly impairing osteoclast differentiation and function through a serotonin-reuptake-independent mechanism that is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ levels and the transcription factor Nfatc1. With time, however, Flx also triggers a brain-serotonin-dependent rise in sympathetic output that increases bone resorption sufficiently to counteract its local anti-resorptive effect, thus leading to a net effect of impaired bone formation and bone loss. Accordingly, neutralizing this second mode of action through co-treatment with the β-blocker propranolol, while leaving the peripheral effect intact, prevents Flx-induced bone loss in mice. Hence, this study identifies a dual mode of action of SSRIs on bone remodeling and suggests a therapeutic strategy to block the deleterious effect on bone homeostasis from their chronic use."
https://openalex.org/W2516557409,"Atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of lipid metabolism and inflammation; however, it is also closely associated with endothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, with fibronectin accumulating in the laminin-collagen basement membrane. To investigate how fibronectin modulates inflammation in arteries, we replaced the cytoplasmic tail of the fibronectin receptor integrin α5 with that of the collagen/laminin receptor integrin α2. This chimaera suppressed inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells on fibronectin and in knock-in mice. Fibronectin promoted inflammation by suppressing anti-inflammatory cAMP. cAMP was activated through endothelial prostacyclin secretion; however, this was ECM-independent. Instead, cells on fibronectin suppressed cAMP via enhanced phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, through direct binding of integrin α5 to phosphodiesterase-4D5 (PDE4D5), which induced PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of PDE4D5 on the inhibitory site Ser651. In vivo knockdown of PDE4D5 inhibited inflammation at athero-prone sites. These data elucidate a molecular mechanism linking ECM remodelling and inflammation, thereby identifying a new class of therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2513443250,"How chaperones, insertases and translocases facilitate insertion and folding of complex cytoplasmic proteins into cellular membranes is not fully understood. Here we utilize single-molecule force spectroscopy to observe YidC, a transmembrane chaperone and insertase, sculpting the folding trajectory of the polytopic α-helical membrane protein lactose permease (LacY). In the absence of YidC, unfolded LacY inserts individual structural segments into the membrane; however, misfolding dominates the process so that folding cannot be completed. YidC prevents LacY from misfolding by stabilizing the unfolded state from which LacY inserts structural segments stepwise into the membrane until folding is completed. During stepwise insertion, YidC and the membrane together stabilize the transient folds. Remarkably, the order of insertion of structural segments is stochastic, indicating that LacY can fold along variable pathways toward the native structure. Since YidC is essential in membrane protein biogenesis and LacY is a model for the major facilitator superfamily, our observations have general relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2514779583,"Inhibition of granule cells plays a key role in gating the flow of signals into the cerebellum, and it is thought that Golgi cells are the only interneurons that inhibit granule cells. Here we show that Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, also directly inhibit granule cells via their axon collaterals. Anatomical and optogenetic studies indicate that this non-canonical feedback is region specific: it is most prominent in lobules that regulate eye movement and process vestibular information. Collaterals provide fast, slow, and tonic inhibition to granule cells, and thus allow Purkinje cells to regulate granule cell excitability on multiple timescales. We propose that this feedback mechanism could regulate excitability of the input layer, contribute to sparse coding, and mediate temporal integration."

Environmental factors of rat habitats are constantly changing (Feng and Himsworth, 2014Feng A.Y.T. Himsworth C.G.

Consequently, evolutionary pressure has favored cognitive flexibility, allowing rats to dynamically update strategies (Hamilton and Brigman, 2015Hamilton D.A. Brigman J.L. Behavioral flexibility in rats and mice: contributions of distinct frontocortical regions.Genes Brain Behav. 2015; 14: 4-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, only few environmental changes are relevant and should induce cognitive flexibility, while the majority of changes are irrelevant, potentially represent noise, and should be ignored (Dayan et al., 2000Dayan P.

Therefore, successfully directing behavior to a current goal relies on an adequate trade-off between cognitive stability and flexibility (Cools, 2012Cools R.

A brain region that has been frequently associated with cognitive control, balancing between stability and flexibility, is the prefrontal cortex (Cohen et al., 1996Cohen J.D. Braver T.S.

Particularly, active stabilization of goal-relevant representation, a fundamental process of working memory, is one of the best-described functions of the prefrontal cortex (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S.

We asked how unequivocally identified PV+ basket cells in the prefrontal cortex might contribute to a multidimensional behavioral paradigm involving different behavioral options, temporally structured task episodes, associative working memory, and stimulus-guided choice behavior. We recorded the activity of 11 identified PV+ basket cells in the prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats performing a delayed cue-matching-to-place task using glass electrodes. Rats received a stimulus (chocolate- or cherry-flavored solution) in the start arm of a Y-maze and, according to the stimulus, had to choose one of the side arms of the Y-maze to receive reward. In each trial, the execution of choice was delayed by 6 s with a moveable door (Figure 1A; Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T. Buzsáki G. Behavior-dependent short-term assembly dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We confirmed the involvement of prelimbic cortex in this task with muscimol-inactivation experiments (Figures 1A and S1). For neuronal recording experiments, all rats performed the task with >85% correct choices. After recording neurons for >20 trials (25 ± 2 trials), the glass electrode was moved into a juxtacellular position for filling the recorded cell with neurobiotin (Lapray et al., 2012Lapray D. Lasztoczi B. Lagler M. Viney T.J. Katona L. Valenti O. Hartwich K. Borhegyi Z. Somogyi P. Klausberger T. Behavior-dependent specialization of identified hippocampal interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This allowed unequivocal identification of the cell type as well as detailed assessment of the axo-dendritic arborisation and synaptic connectivity. The recording locations were within the rostro-caudal and medio-lateral axis of the prelimbic cortex (n = 10), with the exception of one cell located within the anterior cingulate cortex. Somata of the identified PV+ basket cells were located in prelimbic layer II/III (n = 5; Figures 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C, 3B, and 3C) or layer V/VI (n = 5; Figure 4). The cells displayed smooth, multipolar, and radially oriented dendrites (Figures 1B, 2B, and 3B). All identified basket cells were tested PV+ on dendrites or somata (Figures 1D, 2C, and 3C). Their axonal arborisation was mostly restricted to the layer of the cell soma and neighboring layers (Figures 1B, 2B, and 3B). All interneurons presented in this study displayed a characteristically dense bouton distribution. Further light microscopic evaluation showed that the axon frequently formed boutons apposing cell somata and proximal dendrites (“basket-like” structures; Figure S2). We confirmed this observation by subcellular target identification using electron microscopy for the labeled cell ML80a (Figures 1E and S2). To compare the firing activity of different PV+ basket cells within and across animals, we defined seven consecutive, behaviorally distinct task episodes during each trial: pause, stimulus, delay, goal run, reward, post-reward, and return. The firing rate of each cell was calculated in 1 s windows, which can be allocated to different task episodes; each trial consisted of 27 time windows; goal runs and returns were divided into three windows, as they lasted on average 3 s. Investigating the firing patterns of PV+ basket cells during task performance, we observed that they did not fire at constant rates throughout the task, but instead strongly increased (Figures 1 and 2) or decreased (Figure 3) firing activity during one or more preferred task episodes, and they maintained such firing patterns during consecutive trials (Figures 2D and 3D). However, PV+ basket cells did not fire homogenously as a group, but individual neurons increased or decreased their firing during different task episodes (Figures 1, 2, and 3). To test these observations quantitatively, we employed three complementary statistical tests. First, we performed a shuffling procedure, and the measured firing rates of a cell during each 1 s time window were randomly assigned to any 1 s window of the same trial, a surrogate firing histogram was calculated from all trials, and the procedure was repeated to construct 10,000 surrogate histograms. Because of 27 windows used and to test for a possible activation or inhibition of firing rate, we accepted the firing rate of a window to be significantly activated or inhibited if it was larger or smaller than 99.9074% or 0.0925%, respectively, (Bonferroni correction for 27 windows and two-tailed) of the surrogate histograms in this window. We found that eight of the labeled PV+ basket cells significantly increased their firing rates during different task episodes, while the other three PV+ basket cells significantly decreased their firing rates, all during goal run (Figure 4). The p values for each cell and 1 s time window are stated in Table S1. In a different type of analysis, we calculated the mean firing rate and standard deviation from the individual trials for each cell. A threshold for significant activation or inhibition was considered if firing above or below mean ± 3 SD (delineates 99.97% of a normal distribution) was observed. These thresholds resulted in similar observations compared to the shuffling procedure (Figure 4), supporting the robustness of these tests. In a third type of analysis, we tested whether the firing rates of each cell were different in the 27 time windows with a non-parametric and paired Friedman two-tailed test. All 11 PV+ basket cells were significantly different in their firing rates across the time windows (p < 0.0001). A post hoc Dunn test indicated that those time windows, which were significantly increased or decreased with the shuffling procedure and the mean ± 3 SD thresholds, were most often tested significantly different from the firing rate of other time-windows (Table S2). Overall, three independent types of statistical analysis indicate that PV+ basket cells were activated or inhibited during distinct task episodes. Individual PV+ basket cells showed activation/inhibition during different episodes, suggesting sequential contributions to different task episodes by subsets of prelimbic PV+ basket cells.Figure 3Firing Activity of an Identified PV+ Basket Cell in Prelimbic Layer III Was Inhibited during Goal Run of the Working Memory TaskShow full caption(A) Firing of the labeled PV+ basket cell ML95a remained stable during most episodes of the working memory task but transiently decreased during goal run.(B and C) Dendrites (red) spanning from layer II to layer V.

Data are shown as mean ± SEM. When comparing firing activity of PV+ basket cells within and across layers of prelimbic cortex, we observed that cells with similar laminar position can have different firing patterns and cells with different laminar location can have similar firing patterns (Figure 4). To test this hypothesis, we recorded additional, putative PV+ basket cells (action potential width <0.3 ms, firing rate >10 Hz) for which the location in a cortical layer could be determined. These cells were recorded with a glass electrode in close proximity to another labeled cell and in the same electrode track, or with a silicon probe for which the location of the shanks and recording sites could be determined with histology (Figure S3A), or from tetrode experiments in which only a single tetrode was inserted into the prelimbic cortex and was not moved after recording the interneuron, allowing a reliable allocation of the recording site (Figures S3B and S3C). Firing patterns from these cells supported our observation that fast-spiking cells within the same cortical layer have different firing patterns and cells with the same firing patterns are observed in different cortical layers (Figures 5A and 5D). Comparing the proportion of cells in superficial (II and III) layers with those in deep (V and VI) layers for activation of firing during stimulus and delay, activation during goal run and reward, and inhibition during goal run, no statistical difference was observed (Figure 5B; p = 0.934, Fisher’s exact test, n = 49 cells). This suggests that different firing patterns are distributed within and across prelimbic layers rather than a laminar distinction of task-related firing patterns among prelimbic PV+ basket cells. In order to assess task dependence of the observed firing patterns in the prelimbic cortex, we performed a series of control experiments, which were repeated on two recording days. First, we obtained a session of unaltered delayed cue-matching-to-place behavior with performance >85%. Next, we omitted presenting information of stimulus by providing sucrose solution in the home arm (sucrose trials). Behavioral performance immediately dropped to random decisions (Figure 5C). However, during sucrose trials the rat still executed its own intentions. Therefore, in another control condition we prevented the rat from executing its own intention by blocking one arm and forcing the animal into randomly assigned reward locations (forced trials). We recorded the firing of prelimbic neurons throughout the different conditions with a silicon probe. We found significant reduction of task episode modulation of firing during sucrose and forced trials for putative interneurons (Figure 5C). Task episode modulation was calculated as maximum difference of z-scored firing from the mean. This indicates that observed firing patterns of prelimbic interneurons differentiating consecutive task episodes are related to the cognitive content of the working memory task rather than reflecting navigation along the maze only. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the local connectivity profile of individual PV+ basket cells correlated with their firing patterns during task performance. GABAergic interneurons expressing VIP have been described as exclusively innervating other interneurons (Hajos et al., 1996Hajos N. Acsady L. Freund T.F. Target selectivity and neurochemical characteristics of VIP-immunoreactive interneurons in the rat dentate gyrus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1415-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and their importance for controlling activity of other interneurons in vivo has been suggested (Donato et al., 2013Donato F.

Cortical interneurons that specialize in disinhibitory control.Nature. 2013; 503: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Most cortical PV+ interneurons receive VIP+ innervation; the degree, however, is highly variable (Dávid et al., 2007Dávid C. Schleicher A. Zuschratter W. Staiger J.F. The innervation of parvalbumin-containing interneurons by VIP-immunopositive interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex of the adult rat.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 2329-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used immunofluorescence microscopy on the labeled neurons and found that prelimbic PV+ basket cell dendrites receive VIP+ (Figures 6A and 6B ) input at various levels (Figure 6C). We observed that density of VIP-input onto dendrites of PV+ basket cells was negatively correlated with their z-scored firing during goal run, when different subsets of PV+ basket cells are either activated, inhibited, or do not change their activity (Figure 6D). These data suggest that the local connectivity of individual PV+ basket cells is related to their different firing patterns during the delayed cue-matching-to-place task. During cognitive behavior, when spatial information is integrated into a decision-making network, synchrony between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is enhanced (Benchenane et al., 2010Benchenane K.

Wilson M.A. Theta rhythms coordinate hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in a spatial memory task.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e402Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Among prefrontal GABAergic interneurons, PV+ cells are preferentially targeted by hippocampal projections (Gabbott et al., 2002Gabbott P. Headlam A. Busby S.

https://openalex.org/W2507741532,"Cancer is characterised by DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing of CpG island-associated promoters, including tumour-suppressor genes. The methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins bind to methylated DNA and can aid in the mediation of gene silencing through interaction with histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases. However, the mechanisms responsible for eliciting CpG island hypermethylation in cancer, and the potential role that MBD proteins play in modulation of the methylome remain unclear. Our previous work demonstrated that MBD2 preferentially binds to the hypermethylated GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells. Here, we use functional genetic approaches to investigate if MBD2 plays an active role in reshaping the DNA methylation landscape at this locus and genome-wide. First, we show that loss of MBD2 results in inhibition of both maintenance and spread of de novo methylation of a transfected construct containing the GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells and Mbd2−/− mouse fibroblasts. De novo methylation was rescued by transient expression of Mbd2 in Mbd2−/− cells. Second, we show that MBD2 depletion triggers significant hypomethylation genome-wide in prostate cancer cells with concomitant loss of MBD2 binding at promoter and enhancer regulatory regions. Finally, CpG islands and shores that become hypomethylated after MBD2 depletion in LNCaP cancer cells show significant hypermethylation in clinical prostate cancer samples, highlighting a potential active role of MBD2 in promoting cancer-specific hypermethylation. Importantly, co-immunoprecipiation of MBD2 shows that MBD2 associates with DNA methyltransferase enzymes 1 and 3A. Together our results demonstrate that MBD2 has a critical role in ‘rewriting’ the cancer methylome at specific regulatory regions."

https://openalex.org/W2508109960,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain cancer in adults. However, the molecular events underlying carcinogenesis and their interplay remain elusive. Here, we report that the stability of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S) is regulated by the PTEN/Akt pathway and that its degradation depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mechanistically, Akt1 physically interacted with and phosphorylated UBE2S at Thr 152, enhancing its stability by inhibiting proteasomal degradation. Additionally, accumulated UBE2S was found to be associated with the components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) complex and participated in the NHEJ-mediated DNA repair process. The association of Ku70 with UBE2S was enhanced, and the complex was recruited to double-stranded break (DSB) sites in response to etoposide treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of UBE2S expression inhibited NHEJ-mediated DSB repair and rendered glioblastoma cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. Overall, our findings provide a novel drug target that may serve as the rationale for the development of a new therapeutic approach."

To elucidate the chloroplast (cp) genome evolution within this family, here we present complete genomes of three species from two sister genera (Clematoclethra and Actinidia) in the Actinidiaceae via genome skimming technique. Comparative analyses revealed that the genome structure and content were rather conservative in three cp genomes in spite of different inheritance pattern, i.e.paternal in Actinidia and maternal in Clematoclethra. The clpP gene was lacked in all the three sequenced cp genomes examined here indicating that the clpP gene loss is likely a conspicuous synapomorphic characteristic during the cp genome evolution of Actinidiaceae. Comprehensive sequence comparisons in Actinidiaceae cp genomes uncovered that there were apparently heterogenous divergence patterns among the cpDNA regions, suggesting a preferred data-partitioned analysis for cp phylogenomics. Twenty non-coding cpDNA loci with fast evolutionary rates are further identified as potential molecular markers for systematics studies of Actinidiaceae. Moreover, the cp phylogenomic analyses including 31 angiosperm plastomes strongly supported the monophyly of Actinidia, being sister to Clematoclethra in Actinidiaceae which locates in the basal asterids, Ericales."

We show that mice similarly fail to generalize, suggesting that they learn this segregation task discriminatively by adjusting task-specific decision boundaries without taking advantage of a demixed representation of odors. In natural environments, the olfactory system must be able to detect behaviorally relevant odors against varying background smells. This task resembles the cocktail party problem in audition where the signals of different sound sources also arrive as a linear mixture at the sensory organ. Similar to our remarkable ability of disentangling sound sources, mice have been shown to excel at the olfactory equivalent (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D. Hemmelder V. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. An olfactory cocktail party: figure-ground segregation of odorants in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yet, with an increasing number of mixture components this task can get difficult due to the overlapping, combinatorial representation of odorants by receptor neurons (Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999Duchamp-Viret P.

These representations have been described as synthetic, in the sense that combinations of odorants are thought to be encoded rather than individual components (Gottfried, 2010Gottfried J.A.

In the main olfactory system of the mouse, each sensory neuron expresses only one out of a family of ∼1,000 types of olfactory receptor proteins (Godfrey et al., 2004Godfrey P.A. Malnic B. Buck L.B. The mouse olfactory receptor gene family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Each odor activates a subset of these receptor types and is identified by this subset, and each receptor type may be activated by many odors, leading to a potentially large overlap in the representation of different odorants (Duchamp-Viret et al., 1999Duchamp-Viret P.

Furthermore, mixtures may be represented as nonlinear functions of their parts (Rospars et al., 2008Rospars J.-P. Lansky P. Chaput M. Duchamp-Viret P.

In a previous study, we found that mice can be trained to perform a target-odor detection task and can do so remarkably well even in the presence of a large number of background odors (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D.

These behavioral results led to the question of how mice solve this task given the nonlinear, noisy, and high-dimensional input that the glomeruli provide. Various attempts have been made previously to provide theoretical understanding of how odors can be detected against a background. Several studies have suggested algorithms that rely on the temporal structure of OB activity to provide a concentration and background invariant code for odor identity (Brody and Hopfield, 2003Brody C.D.

Detection of a specific component can also be achieved using Bayesian inference if one assumes prior knowledge of the receptor activation levels for “all odors.” Such prior knowledge could be implemented in the brain as a “generative model,” which could be formed by unsupervised learning (Mumford, 1994Mumford D. Neural architectures for pattern-theoretic problems. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1994Google Scholar, Hinton and Sejnowski, 1999Hinton G. Sejnowski T.J. Unsupervised learning: foundations of neural computation. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1999Crossref Google Scholar). Unsupervised learning could yield “demixed,” atomic representations of odors in higher olfactory areas—akin to Barlow’s idea that a lot of knowledge about the world is imprinted into the representations of sensory systems (Barlow, 1997Barlow H.B. The knowledge used in vision and where it comes from.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on a linear encoding model, Bayesian inference has been shown to work well in conditions where the typical mixture contains few components (Grabska-Barwinska et al., 2013Grabska-Barwinska A.

More generally, many algorithms for blind source separation and inference could be applied to such a generative model (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995Bell A.J. Sejnowski T.J.

Encoding of mixtures in a simple olfactory system.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1246-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). None of these studies, however, attempted to identify the decoding mechanism that mimics mouse psychophysical performance; this is the focus of the current work. In this study, we sought to find the simplest decoding mechanism that uses experimentally constrained neuronal input and match the ability of mice to detect target odorants (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D. Hemmelder V. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. An olfactory cocktail party: figure-ground segregation of odorants in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We measured representations of single odorants and hundreds of mixtures by olfactory receptors to derive a quantitative model of mixture responses, which also included saturation and experimentally measured trial-to-trial variability. We tested whether simple biologically plausible read-out mechanisms can solve the behavioral task based on inputs that were generated by the mixture model. We find that the simplest multi-glomerular approach, which sums up the weighted activity of different glomeruli and compares this sum to a threshold (a linear classifier), is sufficient to mimic the behavior of mice. Several glomeruli have to be combined, which argues against a strict labeled-line encoding model. The quality of the mixture samples used in training the model was important, since a model trained only on single odors only poorly generalizes to mixtures. We tested this prediction in mice and found a similar behavior. In the behavioral task, mice were required to report the presence of one of two target odors in random mixtures containing up to 14 odors (Figure 1A). After learning, mice achieved accuracies close to 100% for a small number of distractors, and performance declined with increasing number of background odors (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D. Hemmelder V. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. An olfactory cocktail party: figure-ground segregation of odorants in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is a seemingly remarkable feat given that (a) mice had to generalize from around 1,000 training trials to mixtures that they had never smelled before (greater than 60% are novel in test phase; ∼50,000 possible mixtures), (b) glomerular patterns are highly overlapping, (c) mixture responses arise from nonlinear interactions of single odors, and (d) odor responses are highly variable from trial to trial. To assess how challenging this task actually is, we started by quantifying all the parameters of the input at the level of receptors and then probed the ability of decoders to use glomerular activity patterns to extract the presence of particular target odors. In earlier experiments (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D. Hemmelder V. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. An olfactory cocktail party: figure-ground segregation of odorants in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we had measured the average glomerular responses to the 16 individual odors in anesthetized mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 in all olfactory receptor neurons (glomeruli were from the dorsal surface of the OB). The measured signals arise from the collection of sensory axons converging on glomeruli. The number of glomeruli that were responsive to at least one odor in each OB ranged between 63 and 76. Due to the large number of possible odor mixtures, measuring the neural responses to the whole stimulus set is intractable (>10,000 mixtures). Therefore, we estimated a statistical model that describes the glomerular responses given a particular odor mixture. We imaged responses of glomeruli in the dorsal OB to all single components as well as a sample of ∼500 mixtures in five additional OMP-GCaMP3 mice (Isogai et al., 2011Isogai Y. Si S. Pont-Lezica L. Tan T. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. Dulac C. Molecular organization of vomeronasal chemoreception.Nature. 2011; 478: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; Figures 1C–1L). To estimate the variability of responses, each single odorant was presented several times per experiment (7.7 ± 1.7, mean ± SD; Figure 1F). Over all odor-glomerulus pairs, the average coefficient of variation (CV) was 0.37 ± 0.07 (mean ± SD). However, much of the variability was correlated across glomeruli, probably reflecting causes that either are irrelevant to behaving mice (e.g., anesthesia level and breathing parameters; Blauvelt et al., 2013Blauvelt D.G. Sato T.F. Wienisch M. Knöpfel T. Murthy V.N. Distinct spatiotemporal activity in principal neurons of the mouse olfactory bulb in anesthetized and awake states.Front. Neural Circuits. 2013; 7: 46PubMed Google Scholar) or could be easily factored out by neural operations such as normalization. This correlated variability is evident when the responses of all glomeruli to each trial of a specific odor were plotted against the mean response to that odor across trials (Figure 1G). To estimate the non-correlated variability, we first subtracted the correlated variability from all responses. This was achieved by subtracting from each response pattern its best linear fit to the mean response pattern of the same odor (solid lines in Figure 1G; see Equation 4 in Experimental Procedures). The timescale of changes in the linear fit parameters was on the order of 10 min (Figure S1), suggesting factors such as variation in anesthesia. For each glomerulus i and odor j, we then calculated the uncorrelated component of the standard deviation (Equation 4) across trials t and plotted it against its mean response amplitude Oij. The non-correlated CV for each experiment was calculated as the slope of the linear relationship between the non-correlated SD and response amplitude (Figure 1H). Non-correlated CVs ranged between 0.08 and 0.13 (0.099 ± 0.019, mean ± SD, n = 5 mice). This value is higher than expected based on the CVs measured in single rat receptor neurons in vivo (Duchamp-Viret et al., 2005Duchamp-Viret P. Kostal L. Chaput M. Lánsky P. Rospars J.-P. Patterns of spontaneous activity in single rat olfactory receptor neurons are different in normally breathing and tracheotomized animals.J. Neurobiol. 2005; 65: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that our measure of variability is probably conservative. To estimate how glomerular responses to mixtures relate to their responses to mixture components, we imaged a sample of ∼100 mixtures per experiment (98 ± 39, mean ± SD, n = 5) and compared the responses with the sum of the responses to individual components of the mixture (Figures 1I–1L). Most mixture responses could be estimated rather well by the linear sum of individual component responses (Figure 1I). However, beyond a certain value, mixture responses saturated (Figures 1J–1L). Saturation in odor responses may be due to several factors such as odor-receptor interaction, receptor neuron firing, and saturation of the Ca2+ indicator. We could not disambiguate which of these contribute to saturation in our dataset, and since receptor ligand interactions are well known to be saturating with increasing ligand concentration (Firestein et al., 1993Firestein S. Picco C. Menini A. The relation between stimulus and response in olfactory receptor cells of the tiger salamander.J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we conservatively assume that saturation is a real characteristic of odor responses of olfactory receptor neurons and use a saturating curve in our model for mixture responses. These mixture responses can thus be summarized by the following encoding model that describes the activity vector R of glomerular responses in trial t (see Experimental Procedures):R(t)= λR0(t)+(1−λ)σ(R0(t)).(Equation 1) Here, λ∈[0,1] interpolates between the fully linear model R0(t) and the nonlinear model σ(R0(t)), where σ denotes the saturating nonlinearity (Equation 6). The linear encoding part is given byR0(t)= ∑j=116cj(t)⋅(Oj+ηj),ηj∈N(0,α2Oj2),(Equation 2) where Oj is the glomerular response pattern for the jth odor, cj(t) is a binary variable denoting the presence of odor j in trial t, and the noise term ηj is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of α2Oj2. The factor α controls the coefficient of variation, and our empirical estimate for it is ∼0.1. We will refer to the sequence of cj(t) during an experiment as the trial statistics. In addition to introducing nonlinear mixing, parameterized by λ, we also systematically varied levels of trial-to-trial variability to study its effect on decoding performance. The simplest decoder at the population level is a linear readout, similar to a single perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958Rosenblatt F. The perceptron: a probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain.Psychol. Rev. 1958; 65: 386-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Such a readout weighs the activity of individual glomeruli Ri(t) by synaptic weights wi and predicts the presence or absence of a target when the summed product is larger or smaller than a threshold θ, respectively. This linear-nonlinear cascade can be interpreted like a single readout neuron. Mathematically, the output is given byy=H(wTR(t)−θ),(Equation 3) where y is the binary output, H is the Heaviside function, which is 1 for positive arguments and 0 otherwise, and T denotes the transpose of the weight vector w. In our published work (Rokni et al., 2014Rokni D. Hemmelder V. Kapoor V. Murthy V.N. An olfactory cocktail party: figure-ground segregation of odorants in rodents.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), there were 13 mice and 1,500–3,500 trials per mouse (2,308 ± 625, mean ± SD) with the number of odors per trial equally distributed between 1 and 14. For each mouse this segregation task can be summarized by the trial statistics cj(t) and the ideal behavior r(t). For each animal’s trial statistics, we calculated the optimal linear weights that minimize the mean squared deviations between the ideal behavior r(t) and the output of the linear readout (see Equation 8) and the optimal decision threshold θ that maximizes performance on samples drawn from the encoding model (Equation 1), for a random training set of 80% of the trials. This decoder, which we call the OLE (optimal linear estimator), was then tested on the remaining 20% of trials (Experimental Procedures). We repeated this procedure 20 times and report the average performance on the test sets. Performance was perfect without saturation (λ = 1) and trial-to-trial variability (α = 0) (Figure 2B). Increasing α gradually decreased performance, which reached ∼65% for α = 1 (Figures 2A and 2B). Similar trends were obtained using the glomerular patterns from different imaging datasets (Figure 2A) and target odors (Figure 2B). For a noise level similar to our experimental estimate (∼0.1), most linear readouts performed better than corresponding mice detecting the same targets (Figure 2B). Thus, considering only trial-to-trial variability and mixing of odors without saturation, a simple linear decoder is sufficient to match or exceed mouse performance, although it had access only to the time-averaged response of a limited set of dorsal glomeruli. Since the specific choice of data had little effect on classifier performance, we focused on a particular imaging set with 72 glomeruli. Next, we varied glomerular saturation by varying the parameter λ in Equation 1. As expected, the average performance of the optimal linear decoder for all target odors declined with both increasing nonlinearity and noise (Figure 2C, single odor pair Figure S2A). When noise levels are low (< 0.1) and responses are not fully saturating (λ > 0), the mean decoder performance is above 98%. When considering saturating glomeruli (λ = 0) and the experimental estimate of noise (α = 0.1), performance drops to 91.6%, which is comparable to the average mouse performance of 90.3%. This demonstrates that the “cocktail party problem” is almost linearly separable at the level of glomeruli. Since the glomerular activity patterns in the linear, noisy mixture case R(t) are given by a superposition of multiple Gaussian random vectors, the optimal decision boundary might be highly nonlinear and not merely a single hyperplane. When the odor patterns are nonlinearly mixed, the geometry of the decision boundaries becomes even more intricate. A decoder that is able to flexibly adjust its decision boundaries without constraining them to be a single hyperplane may therefore perform considerably better than the simple linear readout. One powerful class of decoders with such properties is the SVM, which uses a so-called kernel trick. For SVMs that use radial basis functions as kernels, the decision boundaries are formed by sums of Gaussians and can, in the limit, approximate almost any decision boundary (Schoelkopf and Smola, 2002Schoelkopf B. Smola A. Learning with kernels: support vector machines, regularization, optimization and beyond. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2002Google Scholar). We trained SVM decoders with the same cross-validation procedure as described for the optimal linear decoder. As expected from their versatility, SVMs were more accurate than the linear readout. Figure 2D shows the performance of the SVM for the same target odors as the optimal linear decoder in Figure 2C. When noise levels are low (α < 0.1) and responses are not fully saturating (λ > 0), the SVM performance was above 99.5%. When considering saturating glomeruli (λ = 0) and the experimental estimate of noise (α = 0.1), performance drops to 94.7%, outperforming mice and making about 40% fewer mistakes than the optimal linear decoder. Similarly, for other conditions, SVMs make fewer errors than the optimal linear decoder and have substantially better performance for low noise levels irrespective of λ (Figures 2C and 2D). Given that the overall performance of both optimal linear decoder and SVM broadly resembled that of mice, we investigated whether they make similar errors. Specifically, we asked whether the dependence of performance on the number of mixture components is similar to the monotonic decline seen in mice (Figures 2E and 2F). We refer to this relationship as the performance curve. We calculated the average correlation coefficient (r) between the performance curves of the classifiers for specific odor targets and their corresponding mice. The average correlation was maximal for the fully saturated mixture model (λ = 0) with a noise level of α = 0.25 for both the optimal linear decoder (r = 0.42 ± 0.01, mean ± SEM, n = 13 mice) and SVM (r = 0.40 ± 0.01, mean ± SEM, n = 13 mice; Figures S2C and S2D). When scrutinizing the shape of the performance curves, it is important to note that the number of possible mixtures varies with the number of components in the mixture. For instance, there are many more possible mixtures of 7 components than there are of 1 or 14 components. Therefore, specific stimuli on the edges of the performance curve repeat much more, offering more training samples for the classifier. For this reason, one may expect that classifier (and mouse) performance curves will not be monotonic, but could have a minimum at the midrange of mixtures. We find, however, that despite the different computational capabilities of SVMs and the OLE, performance for both decoders decreases as the number of components in a mixture increase, for realistic estimates of noise and nonlinearity. This suggests that the overlapping and nonlinear mixing of noisy glomerular patterns, rather than limitations of the readout mechanism, is a fundamental bottleneck for this task. Taken together, although the linear decoder is not the optimal decoder, its performance is comparable to that of mice for our conservative estimates of noise and saturation levels. We therefore used this linear decoder, rather than the SVM, for further analysis. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that nonlinear decoding schemes such as the SVM could be good models for certain olfactory computations, but for this task, nonlinear decision boundaries are not necessary. The linear decoders considered so far had no restrictions on the number of glomeruli used. Inspired by the observation that the projections from the OB to the piriform cortex are sparse and disperse (Giessel and Datta, 2014Giessel A.J. Datta S.R. Olfactory maps, circuits and computations.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 24: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we wondered how well sparse, linear readouts would perform the task. We turned to logistic regression, which is an efficient, binary classification algorithm that can be readily interpreted from a neuronal point of view as a linear readout neuron with nonlinear firing (Berens et al., 2012Berens P. Ecker A.S. Cotton R.J. Ma W.J. Bethge M. Tolias A.S. A fast and simple population code for orientation in primate V1.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 10618-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similar to the OLE, the optimal logistic regression (OLR) is found by minimizing the likelihood of misclassifications on a training set. Additionally, we employed a regularization term that punishes non-zero readout weights by adding the sum of all absolute values of the weights to the number of misclassifications (L1 – regularization; Equation 10). By weighing this regularization term with a constant 1/C that can be systematically varied, one can bias the OLR to exhibit varying degrees of sparseness. This regularization can be thought of as an additional cost term for neuronal wiring, and the OLR attempts to maximize performance while minimizing wiring. When the cost for wiring dominates, the performance of the OLR drops to chance level and at the other extreme performance asymptotes to levels similar to the optimal linear estimator. Between these two extremes, performance strongly depends on the number of nonzero readout weights (Figure 3A). However, the overall effect of readout sparseness on performance was mild; this is not a simple consequence of the glomerular activity itself being sparse, since most glomeruli are activated by at least one odor. For our estimated noise level of 0.1, only 10–20 glomeruli are sufficient to match the performance of mice. To reach 90% of the asymptotic performance, only 15.7 ± 0."
https://openalex.org/W2510378045,"Recent evidence from a comprehensive genome analysis and functional studies have revealed that FOXM1 is a crucial metastatic regulator that drives cancer progression. However, the regulatory mechanism by which FOXM1 exerts its metastatic functions in cancer cells remains obscure. Here, we report that DLX1 acts as a FOXM1 downstream target, exerting pro-metastatic function in ovarian cancers. Both FOXM1 isoforms (FOXM1B or FOXM1C) could transcriptionally upregulate DLX1 through two conserved binding sites, located at +61 to +69bp downstream (TFBS1) and −675 to −667bp upstream (TFBS2) of the DLX1 promoter, respectively. This regulation was further accentuated by the significant correlation between the nuclear expression of FOXM1 and DLX1 in high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Functionally, the ectopic expression of DLX1 promoted ovarian cancer cell growth, cell migration/invasion and intraperitoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer in mice, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated DLX1 knockdown in FOXM1-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells abrogated these oncogenic capacities. In contrast, depletion of FOXM1 by shRNAi only partially attenuated tumor growth and exerted almost no effect on cell migration/invasion and the intraperitoneal dissemination of DLX1-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the mechanistic studies showed that DLX1 positively modulates transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling by upregulating PAI-1 and JUNB through direct interaction with SMAD4 in the nucleus upon TGF-β1 induction. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that DLX1 has a pivotal role in FOXM1 signaling to promote cancer aggressiveness through intensifying TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling in high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells."

A cancer stem cell (CSC) sub-population that is characterized by the abilities of tumor initiation, self-renewal, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy can suggest new therapeutic targets. However, no such sub-population has been conclusively identified for CRC, and we lack any marker to identify cells with all of the above characteristics. Here, we report that CD51+ CRC cells displayed greater sphere-forming and tumorigenic capacities, increased migratory and invasive potentials, and enhanced chemoresistance compared with CD51- CRC cells. CD51 knockdown reduced the side population, sphere formation, cell motility and inhibited tumor incidence and metastasis in an in vivo tumor model. Furthermore, CD51 could bind transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) receptors, and that it upregulated TGF-β/Smad signaling. These results indicate that CD51 is a novel functional marker for colorectal CSCs which may provide an therapeutic target for the efficient elimination of colorectal CSCs."

Inhibitors of these proteins, particularly HER2, have dramatically improved patient outcomes in the clinic, but recent studies have demonstrated that stimulating the heterodimeric complex, either via growth factors or by increasing the concentrations of HER2 and HER3 at the membrane, significantly diminishes the activity of the inhibitors. To identify an inhibitor of the active HER2-HER3 oncogenic complex, we developed a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines suitable for ultra-high-throughput screening. Medicinal chemistry on the hit scaffold resulted in a previously uncharacterized inhibitor that acts through preferential inhibition of the active state of HER2 and, as a result, is able to overcome cellular mechanisms of resistance such as growth factors or mutations that stabilize the active form of HER2."
https://openalex.org/W2508936338,"Some members of the class A β-lactamase family are capable of conferring resistance to the last resort antibiotics, carbapenems. A unique structural feature of these clinically important enzymes, collectively referred to as class A carbapenemases, is a disulfide bridge between invariant Cys69 and Cys238 residues. It was proposed that this conserved disulfide bridge is responsible for their carbapenemase activity, but this has not yet been validated. Here we show that disruption of the disulfide bridge in the GES-5 carbapenemase by the C69G substitution results in only minor decreases in the conferred levels of resistance to the carbapenem imipenem and other β-lactams. Kinetic and circular dichroism experiments with C69G-GES-5 demonstrate that this small drop in antibiotic resistance is due to a decline in the enzyme activity caused by a marginal loss of its thermal stability. The atomic resolution crystal structure of C69G-GES-5 shows that two domains of this disulfide bridge-deficient enzyme are held together by an intensive hydrogen-bonding network. As a result, the protein architecture and imipenem binding mode remain unchanged. In contrast, the corresponding hydrogen-bonding networks in NMCA, SFC-1, and SME-1 carbapenemases are less intensive, and as a consequence, disruption of the disulfide bridge in these enzymes destabilizes them, which causes arrest of bacterial growth. Our results demonstrate that the disulfide bridge is essential for stability but does not play a direct role in the carbapenemase activity of the GES family of β-lactamases. This would likely apply to all other class A carbapenemases given the high degree of their structural similarity."
https://openalex.org/W2507532399,"Abstract Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases that recognize specific altered bases. DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases carry both a glycosylase activity that removes the faulty base and an apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase activity that introduces a single-strand DNA incision. In particular, the CUT domains within the CUX1 and CUX2 proteins were recently shown to interact with the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase and stimulate its enzymatic activities. SATB1, which contains two CUT domains, was originally characterized as a T cell-specific genome organizer whose aberrant overexpression in breast cancer can promote tumor progression. Here we investigated the involvement of SATB1 in DNA repair. SATB1 knockdown caused a delay in DNA repair following exposure to H2O2, an increase in OGG1-sensitive oxidized bases within genomic DNA, and a decrease in 8-oxoG cleavage activity in cell extracts. In parallel, we observed an increase in phospho-CHK1 and γ-H2AX levels and a decrease in DNA synthesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of SATB1 accelerated DNA repair and reduced the levels of oxidized bases in genomic DNA. Moreover, an enhanced GFP-SATB1 fusion protein was rapidly recruited to laser microirradiation-induced DNA damage. Using purified proteins, we showed that SATB1 interacts directly with OGG1, increases its binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA, promotes Schiff base formation, and stimulates its glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase enzymatic activities. Structure/function analysis demonstrated that CUT domains, but not the homeodomain, are responsible for the stimulation of OGG1. Together, these results identify another CUT domain protein that functions both as a transcription factor and an accessory factor in base excision repair."

https://openalex.org/W2507282136,"Bipolar disorder (BD), which is characterized by depression and mania, affects 1-2% of the world population. Current treatments are effective in only 40-60% of cases and cause severe side effects. Valproate (VPA) is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of BD, but the therapeutic mechanism of action of this drug is not understood. This knowledge gap has hampered the development of effective treatments. To identify candidate pathways affected by VPA, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis in yeast cells grown in the presence or absence of the drug. VPA caused up-regulation of FEN1 and SUR4, encoding fatty acid elongases that catalyze the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids (C24 to C26) required for ceramide synthesis. Interestingly, fen1Δ and sur4Δ mutants exhibited VPA sensitivity. In agreement with increased fatty acid elongase gene expression, VPA increased levels of phytoceramide, especially those containing C24-C26 fatty acids. Consistent with an increase in ceramide, VPA decreased the expression of amino acid transporters, increased the expression of ER chaperones, and activated the unfolded protein response element (UPRE), suggesting that VPA induces the UPR pathway. These effects were rescued by supplementation of inositol and similarly observed in inositol-starved ino1Δ cells. Starvation of ino1Δ cells increased expression of FEN1 and SUR4, increased ceramide levels, decreased expression of nutrient transporters, and induced the UPR. These findings suggest that VPA-mediated inositol depletion induces the UPR by increasing the de novo synthesis of ceramide."

Cingulin is an adaptor protein first discovered in epithelium and is involved in the organization of the tight junctions. This study investigated the role of cingulin in control of agonist-induced lung EC permeability via interaction with RhoA-specific activator GEF-H1. The siRNA-induced cingulin knockdown augmented thrombin-induced EC permeability monitored by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance and endothelial cell permeability for macromolecules. Increased thrombin-induced permeability in ECs with depleted cingulin was associated with increased activation of GEF-H1 and RhoA detected in pulldown activation assays. Increased GEF-H1 association with cingulin was essential for down-regulation of thrombin-induced RhoA barrier disruptive signaling. Using cingulin-truncated mutants, we determined that GEF-H1 interaction with the rod + tail domain of cingulin was required for inactivation of GEF-H1 and endothelial cell barrier preservation. The results demonstrate the role for association of GEF-H1 with cingulin as the mechanism of RhoA pathway inactivation and rescue of EC barrier after agonist challenge.

This study investigated the role of cingulin in control of agonist-induced lung EC permeability via interaction with RhoA-specific activator GEF-H1. The siRNA-induced cingulin knockdown augmented thrombin-induced EC permeability monitored by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance and endothelial cell permeability for macromolecules. Increased thrombin-induced permeability in ECs with depleted cingulin was associated with increased activation of GEF-H1 and RhoA detected in pulldown activation assays. Increased GEF-H1 association with cingulin was essential for down-regulation of thrombin-induced RhoA barrier disruptive signaling. Using cingulin-truncated mutants, we determined that GEF-H1 interaction with the rod + tail domain of cingulin was required for inactivation of GEF-H1 and endothelial cell barrier preservation. The results demonstrate the role for association of GEF-H1 with cingulin as the mechanism of RhoA pathway inactivation and rescue of EC barrier after agonist challenge.

Together, these mechanisms cause actomyosin stress fiber formation, MLC phosphorylation, and cell contraction, leading to increased EC permeability. Agonist-induced vascular EC permeability is a reversible process. However, mechanisms of local regulation of barrier-disruptive RhoA signaling and barrier dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1) exhibits Rho-specific activity (18.Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In a microtubule-bound state, the guanine-exchange activity of GEF-H1 is suppressed. GEF-H1 release from microtubules stimulates Rho-specific GEF activity (20.Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 mediates cross-talk between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, GEF-H1 targeting to the tight junctions (TJ) in polarized kidney epithelial cells was associated with down-regulation of RhoA signaling (19.Benais-Pont G. Punn A. Flores-Maldonado C. Eckert J. Raposo G. Fleming T.P. Cereijido M. Balda M.S. Matter K. Identification of a tight junction-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Rho and regulates paracellular permeability.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tight junctions consist of transmembrane proteins occludin and claudin, which interact with the intracellular proteins zonula occludens (ZO), afadin, cingulin, and others (21.Miyoshi J. Takai Y.

Endothelial tight junctions: permeable barriers of the vessel wall.Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cingulin is a protein localized in the cytoplasmic compartment of the TJ in epithelial and endothelial cells and is involved in TJ reassembly (23.Citi S. Guerrera D. Spadaro D. Shah J. Epithelial junctions and Rho family GTPases: the zonular signalosome.Small GTPases. 2014; 5: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cingulin forms a parallel homodimer of two 140-kDa subunits, each comprising a globular Head domain, a coiled-coil “rod,” and a small globular tail (24.Cordenonsi M. D'Atri F. Hammar E.

Although early studies suggested a role of cingulin in epithelial tight junction formation due to its role in sequestration of GEF-H1 and inhibition of RhoA signaling (27.Guillemot L. Citi S. Cingulin regulates claudin-2 expression and cell proliferation through the small GTPase RhoA.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), later studies suggested that cingulin is not directly required for the formation of tight junctions and epithelial polarity of the Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cell line (28.Paschoud S. Citi S. Inducible overexpression of cingulin in stably transfected MDCK cells does not affect tight junction organization and gene expression.Mol. Membr.

Cingulin is dispensable for epithelial barrier function and tight junction structure, and plays a role in the control of claudin-2 expression and response to duodenal mucosa injury.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5005-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cingulin involvement in the regulation of the Rho pathway of agonist-induced vascular EC permeability remains unexplored. This study tested the hypothesis that increased cingulin interaction with GEF-H1 after stimulation with barrier-disruptive agonists is required for down-regulation of Rho signaling and preservation of the EC barrier. Roles of cingulin in the maintenance of basal barrier properties of the pulmonary EC monolayer and in permeability changes in response to barrier-disruptive agonist stimulation were evaluated in experiments with siRNA-induced cingulin knockdown. Studies in canine kidney epithelial cells did not show significant effects of cingulin overexpression on TJ formation and epithelial polarity under basal conditions (28.Paschoud S. Citi S. Inducible overexpression of cingulin in stably transfected MDCK cells does not affect tight junction organization and gene expression.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previous studies on Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers looked at the effect of cingulin KO/depletion on transepithelial electrical resistance (27.Guillemot L. Citi S. Cingulin regulates claudin-2 expression and cell proliferation through the small GTPase RhoA.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30.Guillemot L. Hammar E. Kaister C. Ritz J. Caille D. Jond L. Bauer C. Meda P. Citi S. Disruption of the cingulin gene does not prevent tight junction formation but alters gene expression.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5245-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In human pulmonary ECs, introduction of cingulin-specific siRNA did not affect basal levels of transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) in comparison with cells transfected with nonspecific RNA. Basal TER levels were 981 ± 62 ohm for HPAEC transfected with non-specific-RNA and 964 ± 91 ohm for ECs transfected with cingulin-specific siRNA. Measurements of TER changes over 60 h after transfection did not reveal significant difference between control and cingulin-depleted ECs (Fig. 1A). Knockdown efficiency was monitored by Western blotting analysis of cingulin protein content in cell lysates (Fig. 1A). In turn, EC stimulation with sub-maximal concentration of edemagenic agonist thrombin caused rapid decline in TER reflecting EC barrier compromise. This effect was exacerbated in EC monolayers with depleted cingulin. Cingulin knockdown in these experiments was achieved by EC transfection with a pool of four cingulin-specific siRNAs (Fig. 1B, left panel) or two additional single cingulin-specific siRNAs (Fig. 1B, right panel), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Basal TER values in nonspecific RNA controls and cingulin-depleted ECs were 1371 ± 156 and 1297 ± 183 ohm, respectively. Cingulin knockdown compromised recovery of EC barrier after thrombin challenge, as compared with thrombin-stimulated ECs without cingulin knockdown. Visualization of EC monolayer permeability for macromolecules using FITC-labeled avidin as tracer (see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed the results of TER measurements and demonstrated augmented permeability response to thrombin in ECs with cingulin knockdown (Fig. 1C). The quantitative analysis of thrombin-induced EC permeability for FITC-labeled avidin was performed by fluorimetric measurements of control and thrombin-stimulated ECs grown in 96-well plates after addition of FITC-labeled avidin (Fig. 1D). The results show augmented permeability response to thrombin in ECs with depleted cingulin. Analysis of thrombin-induced remodeling of actin cytoskeleton and cell junctions, developed after 5 min of thrombin treatment (acute phase), showed increased stress fiber formation and paracellular gap formation in ECs with cingulin knockdown (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis of paracellular gaps in non-stimulated and thrombin-stimulated ECs (Fig. 2B) showed that cingulin knockdown did not affect the overall number of gaps observed in basal conditions, but it markedly increased the total area of paracellular gaps formed after thrombin challenge. These effects were accompanied by disruption of VE-cadherin-positive adherens junctions in ECs with cingulin knockdown, as compared with cells treated with nonspecific RNA (Fig. 2C). Dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling is critical to formation of cell protrusions, re-establishment of cell-cell contacts, and EC monolayer integrity. LifeAct, a 17-amino acid peptide, interacts with F-actin structures in eukaryotic cells, does not interfere with actin dynamics, and has been widely used to track down actin cytoskeletal remodeling in live cells (31.Riedl J. Crevenna A.H. Kessenbrock K. Yu J.H. Neukirchen D. Bista M. Bradke F. Jenne D. Holak T.A. Werb Z. Sixt M. Wedlich-Soldner R. Lifeact: a versatile marker to visualize F-actin.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). We used ECs expressing GFP-tagged LifeAct to visualize the effect of cingulin knockdown on the cytoskeletal dynamics during EC barrier recovery after thrombin challenge. Monitoring of neighbor cells expressing GFP-LifeAct using time-lapse live imaging microscopy showed that thrombin induced rapid disruption of cell-cell contacts and formation of intercellular gaps. It was seen as early as 1 min after thrombin challenge followed by re-establishment of cell junctions and resealing of intercellular gaps by 8–10 min after thrombin stimulation (Fig. 3, upper panels). In contrast, disruption of cell-cell contacts caused by thrombin was not recovered in ECs with cingulin knockdown (Fig. 3, lower panels). Previous reports described RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 as a cingulin-binding partner in epithelial cells (32.Aijaz S. D'Atri F. Citi S. Balda M.S. Matter K.

The tight junction protein cingulin regulates gene expression and RhoA signaling.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1165: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Activation of the RhoA pathway is a major mechanism of thrombin-induced pulmonary EC permeability (34.Beckers C.M. van Hinsbergh V.W. van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Driving Rho GTPase activity in endothelial cells regulates barrier integrity.Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 103: 40-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The following experiments tested the involvement of cingulin in thrombin-induced activation of the GEF-H1-RhoA pathway. We used three distinct cingulin-specific siRNA sets as follows: a pool of four cingulin-specific siRNAs and two additional cingulin-specific single RNAs to achieve cingulin knockdown. Cingulin knockdown increased GEF-H1 activation by thrombin, which was measured in pulldown assays with mutated RhoA interacting with activated GEF (Fig. 4A). Additional GEF-H1 activation in ECs with cingulin knockdown led to increased activation of RhoA (Fig. 4B) and phosphorylation of the Rho kinase downstream target, myosin light chains (Fig. 4C). Experiments with reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous GEF-H1 and cingulin from non-transfected pulmonary ECs showed that thrombin stimulation induced time-dependent and reversible association of endogenous cingulin and GEF-H1, which reached a peak at 15 min and returned to basal levels by 60 min post-thrombin (Fig. 4D), the time corresponding to the point of EC barrier restoration (Fig. 1B). Cingulin has a domain structure represented by three major domains as follows: a globular 49-kDa N-terminal Head region (amino acids 1–346), a central 105-kDa coiled-coil Rod region (amino acids 347–1155), and a C-terminal 4-kDa Tail (amino acids 1156–1203) (35.Citi S. D'Atri F. Parry D.A. Human and Xenopus cingulin share a modular organization of the coiled-coil rod domain: predictions for intra- and intermolecular assembly.J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Characterization of cingulin domains involved in cingulin/GEF-H1 interaction and their role in agonist-induced EC permeability was performed in the next experiments. Interaction of endogenous GEF-H1 with recombinant c-Myc-tagged full-length cingulin or its domains ectopically expressed in pulmonary ECs was further evaluated in immunoprecipitation studies and pulldown assays from human pulmonary ECs with ectopic expression of recombinant cingulin variants or GEF-H1. We expressed in pulmonary ECs the c-Myc-tagged full-length cingulin, the cingulin rod + tail (R + T) or cingulin Head domains, and we examined their association with endogenous GEF-H1 under non-stimulated conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed increased association of endogenous GEF-H1 with cingulin full-length and R + T domains (Fig. 5A). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays with GEF-H1 antibodies confirmed GEF-H1 association with full-length and R + T cingulin domain, but not with the Head domain (Fig. 5B). Ectopic expression of recombinant cingulin variants in human pulmonary ECs was verified by Western blotting analysis of total cell lysates with c-Myc antibody (Fig. 5B, right panel). The direct nature of cingulin/GEF-H1 interaction was confirmed in the study by Aijaz et al. (32.Aijaz S. D'Atri F. Citi S. Balda M.S. Matter K. Binding of GEF-H1 to the tight junction-associated adaptor cingulin results in inhibition of Rho signaling and G1/S phase transition.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which showed a direct binding of recombinant His6-pleckstrin homology domain of GEF-H1 to a GST fusion with cingulin residues 782–1025, within the coiled-coil domain. The next experiments investigated the functional role of cingulin/GEF-H1 interactions and their physiological regulation. GEF-H1 under basal conditions associates with microtubules, whereas microtubule disassembly causes GEF-H1 release to the cytoplasm and its activation (20.Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 mediates cross-talk between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We used this GEF-H1 property to test whether free GEF-H1 released to the cytosol interacts with bacterially expressed purified cingulin. We expressed full-length GST-tagged cingulin in the bacterial system and conjugated it with agarose beads. Analysis of the cingulin/GEF-H1 interaction was performed by pulldown of endogenous GEF-H1 from lysates of pulmonary ECs stimulated with thrombin known to cause partial microtubule disassembly and from cells stimulated with nocodazole causing total microtubule disassembly (36.Birukova A.A. Adyshev D. Gorshkov B. Bokoch G.M. Birukov K.G. Verin A.D. GEF-H1 is involved in agonist-induced human pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2006; 290: L540-L548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The results show increased immobilization of GEF-H1 on cingulin-conjugated beads from thrombin-stimulated EC lysates and more robust immobilization of GEF-H1 from the cell lysates of nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 6A). These results strongly suggest that the interaction of recombinant bacterially expressed cingulin with GEF-H1 correlates with the amount of free cytosolic GEF-H1. To investigate whether the GEF-H1 activated state is important for GEF-H1/cingulin interaction, we co-expressed cingulin with GEF-H1 wild type, dominant-negative, or constitutively activated mutants in pulmonary ECs. Co-immunoprecipitation assays using c-Myc antibody showed strong association of c-Myc-tagged cingulin with wild type and constitutively activated GEF-H1, but not with dominant-negative GEF-H1 mutant (Fig. 6B). Of note, we observed more robust cingulin interaction with constitutively activated GEF-H1 with deleted microtubule-binding domain, as compared with full-length GEF-H1. Control immunoblotting analysis of the levels of recombinant GEF-H1 variants in total cell lysates showed comparable levels of protein expression (Fig. 6B, bottom panel). Finally, pulldown assays using immobilized bacterially expressed full-length GEF-H1 and lysates from pulmonary ECs expressing cingulin mutants showed GEF-H1 interactions with cingulin full-length and R + T variants but not with the Head domain (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that cingulin interacts with GEF-H1 via its R + T domain, and this interaction increases under thrombin-stimulated conditions. This interaction is further enhanced by the GEF-H1-activated state. Functional role of cingulin/GEF-H1 interactions in modulation of Rho signaling and EC responses to vasoactive agonists was further evaluated in experiments with ectopic expression of cingulin-truncated mutants in pulmonary ECs. Analysis of GEF-H1 activation in ECs expressing cingulin Head domain showed time-dependent increase in GEF-H1 activity caused by thrombin stimulation. In contrast, expression of cingulin R + T domain inhibited thrombin-induced GEF-H1 activation (Fig. 7A). In agreement with the effects on thrombin-induced GEF-H1 activation, expression of cingulin R + T domain suppressed thrombin-induced activation of RhoA (Fig. 7B) and phosphorylation of Rho kinase effectors, myosin light chain phosphatase (MYPT1) and MLC (Fig. 7C). These inhibitory effects on thrombin-induced Rho signaling were not observed in ECs with ectopic expression of cingulin Head domain. Effects of expression of cingulin R + T and Head domains on thrombin-induced permeability and cytoskeletal remodeling were further examined by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance and immunofluorescence studies. Basal TER values in non-transfected controls, cells expressing head and R + T domains were 1056 ± 78, 1103 ± 154, and 1131 ± 177 ohm, respectively. In contrast to non-transfected ECs and cells expressing the cingulin Head domain, expression of cingulin R + T mutant abolished EC permeability response to thrombin (Fig. 8A). Consistent with the observed attenuation of thrombin-induced EC barrier dysfunction, ectopic expression of the cingulin R + T domain attenuated thrombin-induced F-actin stress fiber formation. In contrast, expression of cingulin Head domain did not affect F-actin arrangement in the ECs stimulated with thrombin (Fig. 8B). This study provides the first evidence of a direct role for cingulin in dynamic regulation of agonist-induced pulmonary EC permeability and describes the mechanism of EC barrier regulation by cingulin. Cingulin was first discovered as a protein localized at the cytoplasmic surface of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial cells (37.Citi S. Sabanay H. Jakes R. Geiger B. Kendrick-Jones J. Cingulin, a new peripheral component of tight junctions.Nature. 1988; 333: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and later identified in vascular endothelial cells (38.Corada M. Mariotti M. Thurston G. Smith K. Kunkel R. Brockhaus M. Lampugnani M.G. Martin-Padura I. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. McDonald D.M. Ward P.A. Dejana E. Vascular endothelial-cadherin is an important determinant of microvascular integrity in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9815-9820Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Studies in kidney epithelial cells showed that cingulin gene disruption did not affect TJ formation, epithelial polarity, or maintenance of TJ organization (30.Guillemot L. Hammar E. Kaister C. Ritz J. Caille D. Jond L. Bauer C. Meda P. Citi S. Disruption of the cingulin gene does not prevent tight junction formation but alters gene expression.J.

https://openalex.org/W2513388740,"Expression of DAPK1, a critical regulator of autophagy and apoptosis, is lost in a wide variety of tumors, although the mechanisms are unclear. A transcription factor complex consisting of ATF6 (an endoplasmic reticulum-resident factor) and C/EBP-β is required for the IFN-γ-induced expression of DAPK1. IFN-γ-induced proteolytic processing of ATF6 and phosphorylation of C/EBP-β are obligatory for the formation of this transcriptional complex. We report that defects in this pathway fail to control growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Consistent with these observations, IFN-γ and chemotherapeutics failed to activate autophagy in CLL patient samples lacking ATF6 and/or C/EBP-β. Together, these results identify a molecular basis for the loss of DAPK1 expression in CLL. Expression of DAPK1, a critical regulator of autophagy and apoptosis, is lost in a wide variety of tumors, although the mechanisms are unclear. A transcription factor complex consisting of ATF6 (an endoplasmic reticulum-resident factor) and C/EBP-β is required for the IFN-γ-induced expression of DAPK1. IFN-γ-induced proteolytic processing of ATF6 and phosphorylation of C/EBP-β are obligatory for the formation of this transcriptional complex. We report that defects in this pathway fail to control growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Consistent with these observations, IFN-γ and chemotherapeutics failed to activate autophagy in CLL patient samples lacking ATF6 and/or C/EBP-β. Together, these results identify a molecular basis for the loss of DAPK1 expression in CLL. Multiple genes are inactivated during the progression of a normal cell into malignant one. The death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK1) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that controls several aspects of cell growth, including cell cycle check points, apoptosis, and autophagy, and suppresses tumor metastasis (1.Harrison B.

Expression of DAPK1 is frequently lost in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 2The abbreviations used are: CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; HDAC, histone deacetylase; qPCR, real-time quantitative PCR; NR-IgG, non-reactive rabbit IgG; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms of such loss are not known. CLL, a mature B cell malignancy, is one of the more prevalent types of adult leukemias. Limited therapeutic interventions are available for advanced stages, and, as a result, increased mortality of elderly patients occurs (5.Galton D.A. The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1966; 94: 1005-1010PubMed Google Scholar). A major proportion of CLL patients display abnormalities in cytokine secretion and/or response (6.Reyes E. Prieto A. Carrión F. García-Suarez J. Esquivel F. Guillén C. Alvarez-Mon M. Altered pattern of cytokine production by peripheral blood CD2+ cells from B chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.Am. J. Hematol. 1998; 57: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, phytohemagglutinin-activated CD2+ cells from CLL patients produced higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α compared with healthy individuals. Serum IL2 and IL4 levels were significantly higher in CLL patients than in the healthy controls (7.Zaki M. Douglas R. Patten N. Bachinsky M. Lamb R. Nowell P. Moore J.

The well described IFN-induced JAK-STAT pathways are critical for executing acute responses, such as antiviral activities. However, a number of other pathways regulate IFN-induced chronic biological activities, such as cell growth and adaptive immunity. Earlier, we identified a non-STAT pathway in which transcriptional factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) promotes IFN-induced responses (10.Gade P. Roy S.K. Li H. Nallar S.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Critical role for transcription factor C/EBP-β in regulating the expression of death-associated protein kinase 1.Mol.

Importantly, C/EBP-β cooperates with the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key ER stress-associated transcription factor, for inducing DAPK1 expression in response to IFN-γ (15.Gade P. Ramachandran G. Maachani U.B. Rizzo M.A. Okada T. Prywes R. Cross A.S. Mori K. Kalvakolanu D.V.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10316-10321Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have shown that the IFN-induced threonine phosphorylation of C/EBP-β in its second regulatory domain by ERK1/2, along with the phosphorylation and proteolytic activation of ATF6, is obligatory for DAPK1 expression (15.Gade P. Ramachandran G. Maachani U.B. Rizzo M.A. Okada T. Prywes R. Cross A.S. Mori K. Kalvakolanu D.V.

Cell Biol. 2014; 34: 4033-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because most of these studies were restricted to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the relevance of this new pathway to human cancers is not clear. Here we examined the importance of this pathway to cell growth control via autophagy using a CLL model. Autophagy, an intracellular vesicle-initiated, lysosome-dependent self-digestion, is emerging as a major mechanism for tumor suppression, pathogen elimination, removal of apoptotic cells, and antigen presentation (17.Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Autophagy and cell death.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2007; 78: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Autophagy appears to play a dual role in cancer cells. It promotes cancer cell survival by supplying energy sources. In contrast, it serves as an effective tumor-suppressive mechanism due to excessive digestion of cellular contents (18.Kubisch J. Turei D. Földvári-Nagy L. Dunai Z.A. Zsákai L. Varga M. Vellai T. Csermely P. Korcsmáros T. Complex regulation of autophagy in cancer: integrated approaches to discover the networks that hold a double-edged sword.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2013; 23: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although one major mechanism for DAPK1 silencing in cancer appears to be promoter methylation, it is often silenced without apparent methylation in many cases (19.Narayan G. Arias-Pulido H. Koul S. Vargas H. Zhang F.F. Villella J. Schneider A. Terry M.B. Mansukhani M. Murty V.V. Frequent promoter methylation of CDH1, DAPKRARBHIC1 genes in carcinoma of cervix uteri: its relationship to clinical outcome.Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutational inactivation of DAPK1 is uncommon, except in the case of a familial form of CLL that diminishes its expression (20.Raval A. Tanner S.M. Byrd J.C. Angerman E.B. Perko J.D. Chen S.S. Hackanson B. Grever M.R. Lucas D.M. Matkovic J.J. Lin T.S. Kipps T.J. Murray F. Weisenburger D. Sanger W. et al.Downregulation of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Cell. 2007; 129: 879-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In one case, this rare “CLL haplotype” resulted in an increased binding of the homeobox transcription factor HOXB7 to the DAPK1 promoter, resulting in a slight but significant reduction of its expression (20.Raval A. Tanner S.M. Byrd J.C. Angerman E.B. Perko J.D. Chen S.S. Hackanson B. Grever M.R. Lucas D.M. Matkovic J.J. Lin T.S. Kipps T.J. Murray F. Weisenburger D. Sanger W. et al.Downregulation of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Cell. 2007; 129: 879-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This aberration is not global to all CLLs. Thus, there is a critical need to understand how DAPK1 expression is suppressed. We hypothesized that a dysfunction in the C/EBP-β and ATF6 pathway contributes to a loss of DAPK1 expression and growth control in CLL. We report here that defects in this pathway suppress DAPK1 expression and promote CLL growth. We first investigated whether DAPK1 expression was induced by IFN-γ in B cell tumor line MEC1 (derived from a case of CLL) and compared it with a control B cell line. Western blotting analyses showed higher basal DAPK1 levels in the B cell line, which was further stimulated following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1A). Neither basal nor IFN-induced expression of DAPK1 was detected in MEC1. Similarly, DAPK1 mRNA was induced following IFN-γ treatment, only in the control B cell line and not in MEC1 (Fig. 1B). Notably, even the basal DAPK1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in this tumor line, compared with the control. Because DAPK1 participates in autophagy and tumor suppression, such a defect could result in an inhibition of autophagy. Initially, we examined the levels of Beclin1 (BECN1), a crucial regulator of autophagy and tumor suppression (Fig. 1B). No significant differences were observed in the basal and IFN-induced BECN1 mRNA levels in the control B cell line and MEC1. Next, we investigated whether IFN-γ differentially stimulated autophagy in these cells by measuring the formation of LC3 puncta. IFN-γ induced significant LC3 puncta only in the control B cell line and not in the MEC1 cell line (Fig. 1C). Alternatively, LC3-II formation, p62 (SQSTM1) degradation, and Beclin1 (Thr119) phosphorylation levels were measured in these cells using Western blotting analyses with specific antibodies (Fig. 1D) to confirm activation of autophagy. The increase in formation of LC3-II correlated well with puncta formation in the control B cell line. The p62 (SQSTM1) protein cargoes oxidized protein aggregates to autophagosomes (21.Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Wooten M.W. Signal integration and diversification through the p62 scaffold protein.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 95-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which are degraded along with the cargo during autophagy. Thus, higher cellular p62 levels indicate a defect in autophagy. Upon IFN-γ treatment, p62 was lowered only in the control B cell line and not in MEC1 (Fig. 1D). Because DAPK1 is known to phosphorylate Beclin1 during autophagy (22.Zalckvar E. Berissi H. Mizrachy L. Idelchuk Y. Koren I. Eisenstein M. Sabanay H. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Kimchi A. DAP-kinase-mediated phosphorylation on the BH3 domain of beclin 1 promotes dissociation of beclin 1 from Bcl-XL and induction of autophagy.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), we next examined its phosphorylation at Thr119. Although both cell lines expressed comparable levels of total Beclin, increased Beclin1-Thr(P)119 was found only in the control B cell line and not in MEC1 in response to IFN treatment (Fig. 1D). To ensure the critical role of DAPK1 in autophagy, we investigated whether a knockdown of DAPK1 using RNAi in the control B cell line and an introduction of DAPK1 into MEC1 would alter autophagy. Fig. 1E shows the Western blotting analysis of DAPK1 levels in these cell lines along with their corresponding controls. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that DAPK1 depletion in the control B cell line caused a significant loss of the IFN-γ-induced LC3 puncta when compared with the scrambled shRNA control (Sc shRNA) (Fig. 1F). In contrast, DAPK1 expression in MEC1 yielded maximum LC3 puncta, compared with vector control, following IFN-γ treatment. Because our recent studies using MEFs identified a major role for ATF6 and C/EBP-β in promoting DAPK1 expression, we investigated the relevance of these transcription factors (Fig. 2A) to DAPK1 expression in B cells, using RNAi. The ATF6- or C/EBP-β- specific shRNAs, but not the scrambled shRNA control, suppressed the IFN-induced expression of DAPK1 in B cells (Fig. 2B). Because the levels of the targeted proteins were not significantly different between mock-transfected and scrambled shRNA control-transfected cells (Fig. 2A), in the following experiments, all comparisons were made between scrambled shRNA control and specific shRNA transfectants. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that only B cells with scrambled shRNA control yielded maximum numbers of LC3 puncta upon IFN-γ treatment, when compared with either ATF6 or C/EBP-β depletion, signifying their importance in IFN-induced autophagy (Fig. 2C). Notably, we were able to co-localize LC3 puncta and DAPK1 in the IFN-treated control cells but not in ATF6- or C/EBP-β-depleted cells. Because certain histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC2 and HDAC5, were known to repress DAPK1 in certain forms of acute myeloid leukemia (23.Shanmugam R. Gade P. Wilson-Weekes A. Sayar H. Suvannasankha A. Goswami C. Li L. Gupta S. Cardoso A.A. Al Baghdadi T. Sargent K.J. Cripe L.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Boswell H.S. A noncanonical Flt3ITD/NF-κB signaling pathway represses DAPK1 in acute myeloid leukemia.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we measured their levels by Western blotting analysis and found that such differences were not due to an increased expression of HDACs in these cells when either ATF6 or C/EBP-β was depleted (Fig. 2B). To address whether the ATF6·C/EBP-β complex is recruited to the DAPK1 promoter upon IFN-γ treatment, we performed ChIP assays with specific antibodies. DAPK1 promoter-specific PCR products were observed only in the control B cell line and not in MEC1 following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 2D). The control reactions with either no IgG or non-reactive rabbit IgG (NR-IgG) yielded no products, showing the specificity of the ChIP assay. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of these ChIP products is shown in Fig. 2E. Thus, a failure to recruit ATF6 and/or C/EBP-β to the DAPK1 promoter may result in a loss of DAPK1 expression in the tumor cells. We next examined the mechanistic bases for the lack of ATF6 and C/EBP-β recruitment to the DAPK1 promoter in MEC1 cells. Because IFN-induced phosphorylation of C/EBP-β and proteolytic activation of ATF6 are required for DAPK1 expression, we checked whether any aberrations in these processes were responsible for the lack of transcription factor recruitment to the DAPK1 promoter. Only the control B cells showed higher levels of phospho-Thr235 C/EBP-β (a known ERK-phosphorylated site) and activated ATF6 (50-kDa form) upon IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 2F). Strikingly, phospho-Thr235 C/EBP-β was barely detectable in MEC1 cells, whereas normal proteolytic activation of ATF6 was detected in MEC1 tumor cells upon IFN-γ treatment. Bar graphs in the bottom panel of Fig. 2F show the quantified data. The importance of previously reported ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways for IFN-γ-induced C/EBP-β·ATF-6-dependent DAPK1 expression was examined in B cell lines by using chemical inhibitors. We used PD98059 and SB20219 for specifically blocking the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, respectively. An unrelated inhibitor that blocks the PI3K pathway was used as a control. The effects of these inhibitors on the DAPK1 mRNA levels in B cells and MEC1 tumor cells were studied. Only PD98059 and SB20219 and not the control inhibitor LY294002 or DMSO blocked the IFN-induced DAPK1 mRNA levels in B cells (Fig. 2G). However, in MEC1 cells, as predicted, IFN-γ treatment did not yield any significant differences in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors. In the next experiment, we investigated whether the ATF6·C/EBP-β complex is recruited to the DAPK1 promoter upon IFN-γ treatment in the presence of these inhibitors. We performed ChIP assays with specific antibodies. qPCR analyses of the ChIP products are shown in Fig. 2H. Only the specific inhibitors PD98059 and SB20219 and not the DMSO control blocked the IFN-induced recruitment of ATF6 and C/EBP-β to the DAPK1 promoter. To examine the clinical relevance of the above observations, we investigated whether a correlation exists between DAPK1 levels and ATF6 or C/EBP-β expression in primary CLL. The patient sample details are shown in Table 1. Because we could only obtain small quantities of purified primary tumor cells, we measured expression levels of the stated mRNA by qPCR. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy individuals (n = 8) were used as a control in these experiments. qPCR analyses of the steady state levels of DAPK1, ATF6, BECN1, and CEBPB mRNAs in the patient samples showed a loss of their expression in the majority of CLLs (Fig. 3A). Unlike in the MEC1 tumor cell line, many CLL samples also expressed a significantly lower level of BECN1 when compared with the controls.TABLE 1Details of CLL samples obtained from patientsPatient sampleGenderAgeEthnicityyrAMale84CaucasianBMale58CaucasianCMale68CaucasianDMale62CaucasianEMale45African-AmericanFFemale66African-AmericanGMale72CaucasianHMale39CaucasianIFemale60CaucasianJMale41African-AmericanKFemale64African-AmericanLMale65CaucasianMFemale64African-AmericanNMale56Asian/Pacific IslanderOMale62CaucasianPMale62CaucasianQMale61CaucasianRMale59African-AmericanSMale72CaucasianTMale59CaucasianUMale71Caucasian Open table in a new tab Because ATF6 is also involved in ER stress responses, we investigated changes in the mRNA levels of ER stress response genes, such as HSPA5 (BiP), ATF4, and XBP1. Both HSPA5 and ATF4 levels were significantly low in many samples. No significant changes in XBP1 levels were observed in these samples (Fig. 3B). We also investigated whether there were any differences in mRNA levels of IFN-induced tumor suppressor genes IRF1 and IRF8 (24.Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K.

Requirement for transcription factor IRF-1 in NO synthase induction in macrophages.Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). These transcripts were abundantly expressed in CLL samples, and their levels were comparable with those of healthy controls (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C shows the relative abundance of DAPK1, ATF6, and CEBPB mRNAs in each CLL sample. Although two samples (patients A and J) expressed normal levels of CEBPB, they had a lower level of ATF6. In another sample (patient C), ATF6 and CEBPB mRNA levels were similar and lower, respectively, compared with controls. Thus, low DAPK1 levels correlated with severely reduced expression of either ATF6 or CEBPB (except for one from patient B). To address whether the ATF6·C/EBP-β complex is recruited to the DAPK1 promoter upon IFN-γ treatment in the patient samples, we performed ChIP assays with specific antibodies. DAPK1 promoter-specific PCR products were observed only in the control PBL and not in the patient samples (n = 5) following IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 3D). Because ATF6 and C/EBP-β are required for IFN-γ stimulated DAPK1 expression and autophagy, we next checked the expression levels of these proteins by immunofluorescence in different CLL patient samples. Fig. 4A shows the representative images for the levels of DAPK1, C/EBP-β, and ATF6 from CLL samples (different patient samples) alongside a healthy control. After immunostaining with specific antibodies, images were captured, and mean fluorescence intensity of the signals was determined using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). As observed in qPCR profiles, DAPK1, ATF6, and C/EBP-β levels were very low in CLL patient samples when compared with healthy controls. In some samples (B, F, and J), for which sufficient cell numbers were available, we quantified DAPK1 levels using Western blotting analyses (Fig. 4B). CLL samples F and J did not express DAPK1. In patient sample B, where a high level of steady state DAPK1 was observed, IFN-γ treatment did not induce DAPK1 levels further. As expected, normal PBL control(s) expressed both steady state and IFN-γ-induced DAPK1 (Fig. 4B). In the subsequent experiments, we investigated the effects of flavopiridol, a pan-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor (26.Sedlacek H. Czech J. Naik R. Kaur G. Worland P. Losiewicz M. Parker B. Carlson B. Smith A. Senderowicz A. Sausville E. Flavopiridol (L86 8275; NSC 649890), a new kinase inhibitor for tumor therapy.Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 9: 1143-1168PubMed Google Scholar), and chlorambucil, an alkylating agent (27.Begleiter A. Mowat M. Israels L.G. Johnston J.B. Chlorambucil in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: mechanism of action.Leuk. Lymphoma. 1996; 23: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which demonstrated significant clinical activity in CLL (28.Mahoney E. Lucas D.M. Gupta S.V. Wagner A.J. Herman S.E. Smith L.L.

Paiement J.P. Christodoulopoulos G. Belenkov A. Malapetsa A. Aloyz R. Chlorambucil drug resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: the emerging role of DNA repair.Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 454-461PubMed Google Scholar), on autophagy and cell growth. Fig. 4C (top panels) shows Western blotting analyses of LC3-II p62, phospho-Beclin1, and Beclin1 levels in the indicated CLL samples after IFN-γ (for 8 h), flavopiridol (2 μm for 4 h), and chlorambucil (20 μm for 4 h) treatments. LC3-II formation was severely suppressed in the three CLL samples compared with healthy control PBL. p62 levels were either greater than or the same relative to the untreated control, consistent with the ablation of autophagy in the CLL samples. Consistent with these observations, phospho-Beclin1 levels were also undetectable in all CLL samples when compared with the control PBL. Fig. 4C (bottom) shows the quantified data for each of the proteins analyzed. Thus, a loss of expression of ATF6 and/or C/EBP-β results in severely reduced autophagy in CLL. Because DAPK1 is a regulator of cell death, we also measured the percentage of viable cells in the tumor and control B cell lines following treatment with IFN-γ, flavopiridol, and chlorambucil (Fig. 4D). Upon IFN-γ treatment (for 4 or 16 h), the percentage of viable cells significantly declined in the control B cell line but not in MEC1. Similarly, flavopiridol and chlorambucil treatment significantly suppressed the viability of the control B cell line but not MEC1. In summary, the tumor cell line MEC1 defective for C/EBP-β phosphorylation (see Fig. 2) showed a poorer response to IFN-γ and therapeutic agents. A similar experiment could not be performed in primary CLL samples due to the limited availability of cells. We next examined whether restoration of C/EBP-β and/or ATF6 in the defective CLL patient samples would reestablish DAPK1 expression and autophagy. For this experiment, we have chosen two CLL patient samples: 1) sample F with a low C/EBP-β but a normal ATF6 level and 2) sample J with low ATF6 but a normal C/EBP-β level. These cells were transfected with lentiviral expression vectors encoding either C/EBP-β (F) or ATF6 (J) or control vector alone (F and J) (Fig. 5A). These cells were examined for IFN-induced expression of DAPK1 and autophagy. IFN-γ was able to induce DAPK1 expression and promote autophagy (Fig. 5, B and C) only after a re-expression of C/EBP-β or ATF6 in these CLL samples. Autophagy maintains cellular hygiene by eliminating damaged organelle or protein aggregates via sequestration into double membrane intracellular vesicles and their subsequent fusion with lysosomes. Autophagy has been linked to both survival and death (30.Klionsky D.J. Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), depending on the cell type, signal, and physiologic state of a cell (31.Hoare M. Young A.R. Narita M. Autophagy in cancer: having your cake and eating it.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2011; 21: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). For example, autophagy promotes cell survival by providing nutrients during cell starvation. In contrast, it can promote cell death via excessive digestion organelles if cells fail to return to normal functions. Autophagy promotes senescence to suppress tumor growth (32.Young A.R.J.

Blockade of autophagy enhances the apoptotic cell death mode in some cases. Indeed, a number of regulators of autophagy also participate in apoptosis (35.Subramani S. Malhotra V.

DAPK1 is one of the first known proteins that directly connects autophagy to cell death through phosphorylation of Beclin1, a known tumor suppressor (36.Zalckvar E. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A.

DAPK1 employs several substrates for exerting its biological effects (37.Bialik S. Kimchi A. The DAP-kinase interactome.Apoptosis. 2014; 19: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, it phosphorylates and activates protein kinase D, a tumor suppressor that regulates trans-Golgi trafficking. During oxidative stress, DAPK1 binds and phosphorylates Vps34, a major regulator of autophagy (38.Eisenberg-Lerner A. Kimchi A.

https://openalex.org/W2509989231,"Mycolic acids are essential components of the mycobacterial cell envelope, and their biosynthetic pathway is a well known source of antituberculous drug targets. Among the promising new targets in the pathway, FadD32 is an essential enzyme required for the activation of the long meromycolic chain of mycolic acids and is essential for mycobacterial growth. Following the in-depth biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of FadD32, we investigated its putative regulation via post-translational modifications. Comparison of the fatty acyl-AMP ligase activity between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated FadD32 isoforms showed that the native protein is phosphorylated by serine/threonine protein kinases and that this phosphorylation induced a significant loss of activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of the native protein confirmed the post-translational modifications and identified Thr-552 as the phosphosite. Phosphoablative and phosphomimetic FadD32 mutant proteins confirmed both the position and the importance of the modification and its correlation with the negative regulation of FadD32 activity. Investigation of the mycolic acid condensation reaction catalyzed by Pks13, involving FadD32 as a partner, showed that FadD32 phosphorylation also impacts the condensation activity. Altogether, our results bring to light FadD32 phosphorylation by serine/threonine protein kinases and its correlation with the enzyme-negative regulation, thus shedding a new horizon on the mycolic acid biosynthesis modulation and possible inhibition strategies for this promising drug target."

Based on these activities, a pathway for riboflavin catabolism is proposed. Cofactors play key roles in augmenting the limited functionality available on proteins for catalysis. As with all other metabolites, cofactors do not accumulate in the environment. This is due in part to efficient salvage of these biosynthetically expensive metabolites and in part to cofactor catabolism. However, in contrast to the large literature on cofactor biosynthesis, relatively little is known about cofactor breakdown (1.Mukherjee T. McCulloch K.M. Ealick S.E. Begley T.P.

Analysis of culture metabolites from the reported riboflavin catabolic strain demonstrated that this strain was capable of fully degrading the isoalloxazine ring of riboflavin (12.Harkness D.R.

Riboflavin hydrolase, the only previously characterized riboflavin catabolic enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of riboflavin to lumichrome and ribose and has previously been identified as a potential catabolic enzyme in a second pathway (13.Foster J.W.

However, despite significant effort, the gene encoding this enzyme was never identified and the enzyme itself proved to be biochemically intractable (16.Yang C.S. McCormick D.B. [164]Riboflavin hydrolase (EC 3.5.99.1) from Pseudomonas riboflavina.Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 571-573Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of a riboflavin-catabolizing Microbacterium maritypicum strain from dust samples obtained at the DSM riboflavin production plant in Germany. The catabolic operon was isolated from a cosmid library, sequenced, and annotated. Preliminary characterization of the enzymes involved suggested a riboflavin catabolic pathway. Dust samples, collected at the DSM riboflavin production plant in Germany, were screened by culturing in a defined minimal medium containing M9 salts with riboflavin as the primary carbon source. Bleaching of the riboflavin color was observed in some of the samples. The cells from these hits were grown on NB plates and single colonies were selected. Individual strains were retested in M9 medium with riboflavin as the sole carbon source. The best of these strains (strain G10) completely bleached the yellow color of riboflavin after 12 h of growth and was selected for further study. The sequence of the gene encoding 16S rRNA identified this strain as M. maritypicum. To identify the products generated from consumption of riboflavin, M. maritypicum G10 was grown in M9 medium supplemented with 0.1% LB and 100 μg/ml (270 μm) of riboflavin. HPLC analysis of the medium showed time-dependent consumption of riboflavin and appearance of a new signal, which comigrated with lumichrome (Fig. 1A). Analysis after 21 h showed complete catabolism of riboflavin, a small peak for lumichrome, and no new signals were observed on the HPLC. We therefore wondered whether lumichrome was precipitating from the growth medium. After 30 h, the total lumichrome concentration, from 270 μm riboflavin, was 260 μm. This corresponds to 96% conversion of riboflavin to lumichrome. When the same culture medium was filtered before basification, the lumichrome concentration was less than 25 μm (Fig. 1B). We therefore conclude that riboflavin catabolism in M. maritypicum G10 involves cleavage of the ribose from the isoalloxazine ring. The ribose is used to sustain cell growth and the lumichrome precipitates from the growth medium. A cosmid library was constructed for the isolation of the riboflavin catabolic gene cluster (17.Cheng L. Chen W. Zhai L. Xu D. Huang T. Lin S. Zhou X. Deng Z. Identification of the gene cluster involved in muraymycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces sp. NRRL 30471.Mol. BioSyst. 2011; 7: 920-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After failing to identify the gene cluster by screening this library in Escherichia coli, Streptomyces lividans 1326 was chosen as the heterologous host because Microbacterium and Streptomyces both have similar genomic GC content (∼70%). The cosmid library was therefore reconstructed in vector pJTU2463 containing oriT for conjugation and integration into the attP site of S. lividans. Based on an estimated Microbacterium genome size of 4–5 Mbp, we constructed a library of 768 clones (eight 96-well plates) resulting in at least 6-fold coverage of the genome. This library was screened, first in batches of 12 cosmids, then individually, to yield two cosmids encoding the riboflavin catabolic pathway (1A4 and 5H7, Fig. 2A). Sequence alignment of the two cosmids identified a 6.63-kb region in 1A4 showing 86% identity with 5H7 suggesting that the riboflavin catabolic genes were localized in this region. To test this, an 8.7-kb BamHI fragment from 5H7, containing the target 6.63-kb region, was cloned into pJTU2463 and introduced into S. lividans. This strain also consumed riboflavin. The genetic organization of the riboflavin catabolic gene cluster of cosmid 5H7 is shown in Fig. 2B and the gene annotations are shown in Table 1. The riboflavin catabolic gene cluster on cosmid 1A4 was similarly annotated (supplemental Table S2). All of the genes in this cluster have high identity (77∼95%) with those in the 5H7 cluster except for RcaH, which is replaced by a gene of unknown function (RcaJ2) and RcaA, which is absent. Based on the sequence analysis, RcaF and RcaG are likely to be involved in riboflavin transport and RcaC in pathway regulation. These proteins were not further studied. Cosmids 5H7 and 1A4 both contain all of the genes essential for riboflavin catabolism in S. lividans (supplemental Table S2). Because a second riboflavin kinase is available for FMN and FAD biosynthesis in S. lividans, RcaA is not an essential component of the catabolic gene cluster (see below). In addition, because rcaH is missing from cosmid 1A4 and rcaJ2 is missing from cosmid 5H7, we conclude that neither of these genes are involved in riboflavin catabolism.TABLE 1Deduced functions of ORFs in the riboflavin catabolic gene cluster of cosmid 5H7GeneStartStopAmino acidProtein homolog/Proposed functionIdentity%RcaA15851193131Bifunctional riboflavin kinase Arsenicicoccus bolidensis/Flavokinase70/12954RcaB21061585174Flavin reductase Marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1/Flavin-reductase87/15955RcaC22092811201PadR family transcriptional regulator Salinibacterium sp.

The overexpressed enzyme was purified on a Ni-NTA 2The abbreviations used are:Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PFBHA, O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. HisTrap HP column (Fig. 3A). The purified enzyme was incubated with riboflavin and ATP and the product was identified as FMN by HPLC co-elution with the purchased standard, thus confirming RcaA as a riboflavin kinase (Fig. 3B). RcaB was cloned into the pMAL vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The overexpressed enzyme was purified on an amylose resin column followed by maltose tag cleavage (Fig. 4A). The purified enzyme was incubated with NADH and riboflavin (or FMN) and a steady decrease in the absorbance for oxidized flavin at 450 nm was observed by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 4B). As evident from Fig. 4B, a complete reduction of 80 μm FMN was achieved in 80 s with 100 nm RcaB in the presence of excess NADH, whereas similar reduction of riboflavin required 1 μm enzyme. In Fig. 4C NADH consumption was monitored by the decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm. NADH consumption was measured for both FMN (left panel) and riboflavin (right panel) reduction with 100 nm RcaB. A comparison between the two panels (supplemental Fig. S1) clearly indicates that the rate of reduction of FMN by RcaB is faster than that of riboflavin. No such decrease in the absorbance of the oxidized flavin at 450 nm was observed when the flavin was incubated with NADH in the absence of the enzyme (Fig. 4D). Similarly, in the absence of oxidized flavin no decrease in the absorbance for NADH at 340 nm was observed (Fig. 4E). The above results confirmed RcaB as a flavin reductase with a modest substrate preference for FMN. RcaD was cloned into the pMAL vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The enzyme was purified as described for RcaB above (Fig. 5A). RcaD catalyzed the conversion of ribose to ribose 5-phosphate in the presence of ATP. The product was detected by LC-MS analysis of the reaction mixture after treatment with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine (PFBHA) to convert the corresponding aldehyde to an oxime (Fig. 5, B and C) followed by co-elution with the synthesized standard of ribose 5-phosphate-PFBHA oxime (supplemental Fig. S2), thus confirming RcaD as a ribokinase. RcaE was cloned into pET28b and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The protein was purified on a Ni-NTA HisTrap HP column (Fig. 6A). To test for riboflavin hydrolase activity riboflavin, NADH and ATP were incubated with purified RcaA, RcaB, and RcaE and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC. A time-dependent formation of lumichrome with the enzyme mixture was observed (Fig. 6B). To characterize the sugar product in the enzymatic degradation of riboflavin, the reaction mixture was treated with PFBHA and analyzed by LC-MS. The full reaction revealed the formation of ribose-PFBHA oxime (Fig. 6C). Its identity was confirmed by co-elution with a synthesized standard of ribose-PFBHA oxime followed by ESI-mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 6D). To further define the riboflavin hydrolase activity, a series of reactions, lacking individual enzymes, were run (Fig. 7). These experiments established the following: RcaA catalyzes the first step in the catabolic pathway because in the absence of RcaA, riboflavin is not consumed and lumichrome is not formed; RcaB catalyzes the second step because in its absence FMN accumulates and greatly reduced quantities of lumichrome are formed due to slow non-enzymatic reduction of FMN by NADH (Fig. 4D). In the absence of RcaE, FMN also accumulates because any reduced flavin will undergo re-oxidation during aerobic work-up. Remarkably, addition of catalytic amounts of FMN removes the RcaA requirement thus enabling reconstitution of the riboflavin hydrolase using only RcaB and RcaE (Fig. 8). The hydrolase reaction is oxygen-dependent (Fig. 9) and the reaction products are lumichrome and ribose.FIGURE 7.HPLC characterization of the enzymatic formation of lumichrome in the absence of individual participating enzymes. Formation of lumichrome is observed when riboflavin is incubated with RcaA, RcaB, and RcaE (yellow trace). No consumption of riboflavin is observed in the absence of RcaA (red trace). In the absence of RcaB, reduced levels of lumichrome formation are observed and riboflavin is converted to FMN (green trace). The lumichrome formed in this sample is due to the slow non-enzymatic reduction of FMN by NADH.

The trace of lumichrome in this reaction is a contaminant in commercial FMN and riboflavin samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initial screening for riboflavin catabolic organisms in soil and sewage samples from Ithaca (New York) and College Station (Texas) was unsuccessful. This suggested that it was necessary to screen from environments richer in riboflavin. With this in mind, riboflavin catabolic microorganisms were readily isolated from dust samples obtained at the DSM riboflavin production plant in Germany. From these M. maritypicum G10, capable of growth on riboflavin as the sole carbon source, was isolated. HPLC analysis of the growth medium from this strain demonstrated the conversion of riboflavin to lumichrome (Fig. 1). Recently another strain of M. maritypicum was isolated from soil samples in Japan and optimized for lumichrome production. The catabolic operon in this strain was not characterized (18.Luzhetskiı̌ A.N. Ostash B.E. Fedorenko V.A. Interspecies conjugation of Escherichia coli-Streptomyces globisporus 1912 using integrative plasmid pSET152 and its derivatives.Genetika. 2001; 37: 1340-1347PubMed Google Scholar). A cosmid library, prepared from M. maritypicum G10, was screened in S. lividans and two cosmids encoding a riboflavin catabolic cluster were identified. Sequence analysis revealed that the two gene clusters (86% identity, Table 1 and supplemental Table S2) were on different locations in the genome. Based on sequence similarity and in vivo screening of the BamHI fragments of one of the cosmids, the gene cluster was localized to a 6.63-kb DNA fragment. This DNA segment had 8 open reading frames (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Biochemical studies focused on identifying the reactions catalyzed by RcaA, RcaB, RcaD, and RcaE. Based on the sequence analysis, RcaF and RcaG are likely to be involved in riboflavin transport and RcaC in pathway regulation. In addition, RcaH was not studied further because it is not present in the second catabolic cosmid (1A4). RcaA, RcaB, and RcaD were overexpressed and their predicted activities as riboflavin kinase, riboflavin reductase, and ribokinase, respectively, were confirmed. Sequence analysis of RcaE identified this enzyme as a possible riboflavin-dependent N5,N10-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin reductase. Being the only remaining unassigned riboflavin-binding protein in the catabolic cluster, it seemed reasonable that RcaE might function as a riboflavin hydrolase. In support of this hypothesis, it was possible to demonstrate that a reaction mixture containing purified RcaA, RcaB, and RcaE catalyzed the conversion of riboflavin to lumichrome and ribose (Fig. 6). Further simplification of the reaction mixture demonstrated that RcaB and RcaE were sufficient to cleave riboflavin to lumichrome and ribose using FMN as the RcaE cofactor (Fig. 8). A proposal for riboflavin catabolism in M. maritypicum G10 is shown in Fig. 10. In this proposal, RcaF and RcaG transport riboflavin into the cell (not shown). RcaA phosphorylates riboflavin and RcaB reduces the resulting FMN to generate the active form of the riboflavin hydrolase (RcaE) cofactor. Cleavage of riboflavin to lumichrome and ribose is an oxygen-requiring reaction (Fig. 9). The final step of riboflavin catabolism involves ribose phosphorylation. The mechanism of riboflavin hydrolase does not follow any of the canonical motifs in flavoenzymology and is currently under investigation. One possibility is that reduced FMN generates superoxide, which then triggers the ribose cleavage reaction by hydrogen atom abstraction from C1′ of the riboflavin ribose. The M. maritypicum G10 pathway is considerably simpler than a previously reported pathway in which culture medium metabolites indicated complete isoalloxazine degradation (12.Harkness D.R. Stadtman E.R. Bacterial degradation of riboflavin: VI. enzymatic conversion of riboflavin to 1-ribityl-2,3-diketo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6, 7-dimethylquinoxaline, urea, and carbon dioxide.J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4089-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that cleavage of the ribose from riboflavin terminates riboflavin catabolism because of lumichrome insolubility and that more extensive catabolism requires that the ribose remains bound to the heterocycle throughout the early stages of the isoalloxazine degradation. A phylogenetic tree constructed for RcaE using the Fast Minimum Evolution Method is shown in Fig. 11 and suggests that RcaE is narrowly distributed in bacteria. In addition to its intermediacy in riboflavin catabolism, lumichrome has been suggested as a generally important signaling molecule in plant microbe interactions. Lumichrome activates the LasR bacterial quorum sensing receptor (19.Weisburg W.G. Barns S.M. Pelletier D.A. Lane D.J. 16S ribosomal DNA amplification for phylogenetic study.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (8845) Google Scholar) and lumichrome produced by Sinorhizobium meliloti is an enhancer of alfalfa root respiration and shoot growth (20.Marchena M. Gil M. Martín C. Organero J.A. Sanchez F. Douhal A. Stability and photodynamics of lumichrome structures in water at different pHs and in chemical and biological caging media.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The orthologs marked in red in the phylogenetic tree of RcaE (Fig. 11) show that RcaE is well distributed among rhizosphere bacteria such as Azorhizobium caulinodans, several Bradyrhizobium sp., and root endophytes such as Microbacterium sp. Root322, Leifsonia sp. Root4. Riboflavin catabolism in these species is likely to play an additional signaling role. Riboflavin, FMN, NADH, PFBHA, and ribose 5-phosphate were purchased from Sigma. The commercial FMN came with small amounts of riboflavin and lumichrome as impurities. The impurities could not be eliminated after a round of HPLC purification of FMN due to the spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation of FMN. Commercial riboflavin also had trace amounts of lumichrome as an impurity, which showed up as a trace peak on the HPLC only with high concentrations (∼500 μm). The dehydrated form of LB broth and minimal medium salts were purchased from EMD Millipore. Kanamycin, ampicillin, and IPTG were purchased from Lab Scientific Inc. Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (10,000 MWCO) were obtained from Millipore. HisTrap columns were obtained from GE Healthcare. Econo-Pack 10DG desalting columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. S. lividans 1326 was used as the heterologous host for cosmid library screening for the riboflavin catabolic gene cluster. S. lividans 1326 and its derivatives were grown at 30 °C on soy flour-mannitol agar plates for sporulation and conjugation. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid construction and S17-1 was used for E. coli-Streptomyces conjugation. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used for protein overexpression and E. coli Epi100TM from Epicenter was used for cosmid library construction. The cosmid library was constructed with vector pJTU2463 (21.Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. Intergeneric conjugation between Escherichia coli and Streptomyces species.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which is a derivative of pOJ446 with the SCP2 replicon replaced by int and attP from pSET152 (22.Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, England2000Google Scholar). Plasmid pXH1 was cloned by inserting an 8.7-kb BamHI fragment from cosmid 5H7 into BamHI/CIP-treated pJTU2463. The strains and plasmids used are shown in supplemental Table S1. All enzymatic reactions were carried out in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. For HPLC analysis, an Agilent 1260 HPLC equipped with a quaternary pump, autosampler, column heater, and diode array detector was used. The liquid chromatographic analysis was carried out with a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particles, Agilent Technologies) with the following combination of solvents: A, water; B, 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.6; C, methanol. The column was pre-equilibrated in 90% A, 10% B, 0% C for 6 min prior to sample injection. This composition was held for 2 min and then changed to 20% A, 10% B, 70% C over 10 min (12 min for RcaA reaction analysis) using a linear gradient. This composition was held for 8 min and then the mixture was returned to 90% A, 10% B, 0% C over an additional 8 min. The flow rate was held constant at 1 ml/min. Data were viewed and processed with ChemStation software DataAnalysis version 4.0 SP 2 (build 274). LC-ESI-TOF-MS was performed using an Agilent 1260 HPLC system that was equipped with a binary pump, an autosampler, a column heater, and a 1200 series diode array detector upstream of a MicroToF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using an ESI source in the positive mode. Analysis was performed on an LC-18-T column (15 cm × 3 mm, 3 μm particles, Supelco) with the following combination of solvents at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min: A, 5 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.6; B, 75% methanol, 25% water. The column was pre-equilibrated in 100% A prior to sample injection. Upon sample injection the composition was held for 2 min and then changed to 30% A, 70% B over 10 min. This composition was held for 5 min and then the mobile phase was returned to 100% A, 0% B over 1 min. The column was equilibrated for 12 min prior to the injection of the next sample. Riboflavin catabolic strains were isolated from the dust at the DSM riboflavin-producing plant (Germany). Bacteria from dust samples were cultured in modified M9 medium (no glucose, 0.1 mm FeCl3, 0.1% LB, 100 μg/ml of riboflavin) for several days. The growing cells were plated on NB plates and single colonies were selected to make a collection. Individual strains were then inoculated into 5 ml of NB and cultured at 30 °C overnight. 1% of each starter culture was inoculated into 50 ml of modified M9 medium. The best strain catabolized riboflavin within 12 h and was selected for further study. The gene encoding 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR (F primer, 5′-CCGAATTCGTCGACAACAGAGTTTGA-3′) and R primer, 5′-CCCGGGATCCAAGCTTACGGCTACCT-3′) (23.Yamamoto K. Asano Y. Efficient production of lumichrome by Microbacterium sp. strain TPU 3598.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2015; 81: 7360-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sequence showed that this riboflavin catabolic strain had high homology with M. maritypicum strain DSM12512 and was named M. maritypicum G10. M. maritypicum G10 was inoculated into 5 ml of NB and grown overnight. The starter culture (1%) was inoculated into 50 ml of fresh modified M9 medium with riboflavin as the only carbon source. The cultures were grown in the dark at 30 °C for ∼4 days. For HPLC analysis, 200 μl of culture medium was filtered at various time points using 10-kDa filters and 100 μl was injected onto the HPLC column (Fig. 1A). To determine total lumichrome produced, 500 μl of culture medium was mixed with 500 μl of 1 n KOH and the UV-visible spectrum of the resulting mixture was recorded (Fig. 1B) (24.Rajamani S. Bauer W.D. Robinson J.B. Farrow 3rd, J.M. Pesci E.C. Teplitski M. Gao M. Sayre R.T. Phillips D.A. The vitamin riboflavin and its derivative lumichrome activate the LasR bacterial quorum-sensing receptor.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2008; 21: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The lumichrome concentration was determined using a calibration curve constructed using known quantities of lumichrome (2 to 80 μg/ml) dissolved in basic growth medium. The cosmid library was constructed in vector pJTU2463 containing oriT for conjugation and integration into the attP site of S. lividans. The genome size of Microbacterium is 4∼5 Mb. and the resulting library consisted of eight 96-well plates. The cosmid mixture from combining each row (12 samples) of the 96-well plates was transformed into E. coli S17-1 and then introduced into S. lividans by conjugation (25.Phillips D.A. Joseph C.M. Yang G.-P. Martinez-Romero E. Sanborn J.R. Volpin H. Identification of lumichrome as a Sinorhizobium enhancer of alfalfa root respiration and shoot growth.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12275-12280Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to give the corresponding S. lividans mutant mixture. Sixty-four conjugations were carried out and all the spores of the conjugants from each plate were collected to make one glycerol stock. Each mixture was tested on an M9 riboflavin plate for color bleach. After 7 days at 30 °C, plates with mutants carrying cosmid mixtures from Plate 1, row A (1A), and Plate 5, row H (5H), bleached the riboflavin. Each of the 24 cosmids from rows 1A and 5H was then individually introduced into S. lividans and tested on modified M9 agar plates at 30 °C for 1 week. The bottom layer of the modified plates was M9 medium (no glucose) with 1.6% of agar. The top layer was M9 medium (no glucose), 1.6% agar, 100 μg/ml of riboflavin, and 40 μl of spore stock. Two mutants (1A well 4 and 5H well 7) consumed riboflavin (Fig. 2A). Next generation sequencing of cosmids 1A4 and 5H7 was performed by AgriLife Genomics and Bioinformatics Services at Texas A&M University using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. The raw sequence data were analyzed with FramePlot 4.0 Beta and annotated using the BLAST algorithm and the SEED. The rcaE gene was amplified by PCR using cosmid 5H7 as the template (F primer: 5′-AAAACATATGACCGATCAGAACACCGT-3′, R primer: 5′-AAAAGAATTCAGACACGCGACATCGTC-3′, engineered NdeI and EcoRI sites are underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into pET28b (digested with NdeI/EcoRI) to generate plasmid pXH-2. This was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The transformants were grown in 3 liters of LB medium with 40 μg/ml of kanamycin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. IPTG was added to an initial concentration of 0.4 mm and incubation was continued at 15 °C for 18 h. The His-tagged RcaE was purified on a Ni-NTA HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and buffer exchanged into 50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, by passing through an Econo-Pac 10DG desalting column (Bio-Rad). The protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RcaA was purchased from GenScript and cloned into the pTHT vector. The His-tagged RcaA was overexpressed and purified using the same procedure used for RcaE. The rcaB gene was amplified by PCR using cosmid 5H7 as the template (F primer: 5′-AAAACATATGACGACTGTCGTGACCGA-3′, R primer: 5′-AAAACTCGAGTTACGCGCTCTCGGGAGC-3′, engineered NdeI and XhoI site are underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pMAL (NdeI/XhoI) to generate plasmid pXH-3. The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3). The transformants were grown in 3 liters of LB medium with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 0.5% glucose at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and the incubation was continued at 15 °C for 18 h. RcaB was purified on an amylose resin column followed by cleavage of the maltose tag with Factor Xa protease. The solution was then passed through an amylose resin column where the maltose tag was retained in the column and the pure protein was recovered in the flow-through. The purified protein was then exchanged into 50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, by passing through an Econo-Pac 10DG desalting column (Bio-Rad). The protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RcaD was similarly overexpressed and purified. A reaction mixture (100 μl) of 20 μm RcaA, 250 μm riboflavin, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2 was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Protein was removed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off filter) and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3B). A reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 100 nm RcaB, 250 μm NADH, 80 μm FMN (Fig. 4B, left trace) or 1 μm RcaB, 250 μm NADH, 80 μm riboflavin (Fig. 4B, right trace) was placed in a quartz cuvette and the reaction was monitored by following the reduction in the spectrum of oxidized flavin between 400 and 510 nm by UV-visible spectroscopy. Similarly 20 nm RcaB was incubated with 50 μm NADH and 20 μm riboflavin (or FMN) to monitor the relative rates for the oxidation of NADH (Fig. 4C) in the enzymatic reaction between 290 and 410 nm for FMN (left trace) versus riboflavin (right trace). As negative controls, the non-enzymatic reduction of FMN with NADH was monitored between 400 and 510 nm (Fig. 4D). Also the oxidation of NADH by RcaB in the absence of flavins was monitored between 290 and 410 nm (Fig. 4E). A reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 20 μm RcaD, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm ribose was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Protein was removed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off) and the product was converted to the corresponding oxime by treatment with 10 mm PFBHA at 65 °C for 1 h and analyzed by LC-MS (Fig. 5B). A reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 10 μm RcaE, 100 nm RcaA, 1 μm RcaB, 500 μm riboflavin, 5 mm NADH, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP was incubated at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min. Protein was removed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off filter) and the reaction mixture from each time point was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 6B). The reaction mixture after incubation for 10 min with the enzyme mixture was treated with PFBHA at 65 °C for 1 h and the corresponding oxime was analyzed by LC-MS (Fig. 6, C and D). A reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 4 μm RcaE, 400 nm RcaB, 200 μm riboflavin, 5 mm NADH, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP in the absence of RcaA was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In a second reaction mixture, 20 μm FMN was added to the mixture (100 μl) with 4 μm RcaE, 400 nm RcaB, 200 μm riboflavin, 5 mm NADH, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Protein was removed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off filter) and the two reaction mixtures (with and without catalytic amounts of FMN) were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 8). In the glove box, a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 10 μm RcaE, 1 μm RcaB, 500 μm riboflavin, 200 μm FMN, 5 mm NADH was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 25, 50, 100, and 125 μm oxygen prepared by appropriately diluting aerobic buffer containing 260 μm oxygen with anaerobic buffer. A reaction with identical conditions was set up in the presence of anaerobic buffer. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off filter) and the reaction mixture from each oxygen concentration was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 9). T. P. B. conceived and designed the project. H.

https://openalex.org/W2515575264,"Human gastric fundus relaxation is mediated by intrinsic inhibitory pathway. We investigated the roles of nitrergic and purinergic pathways, two known inhibitory factors in gastric motility, on spontaneous and nerve-evoked contractions in human gastric fundus muscles.Gastric fundus muscle strips (12 circular and 13 longitudinal) were obtained from patients without previous gastrointestinal motility disorder who underwent gastrectomy for stomach cancer. Using these specimens, we examined basal tone, peak, amplitude, and frequency of spontaneous contractions, and peak and nadir values under electrical field stimulation (EFS, 150 V, 0.3 ms, 10 Hz, 20 s). To examine responses to purinergic and nitrergic inhibition without cholinergic innervation, atropine (muscarinic antagonist, 1 μM), MRS2500 (a purinergic P2Y1 receptor antagonist, 1 μM), and N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 100 μM) were added sequentially for spontaneous and electrically-stimulated contractions. Tetrodotoxin was used to confirm any neuronal involvement.In spontaneous contraction, L-NNA increased basal tone and peak in both muscle layers, while amplitude and frequency were unaffected. EFS (up to 10 Hz) uniformly induced initial contraction and subsequent relaxation in a frequency-dependent manner. Atropine abolished initial on-contraction and induced only relaxation during EFS. While MRS2500 showed no additional influence, L-NNA reversed relaxation (p = 0.012 in circular muscle, and p = 0.006 in longitudinal muscle). Tetrodotoxin abolished any EFS-induced motor response.The relaxation of human gastric fundus muscle is reduced by nitrergic inhibition. Hence, nitrergic pathway appears to be the main mechanism for the human gastric fundus relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2509679489,"Components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, including BRG1 (also SMARCA4), are inactivated in cancer. Among other functions, SWI/SNF orchestrates the response to retinoid acid (RA) and glucocorticoids (GC) involving downregulation of MYC. The epigenetic drugs SAHA and azacytidine, as well as RA and GC, are currently being used to treat some malignancies but their therapeutic potential in lung cancer is not well established. Here we aimed to determine the possible therapeutic effects of azacytidine and SAHA (A/S) alone or in combination with GC plus RA (GC/RA) in lung cancers with either BRG1 inactivation or MYC amplification. In vitro, responses to GC/RA treatment were more effective in MYC-amplified cells. These effects were mediated by BRG1 and involved a reprogramming towards prodifferentiation gene expression signatures and downregulation of MYC. In MYC-amplified cells, administration of GC/RA enhanced the cell growth inhibitory effects of A/S which, in turn, accentuated the prodifferentiation features promoted by GC/RA. Finally, these treatments improved overall survival of mice orthotopically implanted with MYC-amplified, but not BRG1-mutant, cells and reduced tumor cell viability and proliferation. We propose that the combination of epigenetic treatments with retinoids and corticoids of MYC-driven lung tumors constitute a strategy for therapeutic intervention in this otherwise incurable disease."
https://openalex.org/W2514716739,"To develop clinical descriptions (vignettes) of life with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted focus groups of persons with AD (n = 14), family caregivers of persons with AD (n = 20), and clinicians who see persons with AD in their practices (n = 5).Group participants read existing descriptions of AD and commented on the realism and comprehensibility of the descriptions. We used thematic framework analysis to code the comments into themes and develop three new vignettes to describe mild, moderate, and severe AD.Themes included the types of symptoms to mention in the new vignettes, plus the manner in which the vignettes should be written. Since the vignette descriptions were based on focus group participants' first-hand knowledge of AD, the descriptions can be said to demonstrate content validity.Members of the general public can read the vignettes and estimate their health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) as if they had AD based on the vignette descriptions. This is especially important for economic evaluations of new AD medications, which require HRQoL to be assessed in a manner that persons with AD often find difficult to undertake. The vignettes will allow the general public to serve as a proxy and provide HRQoL estimates in place of persons with AD."
