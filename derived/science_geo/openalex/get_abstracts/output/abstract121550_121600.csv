https://openalex.org/W2024655460,"THE amygdala is thought to play a crucial role in emotional and social behaviour1. Animal studies implicate the amygdala in both fear conditioning2 and face perception3. In humans, lesions of the amygdala can lead to selective deficits in the recognition of fearful facial expressions4,5 and impaired fear conditioning6,7, and direct electrical stimulation evokes fearful emotional responses8. Here we report direct in vivo evidence of a differential neural response in the human amygdala to facial expressions of fear and happiness. Positron-emission tomography (PET) measures of neural activity were acquired while subjects viewed photographs of fearful or happy faces, varying systematically in emotional intensity. The neuronal response in the left amygdala was significantly greater to fearful as opposed to happy expressions. Furthermore, this response showed a significant interaction with the intensity of emotion (increasing with increasing fearfulness, decreasing with increasing happiness). The findings provide direct evidence that the human amygdala is engaged in processing the emotional salience of faces, with a specificity of response to fearful facial expressions."

https://openalex.org/W1977176665,"SIGNAL transduction pathways enable extracellular signals to activate latent transcription factors in the cytoplasm of cells. Dimerization, nuclear localization and binding to specific DNA sequences result in the induction of gene transcription by these proteins. These events are necessary for the functioning of the JAK/STAT pathway and of the glucocorticoid-receptor pathway. In the former, the protein Stat5, which is a member of a family of signal transducers and activators of transcription, is activated by cytokines, hormones and growth factors1–7. These polypeptide ligands bind at the outside of the cell to specific transmembrane receptors and activate intracellular Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) to tyrosine-phosphorylate STAT proteins; interaction with the SH2 domain of the dimerization partner then confers the ability to bind to DNA at the STAT-response element and induce transcription8–10. In the glucocorticoid-receptor path-way, the receptor interacts with its steroid hormone ligand in the cytoplasm, undergoes an allosteric change that enables the hormone receptor complex to bind to specific DNA-response elements (glucocorticoid response elements, or GRE) and mod-ulate transcription11,12. Although these pathways appear to be unrelated, we show here that the glucocorticoid receptor can act as a transcriptional co-activator for Stat5 and enhance Stat5-dependent transcription. Stat5 forms a complex with the gluco-corticoid receptor which binds to DNA independently of the GRE. This complex formation between Stat5 and the glucocorticoid receptor diminishes the glucocorticoid response of a GRE-con-taining promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2025201512,"The epigenetic signals that regulate lineage development in the embryonic mammalian brain are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that a specific subclass of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), cause the selective, dose-dependent elaboration of the astroglial lineage from murine embryonic subventricular zone (SVZ) multipotent progenitor cells. The astroglial inductive effect is characterized by enhanced morphological complexity and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, with concurrent suppression of neuronal and oligodendroglial cell fates. SVZ progenitor cells express transcripts for the appropriate BMP-specific type I and II receptor subunits and selective BMP ligands, suggesting the presence of paracrine or autocrine developmental signaling pathways (or both). These observations suggest that the BMPs have a selective role in determining the cell fate of SVZ multipotent progenitor cells or their more developmentally restricted progeny."

https://openalex.org/W2142190178,"RECEPTOR tyrosine kinases of the EPH class have been implicated in the control of axon guidance and fascieulation1–7, in regulating cell migration8, and in defining compartments in the developing embryo9–11. Efficient activation of EPH receptors generally requires that their ligands be anchored to the cell surface, either through a transmembrane (TM) region or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) group12. These observations have suggested that EPH receptors can transduce signals initiated by direct cell–cell interaction. Genetic analysis of Nuk, a murine EPH receptor that binds TM ligands, has raised the possibility that these ligands might themselves have a signalling function6. Consistent with this, the three known TM ligands have a highly conserved cytoplasmic region, with multiple potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation12–17. Here we show that challenging cells that express the TM ligands Elk-L or Htk-L with the clustered ectodomain of Nuk induces phosphorylation of the ligands on tyrosine, a process that can be mimicked both in vitro and in vivo by an activated Src tyrosine kinase. Co-culture of cells expressing a TM ligand with cells expressing Nuk leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of both the ligand and Nuk. These results suggest that the TM ligands are associated with a tyrosine kinase, and are inducibly phosphorylated upon binding Nuk, in a fashion reminiscent of cytokine receptors18. Furthermore, we show that TM ligands, as well as Nuk, are phosphorylated on tyrosine in mouse embryos, indicating that this is a physiological process. EPH receptors and their TM ligands therefore mediate bidirectional cell signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2012893265,"To investigate the structural role of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in vivo, mice carrying a null mutation in GFAP were generated. In 7/14 mutant animals older than 18 months of age, hydrocephalus associated with white matter loss was detected. Mutant mice displayed abnormal myelination including the presence of actively myelinating oligodendrocytes in adults, nonmyelinated axons in optic nerve, and reduced myelin thickness in spinal cord. White matter was poorly vascularized and the blood-brain barrier was structurally and functionally impaired. Astrocytic structure and function were abnormal, consisting of shortened astrocytic cell processes, decreased septation of white matter, and increased CNS extracellular space. Thus, GFAP expression is essential for normal white matter architecture and blood-brain barrier integrity, and its absence leads to late-onset CNS dysmyelination."

https://openalex.org/W1969677285,"EUKARYOTIC ribosomal RNAs are post-transcriptionally modified by methylation at the ribose sugar of specific nucleotides1. This takes place in the nucleolus and involves a family of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) with long regions (10–21 nucleotides) complementary to rRNA sequences spanning the methylation site2–4—a complementary snoRNA is required for methylation at a specific site5. Here we show that altering the sequence of the snoRNA is sufficient to change the specificity of methylation. Mammalian cells transfected with a snoRNA engineered to be complementary to an arbitrary rRNA sequence direct the methylation of the predicted nucleotide in that sequence. We have further identified structural features, both of the guide and substrate RNA, required for methylation and have used these to design an exogenous transcript, devoid of rRNA sequence, that is site-specifically methylated when co-expressed with an appropriate guide snoRNA. Endogenous non-ribosomal RNA can thus be targeted, possibly providing a highly selective tool for the alteration of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level."
