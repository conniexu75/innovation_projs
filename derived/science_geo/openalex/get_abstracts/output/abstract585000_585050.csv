https://openalex.org/W2605899784,"Low dietary quality and quantity and inappropriate feeding practices can cause undernutrition. Poor nutritional status in early childhood is associated with growth faltering. The objective of the study was to assess the potential of community-based nutrition education to improve height-for-age z-scores in children 6-23 months of age.We carried out a cluster-randomized-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of nutrition education. A total of 24 Extension Planning Area Sections served as clusters. The selection criteria were: the position of the extension officer was staffed and the sections had been selected by the project for activities in its first project year. The sections were randomized into intervention and control restricted on mean height for age Z-score using baseline information. In the intervention area, food security activities and community-based nutrition education was implemented. The control area received food security activities only. At baseline (2011) and endline (2014), caregivers with a child below two years of age were enrolled. Data assessment included anthropometric measurements, interviews on socio-economic status, dietary intake and feeding practices. A difference-in-differences estimator was used to calculate intervention effects. A positive impact on child dietary diversity was observed (B (SE) = 0.39 (0.15), p = 0.01; 95%CI 0.09-0.68). There was a non-significant positive intervention effect on mean height-for-age z-scores (B (SE) = 0.17 (0.12), p = 0.15; 95%CI -0.06-0.41).The 24h dietary recalls used to measure dietary diversity did not consider quantities of consumed foods. Unrecorded poor quality of consumed foods might have masked a potential benefit of increased child dietary diversity on growth.Participatory community-based nutrition education for caregivers improved child dietary diversity even in a food insecure area. Nutrition education should be part of programs in food insecure settings aiming at ameliorating food insecurity among communities."
https://openalex.org/W2605702841,"The immune system is necessary for protecting against various pathogens. However, under certain circumstances, self-reactive immune cells can drive autoimmunity, like that exhibited in type 1 diabetes (T1D). CD4+ T cells are major contributors to the immunopathology in T1D, and in order to drive optimal T cell activation, third signal reactive oxygen species (ROS) must be present. However, the role ROS play in mediating this process remains to be further understood. Recently, cellular metabolic programs have been shown to dictate the function and fate of immune cells, including CD4+ T cells. During activation, CD4+ T cells must transition metabolically from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis to support proliferation and effector function. As ROS are capable of modulating cellular metabolism in other models, we sought to understand if blocking ROS also regulates CD4+ T cell activation and effector function by modulating T cell metabolism. To do so, we utilized an ROS scavenging and potent antioxidant manganese metalloporphyrin (MnP). Our results demonstrate that redox modulation during activation regulates the mTOR/AMPK axis by maintaining AMPK activation, resulting in diminished mTOR activation and reduced transition to aerobic glycolysis in diabetogenic splenocytes. These results correlated with decreased Myc and Glut1 upregulation, reduced glucose uptake, and diminished lactate production. In an adoptive transfer model of T1D, animals treated with MnP demonstrated delayed diabetes progression, concurrent with reduced CD4+ T cell activation. Our results demonstrate that ROS are required for driving and sustaining T cell activation-induced metabolic reprogramming, and further support ROS as a target to minimize aberrant immune responses in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2607354784,"Transcriptome-scale data can reveal essential clues into understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms behind specific cellular functions and biological processes. Transcriptomics is a continually growing field of research utilized in biomarker discovery. The transcriptomic profile of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which serve as slow-wave electrical pacemakers for gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscle, has yet to be uncovered. Using copGFP-labeled ICC mice and flow cytometry, we isolated ICC populations from the murine small intestine and colon and obtained their transcriptomes. In analyzing the transcriptome, we identified a unique set of ICC-restricted markers including transcription factors, epigenetic enzymes/regulators, growth factors, receptors, protein kinases/phosphatases, and ion channels/transporters. This analysis provides new and unique insights into the cellular and biological functions of ICC in GI physiology. Additionally, we constructed an interactive ICC genome browser (http://med.unr.edu/physio/transcriptome) based on the UCSC genome database. To our knowledge, this is the first online resource that provides a comprehensive library of all known genetic transcripts expressed in primary ICC. Our genome browser offers a new perspective into the alternative expression of genes in ICC and provides a valuable reference for future functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2606871534,"Algae-inhabiting marine fungi represent a taxonomically and ecologically interesting group of microorganisms still largely neglected, especially in temperate regions. The aim of this study was to isolate and to identify the culturable mycobiota associated with Flabellia petiolata, a green alga frequently retrieved in the Mediterranean basin. Twenty algal thalli were collected from two different sampling sites in the Mediterranean Sea (Elba Island, Italy). A polyphasic approach showed the presence of a relevant alga-associated mycobiota with 64 taxa identified. The fungal isolates belonged mainly to Ascomycota (61 taxa), while only three Basidiomycota were detected. The phylogenetic position of sterile mycelia and cryptic taxa, inferred on the basis of LSU partial region, highlighted the presence of putative new phylogenetic lineages within Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes. This work represents the first quali-quantitative analysis of the culturable mycobiota associated to a green alga in the Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2605479547,"The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is the key pest of citrus wherever it occurs due to its role as vector of huanglongbing (HLB) also known as citrus greening disease. Insecticidal vector control is considered to be the primary strategy for HLB management and is typically intense owing to the severity of this disease. While this approach slows spread and also decreases severity of HLB once the disease is established, economic viability of increasingly frequent sprays is uncertain. Lacking until now were studies evaluating the optimum frequency of insecticide applications to mature trees during the growing season under conditions of high HLB incidence. We related different degrees of insecticide control with ACP abundance and ultimately, with HLB-associated yield losses in two four-year replicated experiments conducted in commercial groves of mature orange trees under high HLB incidence. Decisions on insecticide applications directed at ACP were made by project managers and confined to designated plots according to experimental design. All operational costs as well as production benefits were taken into account for economic analysis. The relationship between management costs, ACP abundance and HLB-associated economic losses based on current prices for process oranges was used to determine the optimum frequency and timing for insecticide applications during the growing season. Trees under the most intensive insecticidal control harbored fewest ACP resulting in greatest yields. The relationship between vector densities and yield loss was significant but differed between the two test orchards, possibly due to varying initial HLB infection levels, ACP populations or cultivar response. Based on these relationships, treatment thresholds during the growing season were obtained as a function of application costs, juice market prices and ACP densities. A conservative threshold for mature trees with high incidence of HLB would help maintain economic viability by reducing excessive insecticide sprays, thereby leaving more room for non-aggressive management tools such as biological control."
https://openalex.org/W2606941214,"University scientists conducting research on topics of potential health concern often want to partner with a range of actors, including government entities, non-governmental organizations, and private enterprises. Such partnerships can provide access to needed resources, including funding. However, those who observe the results of such partnerships may judge those results based on who is involved. This set of studies seeks to assess how people perceive two hypothetical health science research collaborations. In doing so, it also tests the utility of using procedural justice concepts to assess perceptions of research legitimacy as a theoretical way to investigate conflict of interest perceptions. Findings show that including an industry collaborator has clear negative repercussions for how people see a research partnership and that these perceptions shape people’s willingness to see the research as a legitimate source of knowledge. Additional research aimed at further communicating procedures that might mitigate the impact of industry collaboration is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2605658575,"The NEET proteins mitoNEET (mNT) and nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1) are required for cancer cell proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress. NAF-1 and mNT are also implicated in a number of other human pathologies including diabetes, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease, as well as in development, differentiation and aging. Previous studies suggested that mNT and NAF-1 could function in the same pathway in mammalian cells, preventing the over-accumulation of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether these two proteins directly interact in cells, and how they mediate their function. Here we demonstrate, using yeast two-hybrid, in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), direct coupling analysis (DCA), RNA-sequencing, ROS and iron imaging, and single and double shRNA lines with suppressed mNT, NAF-1 and mNT/NAF-1 expression, that mNT and NAF-1 directly interact in mammalian cells and could function in the same cellular pathway. We further show using an in vitro cluster transfer assay that mNT can transfer its clusters to NAF-1. Our study highlights the possibility that mNT and NAF-1 function as part of an iron-sulfur (2Fe-2S) cluster relay to maintain the levels of iron and Fe-S clusters under control in the mitochondria of mammalian cells, thereby preventing the activation of apoptosis and/or autophagy and supporting cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2606204707,"Root-knot nematodes (RKNs, Meloidogyne spp.) are the most damaging plant parasites causing severe losses to crop production. The present study reports genome-wide identification and characterization of both tomato and RKN miRNAs simultaneously from RKN-infected susceptible tomato roots using high-throughput sequencing technique. RNAseq data from 11 small RNA libraries derived from 5 disease development stages identified 281 novel miRNAs of tomato in addition to 52 conserved and 4 variants of conserved miRNAs. Additionally, the same set of RNAseq data identified 38 conserved and 290 novel RKN miRNAs. Both tomato and RKN miRNAs showed differential expression at 5 stages of disease development based on digital expression profiles. In tomato, further validation through qRT-PCR confirmed that majority of miRNAs were significantly upregulated during susceptible response whereas downregulated during resistance response. The predicted targets of 8 conserved and 1 novel miRNAs were validated through 5’RLM-RACE. A negative correlation between expression profiles of a few conserved miRNAs (miR156, miR159, miR164 and miR396) and their targets (SBP, GAMYB-like, NAC and GRF1 transcription factor) was confirmed. A novel Sly_miRNA996 also showed a negative correlation with its target MYB-like transcription factor. These results indicate that the conserved and novel tomato miRNAs are involved in regulating developmental changes in host root during RKN infection. In RKN, the targets of conserved miRNAs were also predicted and a few of their predicted target genes are known to be involved in nematode parasitism. Further, the potential roles of both tomato and RKN miRNAs have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2607336371,"Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal ectasia linked to thinning of the central cornea. Hard contact lenses, rigid gas permeable lenses, and scleral lenses are the primary treatment modalities for early to mid- stages of KC to correct refractive error and astigmatism that develops as a result of an irregular corneal structure. These treatments are associated with significant drawbacks, including reduced availability of the tear film and oxygen to the corneal epithelium and stroma. However, it remains unknown whether hypoxia affects corneal integrity in the KC pathobiology. A number of studies have associated elevated oxidative stress with KC both in vitro and ex vivo. We hypothesized that KC-derived corneal fibroblasts are more susceptible to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress compared to healthy controls leading to exacerbation of corneal thinning in KC. This study investigated the effects of hypoxia on ECM secretion, assembly, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in human corneal fibroblasts from healthy controls (HCFs) and KC patients (HKCs) in vitro. HCFs and HKCs were cultured in 3D constructs for 3 weeks and maintained or transferred to normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions, respectively, for 1 additional week. At the 4 week time-point, constructs were isolated and probed for Collagen I, III, and V, keratocan and MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and -13, as well as hypoxia markers, hypoxia inducible factor-1α and lactoferrin. Conditioned media was also collected and probed for Collagen I, III, and V by Western blot. Thickness of the ECM assembled by HCFs and HKCs was measured using immunofluorescence microscopy. Results showed that hypoxia significantly reduced Collagen I secretion in HKCs, as well as upregulated the expression of MMP-1 and -2 with no significant effects on MMP-3, -9, or -13. ECM thickness was reduced in both cell types following 1 week in a low oxygen environment. Our study shows that hypoxia influences collagen and MMP expression by HKCs, which may have consequential effects on ECM structure in the context of KC."

Methods An observational retrospective study was performed at Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Recife, Brazil. 103 infants with presumed congenital Zika syndrome. All infants had microcephaly and head computed tomography findings compatible with congenital Zika syndrome. Zika IgM antibody was detected in cerebrospinal fluid samples of 23 infants. In 80 infants, the test was not performed because it was not available at that time. All infants had negative serology for HIV, syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis. A complete transthoracic two-dimensional, M-mode, continuous wave and pulsed wave Doppler and color Doppler echocardiographic (PHILIPS HD11XE or HD15) examination was performed on all infants. Results 14/103 (13.5%) echocardiograms were compatible with congenital heart disease: 5 with an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, 8 had a hemodynamically insignificant small apical muscular ventricular septal defect and one infant with dyspnea had a large membranous ventricular septal defect. The echocardiograms considered normal included 45 infants with a persistent foramen ovale and 16 with a minimum patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions Preliminarily this study suggests that congenital Zika syndrome may be associated with an increase prevalence of congenital heart disease. However the types of defects noted were septal defects, a proportion of which would not be hemodynamically significant."

Three years of medical records related to suicide attempters (N = 666) who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. Of the sample, 69.2% were female, 30.8% male; 63.8% Chinese, 15.8% Indian, and 15.0% Malay. Indians were over-represented in this sample, as compared with the ethnic distribution in the general population. Ages ranged from 10 to 85 years old (M = 29.7, SD = 16.1). Ethnic differences were found in risk and protective factors, and perceived lethality of suicide attempts. All available variables were subjected to regression analyses for Chinese, Indian and Malay attempters to arrive at parsimonious models for prediction of perceived lethality. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in assessment of suicide risk and primary prevention for the multiethnic society in Singapore."
https://openalex.org/W2605949011,"This study assessed the occurrence of indicators for suboptimal biologic therapy among ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients over time in the United States (US). Data from a large US claims database (2005-2013) were used to retrospectively identify patients with diagnosed with either UC or CD who were new biologic users. Indicators of suboptimal biologic therapy included: dose escalation during the maintenance phase, discontinuation of the initial biologic, switch to another biologic within 90 days following the last day of supply of the initial biologic, augmentation with a non-biologic systemic therapy, UC- or CD-related surgery, UC- or CD-related urgent care, and development of fistula (for CD only). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used. A total of 1,699 UC and 4,569 CD patients were included. Among UC patients, 51.1% and 90.9% experienced ≥1 indicator of suboptimal biologic therapy within 6 months and 36 months of biologic therapy initiation, respectively. Among CD patients, 54.3% and 91.4% experienced ≥1 indicator of suboptimal biologic therapy within 6 and 36 months of biologic therapy initiation, respectively. For both UC and CD patients, the most frequent indicators of suboptimal biologic therapy were discontinuation, dose escalation and augmentation. In conclusion, this study found that the occurrence of suboptimal biologic therapy is common among patients with UC and CD, with approximately 90% of patients experiencing at least one indicator of suboptimal biologic therapy within 36 months of biologic treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2606589240,"Disruption of nuclear receptors, a transcription factor superfamily regulating gene expression in animals, is one proposed mechanism through which pollution causes effects in aquatic invertebrates. Environmental pollutants have the ability to interfere with the receptor’s functions through direct binding and inducing incorrect signals. Limited knowledge of invertebrate endocrinology and molecular regulatory mechanisms, however, impede the understanding of endocrine disruptive effects in many aquatic invertebrate species. Here, we isolated three nuclear receptors of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas: two isoforms of the retinoid X receptor, CgRXR-1 and CgRXR-2, a retinoic acid receptor ortholog CgRAR, and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ortholog CgPPAR. Computer modelling of the receptors based on 3D crystal structures of human proteins was used to predict each receptor’s ability to bind to different ligands in silico. CgRXR showed high potential to bind and be activated by 9-cis retinoic acid and the organotin tributyltin (TBT). Computer modelling of CgRAR revealed six residues in the ligand binding domain, which prevent the successful interaction with natural and synthetic retinoid ligands. This supports an existing theory of loss of retinoid binding in molluscan RARs. Modelling of CgPPAR was less reliable due to high discrepancies in sequence to its human ortholog. Yet, there are suggestions of binding to TBT, but not to rosiglitazone. The effect of potential receptor ligands on early oyster development was assessed after 24h of chemical exposure. TBT oxide (0.2μg/l), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (0.06 mg/L) and perfluorooctanoic acid (20 mg/L) showed high effects on development (>74% abnormal developed D-shelled larvae), while rosiglitazone (40 mg/L) showed no effect. The results are discussed in relation to a putative direct (TBT) disruption effect on nuclear receptors. The inability of direct binding of ATRA to CgRAR suggests either a disruptive effect through a pathway excluding nuclear receptors or an indirect interaction. Our findings provide valuable information on potential mechanisms of molluscan nuclear receptors and the effects of environmental pollution on aquatic invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2607277383,"Along with global climate change, the occurrence of extreme droughts in recent years has had a serious impact on the Amazon region. Current studies on the driving factors of the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts has focused on the influence of precipitation, whereas the impacts of temperature and radiation have received less attention. This study aims to explore the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation decline during the extreme droughts using vegetation index, precipitation, temperature and radiation datasets. First, time-lag effects of Amazonian vegetation responses to precipitation, radiation and temperature were analyzed. Then, a multiple linear regression model was established to estimate the contributions of climatic factors to vegetation greenness, from which the dominant climate-driving factors were determined. Finally, the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation greenness decline during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were explored. The results showed that (i) in the Amazon vegetation greenness responded to precipitation, radiation and temperature, with apparent time lags for most averaging interval periods associated with vegetation index responses of 0-4, 0-9 and 0-6 months, respectively; (ii) on average, the three climatic factors without time lags explained 27.28±21.73% (mean±1 SD) of vegetation index variation in the Amazon basin, and this value increased by 12.22% and reached 39.50±27.85% when time lags were considered; (iii) vegetation greenness in this region in non-drought years was primarily affected by precipitation and shortwave radiation, and these two factors altogether accounted for 93.47% of the total explanation; and (iv) in the common epicenter of the two droughts, pixels with a significant variation in precipitation, radiation and temperature accounted for 36.68%, 40.07% and 10.40%, respectively, of all pixels showing a significant decrease in vegetation index in 2005, and 15.69%, 2.01% and 45.25% in 2010, respectively. Overall, vegetation greenness declines during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were adversely influenced by precipitation, radiation and temperature; this study provides evidence of the influence of multiple climatic factors on vegetation during the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts."

The aims of this study were to characterize the clinical and radiological features associated with small bowel volvulus and treatment and to identify risk factors for associated small bowel necrosis.Patients with small bowel volvulus who underwent operations from January 2001 to December 2015 at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University (Shenyang, China) were reviewed. Clinical, surgical and postsurgical data were registered and analyzed.Thirty-one patients were included for analysis. Fifteen patients were female (48.4%), with an average age of 47.7 years (18-79 years). The clinical signs and symptoms were unspecific and resembled intestinal obstruction. Clinical examination revealed abdominal distension and/or diffuse tenderness with or without signs of peritonitis. The use of CT scans, X-rays or ultrasound did not differ significantly between patients. In 9 of 20 patients that received abdominal CT scans, ""whirlpool sign"" on the CT scan was present. Secondary small bowel volvulus was present in 58.1% of patients, and causes included bands (3), adhesion (7), congenital anomalies (7) and stromal tumor (1). Out of the 31 patients, 15 with gangrenous small bowel had to undergo intestinal resection. Intestinal gangrene was present with higher neutrophils count (p<0.0001) and the presence of bloody ascites (p = 0.004). Three patients died of septic shock (9.68%), and the recurrence rate was 3.23%.To complete an early and accurate diagnosis, a CT scan plus physical exam seems to be the best plan. After diagnosis, an urgent laparotomy must be performed to avoid intestinal necrosis and perforation. After surgery, more than 90% of the patients can expect to have a favorable prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2606983560,"Cerebral malaria (CM) presents as an encephalopathy and is due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Patients are comatose, often with fever, recurrent seizures and this condition is associated with a high mortality rate. The etiology of the coma and seizures are poorly understood. Circulating small molecules and lipids have bioactive functions and alterations in their concentrations have been implicated in seizure disorders and other forms of encephalopathy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of blood metabolites during CM to explore a biochemical basis of this encephalopathy. A paired metabolomics analysis was performed on the plasma samples of Malawian children (n = 11) during CM and at convalescence thirty days later, to identify differentially abundant molecules associated with CM. We also report plasma molecules associated with CM mortality (n = 4) compared to survival (n = 19). Plasma metabolites were identified through ultra high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to maximize compound detection and accuracy and then compared to a library for identification. We detected a total of 432 small molecules in the plasma and 247 metabolites were significantly differentially abundant between CM and convalescence (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.10). These represented global changes across many classes of molecules including lipids, amino acids and hemoglobin metabolites. We observed significant changes in molecules that could impact neurologic function during CM; these include increased levels of kynurenate and decreased indolepropionate, glutamate, arginine and glutamine. Moreover, 1-methylimidazoleacetate, kyurenate, arachidonic acid and dimethylarginine were associated with mortality (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.2). These results highlight the broad changes in blood chemistry during CM. We have identified metabolites that may impact central nervous system physiology and disease outcomes and can be further explored for their mechanistic roles into the pathophysiology of CM."
https://openalex.org/W2606105944,"The body temperature of cattle varies regularly with both the reproductive cycle and disease status. Establishing an automatic method for monitoring body temperature may facilitate better management of reproduction and disease control in cattle. Here, we developed an Automatic Measurement System for Cattle’s Surface Temperature (AMSCST) to measure the temperature of metatarsus by attaching a special shell designed to fit the anatomy of cattle’s hind leg. Using AMSCST, the surface temperature (ST) on the metatarsus of the hind leg was successively measured during 24 hours a day with an interval of one hour in three tested seasons. Based on ST and rectal temperature (RT) detected by AMSCST and mercury thermometer, respectively, a linear mixed model was established, regarding both the time point and seasonal factors as the fixed effects. Unary linear correlation and Bland-Altman analysis results indicated that the temperatures measured by AMSCST were closely correlated to those measured by mercury thermometer (R2 = 0.998), suggesting that the AMSCST is an accurate and reliable way to detect cattle’s body temperature. Statistical analysis showed that the differences of STs among the three seasons, or among the different time points were significant (P<0.05), and the differences of RTs among the different time points were similarly significant (P<0.05). The prediction accuracy of the mixed model was verified by 10-fold cross validation. The average difference between measured RT and predicted RT was about 0.10 ± 0.10°C with the association coefficient of 0.644, indicating the feasibility of this model in measuring cattle body temperature. Therefore, an automated technology for accurately measuring cattle body temperature was accomplished by inventing an optimal device and establishing the AMSCST system."

https://openalex.org/W2607112223,"Background Liver grafts from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors are increasingly accepted as an extension of the organ pool for transplantation. There is little data on the outcome of liver transplantation with DCD grafts from a pediatric donor. The objective of this study was to assess the outcome of liver transplantation with pediatric DCD grafts and to compare this with the outcome after transplantation of livers from pediatric donation after brain death (DBD) donors. Method All transplantations performed with a liver from a pediatric donor (≤16 years) in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2015 were included. Patient survival, graft survival, and complication rates were compared between DCD and DBD liver transplantation. Results In total, 74 liver transplantations with pediatric grafts were performed; twenty (27%) DCD and 54 (73%) DBD. The median donor warm ischemia time (DWIT) was 24 min (range 15–43 min). Patient survival rate at 10 years was 78% for recipients of DCD grafts and 89% for DBD grafts (p = 0.32). Graft survival rate at 10 years was 65% in recipients of DCD versus 76% in DBD grafts (p = 0.20). If donor livers in this study would have been rejected for transplantation when the DWIT ≥30 min (n = 4), the 10-year graft survival rate would have been 81% after DCD transplantation. The rate of non-anastomotic biliary strictures was 5% in DCD and 4% in DBD grafts (p = 1.00). Other complication rates were also similar between both groups. Conclusions Transplantation of livers from pediatric DCD donors results in good long-term outcome especially when the DWIT is kept ≤30 min. Patient and graft survival rates are not significantly different between recipients of a pediatric DCD or DBD liver. Moreover, the incidence of non-anastomotic biliary strictures after transplantation of pediatric DCD livers is remarkably low."
https://openalex.org/W2606135105,"We recently characterized S426A/S430A mutant mice expressing a desensitization-resistant form of the CB1 receptor. These mice display an enhanced response to endocannabinoids and ∆9-THC. In this study, S426A/S430A mutants were used as a novel model to test whether ethanol consumption, morphine dependence, and reward for these drugs are potentiated in mice with a “hyper-sensitive” form of CB1. Using an unlimited-access, two-bottle choice, voluntary drinking paradigm, S426A/S430A mutants exhibit modestly increased intake and preference for low (6%) but not higher concentrations of ethanol. S426A/S430A mutants and wild-type mice show similar taste preference for sucrose and quinine, exhibit normal sensitivity to the hypothermic and ataxic effects of ethanol, and have normal blood ethanol concentrations following administration of ethanol. S426A/S430A mutants develop robust conditioned place preference for ethanol (2 g/kg), morphine (10 mg/kg), and cocaine (10 mg/kg), demonstrating that drug reward is not changed in S426A/S430A mutants. Precipitated morphine withdrawal is also unchanged in opioid-dependent S426A/S430A mutant mice. Although ethanol consumption is modestly changed by enhanced CB1 signaling, reward, tolerance, and acute sensitivity to ethanol and morphine are normal in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2607101898,"Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the current situation of vancomycin (VAN)-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) in China and identify the risk factors for VA-AKI, as well as to comprehensively examine the risk related to concurrent drug use. Further, we assessed the outcomes of patients who developed VA-AKI and the risk factors for these outcomes. Finally, we aimed to provide suggestions for improving the prevention and treatment of VA-AKI in China. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study of inpatients who had been treated with VAN between January 2013 and December 2013 at Peking University First Hospital. AKI was defined as an increase in SCr of ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours or an increase to ≥1.5 times the baseline certainly or presumably within the past 7 days. VA-AKI was defined as the development of AKI during VAN therapy or within 7 days following the termination of VAN therapy. In addition, we compared patients with NO-AKI, who did not develop AKI during their hospitalization, with those with VA-AKI. Results Of the 934 patients treated with VAN during their hospital stay, 740 were included in this study. Among those excluded, 38.1% (74/194) were excluded because of a lack of data on serum creatinine (SCr). Among the included patients, 120 had confirmed VA-AKI, with an incidence of 16.2% (120/740). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that an elevated baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.009; p = 0.017) and concomitant vasopressor therapy (OR = 2.942; p = 0.009), nitrate use (OR = 2.869; p = 0.007), imipenem-cilastatin treatment (OR = 4.708; p = 0.000), and contrast medium administration (OR = 6.609 p = 0.005) were independent risk factors for VA-AKI; in addition, the receipt of orthopedic/trauma/burn surgery (OR = 0.3575; p = 0.011) and concomitant compound glycyrrhizin use (OR = 0.290; p = 0.017) were independent protective factors for VA-AKI. Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated that among the patients who developed VA-AKI, coronary heart disease (CHD) (OR = 12.6; p = 0.006) and concomitant vasopressor therapy (OR = 15.4; p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for death. We also evaluated the factors influencing improvement of renal function. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CHD (OR = 8.858, p = 0.019) and concomitant contrast medium administration (OR = 9.779, p = 0.005) were independent risk factors and that simultaneous β-blocker treatment (OR = 0.124, p = 0.001) was an independent protective factor for improvement of renal function. Conclusion Patients treated with VAN received insufficient monitoring of SCr and inadequate therapeutic drug monitoring. We recommend that hospitals increase their investment in clinical pharmacists. An elevated baseline eGFR and concomitant vasopressor therapy, nitrate use, imipenem-cilastatin treatment, and contrast medium administration were independent risk factors for VA-AKI; in addition, orthopedic/trauma/burn surgery and concomitant compound glycyrrhizin use were independent protective factors for VA-AKI."

https://openalex.org/W2606195189,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive destruction of articular cartilage. Interleukin (IL)-20 is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated the role of IL-20 in OA and evaluated whether anti-IL-20 antibody (7E) treatment attenuates disease severity in murine models of surgery-induced OA. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect IL-20 and its receptors expression in synovial tissue and cartilage from OA patients, and in OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) and chondrocytes (OACCs) from rodents with surgery-induced OA. RTQ-PCR and western blotting were used to determine IL-20-regulated OA-associated gene expression in OASFs and OACCs. OA rats and OA mice were treated with 7E. Arthritis severity was determined based on the degree of cartilage damage and the arthritis severity score. We found that IL-20 and its receptors were expressed in OASFs and OACCs. IL-20 induced TNF-α, IL-1β, MMP-1, and MMP-13 expression by activating ERK-1/2 and JNK signals in OASFs. IL-20 not only upregulated MCP-1, IL-6, MMP-1, and MMP-13 expression, but also downregulated aggrecan, type 2 collagen, TGF-β, and BMP-2 expression in OACCs. Arthritis severity was significantly lower in 7E-treated OA rats, and 7E- or MSC-treated OA mice. Therefore, we concluded that IL-20 was involved in the progression and development of OA through inducing proinflammatory cytokines and OA-associated gene expression in OASFs and OACCs. 7E reduced the severity of arthritis in murine models of surgery-induced OA. Our findings provide evidence that IL-20 is a novel target and that 7E is a potential therapeutic agent for OA."
https://openalex.org/W2606242832,"To introduce a fully-automated algorithm for the detection of small cortical interruptions (≥0.246mm in diameter) on high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) images, and to investigate the additional value of manual correction of the automatically obtained contours (semi-automated procedure).Ten metacarpophalangeal joints from seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and three healthy controls were imaged with HR-pQCT. The images were evaluated by an algorithm according to the fully- and semi-automated procedure for the number and surface of interruptions per joint. Reliability between the fully- and semi-automated procedure and between two independent operators was tested using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the proportion of matching interruptions. Validity of single interruptions detected was tested by comparing it to visual scoring, as gold standard. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity were calculated.The median number of interruptions per joint was 14 (range 2 to 59) and did not significantly differ between the fully- and semi-automated procedure (p = 0.37). The median interruption surface per joint was significantly higher with the fully- vs. semi-automated procedure (respectively, 8.6mm2 vs. 5.8mm2 and 6.1mm2, p = 0.01). Reliability was almost perfect between the fully- and semi-automated procedure for both the number and surface of interruptions (ICC≥0.95) and the proportion of matching interruptions was high (≥76%). Also the inter-operator reliability was almost perfect (ICC≥0.97, proportion of matching interruptions 92%). The PPV ranged from 27.6% to 29.9%, and sensitivity from 69.7% to 76.3%. Most interruptions detected with the algorithm, did show an interruption on a 2D grayscale image. However, this interruption did not meet the criteria of an interruption with visual scoring.The algorithm for HR-pQCT images detects cortical interruptions, and its interruption surface. Reliability and validity was comparable for the fully- and semi-automated procedures. However, we advise the use of the semi-automated procedure to assure quality. The algorithm is a promising tool for a sensitive and objective assessment of cortical interruptions in finger joints assessed by HR-pQCT."
https://openalex.org/W2605612469,"The identification of animal preferences is assumed to provide better rearing environments for the animals in question. Preference tests focus on the frequency of approaches or the time an animal spends in proximity to each item of the investigated resource during a multiple-choice trial. Recently, a preference index (PI) was proposed to differentiate animal preferences from momentary responses (Sci Rep, 2016, 6:28328, DOI: 10.1038/srep28328). This index also quantifies the degree of preference for each item. Each choice response is also weighted, with the most recent responses weighted more heavily, but the index includes the entire bank of tests, and thus represents a history-based approach. In this study, we compared this PI to motivation tests, which consider how much effort is expended to access a resource. We performed choice tests over 7 consecutive days for 34 Nile tilapia fish that presented with different colored compartments in each test. We first detected the preferred and non-preferred colors of each fish using the PI and then tested their motivation to reach these compartments. We found that fish preferences varied individually, but the results were consistent with the motivation profiles, as individual fish were more motivated (the number of touches made on transparent, hinged doors that prevented access to the resource) to access their preferred items. On average, most of the 34 fish avoided the color yellow and showed less motivation to reach yellow and red colors. The fish also exhibited greater motivation to access blue and green colors (the most preferred colors). These results corroborate the PI as a reliable tool for the identification of animal preferences. We recommend this index to animal keepers and researchers to identify an animal’s preferred conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2606714306,"Background Oxygen supply as a lifesaving intervention is frequently used to treat preterm infants suffering additionally from possible prenatal or perinatal pathogen features. The impact of oxygen and/or physical lung injury may influence the morphological lung development, leading to a chronic postnatal lung disease called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). At present different experimental BPD models are used. However, there are no systematic comparative studies regarding different influences of oxygen on morphological lung maturation. Objective We investigated the influence of prenatal hypoxia and/or postnatal hyperoxia on morphological lung maturation based on stereological parameters, to find out which model best reflects morphological changes in lung development comparable with alterations found in BPD. Methods Pregnant mice were exposed to normoxia, the offspring to normoxia (No/No) or to hyperoxia (No/Hyper). Furthermore, pregnant mice were exposed to hypoxia and the offspring to normoxia (Hypo/No) or to hyperoxia (Hypo/Hyper). Stereological investigations were performed on all pups at 14 days after birth. Results Compared to controls (No/No) 1) the lung volume was significantly reduced in the No/Hyper and Hypo/Hyper groups, 2) the volume weighted mean volume of the parenchymal airspaces was significantly higher in the Hypo/Hyper group, 3) the total air space volume was significantly lower in the No/Hyper and Hypo/Hyper groups, 4) the total septal surface showed significantly lower values in the No/Hyper and Hypo/Hyper groups, 5) the wall thickness of septa showed the highest values in the Hypo/Hyper group without reaching significance, 6) the volume density and the volume weighted mean volume of lamellar bodies in alveolar epithelial cells type II (AEII) were significantly lower in the Hypo/Hyper group. Conclusion Prenatal hypoxia and postnatal hyperoxia differentially influence the maturation of lung parenchyma. In 14 day old mice a significant retardation of morphological lung development leading to BPD-like alterations indicated by different parameters was only seen after hypoxia and hyperoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2607045925,"The ability to accurately detect and analyze rare cells in a cell population is critical not only for the study of disease progression but also for next flow cytometry systems in clinical application. Here, we report the development of a prototype device, the ‘Rare cell sorter’, for isolating and recovering single rare cells from whole blood samples. On this device, we utilized an open-channel microfluidic chip for rare cell isolation. And the advantage of open-channel allows us to recover the isolated rare cell directly from the chip. We set the circulating tumor cell (CTC) as a target cell. For the clinical experiment, CTCs were isolated from blood samples collected from patients with metastatic breast cancer and healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference in the number of CTCs between the patients with metastatic breast cancer and healthy volunteers. To evaluate the damage to cells during isolation and recovery, we performed an RNA integrity assay using RNA extracted from CTCs recovered from the chip and found that our process for single CTC isolation and recovery is mild enough for gene analysis of CTCs."
https://openalex.org/W2607181388,"Barbering, where a ""barber"" mouse plucks hair from its cagemates or itself, is both a spontaneously occurring abnormal behavior in mice and a well validated model of Trichotillomania (TTM). N-Acetylcysteine, (NAC) a cysteine derived food additive, is remarkably effective in treating TTM patients, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), also known as free radicals, form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen. Under normal circumstances, cells are able to defend themselves against ROS damage with antioxidant pathways. NAC is the precursor to the main antioxidant produced to defend the brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that barbering is a disease of oxidative stress, whereby ROS and/or a failure of antioxidant defenses leads to neuronal damage that induces barbering in susceptible animals. We tested this hypothesis in 32 female C57BL/6J mice by treating half with 1g/kg BW/day of NAC in their diet, and testing for protection against developing barbering behavior and curing of barbering behavior, and simultaneously testing for a panel of biomarkers of oxidative stress. NAC reduced the chance that mice would be barbers, and this effect did not differ between healthy (i.e. prevention) and affected animals (i.e. cure). Barbering animals had elevated urinary antioxidant capacity, indicative of oxidative stress, at all timepoints. Additionally, after treatment the risk of barbering increased with decreasing hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, and with increasing glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels, further indicating that barbering mice were under oxidative stress regardless of treatment with NAC. We did not find compelling evidence that urinary total antioxidant capacity, or urinary 8-OHdG, could predict response to NAC treatment. We conclude that NAC is effective in preventing and/or curing barbering at least in part by promoting GSH synthesis, thereby preventing oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2605431130,"Widespread overuse of the herbicide glyphosate, the active ingredient in RoundUp®, has led to the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes, some of which persist by overproducing the herbicide's target enzyme, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). EPSPS is a key enzyme in the shikimic acid pathway for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, lignin, and defensive compounds, but little is known about how overproducing EPSPS affects downstream metabolites, growth, or lifetime fitness in the absence of glyphosate. We are using Arabidopsis as a model system for investigating phenotypic effects of overproducing EPSPS, thereby avoiding confounding effects of genetic background or other mechanisms of herbicide resistance in agricultural weeds. Here, we report results from the first stage of this project. We designed a binary vector expressing a native EPSPS gene from Arabidopsis under control of the CaMV35S promoter (labelled OX, for over-expression). For both OX and the empty vector (labelled EV), we obtained nine independent T3 lines. Subsets of these lines were used to characterize glyphosate resistance in greenhouse experiments. Seven of the nine OX lines exhibited enhanced glyphosate resistance when compared to EV and wild-type control lines, and one of these was discarded due to severe deformities. The remaining six OX lines exhibited enhanced EPSPS gene expression and glyphosate resistance compared to controls. Glyphosate resistance was correlated with the degree of EPSPS over-expression for both vegetative and flowering plants, indicating that glyphosate resistance can be used as a surrogate for EPSPS expression levels in this system. These findings set the stage for examination of the effects of EPSPS over-expression on fitness-related traits in the absence of glyphosate. We invite other investigators to contact us if they wish to study gene expression, downstream metabolic effects, and other questions with these particular lines."
https://openalex.org/W2606238573,"Previous studies have indicated that hepcidin, which can regulate iron efflux by binding to ferroportin-1 (FPN1) and inducing its internalization and degradation, acts as the critical factor in the regulation of iron metabolism. However, it is unknown whether hepcidin is involved in acute renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). In this study, an IRI rat model was established via right renal excision and blood interruption for 45 min in the left kidney, and iron metabolism indexes were examined to investigate the change in iron metabolism and to analyze the role of hepcidin during IRI. From 1 to 24 h after renal reperfusion, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were found to be time-dependently increased with different degrees of kidney injury. Regular variations in iron metabolism indexes in the blood and kidneys were observed in renal IRI. Renal iron content, serum iron and serum ferritin increased early after reperfusion and then declined. Hepcidin expression in the liver significantly increased early after reperfusion, and its serum concentration increased beginning at 8 h after reperfusion. The splenic iron content decreased significantly in the early stage after reperfusion and then increased time-dependently with increasing reperfusion time, and the hepatic iron content showed a decrease in the early stage after reperfusion. The early decrease of the splenic iron content and hepatic iron content might indicate their contribution to the increase in serum iron in renal IRI. In addition, the duodenal iron content showed time-dependently decreased since 12 h after reperfusion in the IRI groups compared to the control group. Along with the spleen, the duodenum might contribute to the decrease in serum iron in the later stage after reperfusion. The changes in iron metabolism indexes observed in our study demonstrate an iron metabolism disorder in renal IRI, and hepcidin might be involved in maintaining iron homeostasis in renal IRI. These findings might suggest a self-protection mechanism regulating iron homeostasis in IRI and provide a new perspective on iron metabolism in attenuating renal IRI."
https://openalex.org/W2606940383,"Introduction Attractive Toxic Sugar Baits (ATSB) is a new vector control method that meets Integrated Vector Management (IVM) goals. In an experimental design, this study aimed to determine effects of ATSB on control of Phlebotomus papatasi, as a main vector of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL), in Qom Province, center of Iran. Methods In a cross-sectional design, boric acid was mixed with brown sugar solution and tested as toxic baits for P. papatasi. Two methods were utilized to use the baits: (a) spraying ATSB on vegetation, bushes, and shrubs; and (b) setting ATSB-treated barrier fences in front of colonies at 500 m distance from the houses in outskirts of villages. In order to examine the residual efficacy rate of ATSB-treated barrier fences, the bioassay test was used. Density of P. papatasi sandflies was measured using sticky and light traps biweekly. For data analysis, Mann-Whitney U Test and Kruskal-Wallis were used. Results ATSB-treated barrier fences led to 3 times reduction in P. papatasi population. Besides that, ATSB spraying on plants led to more than 5 times reduction in P. papatasi population. Conclusions Comparing the incidence of leishmaniasis in treated villages before and after the study showed that the incidence was statistically reduced. Therefore, ATSB is an effective method to control vectors and prevent leishmaniasis."

Sliding contact is often characterized experimentally via the standard ASTM D4172 four-ball test, and these tests were conducted for varying times ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour, as well as at varying temperatures and loads. A numerical model was developed to simulate the evolution of wear in the elastohydrodynamic regime. This model uses the results of a Monte Carlo study to develop novel empirical equations for wear rate as a function of asperity height and lubricant thickness; these equations closely represented the experimental data and successfully modeled the sliding contact."
https://openalex.org/W2606727537,"Background Hepatitis A (HAV) and E (HEV) viruses are responsible for enterically transmitted hepatitis. Tunisia is reported to be of intermediate endemicity for HAV and of low seroprevalence for HEV; however, data from rural areas of South Tunisia are lacking. Methods Sera from 216 asymptomatic pregnant women and from 92 patients with acute hepatitis were collected between October 2014 and November 2015. Total and IgM anti-HAV immunoglobulins and anti-HEV IgG and IgM were investigated. Anti-HAV IgM-positive samples were subjected to RT-PCR targeting the VP1/2A region and sequenced. HEV IgM positive samples and all samples from acute hepatitis patients were assessed for HEV RNA. Results Among pregnant women (mean age 32+/-8), HAV seroprevalence was 98.6%, none presented anti-HAV IgM; HEV seroprevalence was 5.1% and three presented weakly reactive anti-HEV IgM without detectable RNA. Among acute hepatitis patients (mean age 18.5 +/- 14), HEV seroprevalence was 19,5%, none presented anti-HEV IgM, nor HEV RNA. HAV seroprevalence exceeded 90% by age 5 and acute HAV infection was detected in 20 patients (21,7%), younger than patients with other hepatitis causes (9,8 years vs. 20,4 years, p = 0,004); 65% were male. Most acute HAV infections were observed in a coastal area where HAV infections represented 52% of hepatitis etiology. Phylogenetic analysis identified genotype IA strains, clustering close to previously published Tunisian sequences. Conclusion The present study confirmed a low HEV endemicity and evidenced a still high level of HAV circulation in Southern Tunisia, suggesting distinct dissemination patterns for these viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2606737908,"Knockout of metallothionein (MT) genes contributes to a heavier body weight in early life and the potential to become obese through the intake of a high fat diet (HFD) in mice. It has thus been suggested that MT genes regulate the formation of adipose tissue, which would become the base for later HFD-induced obesity. We evaluated the fat pads of mice during the lactation stage. The fat mass and adipocyte size of MT1 and MT2 knockout mice were greater than those of wild type mice. Next, we assayed the ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence MT genes in the 3T3-L1 cell line. The expressions of MT1 and MT2 genes were transiently upregulated during adipocyte differentiation, and the siRNA pretreatment led to the suppression of the expression of both MT mRNAs and proteins. The MT siRNA promoted lipid accumulation in adipocytes and caused proliferation of post-confluent preadipocytes; these effects were suppressed by an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002). In addition, MT siRNA promoted insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream kinase of the insulin signaling pathway. Enhanced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells resulting from MT-gene silencing was inhibited by pretreatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, used as a substitute for antioxidant protein MTs. These results suggest that interference in MT expression enhanced the activation of the insulin signaling pathway, resulting in higher lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2605998812,"The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified red meat as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" (Group 2A). In mechanistic studies exploring the link between intake of red meat and CRC, heme iron, the pigment of red meat, is proposed to play a central role as a catalyzer of luminal lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity. In the present work, the novel A/J Min/+ mouse was used to investigate the effects of dietary beef, pork, chicken, or salmon (40% muscle food (dry weight) and 60% powder diet) on Apc-driven intestinal carcinogenesis, from week 3-13 of age. Muscle food diets did not differentially affect carcinogenesis in the colon (flat ACF and tumors). In the small intestine, salmon intake resulted in a lower tumor size and load than did meat from terrestrial animals (beef, pork or chicken), while no differences were observed between the effects of white meat (chicken) and red meat (pork and beef). Additional results indicated that intestinal carcinogenesis was not related to dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, intestinal formation of lipid peroxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), or cytotoxic effects of fecal water on Apc-/+ cells. Notably, the amount of heme reaching the colon appeared to be relatively low in this study. The greatest tumor load was induced by the reference diet RM1, underlining the importance of the basic diets in experimental CRC. The present study in A/J Min/+ mice does not support the hypothesis of a role of red meat in intestinal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2607085848,"Wounds causing extensive injury loss of muscle, also known as volumetric muscle loss (VML), are frequently associated with high-energy civilian trauma and combat-related extremity injuries. Currently, no effective clinical therapy is available for promoting de novo muscle tissue regeneration to restore muscle function following VML. Recent studies have shown evidence that osteoactivin (OA), a transmembrane glycoprotein, has the ability to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy in response to denervation. Therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the potential regenerative effect of OA embedded and delivered via a cross-linked gelatin hydrogel within a volumetric tibialis anterior muscle defect in a rat model. After 4 weeks, however, no evidence for muscle formation was found in defects treated with either low (5 μg/ml) or high (50 μg/ml) OA. It is possible that a different delivery scaffold, delivery kinetics, or OA concentration may have yielded an alternate outcome, or it is also possible that the spaciostructural environment of VML, or the local (versus systemic) delivery of OA, simply does not support any potential regenerative activity of OA in VML. Together with prior work, this study demonstrates that an efficacious and scalable therapy for regenerating muscle volume and function in VML remains a veritable clinical challenge worthy of continued future research efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2606009302,"Cushion formation is the initial step for the development of valvuloseptal structures in mammalian hearts. TGFβ signaling plays critical roles in multiple steps of cushion morphogenesis. We used a newly developed conditional immortal atrioventricular cushion mesenchymal cell line, tsA58-AVM, to identify the TGFβ regulatory target genes through microarray analysis. Expression of ~1350 genes was significantly altered by TGFβ1 treatment. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis of TGFβ activated genes revealed that PDGF-BB signaling is the top hit as the potential upstream regulator. Among the 37 target molecules, 10 genes known to be involved in valve development and hemostasis were selected for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Our results confirmed that they are all upregulated by TGFβ1 stimulation in tsA58-AVM cells and in primary atrioventricular cushion cells. We focused on examining regulation of Pdgfrb by TGFβ1, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for PDGF-BB. We found that the ~150bp Pdgfrb promoter can respond to TGFβ stimulation and that this response relies on the two SP1 binding sites within the promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed SP1 interacts with SMAD2 in a TGFβ-dependent fashion. Furthermore, SMAD2 is associated with the Pdgfrb promoter and this association is diminished by knocking down expression of Sp1. Our data therefore collectively suggest that upon TGFβ stimulation, SP1 recruits SMAD2 to the promoter of Pdgfrb to up-regulate its expression and thus Pdgfrb is a direct downstream target of the TGFβ/SMAD2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2606034815,"Background Access to highly specialized health care services and support to meet the patient’s specific needs is critical for health outcome, especially during age-related transitions within the health care system such as with adolescents entering adult medicine. Being affected by an orphan disease complicates the situation in several important respects. Long distances to dedicated institutions and scarcity of knowledge, even among medical doctors, may present major obstacles for proper access to health care services and health chances. This study is part of the BMBF funded TransCareO project examining in a mixed-method design health care provisional deficits, preferences, and barriers in health care access as perceived by female adolescents affected by the Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS), a rare (orphan) genital malformation. Methods Prior to a communicative validation workshop, critical elements of MRKHS related care and support (items) were identified in interviews with MRKHS patients. During the subsequent workshop, 87 persons involved in health care and support for MRKHS were asked to rate the items using a 7-point Likert scale (7, strongly agree; 1, strongly disagree) as to 1) the elements’ potential importance (i.e., health care expected to be “best practice”, or priority) and 2) the presently experienced care. A gap score between the two was computed highlighting fields of action. Items were arranged into ten separate questionnaires representing domains of care and support (e.g., online-portal, patient participation). Within each domain, several items addressed various aspects of “information” and “access”. Here, we present the outcome of items’ evaluation by patients (attended, NPAT = 35; respondents, NRESP = 19). Results Highest priority scores occurred for domains “Online-Portal”, “Patient participation”, and “Tailored informational offers”, characterizing them as extremely important for the perception as best practice. Highest gap scores yielded domains “Tailored informational offers”, reflecting perceived lack of disease-related information for affected persons, medical experts, and health insurance companies, “Online-Portal” (with limited information available on specialist clinics and specialized doctors), and regarding insufficient support offers (e.g., in school and occupational settings). Conversely, lowest gap scores were found with group offers for MRKHS patients (“Transition programs”) and MRKHS self-help days (“Patient participation”), suggesting satisfaction or good solutions in place. Discussion The importance assigned to disease-related information indicates that informational deficits are perceived by patients as barriers, hindering proper access to health care, especially in an orphan disease. Access to health-related information plays a role for all persons seeking help and care. However, the overwhelmingly high scores attributed to these elements in the context of an orphan disease reveal that here improved information policies are crucial, demanding for institutionalized solutions supported by the health care system. Implications for practice The disparity between experience of care and attribution as best practice detected describes areas of action in all domains involved, highlighting information related fields. New concepts and structures for health care in orphan diseases could draw upon these patient-oriented results a) regarding orphan-disease specific elements demanding institutionalized reimbursement, b) essential elements for center care and corresponding networks, and c) elements reflecting patients´ participation in the conception of centers for rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2606825836,"Psychological stress is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanism by which stress is associated with CVD is not entirely understood. Although genetic factors are implied in both stress responsivity and cardiovascular reactivity, no studies to date have investigated their interactions with stress for cardiovascular end points. The objective was to elucidate the association and interactions between a genetic risk score (GRS), individual genetic variants and stress for three cardiovascular end points: coronary artery disease (CAD), fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal MI, and cardiovascular death.18,559 participants from the Malmö Diet Cancer Study, a population-based prospective study, were included in the analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used and adjusted for a large number of known predictors of cardiovascular end points. Mean follow-up time in years was 14.6 (CAD; n = 1938), 14.8 (fatal MI; n = 436), 14.8 (non-fatal MI; n = 1108), and 15.1 (cardiovascular death; n = 1071) respectively. GRS was significantly associated with increased risks of CAD (top quartile hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-1.96), fatal MI (top quartile HR, 1.62; 95%CI, 1.23-2.15), non-fatal MI (top quartile HR, 1.55; 95%CI, 1.31-1.84), and cardiovascular death (top quartile HR, 1.29; 95%CI, 1.08-1.53). Stress was not independently associated with any end point and did not interact with GRS. Four individual genetic variants interacted unfavorably with stress for end points with mortality outcomes.A GRS composed of 50 SNPs and predictive of CAD was found for the first time to also strongly predict fatal MI, non-fatal MI and cardiovascular death. A stress-sensitive component of the GRS was isolated on the basis of individual genetic variants that interacted unfavorably with stress."
https://openalex.org/W2607398538,"Improved fertility following artificial insemination with frozen-thawed spermatozoa would offer rabbit producers faster genetic improvement. Previous work investigating cryoprotectants for rabbit spermatozoa have reported inconsistent results. Semen was collected from three rabbit bucks by artificial vagina and frozen using a standard procedure with varied cryodiluent components. Post-thaw analysis encompassed motility, sperm kinematic parameters and acrosome and membrane integrity. Spermatozoa were evaluated at 0, 2 and 4 h after thawing. Experiment 1 compared diluents with 3.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1.5% acetamide, 1.75% DMSO + 0.75% acetamide or 3.5% DMSO + 1.5% acetamide. The treatment that resulted in the highest post-thaw motility (P<0.001) and acrosome integrity (P<0.001) was DMSO alone. Experiment 2 compared 3.5, 7 and 10% DMSO in the cryodiluent. The best post-thaw sperm motility (P<0.001) and linearity (P = .002) was in 3.5% DMSO, while 10% DMSO afforded higher acrosome/membrane integrity at this last time point (P<0.05). Experiment 3 varied the cryodiluent to contain either 9 or 17% egg yolk or 9 or 17% low density lipoproteins extracted from whole egg yolk. The treatment with the best post-thaw result was 17% egg yolk (motility, P = 0.01; acrosome/membrane integrity, P<0.001). Experiment 4 compared different carbohydrates in the cryodiluent; 50 mM glucose (TCG), 25 mM glucose with 25 mM sucrose (TCGS low), or 50 mM glucose with 50 mM sucrose (TCGS high). When data were pooled across time points, TCG had significantly higher motility than TCGS high (P = 0.021), but was not different from TCGS low. However, TCG had fewer spermatozoa with intact acrosomes and membranes than both TCGS low and TCGS high (P = .002). Put together, these results indicate that the best cryodiluent for rabbit spermatozoa frozen under the conditions used in this paper is with 7% DMSO and 17% egg yolk in a base medium containing 25 mM glucose and 25 mM sucrose."
https://openalex.org/W2606009304,"Background Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients have poorer survival and local control with mediastinal node (N2) tumor involvement at resection. Earlier assessment of nodal burden could inform clinical decision-making prior to surgery. This study evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and lymph node volume before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Materials and methods CT imaging of patients with operable LA-NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgical resection was assessed. Clinically involved lymph node stations were identified by FDG-PET or mediastinoscopy. Locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method, concordance index and Cox regression. Results 73 patients with Stage IIIA-IIIB NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection were identified. The median RT dose was 54 Gy and all patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Involved lymph node volume was significantly associated with LRR and OS but not DM on univariate analysis. Additionally, lymph node volume greater than 10.6 cm3 after the completion of preoperative chemoradiation was associated with increased LRR (p<0.001) and decreased OS (p = 0.04). There was no association between nodal volumes and nodal clearance. Conclusion For patients with LA-NSCLC, large volume nodal disease post-chemoradiation is associated with increased risk of locoregional recurrence and decreased survival. Nodal volume can thus be used to further stratify patients within the heterogeneous Stage IIIA-IIIB population and potentially guide clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2606880963,"Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative strains have become prevalent. Previously, no animal model mimicked the clinical course of HBeAg-negative HBV infection. To establish an HBeAg-negative HBV infection model, the 3.2-kb full-length genome of HBeAg-negative HBV was cloned from a clinical sample and then circularized to form covalently closed circular (cccDNA). The resulting cccDNA was introduced into the liver of C57BL/6J mice through hydrodynamic injection. Persistence of the HBeAg-negative infection was monitored at predetermined time points using HBV-specific markers including HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) as well as DNA copies. Throughout the study, pAAV-HBV1.2 was used as a control. In mice injected with HBeAg-negative cccDNA, the HBV infection rate was 100% at the initial stage. HBsAg levels increased up to 1 week, at which point levels peaked and dropped quickly thereafter. In 60% of injected mice, HBsAg and HBcAg persisted for more than 10 weeks. High numbers of HBV DNA copies were detected in the serum and liver. Moreover, cccDNA persisted in the liver tissue of HBeAg-negative mice. In contrast to the pAAV-HBV 1.2 injected mice, no HBeAg was found in mice injected with HBeAg-negative HBV throughout the study period. These results demonstrate the first successful establishment of a model of HBeAg-negative HBV-persistent infection in immunocompetent mice. Compared to pAAV-HBV1.2-injected mice, the infection persistence and levels of serum virological and biochemical markers were approximately equal in the model mice. This model will be useful for mechanistic studies on HBeAg-negative HBV infection and will facilitate the evaluation of new antiviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1608821500,"The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association developed Pooled Cohort equations to estimate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. It is unclear how well the equations predict ASCVD mortality in a nationally representative cohort. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994 and Linked Mortality through 2006 (n = 6,644). Among participants aged 40-79 years without ASCVD at baseline, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the 10-year probability of ASCVD death by sex and race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Mexican American (MA)). We estimated the discrimination and calibration for each sex-race-ethnicity model. We documented 288 ASCVD deaths during 62,335 person years. The Pooled Cohort equations demonstrated moderate to good discrimination for ASCVD mortality, with modified C-statistics of 0.716 (95% CI 0.663-0.770), 0.794 (0.734-0.854), and 0.733 (0.654-0.811) for NHW, NHB and MA men, respectively. The corresponding C-statistics for women were 0.781 (0.718-0.844), 0.702 (0.633-0.771), and 0.789 (CI 0.721-0.857). Modified Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 suggested adequate calibration for NHW, NHB and MA men, and MA women (p-values: 0.128, 0.295, 0.104 and 0.163 respectively). The calibration was inadequate for NHW and NHB women (p<0.05). In this nationally representative cohort, the Pooled Cohort equations performed adequately to predict 10-year ASCVD mortality for NHW and NHB men, and MA population, but not for NHW and NHB women."
https://openalex.org/W2605996890,"We analyzed and integrated transcriptome data from two large studies of lung adenocarcinomas on distinct populations. Our goal was to investigate the variable gene expression alterations between paired tumor-normal tissues and prospectively identify those alterations that can reliably predict lung disease related outcomes across populations.We developed a mixed model that combined the paired tumor-normal RNA-seq from two populations. Alterations in gene expression common to both populations were detected and validated in two independent DNA microarray datasets. A 10-gene prognosis signature was developed through a l1 penalized regression approach and its prognostic value was evaluated in a third independent microarray cohort.Deregulation of apoptosis pathways and increased expression of cell cycle pathways were identified in tumors of both Caucasian and Asian lung adenocarcinoma patients. We demonstrate that a 10-gene biomarker panel can predict prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma in both Caucasians and Asians. Compared to low risk groups, high risk groups showed significantly shorter overall survival time (Caucasian patients data: HR = 3.63, p-value = 0.007; Asian patients data: HR = 3.25, p-value = 0.001).This study uses a statistical framework to detect DEGs between paired tumor and normal tissues that considers variances among patients and ethnicities, which will aid in understanding the common genes and signalling pathways with the largest effect sizes in ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose multifunctional markers for distinguishing tumor from normal tissue and prognosis for both populations studied."
https://openalex.org/W2606179112,"This study addressed the question whether or not social collaboration has an effect on delay discounting, the tendency to prefer sooner but smaller over later but larger delivered rewards. We applied a novel paradigm in which participants executed choices between two gains in an individual and in a dyadic decision-making condition. We observed how participants reached mutual consent via joystick movement coordination and found lower discounting and a higher decisions' efficiency. In order to establish the underlying mechanism for dyadic variation, we further tested whether these differences emerge from social facilitation or inner group interchange."
https://openalex.org/W2607258745,"Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) have been used in clinic for adoptive immunotherapy in a variety of malignant tumors and have improved the prognosis of cancer patients. However, there are individual differences in the CIK cell preparations including the obvious differences in the ratio of effector CIK cells among different cancer patients. Infusion of such heterogeneous immune cell preparation is an important factor that would affect the therapeutic efficacy. We report here the enrichment and expansion of CD8+ cells from CIK cells cultured for one week using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). These enriched CD8+ CIK cells expressed T cell marker CD3 and antigen recognition receptor NKG2D. Phenotypic analysis showed that CD8+ CIK cells contained 32.4% of CD3+ CD56+ natural killer (NK)-like T cells, 23.6% of CD45RO+ CD28+, and 50.5% of CD45RA+ CD27+ memory T cells. In vitro cytotoxic activity assay demonstrated that the enriched CD8+ CIK cells had significant cytotoxic activity against K562 cells and five ovarian cancer cell lines. Intriguingly, CD8+ CIK cells had strong cytotoxic activity against OVCAR3 cells that has weak binding capability to NKG2D. Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OVCAR3 cells expressed HLA-I and OCT4 and Sox2, suggesting that CD8+ CIK cells recognize surface antigen via specific T cell receptor and effectively kill the target cells. The results suggest that transplantation of such in vitro enriched and expanded OCT4-specific CD8+ CIK cells may improve the specific immune defense mechanism against cancer stem cells, providing a novel avenue of cancer stem cell targeted immunotherapy for clinical treatment of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2606438977,"Reference laboratories advise immediate separation and freezing of samples for the assay of proinsulin, which limit its practicability for smaller centres. Following the demonstration that insulin and C-peptide are stable in EDTA at room temperature for at least 24hours, we undertook simple stability studies to establish whether the same might apply to proinsulin.Venous blood samples were drawn from six adult women, some fasting, some not, aliquoted and assayed immediately and after storage at either 4°C or ambient temperature for periods from 2h to 24h.There was no significant variation or difference with storage time or storage condition in either individual or group analysis.Proinsulin appears to be stable at room temperature in EDTA for at least 24h. Immediate separation and storage on ice of samples for proinsulin assay is not necessary, which will simplify sample transport, particularly for multicentre trials."
https://openalex.org/W2605379488,"The observability of the leader robot system and the leader-follower formation control are studied. First, the nonlinear observability is studied for when the leader robot observes landmarks. Second, the system is shown to be completely observable when the leader robot observes two different landmarks. When the leader robot system is observable, multi-robots can rapidly form and maintain a formation based on the bearing-only information that the follower robots observe from the leader robot. Finally, simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed formation control."
https://openalex.org/W2606271487,"Vicious cycles of mutations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation contribute to cancer progression. The use of antioxidants to inhibit ROS generation promotes cytostasis by affecting the mutation cycle and ROS-dependent survival signaling. However, cancer cells select mutations to elevate ROS albeit maintaining mitochondrial hyperpolarization (Δψm), even under hypoxia. From this perspective, the use of drugs that disrupt both ROS generation and Δψm is a viable anticancer strategy. Hence, we studied the effects of mitochondrially targeted carboxy proxyl nitroxide (Mito-CP) and a control ten carbon TPP moiety (Dec-TPP+) in the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Daudi) and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells under hypoxia and normoxia. We found preferential localization, Δψm and adenosine triphosphate loss, and significant cytotoxicity by Mito-CP in Daudi cells alone. Interestingly, ROS levels were decreased and maintained in hypoxic and normoxic cancer cells, respectively, by Mito-CP but not Dec-TPP+, therefore preventing any adaptive signaling. Moreover, dual effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics and ROS by Mito-CP curtailed the cancer survival via Akt inhibition, AMPK-HIF-1α activation and promoted apoptosis via increased BCL2-associated X protein and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression. This dual mode of action by Mito-CP provides a better explanation of the application of antioxidants with specific relevance to cancerous transformation and adaptations in the Daudi cell line."
