https://openalex.org/W3191872972,"COVID-19 caused a significant public health crisis worldwide and triggered some other issues such as economic crisis, job cuts, mental anxiety, etc. This pandemic plies across the world and involves many people not only through the infection but also agitation, stress, fret, fear, repugnance, and poignancy. During this time, social media involvement and interaction increase dynamically and share one’s viewpoint and aspects under those mentioned health crises. From user-generated content on social media, we can analyze the public’s thoughts and sentiments on health status, concerns, panic, and awareness related to COVID-19, which can ultimately assist in developing health intervention strategies and design effective campaigns based on public perceptions. In this work, we scrutinize the users’ sentiment in different time intervals to assist in trending topics in Twitter on the COVID-19 tweets dataset. We also find out the sentimental clusters from the sentiment categories. With the help of comprehensive sentiment dynamics, we investigate different experimental results that exhibit different multifariousness in social media engagement and communication in the pandemic period."
https://openalex.org/W3162555076,"Abstract The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) plays a crucial role in mediating viral entry into host cells. However, whether it contributes to pulmonary hyperinflammation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is not well known. In this study, we developed a spike protein–pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein on the surface and determined the distribution of the Spp lentivirus in wild‐type C57BL/6J male mice that received an intravenous injection of the virus. Lentiviruses with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV‐G) or with a deletion of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein [Spp (∆RBD)] were used as controls. Two hours postinfection (hpi), there were 27‐75 times more viral burden from Spp lentivirus in the lungs than in other organs; there were also about 3‐5 times more viral burden from Spp lentivirus than from VSV‐G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney, and spleen. Deletion of RBD diminished viral loads in the lungs but not in the heart. Acute pneumonia was observed in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in SPC + and LDLR + pneumocytes and macrophages in the lungs. IL6, IL10, CD80, and PPAR‐γ were quickly upregulated in response to infection in the lungs as well as in macrophage‐like RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, forced expression of the spike protein in RAW264.7 cells significantly increased the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors. Our results demonstrated that the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 confers the main point of viral entry into the lungs and can induce cellular pathology. Our data also indicate that an alternative ACE2‐independent viral entry pathway may be recruited in the heart and aorta."
https://openalex.org/W3191463694,"Background During uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively improving people’s health literacy is more important than ever. Drawing knowledge maps of health literacy research through data mining and visualized measurement technology helps systematically present the research status and development trends in global academic circles. Methods This paper uses CiteSpace to carry out a metric analysis of 9,492 health literacy papers included in Web of Science through mapping knowledge domains. First, based on the production theory of scientific knowledge and the data mining of citations, the main bodies (country, institution and author) that produce health literacy knowledge as well as their mutual cooperation (collaboration network) are both clarified. Additionally, based on the quantitative framework of cocitation analysis, this paper introduces the interdisciplinary features, development trends and hot topics of the field. Finally, by using burst detection technology in the literature, it further reveals the research frontiers of health literacy. Results The results of the BC measures of the global health literacy research collaboration network show that the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom are the major forces in the current international collaboration network on health literacy. There are still relatively very few transnational collaborations between Eastern and Western research institutions. Collaborations in public environmental occupational health, health care science services, nursing and health policy services have been active in the past five years. Research topics in health literacy research evolve over time, mental health has been the most active research field in recent years. Conclusions A systematic approach is needed to address the challenges of health literacy, and the network framework of cooperation on health literacy at regional, national and global levels should be strengthened to further promote the application of health literacy research. In the future, we anticipate that this research field will expand in two directions, namely, mental health literacy and eHealth literacy, both of which are closely linked to social development and issues. The results of this study provide references for future applied research in health literacy."
https://openalex.org/W3191714175,"Melatonin pleiotropically regulates physiological events and has a putative regulatory role in the circadian clock desynchrony-mediated Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we investigated perturbations in the hepatic circadian clock gene, and Nrf2-HO-1 oscillations in conditions of high-fat high fructose (HFHF) diet and/or jet lag (JL)-mediated NAFLD. Melatonin treatment (100 µM) to HepG2 cells led to an improvement in oscillatory pattern of clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, and Per) in oleic acid (OA)-induced circadian desynchrony, while Cry, Nrf2, and HO-1 remain oblivious of melatonin treatment that was also validated by circwave analysis. C57BL/6J mice subjected to HFHF and/or JL, and treated with melatonin showed an improvement in the profile of lipid regulatory genes (CPT-1, PPARa, and SREBP-1c), liver function (AST and ALT) and histomorphology of fatty liver. A detailed scrutiny revealed that hepatic mRNA and protein profiles of Bmal1 (at ZT6) and Clock (at ZT12) underwent corrective changes in oscillations, but moderate corrections were recorded in other components of clock genes (Per1, Per2, and Cry2). Melatonin induced changes in oscillations of anti-oxidant genes (Nrf2, HO-1, and Keap1) subtly contributed in the overall improvement in NAFLD recorded herein. Taken together, melatonin induced reprograming of hepatic core clock and Nrf2-HO-1 genes leads to an improvement in HFHF/JL-induced NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3190447244,"We simulated epidemic projections of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a residential university population in the United States under varying combinations of asymptomatic tests (5% to 33% per day), transmission rates (2.5% to 14%), and contact rates (1 to 25), to identify the contact rate threshold that, if exceeded, would lead to exponential growth in infections. Using this, we extracted contact rate thresholds among non-essential workers, population size thresholds in the absence of vaccines, and vaccine coverage thresholds. We further stream-lined our analyses to transmission rates of 5 to 8%, to correspond to the reported levels of face-mask-use/physical-distancing during the 2020 pandemic. Our results suggest that, in the absence of vaccines, testing alone without reducing population size would not be sufficient to control an outbreak. If the population size is lowered to 34% (or 44%) of the actual population size to maintain contact rates at 4 (or 7) among non-essential workers, mass tests at 25% (or 33%) per day would help control an outbreak. With the availability of vaccines, the campus can be kept at full population provided at least 95% are vaccinated. If vaccines are partially available such that the coverage is lower than 95%, keeping at full population would require asymptomatic testing, either mass tests at 25% per day if vaccine coverage is at 63-79%, or mass tests at 33% per day if vaccine coverage is at 53-68%. If vaccine coverage is below 53%, to control an outbreak, in addition to mass tests at 33% per day, it would also require lowering the population size to 90%, 75%, and 60%, if vaccine coverage is at 38-53%, 23-38%, and below 23%, respectively. Threshold estimates from this study, interpolated over the range of transmission rates, can collectively help inform campus level preparedness plans for adoption of face mask/physical-distancing, testing, remote instructions, and personnel scheduling, during non-availability or partial-availability of vaccines, in the event of SARS-Cov2-type disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3189231708,"Ammonia is a pollutant frequently found in aquatic ecosystems. In fish, ammonia can cause physical damage, alter its behaviour, and even cause death. Exposure to ammonia also increases fish physiological stress, which can be measured through biomarkers. In this study, we analysed the effect of sublethal ammonia concentrations on the behaviour and the oxidative stress of Barbus meridionalis that had been pre-exposed to this compound in the wild. Wild-caught fish from a polluted site (pre-exposed fish) and from an unpolluted site (non-pre-exposed fish) were exposed, under experimental conditions, to total ammonia concentrations (TAN) of 0, 1, 5, and 8 mg/L. Swimming activity, feeding behaviour, and oxidative stress response based on biomarkers were analysed. Pre-exposed fish showed both an altered behaviour and an altered oxidative stress response in the control treatment (0 mg/L). Differences in swimming activity were also found as pre-exposed fish swam less. Lower feeding activity (voracity and satiety) and altered response to oxidative stress were also observed at ≥ 1 mg/L TAN. Biomarker results confirmed pre-exposed fish suffer from a reduction in their antioxidant defences and, hence, showed increased oxidative tissue damage. In summary, pre-exposed fish showed more sensitivity to ammonia exposure than fish from a pristine site."
https://openalex.org/W3187744308,"A newly-discovered foot disease of unknown origin in captive European Bison (Bison bonasus) was recently detected at Berne Animal Park. Dermatitis of the interdigital cleft of varying degrees of severity was diagnosed in all animals (n = 10). The aim of this study was to describe the gross and histological lesions of the interdigital cleft found in 10 captive European bison and to identify involved potential pathogens in affected feet using molecular-based methods for Treponema spp., Dichelobacter nodosus and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Lesions were scored according to the degree of gross pathology at limb level. In a single animal, the gross lesions were restricted to focal lesions on the dorsal aspect of the digital skin of each foot (score 1), whereas all other animals showed at least one foot with extended lesions including the interdigital cleft (score 2). The presence of viable spirochaetes was observed in all animals using dark field microscopy. Applying fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) on biopsies, Treponema spp. were identified, infiltrating the skin lesions in varying numbers in nine animals. Nested PCRs for Treponema medium, Treponema phagedenis and Treponema pedis of swab samples showed three positive animals out of ten for the latter two, whereas pooled biopsy samples were positive in all ten animals for at least T. phagedenis (9/10) and/or T. pedis (7/10), while all samples were negative for T. medium. However, none of these Treponema species could be isolated and sequence analysis of the amplified products showed 100% match of 365 base pairs (bp) to Treponema phylotype PT3 and almost full match (530 of 532 bp, 99.6%) to Treponema phylotype PT13. The presence of T. phagedenis, PT3 and PT13 phylotypes was confirmed by FISH analyses. The phylotypes of T. phagedenis were present in all hybridized positive biopsies of Treponema spp., and PT13 and PT3 were less abundant. Neither D. nodosus nor F. necrophorum were detected. The histological Treponema score was mostly mild. Digital dermatitis in captive European Bison is contagious and differs from bovine digital dermatitis, concerning associated pathogens as well as gross appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3188028414,"Serine protease inhibitor-E2 (SERPINE2) is highly expressed in the granulosa cells of growing follicles and the dynamic changes in SERPINE2 expression are correlated with follicular development and ovulation in several mammals, including mice, cattle, sheep, and humans. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their functional receptors are extensively expressed in the ovary and play critical roles in the regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis and luteal function. To date, whether BMPs regulate the expression of SERPINE2 during human follicular development remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BMPs on the regulation of SERPINE2 expression (a major regulator of plasminogen activators [PA]) and the underlying mechanisms using primary and immortalized human granulosa-lutein (hGL) cells. Our results demonstrated that these BMPs (BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP15) induced differential upregulation of SERPINE2 expression. In this regard, BMP2 is the major modulator that has the best cellular activity, which further decreased the production of urokinase PA and tissue PA in hGL cells. In addition to canonical SMAD1/5/8 signaling, BMP2 also activates noncanonical SMAD2/3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Using two inhibition approaches (kinase receptor inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown), we found that SMAD2/3-SMAD4 and p38 MAPK, but not SMAD1/5/8 signaling, was involved in the BMP2-induced upregulation of SERPINE2 expression via activin receptor-like kinase 3. These findings deepen our understanding of the differential effect of BMPs in regulating follicular function and provide new insights of the molecular mechanisms by which BMP2 regulates the expression of SERPINE2 in human granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W3190112000,"Alteration in glucose homeostasis during cancer metabolism is an important phenomenon. Though several important transcription factors have been well studied in the context of the regulation of metabolic gene expression, the role of epigenetic readers in this regard remains still elusive. Epigenetic reader protein transcription factor 19 (TCF19) has been recently identified as a novel glucose and insulin-responsive factor that modulates histone posttranslational modifications to regulate glucose homeostasis in hepatocytes. Here we report that TCF19 interacts with a non-histone, well-known tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) and co-regulates a wide array of metabolic genes. Among these, the p53-responsive carbohydrate metabolic genes Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) and Cytochrome C Oxidase assembly protein 2 (SCO2), which are the key regulators of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation respectively, are under direct regulation of TCF19. Remarkably, TCF19 can form different transcription activation/repression complexes which show substantial overlap with that of p53, depending on glucose-mediated variant stress situations as obtained from IP/MS studies. Interestingly, we observed that TCF19/p53 complexes either have CBP or HDAC1 to epigenetically program the expression of TIGAR and SCO2 genes depending on short-term high glucose or prolonged high glucose conditions. TCF19 or p53 knockdown significantly altered the cellular lactate production and led to increased extracellular acidification rate. Similarly, OCR and cellular ATP production were reduced and mitochondrial membrane potential was compromised upon depletion of TCF19 or p53. Subsequently, through RNA-Seq analysis from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, we observed that TCF19/p53-mediated metabolic regulation is fundamental for sustenance of cancer cells. Together the study proposes that TCF19/p53 complexes can regulate metabolic gene expression programs responsible for mitochondrial energy homeostasis and stress adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3190195785,"Heat stress during reproductive stages has been leading to significant yield losses in chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.). With an aim of identifying the genomic regions or QTLs responsible for heat tolerance, 187 F 8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross GPF 2 (heat tolerant) × ILWC 292 (heat sensitive) were evaluated under late-sown irrigated (January-May) and timely-sown irrigated environments (November-April) at Ludhiana and Faridkot in Punjab, India for 13 heat tolerance related traits. The pooled ANOVA for both locations for the traits namely days to germination (DG), days to flowering initiation (DFI), days to 50% flowering (DFF), days to 100% flowering (DHF), plant height (PH), pods per plant (NPP), biomass (BIO), grain yield (YLD), 100-seed weight (HSW), harvest index (HI), membrane permeability index (MPI), relative leaf water content (RLWC) and pollen viability (PV)) showed a highly significant difference in RILs. The phenotyping data coupled with the genetic map comprising of 1365 ddRAD-Seq based SNP markers were used for identifying the QTLs for heat tolerance. Composite interval mapping provided a total of 28 and 23 QTLs, respectively at Ludhiana and Faridkot locations. Of these, 13 consensus QTLs for DG, DFI, DFF, DHF, PH, YLD, and MPI have been identified at both locations. Four QTL clusters containing QTLs for multiple traits were identified on the same genomic region at both locations. Stable QTLs for days to flowering can be one of the major factors for providing heat tolerance as early flowering has an advantage of more seed setting due to a comparatively longer reproductive period. Identified QTLs can be used in genomics-assisted breeding to develop heat stress-tolerant high yielding chickpea cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3190879216,"Introduction Of 2.5 million newborn deaths each year, serious neonatal infections are a leading cause of neonatal death for which inpatient treatment is recommended. However, manysick newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia do not have access to inpatientcare. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline recommends simplified antibiotic treatment atan outpatient level for young infants up to two months of age with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI), when referral is not feasible.We implemented this guidelinein Ethiopia to increase coverage of treatment and to learn about potential facilitating factors and barriers for implementation. Methods We conducted implementation research in two districts (Tiro Afata and Gera) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, to learn about the feasibility of implementing the WHO PSBI guideline within a programme setting using the existing health care structure. We conducted orientation meetings and policy dialogue with key stakeholders and trained health extension workers and health centre staff to identify and manage sick young infants with PSBI signs at a primary health care unit. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to facilitate programme learning, built health workers’ capacity and provided support for quality control, monitoring and data collection.We sensitized the community to appropriate care-seeking and supported the health care system in implementation. The research team collected data using structured case recording forms. Results From September 2016 to August 2017, 6185 live births and 601 sick young infants 0–59 days of age with signs of PSBI were identified. Assuming that 25% of births were missed (total births 7731) and 10% of births had an episode of PSBI in the first two months of life, the coverage of appropriate treatment for PSBI was 77.7% (601/773). Of 601 infants with PSBI, fast breathing only (pneumonia) was recorded in 432 (71.9%) infants 7–59 days of age; signs of clinical severe infection (CSI) in 155 (25.8%) and critical illnessin 14 (2.3%). Of the 432 pneumonia cases who received oral amoxicillin treatment without referral, 419 (97.0%) were successfully treated without any deaths. Of 169 sick young infants with either CSI or critical illness, only 110 were referred to a hospital; 83 did not accept referral advice and received outpatient injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin treatment either at a health post or health centre. Additionally, 59 infants who should have been referred, but were not received injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin outpatient treatment. Of infants with CSI, 129 (82.2%) were successfully treated as outpatients, while two died (1.3%). Of 14 infants with critical illness, the caregivers of five accepted referral to a hospital, and nine were treated with simplified antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Two of 14 (14.3%) infants with critical illness died within 14 days of initial presentation. Conclusion In settings where referral to a hospital is not feasible, young infants with PSBI can be treated on an outpatient basis at either a health post or health centre, which can contribute to saving many lives. Scaling-up will require health system strengthening including community mobilization.

https://openalex.org/W3193189273,"Actin cytoskeletal reorganization plays an important role in regulating smooth muscle contraction, which is essential for the modulation of various physiological functions including airway tone. The adapter protein Abi1 (Abelson interactor 1) participates in the control of smooth muscle contraction. The mechanisms by which Abi1 coordinates smooth muscle function are not fully understood. Here, we found that contractile stimulation elicited Abi1 acetylation in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells. Mutagenesis analysis identified lysine-416 (K416) as a major acetylation site. Replacement of K416 with Q (glutamine) enhanced the interaction of Abi1 with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), an important actin-regulatory protein. Moreover, the expression of K416Q Abi1 promoted actin polymerization and smooth muscle contraction without affecting myosin light chain phosphorylation at Ser-19 and vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56. Furthermore, p300 is a lysine acetyltransferase that catalyzes acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in various cell types. Here, we discovered that a portion of p300 was localized in the cytoplasm of HASM cells. Knockdown of p300 reduced the agonist-induced Abi1 acetylation in HASM cells and in mouse airway smooth muscle tissues. Smooth muscle conditional knockout of p300 inhibited actin polymerization and the contraction of airway smooth muscle tissues without affecting myosin light chain phosphorylation and vimentin phosphorylation. Together, our results suggest that contractile stimulation induces Abi1 acetylation via p300 in smooth muscle. Acetylation at K416 promotes the coupling of Abi1 with N-WASP, which facilitates actin polymerization and smooth muscle contraction. This is a novel acetylation-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3189536877,"To determine whether tidal volume/predicted body weight (TV/PBW) or driving pressure (DP) are associated with mortality in a heterogeneous population of hypoxic mechanically ventilated patients.A retrospective cohort study involving 18 intensive care units included consecutive patients ≥18 years old, receiving mechanical ventilation for ≥3 days, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300 mmHg, whether or not they met full criteria for ARDS. The main outcome was hospital mortality. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) incorporated TV/PBW, DP, and potential confounders including age, APACHE IVa® predicted hospital mortality, respiratory system compliance (CRS), and PaO2/FiO2. Predetermined strata of TV/PBW were compared using MLR.Our cohort comprised 5,167 patients with mean age 61.9 years, APACHE IVa® score 79.3, PaO2/FiO2 166 mmHg and CRS 40.5 ml/cm H2O. Regression analysis revealed that patients receiving DP one standard deviation above the mean or higher (≥19 cmH20) had an adjusted odds ratio for mortality (ORmort) = 1.10 (95% CI: 1.06-1.13, p = 0.009). Regression analysis showed a U-shaped relationship between strata of TV/PBW and adjusted mortality. Using TV/PBW 4-6 ml/kg as the referent group, patients receiving >10 ml/kg had similar adjusted ORmort, but those receiving 6-7, 7-8 and 8-10 ml/kg had lower adjusted ORmort (95%CI) of 0.81 (0.65-1.00), 0.78 (0.63-0.97) and 0.80 0.67-1.01) respectively. The adjusted ORmort in patients receiving 4-6 ml/kg was 1.26 (95%CI: 1.04-1.52) compared to patients receiving 6-10 ml/kg.Driving pressures ≥19 cmH2O were associated with increased adjusted mortality. TV/PBW 4-6ml/kg were used in less than 15% of patients and associated with increased adjusted mortality compared to TV/PBW 6-10 ml/kg used in 82% of patients. Prospective clinical trials are needed to prove whether limiting DP or the use of TV/PBW 6-10 ml/kg versus 4-6 ml/kg benefits mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3192813000,"The U.S. with only 4% of the world’s population, bears a disproportionate share of infections in the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S. conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one, the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our methodology can be applied to other countries and has the potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as well. With this first step in attempting to quantify the factors that go into the “black box” of the transmission factor β , we hope that our work will stimulate further research in the dual role of mitigation policies and compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3192873037,"The ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system is the primary mechanism for maintaining protein homeostasis in eukaryotes, yet the underlying signaling events and specificities of its components are poorly understood. Proteins destined for degradation are tagged with covalently linked polymeric Ub chains and subsequently delivered to the proteasome, often with the assistance of shuttle proteins that contain Ub-like domains. This degradation pathway is riddled with apparent redundancy-in the form of numerous polyubiquitin chains of various lengths and distinct architectures, multiple shuttle proteins, and at least three proteasomal receptors. Moreover, the largest proteasomal receptor, Rpn1, contains one known binding site for polyubiquitin and shuttle proteins, although several studies have recently proposed the existence of an additional uncharacterized site. Here, using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, photocrosslinking, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis, we show that Rpn1 does indeed contain another recognition site that exhibits affinities and binding preferences for polyubiquitin and Ub-like signals comparable to those of the known binding site in Rpn1. Surprisingly, this novel site is situated in the N-terminal section of Rpn1, a region previously surmised to be devoid of functionality. We identified a stretch of adjacent helices as the location of this previously uncharacterized binding site, whose spatial proximity and similar properties to the known binding site in Rpn1 suggest the possibility of multivalent signal recognition across the solvent-exposed surface of Rpn1. These findings offer new mechanistic insights into signal recognition processes that are at the core of the Ub-proteasome system."
https://openalex.org/W3190626979,"Background In Ethiopia, health care providers’ level of adherence to the national Antenatal Care (ANC) guideline is relatively low. The reasons why they do not follow the guidelines are not well known. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the provider-perceived benefits and constraints associated with using the guideline for ANC in public health facilities in Gondar town. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The interview was conducted among a purposive sample of nine health care providers working in four public health facilities in Gondar town. After the interviews were transcribed and coded, a content analysis was done using Atlas ti version 7.5 software packages. Result Decreasing provider’s workload and maximizing performance, improving safe motherhood, and improving the process of service delivery were reported as the perceived benefits of following ANC guideline. Organizational problems, care providers’ existing knowledge, attitude, and skills and availability of training and mentorship were the three main identified groups of factors that hinder complete providers’ adherence to ANC guideline. Conclusion Although providers acknowledged the benefits of following ANC guideline, the guideline is not fully implemented. Refresher training should be given at the start of the updated eight-contact ANC guideline and continuing education and supervision throughout the implementation process. Health care providers call for profound and urgent revisions of the supply chain system for supplies and equipment."
https://openalex.org/W3189210511,"The aim of this study was to determine the association between concentrations of progesterone (P4) during previous the estrous cycle with the intensity of spontaneous or estrogen-induced estrous expression and pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI) . A total of 1,953 AI events from lactating Holstein cows were used, consisting of 1,289 timed AI events from experiment 1 (Exp. 1) and 664 AI events from experiment 2 (Exp. 2) . In Exp. 1, cows were bred after a timed AI protocol based on estradiol and P4. In Exp. 2 animals were bred upon spontaneous estrus detection. In both experiments cows were continuously monitored by an automated activity monitor (AAM) , in Exp.1 a relative increase of activity was calculated (i.e., percentage of increase activity at estrus compared to cow’s baseline activity) and in Exp.2, activity data from each cow were computed into an index value that ranged from 0 to 100. In Exp.2 duration (hours) of estrus were calculated and defined as the total time above the threshold (35 index). The intensity of estrous expression was determined for each event and classified as either high or low intensity using the median of each experiment. Blood samples were collected for P4 analysis in Exp. 1 at –4 d, 0 d, and 7 d relative to timed AI, and in Exp. 2 immediately following estrus (0 d), 7 d, 14 d, and 21 d post-AI. Concentration of P4 was classified as greater or lower according to the median value in each experiment. Cows with lower concentrations of P4 at AI had greater estrous expression in Exp. 1 (363.6 ± 5.2 vs. 275.9 ± 8.0% relative increase) and Exp. 2 (76.7 ± 1.9 vs. 67.4 ± 4.7 index; and 12.5 ± 0.5 vs. 9.3 ± 1.8 hours). Cows with a greater intensity of estrous expression at timed AI had greater concentrations of P4 at –4 d than cows with lower intensity estrus or no estrous expression (4.6 ± 0.2 vs. 3.6 ± 0.2 vs. 3.7 ± 0.2 ng/mL). Cows with greater concentrations of P4 at –4 d had greater P/AI (32.8 ± 4.4 vs. 22.4 ± 4.5%), whereas cows with lesser concentrations of P4 at d0 for either timed AI (35.2 ± 3.4 vs. 19.6 ± 4.6%) or spontaneous estrus (31.8 ± 2.8 vs. 23.4 ± 3.2%) had greater P/AI. Cows with greater concentrations of P4 7 d post-timed AI had greater P/AI compared with cows that had lower concentration of P4 (39.1 ± 2.9 vs. 24.7 ± 2.6%). Similarly, cows that had lower concentrations of P4 at 7 d, 14 d and 21 d post-spontaneous estrus tended to have lower P/AI when compared with cows with greater concentrations of P4. Overall, concentrations of P4 prior to and at AI were associated with greater estrous intensity and P/AI at both spontaneous and timed AI events."

The obesity influence on these responses has not yet been investigated. Our purpose was to evaluate the influence of adulthood obesity on maximal and submaximal physiological responses during CPET, emphasizing the analysis of submaximal dynamic variables. Methods We analyzed 1,594 CPETs of adults (755 obese participants, Body Mass Index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) and compared the obtained variables among non-obese (normal weight and overweight) and obese groups (obesity classes I, II and III) through multivariate covariance analyses. Result Obesity influenced the majority of evaluated maximal and submaximal responses with worsened CPET performance. Cardiovascular, metabolic and gas exchange variables were the most influenced by obesity. Other maximal and submaximal responses were altered only in morbidly obese.

https://openalex.org/W3190646310,"Crosstalk between multiple components underlies the formation of mature vessels. Although the players involved in angiogenesis have been identified, mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between them are still unclear. Using the ex vivo aortic ring assay, we set out to dissect the interactions between two key angiogenic signaling pathways, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), with members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of matrix modifying enzymes. We find an interplay between VEGF, TGFβ, and the LOXs is essential for the formation of mature vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC)-coated vessels. RNA sequencing analysis further identified an interaction with the endothelin-1 pathway. Our work implicates endothelin-1 downstream of TGFβ in vascular maturation and demonstrate the complexity of processes involved in generating vSMC-coated vessels."
https://openalex.org/W3193072868,"Macrophages are the principal component of the innate immune system. They play very crucial and multifaceted roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory vascular diseases. There is an increasing recognition that transcriptionally dynamic macrophages are the key players in the pathogenesis of inflammatory vascular diseases. In this context, the accumulation and aberrant activation of macrophages in the subendothelial layers govern atherosclerotic plaque development. Macrophage-mediated inflammation is an explicitly robust biological response that involves broad alterations in inflammatory gene expression. Thus, cell-intrinsic negative regulatory mechanisms must exist which can restrain inflammatory response in a spatiotemporal manner. In this study, we identified CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain 2 (CITED2) as one such cell-intrinsic negative regulator of inflammation. Our in vivo studies show that myeloid-CITED2-deficient mice on the Apoe-/- background have larger atherosclerotic lesions on both control and high-fat/high-cholesterol diets. Our integrated transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analyses studies show that CITED2 deficiency elevates STAT1 and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. At the molecular level, our studies identify that CITED2 deficiency elevates IFNγ-induced STAT1 transcriptional activity and STAT1 enrichment on IRF1 promoter in macrophages. More importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IRF1 completely reversed elevated pro-inflammatory target gene expression in CITED2-deficient macrophages. Collectively, our study findings demonstrate that CITED2 restrains the STAT1-IRF1 signaling axis in macrophages and limits the development of atherosclerotic plaques."
https://openalex.org/W3189258787,"To what extent birds provide the ecosystem service of pest control in subsistence farms, and how this service might depend on retained natural habitats near farmlands is unexplored in West Africa. To fill this knowledge gap, we placed plasticine mimics of insect pests on experimentally grown crops on the Mambilla Plateau, South Eastern Nigeria. We recorded bird attacks on the mimics and the proportion of mimics removed by birds. We also determined the influence of distance of crops from forest fragments on both attack and removal rates. We placed 90 potted plants of groundnut ( Arachis hypogea ) and bambara nut ( Vigna subterranea ) along 15 transects running 4.5 km from forest edge into open grassland. Each plant had six of the 540 mimics in total placed on their leaves. We inspected the potted plants weekly for 12 weeks to record (i) the presence of bird beak marks on mimics, and (ii) the number of missing mimics. Once a week we collected all the mimics from the plants and counted the number of assumed beak marks. After counting we replaced the mimics on the plants, mark free. We found a strong positive correlation between the abundance of insectivorous birds and the mean number of missing mimics and/or bird attack marks on mimics. However, this positive effect of insectivorous bird abundance on prey mimic attack/removal became less strong the farther they were from a forest fragment. We found increased predation rates and abundance of insectivorous birds closer to forest fragments. Our data suggest that pest predation may be a key ecosystem service provided by insectivorous birds on Nigerian farmlands. Farmlands that are closer to forest fragments may experience a higher rate of pest control by insectivorous birds than those further away, suggesting that retaining forest fragments in the landscape may enhance pest control services in sub-Saharan subsistence farms."

Of the 275 women, who were administered a questionnaire to elicit their treatment-seeking behavior, 62 willing participants were subjected to in-depth interviews. Quantitative responses were descriptively analyzed and presented as count, proportion, mean or median. Framework analysis was performed for the qualitative data. The findings of both types of data were triangulated to construct the pathways to treatment traversed by PCOS patients.Many (~45%) respondents had no information regarding PCOS. Only 9.1% received some information from their doctors. Though the internet was the primary source of information for 37.5% of respondents, they expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of information. Multiple health care agencies were consulted by most (85.8%) of the respondents. Allopathy was the preferred choice of treatment. The average delay in initiating the treatment was 3 months. The major reasons for this were ignorance, the concept of 'normality' and 'endurance'. Deviations from the normal self (like irregular-menstruation, obesity, hirsutism, infertility) were the concern that led them to consult a doctor. They were also dissatisfied with the treatment due to a late diagnosis, lack of relief, taboo, side-effects, expenses involved and the need for repeated laboratory tests. Participants' course of treatment was influenced by the interplay of individual, distress, health-system, and social-economic factors.Women with PCOS were dissatisfied with the quality of the information and treatment received. There were treatment delays. The patients consulted multiple health agencies, including indigenous therapies, in the hope of relief. The findings provide an empirical basis on points to focus on for building better coping strategies for managing the condition."
https://openalex.org/W3191103984,"Background Institutional delivery is one of the key interventions to reduce maternal death. It ensures safe birth, reduces both actual and potential complications, and decreases maternal and newborn death. However, a significant proportion of deliveries in developing countries like Ethiopia are home deliveries and are not attended by skilled birth attendants. We investigated the prevalence and determinants of home delivery in three districts in Sidama administration, Southern Ethiopia. Methods Between 15–29 October 2018, a cross sectional survey of 507 women who gave birth within the past 12 months was conducted using multi-stage sampling. Sociodemographic and childbirth related data were collected using structured, interviewer administered tools. Univariate and backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression models were run to assess independent predictors of home delivery. Results The response rate was 97.6% (495). In the past year, 22.8% (113), 95% confidence interval (CI) (19%, 27%) gave birth at home. Rural residence, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 13.68 (95%CI:4.29–43.68); no maternal education, aOR = 20.73(95%CI:6.56–65.54) or completed only elementary school, aOR = 7.62(95% CI: 2.58–22.51); unknown expected date of delivery, aOR = 1.81(95% CI: 1.03–3.18); being employed women (those working for wage and self-employed), aOR = 2.79 (95%CI:1.41–5.52) and not planning place of delivery, aOR = 26.27, (95%CI: 2.59–266.89) were independently associated with place of delivery. Conclusion The prevalence of institutional delivery in the study area has improved from the 2016 Ethiopian Demography Health Survey report of 26%. Uneducated, rural and employed women were more likely to deliver at home. Strategies should be designed to expand access to and utilization of institutional delivery services among the risky groups."
https://openalex.org/W3191199960,"Studies of personality traits in common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) indicate that there are five or six constructs—Sociability, Dominance, Neuroticism, Openness, and two related to Conscientiousness. The present study attempted to determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded three—Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism—because of a low amount of between-subjects variance. To do so, we increased our sample size from 77 to 128. In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness. In further analyses, we could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and genotype. These results suggest that common marmoset personality structure varies as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated systematically."
https://openalex.org/W3188980554,"Debates on early metallurgy in Western Europe have frequently focused on the social value of copper (between utilitarian and symbolic) and its purported role in the emergence and consolidation of hierarchies. Recent research shows that generalisations are increasingly untenable and highlights the need for comparative regional studies. Given its location in an intermediate area, the early metallurgy of Northeast Iberia provides an interesting case in point to explore the interaction between the well-characterised traditions of southern Iberia and southern France during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Here the analytical study of seven Bell Beaker (decorated and undecorated) vessels reused as crucibles at Bauma del Serrrat del Pont (Tortellà, Girona) are presented. We employed pXRF, metallography, SEM-EDS and lead isotope analyses. The results show evidence for copper smelting employing a remarkable variety of ore sources, including Solana del Bepo, Turquesa and Les Ferreres mines, and an extra unknown area. The smelting vessels were manufactured using the same clay, which contained both mineral and organic inclusions. Our results are discussed with reference to all the evidence available for metals and metallurgy in the Northeast, and more broadly in comparison to southern Iberia and southern France, with special emphasis on issues of production organisation and social complexity. Taken together, our results support the notion that copper metallurgy played a predominantly utilitarian role in Bell Beaker societies and highlight idiosyncratic aspects of the metallurgical trajectory in the Northeast. Differences between territories challenge unilinear explanations of technological and social development after the introduction of metallurgy. Separate trajectories can only be explained in relation to area-specific socio-cultural and environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W3189130864,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by high levels of antibodies directed against nuclear antigens. Elevated serum CD138, a heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycan, correlates with increased disease activity in patients with SLE, but the contribution of CD138 to lupus disease is not known. Corroborating patient data, we detected an increase in serum CD138 in MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J (MRL/Lpr) mice (a model for SLE disease) parallel to disease activity. Although T-cell receptor β (TCRβ)+CD138+ T cells typically expand in MRL/Lpr mice as the disease progresses, surprisingly, TCRβ+CD138- cells were the primary source of circulating CD138, as the transfer of TCRβ+CD138- cells, but not TCRβ+CD138+ cells, to young MRL/Lpr mice resulted in higher serum CD138 in the recipients. We found that trypsin was able to cleave CD138 from TCRβ+CD138+ cells, and that trypsin was highly expressed in TCRβ+CD138- cells. Moreover, trypsin inhibitors, the ""defined trypsin inhibitor"" and leupeptin, increased CD138 expression on TCRβ+CD138- cells, suggesting a contribution of cleaved CD138 to the increase in blood CD138 levels. Furthermore, soluble CD138 was able to bind ""a proliferation-inducing ligand"" (APRIL) and enhance APRIL-mediated plasma cell generation and autoreactive antibody production through the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in B cells. The APRIL receptor ""transmembrane activator, calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor"" was involved in the enhancement of APRIL activity by CD138, as the synergistic effect of APRIL and CD138 was ablated in transmembrane activator, calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor-deficient B cells. These findings indicate a regulatory role for soluble CD138 in B-cell differentiation and autoreactive antibody production in SLE disease."
https://openalex.org/W3191008518,"Liver intestine (LI)-cadherin is a member of the cadherin superfamily, which encompasses a group of Ca2+-dependent cell-adhesion proteins. The expression of LI-cadherin is observed on various types of cells in the human body, such as normal small intestine and colon cells, and gastric cancer cells. Because its expression is not observed on normal gastric cells, LI-cadherin is a promising target for gastric cancer imaging. However, because the cell adhesion mechanism of LI-cadherin has remained unknown, rational design of therapeutic molecules targeting this cadherin has been hampered. Here, we have studied the homodimerization mechanism of LI-cadherin. We report the crystal structure of the LI-cadherin homodimer containing its first four extracellular cadherin repeats (EC1-4). The EC1-4 homodimer exhibited a unique architecture different from that of other cadherins reported so far, driven by the interactions between EC2 of one protein chain and EC4 of the second protein chain. The crystal structure also revealed that LI-cadherin possesses a noncanonical calcium ion-free linker between the EC2 and EC3 domains. Various biochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to elucidate the mechanism of homodimerization. We also showed that the formation of the homodimer observed in the crystal structure is necessary for LI-cadherin-dependent cell adhesion by performing cell aggregation assays. Taken together, our data provide structural insights necessary to advance the use of LI-cadherin as a target for imaging gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3191373635,"Objective To explore the nature of genetic-susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) in African-Americans. Background Recently, the number of genetic-associations with MS has exploded although the MS-associations of specific haplotypes within the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) have been known for decades. For example, the haplotypes HLA-DRB1 * 15 : 01~HLA-DQB1 * 06 : 02 , and HLA-DRB1 * 03 : 01~ HLA-DQB1 * 02 : 01 have odds ratios ( ORs ) for an MS-association orders of magnitude stronger than many of these newly-discovered associations. Nevertheless, all these haplotypes are part of much larger conserved extended haplotypes ( CEHs ), which span both the Class I and Class II MH C regions. African-Americans are at greater risk of developing MS compared to a native Africans but at lesser risk compared to Europeans. It is the purpose of this manuscript to explore the relationship between MS-susceptibility and the CEH make-up of our African-American cohort. Design/methods The African-American (AA) cohort consisted of 1,305 patients with MS and 1,155 controls, who self-identified as being African-American. For comparison, we used the 18,492 controls and 11,144 MS-cases from the predominantly European Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) and the 28,557 phased native Africans from the multinational “Be the Match” registry. The WTCCC and the African-Americans were phased at each of five HLA loci ( HLA-A , HLA-C , HLA-B , HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 ) and the at 11 SNP s (10 of which were in non-coding regions) surrounding the Class II region of the DRB1 gene using previously-published probabilistic phasing algorithms. Results Of the 32 most frequent CEHs , 18 (56%) occurred either more frequently or exclusively in Africans) whereas 9 (28%) occurred more frequently or exclusively in Europeans. The remaining 5 CEHs occurred in neither control group although, likely, these were African in origin. Eight of these CEHs carried the DRB1 * 15 : 03~DQB1 * 06 : 02~a36 haplotype and three carried the DRB1 * 15 : 01~DQB1 * 06 : 02~a1 haplotype. In African Americans, a single-copy of the European CEH ( 03 : 01_07 : 02_07 : 02_15 : 01_06 : 02_a1 ) was associated with considerable MS-risk ( OR = 3 . 30; p = 0 . 0001 )–similar to that observed in the WTCCC ( OR = 3 . 25; p&lt;10 − 168 ) . By contrast, the MS-risk for the European CEH ( 02 : 01_07 : 02_07 : 02_15 : 01_06 : 02_a1 ) was less ( OR = 1.49; ns )–again, similar to the WTCCC ( OR = 2 . 2; p&lt;10 − 38 ). Moreover, four African haplotypes were “protective” relative to a neutral reference, to three European CEHs , and also to the five other African CEHs . Conclusions The common CEHs in African Americans are divisible into those that are either African or European in origin, which are derived without modification from their source population. European CEHs , linked to MS-risk, in general, had similar impacts in African-Americans as they did in Europeans. By contrast, African CEHs had mixed MS-risks. For a few, the MS-risk exceeded that in a neutral-reference group whereas, for many others, these CEHs were “protective”–perhaps providing a partial rationale for the lower MS-risk in African-Americans compared to European-Americans."
https://openalex.org/W3188313658,"Dealing with a system of first-order reactions is a recurrent issue in chemometrics, especially in the analysis of data obtained by spectroscopic methods applied on complex biological systems. We argue that global multiexponential fitting, the still common way to solve such problems, has serious weaknesses compared to contemporary methods of sparse modeling. Combining the advantages of group lasso and elastic net-the statistical methods proven to be very powerful in other areas-we created an optimization problem tunable from very sparse to very dense distribution over a large pre-defined grid of time constants, fitting both simulated and experimental multiwavelength spectroscopic data with high computational efficiency. We found that the optimal values of the tuning hyperparameters can be selected by a machine-learning algorithm based on a Bayesian optimization procedure, utilizing widely used or novel versions of cross-validation. The derived algorithm accurately recovered the true sparse kinetic parameters of an extremely complex simulated model of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, as well as the wide peak of hypothetical distributed kinetics in the presence of different noise levels. It also performed well in the analysis of the ultrafast experimental fluorescence kinetics data detected on the coenzyme FAD in a very wide logarithmic time window. We conclude that the primary application of the presented algorithms-implemented in available software-covers a wide area of studies on light-induced physical, chemical, and biological processes carried out with different spectroscopic methods. The demand for this kind of analysis is expected to soar due to the emerging ultrafast multidimensional infrared and electronic spectroscopic techniques that provide very large and complex datasets. In addition, simulations based on our methods could help in designing the technical parameters of future experiments for the verification of particular hypothetical models."
https://openalex.org/W3188841382,"Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is lost in approximately 70% of sporadic breast cancers, with an inclination towards triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is treated with traditional chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel (PTX); however, tumors often develop drug resistance. We previously created APC knockdown cells (APC shRNA1) using the human TNBC cells, MDA-MB-157, and showed that APC loss induces PTX resistance. To understand the mechanisms behind APC-mediated PTX response, we performed cell cycle analysis and analyzed cell cycle related proteins. Cell cycle analysis indicated increased G2/M population in both PTX-treated APC shRNA1 and parental cells, suggesting that APC expression does not alter PTX-induced G2/M arrest. We further studied the subcellular localization of the G2/M transition proteins, cyclin B1 and CDK1. The APC shRNA1 cells had increased CDK1, which was preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, and increased baseline CDK6. RNA-sequencing was performed to gain a global understanding of changes downstream of APC loss and identified a broad mis-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in APC shRNA1 cells. Our studies are the first to show an interaction between APC and taxane response in breast cancer. The implications include designing combination therapy to re-sensitize APC-mutant breast cancers to taxanes using the specific cell cycle alterations."
https://openalex.org/W3190010609,"Multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence, especially in low-income settings. Despite this, chronic conditions are often managed in isolation, potentially leading to burden-capacity imbalance and reduced treatment adherence. We aimed to explore, in a low-income population with common comorbidities, how the specific demands of multimorbidity affect burden and capacity as defined by the Cumulative Complexity Model.Qualitative interviews with thirteen rural community health centre patients in Victoria, Australia. Participants were aged between 47-72 years and reported 3-10 chronic conditions. We asked about perceived capacity and burden in managing health. The Theory of Patient Capacity was used to analyse capacity and Normalisation Process Theory to analyse burden. All data specifically associated with the experience of multimorbidity was extracted from each burden and capacity domain.The capacity domains of biography, resource mobilisation and work realisation were important in relation to multimorbidity. Conditions causing functional impairment (e.g. chronic pain, depression) interacted with physical, psychological and financial capacity, leading to biographical disruption and an inability to realise treatment and life work. Despite this, few people had a treatment plan for these conditions. Participants reported that multimorbidity affected all burden domains. Coherence and appraisal were especially challenging due to condition interactions, with clinicians providing little guidance.The capacity and burden deficits highlighted by participants were not associated with any specific diagnosis, but were due to condition interactions, coupled with the lack of health provider support to navigate interactions. Physical, psychological and financial capacities were inseparable, but rarely addressed or understood holistically. Understanding and managing condition and treatment interactions was a key burden task for patients but was often difficult, isolating and overwhelming. This suggests that clinicians should become more aware of linkages between conditions, and include generic, synergistic or cross-disciplinary approaches, to build capacity, reduce burden and encourage integrated chronic condition management."
https://openalex.org/W3190714530,"The accurate detection of foot-strike and toe-off is often critical in the assessment of running biomechanics. The gold standard method for step event detection requires force data which are not always available. Although kinematics-based algorithms can also be used, their accuracy and generalisability are limited, often requiring corrections for speed or foot-strike pattern. The purpose of this study was to develop FootNet, a novel kinematics and deep learning-based algorithm for the detection of step events in treadmill running. Five treadmill running datasets were gathered and processed to obtain segment and joint kinematics, and to identify the contact phase within each gait cycle using force data. The proposed algorithm is based on a long short-term memory recurrent neural network and takes the distal tibia anteroposterior velocity, ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion angle and the anteroposterior and vertical velocities of the foot centre of mass as input features to predict the contact phase within a given gait cycle. The chosen model architecture underwent 5-fold cross-validation and the final model was tested in a subset of participants from each dataset (30%). Non-parametric Bland-Altman analyses (bias and [95% limits of agreement]) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used to compare FootNet against the force data step event detection method. The association between detection errors and running speed, foot-strike angle and incline were also investigated. FootNet outperformed previously published algorithms (foot-strike bias = 0 [–10, 7] ms, RMSE = 5 ms; toe-off bias = 0 [–10, 10] ms, RMSE = 6 ms; and contact time bias = 0 [–15, 15] ms, RMSE = 8 ms) and proved robust to different running speeds, foot-strike angles and inclines.

Methods The population-based study included 18,724 screened people with hypertension (age ≥ 60 years, 48.7% women). From 2016 to 2019, data on demographics, potential influencing factors and health status were collected through face-to-face interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Logistic multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors associated with stroke. Results Among the object of study from 2016 to 2019, 2,025 patients were screened for stroke, with the overall prevalence rate of 10.82% (10.41%-11.23%). Multivariate adjusted model analysis showed that dyslipidemia (OR:1.31,95%CI:1.19–1.45), lack of exercise (OR:1.91,95%CI:1.32–2.76), atrial fibrillation [OR:1.49,95%CI:1.35–1.65), family history of stroke (OR:2.18,95%CI:1.6–2.88) were the significant independent influencing factors of stroke in hypertensive patients over 60 years old. When these four factors were combined, compared with participants without any of these factors, the multi-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of risk of stroke for persons concurrently having one, two and three or more of these factors were 1.89 (1.67–2.13), 2.15 (1.86–2.47) and 6.84 (4.90–9.55), respectively (linear trend P &lt; 0.001); after multivariate adjustment, the family history of stroke had additive interaction with lack of exercise [RERI = 1.08(0.22–1.94), AP = 0.19(0.04–0.35), S = 1.31(1.02–1.69)], dyslipidemia [RERI = 0.87(0.41–1.33), AP = 0.23(0.08–0.38), S = 1.46(1.04–2.05)]. Conclusion The prevalence of stroke was high in hypertensive patients aged 60 and above in Jiading District, Shanghai. Dyslipidemia, lack of exercise, atrial fibrillation and family history of stroke were significantly associated with stroke in hypertensive population. Stroke risk can be increased especially when multiple factors coexisting, and family history of stroke combined with a lack of exercise or dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W3187255389,"Aging, obesity, and insulin resistance are associated with low levels of PGC1α and PGC1β coactivators and defective mitochondrial function. We studied mice deficient for PGC1α and PGC1β [double heterozygous (DH)] to investigate their combined pathogenic contribution. Contrary to our hypothesis, DH mice were leaner, had increased energy dissipation, a pro-thermogenic profile in BAT and WAT, and improved carbohydrate metabolism compared to wild types. WAT showed upregulation of mitochondriogenesis/oxphos machinery upon allelic compensation of PGC1α4 from the remaining allele. However, DH mice had decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and biogenesis transcriptomes in mitochondria-rich organs. Despite being metabolically healthy, mitochondrial defects in DH mice impaired muscle fiber remodeling and caused qualitative changes in the hepatic lipidome. Our data evidence first the existence of organ-specific compensatory allostatic mechanisms are robust enough to drive an unexpected phenotype. Second, optimization of adipose tissue bioenergetics is sufficient to maintain a healthy metabolic phenotype despite a broad severe mitochondrial dysfunction in other relevant metabolic organs. Third, the decrease in PGC1s in adipose tissue of obese and diabetic patients is in contrast with the robustness of the compensatory upregulation in the adipose of the DH mice."
https://openalex.org/W3188178914,"Chronodisruption has been largely overlooked as a developmental exposure. The placenta, a conduit between the maternal and fetal environments, may relay circadian cues to the fetus. We have previously shown that developmental chronodisruption causes visual impairment and increased retinal microglial and macrophage marker expression. Here, we investigated the impacts of environmental chronodisruption on fetal and placental outcomes in a C57BL/6J mouse ( Mus musculus ) model. Developmental chronodisruption had no effect on embryo count, placental weight, or fetal sex ratio. When measured with RNAseq, mice exposed to developmental chronodisruption (CD) had differential placental expression of several transcripts including Serpinf1 , which encodes pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Immunofluorescence of microglia/macrophage markers, Iba1 and CD11b, also revealed significant upregulation of immune cell markers in CD-exposed placenta. Our results suggest that in utero chronodisruption enhances placental immune cell expression, potentially programming a pro-inflammatory tissue environment."
https://openalex.org/W3188970457,"Pituitary dwarfism (PD) in German Shepherd dogs (GSD) is a rare endocrinopathy. Cause and inheritance of the disease are well characterized, but the overall survival time, presence of concurrent diseases, quality of life (QoL) and influence of different treatment options on those parameters is still not well investigated. The aim of this study was to obtain data regarding the disease pattern of GSD with PD and to investigate the impact of treatment.47 dogs with dwarfism (presumably PD) and 94 unaffected GSD serving as controls were enrolled. Data were collected via a standardized questionnaire, which every owner of a participating dog had completed. Dogs with PD were grouped based on three categories of treatment: Group 1 (untreated), group 2 (treated with levothyroxine), group 3 (treated with thyroxine and progestogens or with growth hormone (GH)). Groups were compared using One-Way-Anova, Kruskal-Wallis test or Wilcoxon-rank-sum test. Categorical analysis was performed using Two-Sample-Chi-Squared-test.Dogs treated with thyroxine and gestagen or GH were significantly taller and heavier compared to all other dogs with PD. Quality of life was best in dogs with PD treated with thyroxine and similar to unaffected GSD. Treatment increased survival time in dogs with PD independent of the treatment strategy. Dogs receiving thyroxine and progestogens or GH did not develop chronic kidney disease (CKD).GSD with PD should be treated at least for their secondary hypothyroidism to increase survival time. Additional treatment with progestogens or GH improves body size and seems to protect against the occurrence of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3189058666,"Glioblastoma is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis that rapidly acquires resistance to available clinical treatments. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) system produces the selective elimination of HSVtk-positive cells and is a candidate for preclinical testing against glioblastoma via its ability to regulate proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to establish a plasmid encoding the HSVtk/GCV system driven by a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter and verify its possibility of neural differentiation of glioblastoma cell line under the GCV challenge. Four stable clones—N2A-pCMV-HSVtk, N2A-pGFAP-HSVtk, U251-pCMV-HSVtk, and U251-pGFAP-HSVtk—were established from neuronal N2A and glioblastoma U251 cell lines. In vitro GCV sensitivity was assessed by MTT assay for monitoring time- and dosage-dependent cytotoxicity. The capability for neural differentiation in stable glioblastoma clones during GCV treatment was assessed by performing immunocytochemistry for nestin, GFAP, and βIII-tubulin. Under GFAP promoter control, the U251 stable clone exhibited GCV sensitivity, while the neuronal N2A clones were nonreactive. During GCV treatment, cells underwent apoptosis on day 3 and dying cells were identified after day 5. Nestin was increasingly expressed in surviving cells, indicating that the population of neural stem-like cells was enriched. Lower levels of GFAP expression were detected in surviving cells. Furthermore, βIII-tubulin-positive neuron-like cells were identified after GCV treatment. This study established pGFAP-HSVtk-P2A-EGFP plasmids that successfully ablated GFAP-positive glioblastoma cells, but left neuronal N2A cells intact. These data suggest that the neural differentiation of glioblastoma cells can be promoted by treatment with the HSVtk/GCV system."
https://openalex.org/W3190191410,"Uveal melanoma (UVM), the most common primary intraocular malignancy, has a high mortality because of a high propensity to metastasize. Our study analyzed prognostic value and immune-related characteristics of CARD11 in UVM, hoping to provide a potential management and research direction. The RNA-sequence data of 80 UVM patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and divided them into high- and low-expression groups. We analyzed the differentially expressed genes, enrichment analyses and the infiltration of immune cells using the R package and Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis. A clinical prediction nomogram and protein-protein interaction network were constructed and the first 8 genes were considered as the hub-genes. Finally, we constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by Cytoscape and analyzed the statistical data via the R software. Here we found that CARD11 expression had notable correlation with UVM clinicopathological features, which was also an independent predictor for overall survival (OS). Intriguingly, CARD11 had a positively correlation to autophagy, cellular senescence and apoptosis. Infiltration of monocytes was significantly higher in low CARD11 expression group, and infiltration of T cells regulatory was lower in the same group. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that CARD11 was positively related to T cell activation pathways and cell adhesion molecules. The expressions of hub-genes were all increased in the high CARD11 expression group and the ceRNA network showed the interaction among mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA. These findings show that high CARD11 expression in UVM is associated with poor OS, indicating that CARD11 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of the UVM."
https://openalex.org/W3190395410,"Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) are increasingly being treated by endovascular coiling as opposed to open surgical clipping. Unfortunately, endovascular coiling imparts an approximate 25% recanalization rate, leading to additional procedures and increased rupture risk. While a new health technology innovation (HTI) that reduces this recanalization rate would benefit patients, few advancements have been made. We aim to determine whether cost-effectiveness has been a barrier to HTI.A probabilistic Markov model was constructed from the healthcare payer perspective to compare standard endovascular treatment of UIA to standard treatment plus the addition of a HTI adjunct. Costs were measured in 2018 USD and health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). In the base case, the HTI was a theoretical mesenchymal stem cell therapy which reduced the aneurysm recanalization rate by 50% and cost $10,000 per procedure. All other model inputs were derived from the published scientific literature.Based on the model results, we found that for a given HTI price (y) and relative risk reduction of aneurysm recanalization (x), the HTI was always cost-effective if the following equation was satisfied: y ≤ 20268 ∙ x, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. The uncertainty surrounding whether an aneurysm would recanalize was a significant driver within the model. When the uncertainty around the risk of aneurysm recanalization was eliminated, the 10-year projected additional benefit to the United States healthcare system was calculated to be $113,336,994.Cost-effectiveness does not appear to be a barrier to innovation in reducing the recanalization rate of UIA treated by endovascular coil embolization. Our model can now be utilized by academia and industry to accentuate economically feasible HTI and by healthcare payers to calculate their maximum willingness-to-pay for a new technology. Our results also indicate that predicting a patient's baseline risk of aneurysm recanalization is a critical area of future research."
https://openalex.org/W3190711721,"Some previous studies have shown that an increase in blood glucose level makes people more future oriented, however, results are inconsistent, other studies failing to replicate this effect. Here, we tested whether psychological factors (in this instance, perception of food pleasantness after consumption of more palatable or less palatable meal) can play a moderating role. We hypothesized that consuming more palatable food (perceived as rewarding) should cause blood glucose levels to affect future discounting, but that this should not occur for the consumption of less palatable food. A high-powered, independent groups experiment ( N = 149, power β = .90) showed that, subsequent to performing an initial discounting task, the two groups consuming a meal (a control group consumed no meal) displayed a significant increase in blood glucose levels 10 minutes after meal consumption and just before repeating the discounting task. However, the increased blood glucose levels did not cause changes in delay discounting in either experimental group."
https://openalex.org/W3190844833,"In anaesthetic practice the risk of hypoxia and arterial blood gas disturbances is evident, as most anaesthetic regimens depress the respiratory function. Hypoxia may be extended during recovery, and for this reason we wished to investigate if oxygen supply during a one hour post-operative period reduced the development of hypoxia and respiratory acidosis in rats anaesthetized with fentanyl/fluanisone and midazolam. Twelve Sprague Dawley rats underwent surgery and were divided in two groups, breathing either 100% oxygen or atmospheric air during a post-operative period. The peripheral blood oxygen saturation and arterial acid-base status were analyzed for differences between the two groups. We found that oxygen supply after surgery prevented hypoxia but did not result in a significant difference in the blood acid-base status. All rats developed respiratory acidosis, which could not be reversed by supplemental oxygen supply. We concluded that oxygen supply improved oxygen saturation and avoided hypoxia but did not have an influence on the acid-base status."
https://openalex.org/W3192255856,"During lactation, adult female mice display aggressive responses toward male intruders, triggered by male-derived chemosensory signals. This aggressive behavior is not shown by pup-sensitized virgin females sharing pup care with dams. The genetic mechanisms underlying the switch from attraction to aggression are unknown. In this work, we investigate the differential gene expression in lactating females expressing maternal aggression compared to pup-sensitized virgin females in the medial amygdala (Me), a key neural structure integrating chemosensory and hormonal information. The results showed 197 genes upregulated in dams, including genes encoding hormones such as prolactin, growth hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone, neuropeptides such as galanin, oxytocin, and pro-opiomelanocortin, and genes related to catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. In contrast, 99 genes were downregulated in dams, among which we find those encoding for inhibins and transcription factors of the Fos and early growth response families. The gene set analysis revealed numerous Gene Ontology functional groups with higher expression in dams than in pup-sensitized virgin females, including those related with the regulation of the Jak/Stat cascade. Of note, a number of olfactory and vomeronasal receptor genes was expressed in the Me, although without differences between dams and virgins. For prolactin and growth hormone, a qPCR experiment comparing dams, pup-sensitized, and pup-naïve virgin females showed that dams expressed higher levels of both hormones than pup-naïve virgins, with pup-sensitized virgins showing intermediate levels. Altogether, the results show important gene expression changes in the Me, which may underlie some of the behavioral responses characterizing maternal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3187615814,"In Ethiopia, nearly one-third of people living with human immunodeficiency viruses do not adhere to antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, information regarding non-adherence and its associated factors among adults on first-line antiretroviral therapy in Northeast Ethiopia is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of non-adherence and its associated factors among adults on first-line antiretroviral therapy in North Shewa Zone, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 326 participants selected by systematic random sampling technique from the five randomly selected public health facilities. Data were collected using the questionnaire adapted from the studies conducted previously and the collected data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported to Stata version 14 for further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done and an adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95% confidence interval was used to declare a statistical significance.The overall prevalence of non-adherence was 17.4% [95% CI: (12.8%, 21.2%)]. Patients with no formal education [AOR (95% CI) = 5.57 (1.97, 15.88)], those who did not use memory aids to take their medications [AOR (95% CI) = 3.01 (1.27, 7.11)], travel more than 10 kilometers to visit the nearby antiretroviral therapy clinics [AOR (95% CI) = 2.42 (1.22, 25.86)], those who used substance [AOR (95% CI) = 3.57 (1.86, 28.69)], and patients whose medication time interfered with their daily routine activities [AOR (95% CI) = 15.46 (4.41, 54.28) had higher odds of having non-adherence to first-line antiretroviral therapy compared to their counter groups.The level of non-adherence to first-line antiretroviral therapy was 17.4%, higher compared to WHO's recommendation. Hence, patients counseling focused on avoiding substance use, use memory aids, and adjusting working time with medication schedule are very crucial. Furthermore, the ministry of health and the regional health bureau with other stakeholders should expand antiretroviral therapy service delivery at health facilities that are close to the community to address distance barriers."
https://openalex.org/W3188314301,"Introduction Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity in children. Treatment strategies aim to halt progression of the curve. Patients are treated mainly with thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) if indicated. This form of brace treatment has been shown to be cumbersome and tough on growing individuals. However, computer aided design and manufactured (CAD/CAM) braces might increase comfortability and ultimately outcome if compliance is improved. In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, we aim to compare CAD/CAM designed Boston 3D-brace to standard Boston brace. Methods Subjects: 170 previously untreated and skeletally immature children diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis, aged 9–17 years of age (curve magnitude Cobb 25–40 degrees) will be included. Interventions: Both groups will receive a physical activity prescription according to the World Health Organization recommendations. Randomization will be performed 1:1 to a 3D CAD/CAM designed Boston 3D-brace or a standard Boston brace, both with prescribed daily wear time of 20 hours. Outcome: The subjects will participate in the study until curve progression or until skeletal maturity. The primary outcome variable is failure of treatment, defined as progression of the Cobb angle more than 6 degrees compared to the baseline x-ray. The progression is confirmed if seen on two consecutive standing spinal x-rays. Radiographs will be taken at each six-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include patient and clinical reported outcomes, including number of individuals requiring surgical intervention. Discussion This study will show if efficacy in brace treatment can be improved with new brace designs. Trial registration The protocol has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04805437 ."
https://openalex.org/W3188514514,"Existing research shows that evaluations of the risks and benefits of various hazards (i.e., technologies and activities) are inversely related. The affect heuristic explains the negative relation between risks and benefits, as based on the strength of positive or negative affect associated with a hazard. Research on the affect heuristic previously investigated under which conditions people judge risk and benefits independently, focusing on expertise as a factor that might exempt from inversely related judgements of risk and benefits. Measurements within Dual Process Theories have been found to be associated with rational, analytical decision making and accurate judgments. In this paper we investigated the extent to which rational information processing styles can predict the risk-benefit relation of technologies in a medical and food applications and whether the attitudes influence the strength or direction of the relationship. Using the Need for Cognition Scale (NFC), a psychometric-based risk scale and an explicit measure of attitude, in a representative sample of 3228 Swedes, we found that the high NFC group judged the risks and benefits of technologies to be inversely related. In contrast, the low NFC group judged the risks and benefits to be positively related. These results were confirmed across all studied technologies by applying moderation analysis. We discuss the results in light of recent research on cognitive processing and polarization over technologies’ risks."
https://openalex.org/W3190324167,"Given that romantic partners play a pivotal role in patients' survivorship period, integrating partners into survivorship care and broadening the focus of behavioral interventions from the individual (survivor) to the survivor-partner dyad may make healthy lifestyle behaviors more easily adopted and potentially maintained. Understanding the role of dyadic processes in Black survivors is particularly important because their lifestyle behaviors are poor and they have higher cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. To develop an effective dyadic lifestyle behavior intervention for Black survivors, micro-level investigations of interactions between Black survivors and their partners are necessary to pinpoint how survivors and partners facilitate or hinder each other's lifestyle behaviors in their natural, everyday lives. Accordingly, the objective of the present study is to fill these gaps using ecological momentary assessment to eventually develop more effective lifestyle interventions for Black prostate cancer (PCa) survivors and partners. A total of 120 dyads (i.e., 240 individuals) who are Black adult survivors diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa and their romantic partners will be asked to complete four assessments per day for 14 consecutive days on a smartphone after an initial retrospective survey. Over the 14 days, participants will be asked to complete a brief survey regarding their lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentariness and eating behaviors), contexts of lifestyle behaviors, stress, and coping. Physical activity and sedentary behavior will be assessed via accelerometer; eating behaviors will be assessed with the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool. After completing the 14-day assessment, participants will be asked to complete a final retrospective survey. Results of the proposed study will inform the rigorous development of a theory-based dyadic lifestyle intervention in this vulnerable survivorship population with the ultimate goal to improve overall survival and reduce morbidities (for survivors) and reduce cancer incidence (for partners)."
https://openalex.org/W3191030357,"A rapid and cost-effective system is vital for the detection of harmful algae that causes environmental problems in terms of water quality. The approach for algae detection was to capture images based on hyperspectral fluorescence imaging microscope by detecting specific fluorescence signatures. With the high degree of overlapping spectra of algae, the distribution of pigment in the region of interest was unknown according to a previous report. We propose an optimization method of multivariate curve resolution (MCR) to improve the performance of pigment analysis. The reconstruction image described location and concentration of the microalgae pigments. This result indicated the cyanobacterial pigment distribution and mapped the relative pigment content. In conclusion, with the advantage of acquiring two-dimensional images across a range of spectra, HSI conjoining spectral features with spatial information efficiently estimated specific features of harmful microalgae in MCR models."
https://openalex.org/W3187118548,"Recommender systems aim to provide users with a selection of items, based on predicting their preferences for items they have not yet rated, thus helping them filter out irrelevant ones from a large product catalogue. Collaborative filtering is a widely used mechanism to predict a particular user's interest in a given item, based on feedback from neighbour users with similar tastes. The way the user's neighbourhood is identified has a significant impact on prediction accuracy. Most methods estimate user proximity from ratings they assigned to co-rated items, regardless of their number. This paper introduces a similarity adjustment taking into account the number of co-ratings. The proposed method is based on a concordance ratio representing the probability that two users share the same taste for a new item. The probabilities are further adjusted by using the Empirical Bayes inference method before being used to weight similarities. The proposed approach improves existing similarity measures without increasing time complexity and the adjustment can be combined with all existing similarity measures. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets confirmed that the proposed method systematically improved the recommender system's prediction accuracy performance for all considered similarity measures."
https://openalex.org/W3188415278,"Background and objectives Epidemiological studies show that the use of cannabis is related to the use of other illicit drugs, including stimulants such as cocaine and ecstasy. However, few studies have examined how patterns of cannabis use relate to the use of stimulants. In this research we determined relationships between patterns of cannabis use and recent stimulant use, drawing on data from two large nationally representative surveys. We also explored how frequency of cannabis use relates to stimulant use and whether subjects with a cannabis use disorder (CUD)–defined as cannabis abuse or dependence–are more likely to be recent users of cocaine or ecstasy. Materials and methods We analysed data from Ireland’s 2010/11 and 2014/15 National Drug Prevalence Surveys,which recruited 5,134 and 7,005 individuals respectively, aged 15 years and over, living in private households. We included only those people who reported some past cannabis use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations between patterns of cannabis use and recent stimulant use. Results Among survey participants who had used cannabis in the last month, 17.9% reported recent cocaine use, while almost one-quarter (23.6%) reported recent ecstasy use. There was a significant linear relationship between patterns of cannabis use and recent use of cocaine, ecstasy or any stimulant, with last month cannabis users displaying greater odds (OR = 12.03, 95% CI: 8.15–17.78) of having recent stimulant use compared to last year (OR = 4.48, 95% CI: 2.91–6.91) and former (reference) cannabis users. Greater frequency of cannabis use in the last 30 days was also significantly related to the use of stimulants. In addition, results demonstrated an association between CUD and recent use of cocaine or ecstasy (OR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.55–3.35). Conclusions Findings from this study suggest a relationship between patterns and frequency of cannabis use and recent use of stimulants and an association between CUD and stimulant use. As the use of cannabis with stimulants may increase the risk of negative health consequences, education in community and medical settings about polydrug use and its increased risks may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3190715534,"Construction of dams for hydroelectric power requires significant quantities of soil and rock, which are often extracted in borrow pits from adjacent regions. Although the effects of dams on stream processes has received significant attention, the effects of borrow pits has not. The main objective of this study was to analyze the geomorphological and sedimentological aspects of two second-order streams, one of which was directly affected by the borrow pit located upstream of its source (Pedra Branca stream). Flow rates were measured and cross-sections of 600m stretches in both streams were monitored over a hydrological year. At the same time, sediments from the bed of the channels and soils on their banks had their physical and chemical characteristics evaluated. Streams sediments differed in their chemical and organic matter composition. The mean particle size of the sediment particles was different between the reference and degraded streams. The water flow was very similar to both streams, only varying along the seasonal seasons. However, the fluvial channels presented great geomorphological differentiation, mainly downstream, due to the location of the Pedra Branca stream and its proximity to the borrow pit. Despite the great importance for the production of clean electric energy, the construction of hydroelectric plants promotes persistent impacts that affect structural and functional aspects of the adjacent aquatic habitats. Borrow pits used for the construction of projects become large sources of sediment for aquatic environments, affecting the drainage network of the hydrographic basin and the balance of river erosion, transport and deposition processes. The results show the need to review the intervention protocols in borrow pits and the environmental legislation that regulates their rehabilitation."
