https://openalex.org/W2079160409,Electron photomicrographs of cellulose acetate membranes used in the reverse osmosis process of water desalination reveal a dense surface layer with a porous substructure. The high rate of transmission for water can be correlated with the thickness of the dense layer on the air-dried surface of the membrane.

A random tetrahedral network of 300 units has been constructed for direct measurement of coordinates; the construction process is uniquely defined so that it may be possible to synthesize larger networks by use of a computer."

https://openalex.org/W2040177308,"In August 1963, living conchostracans (branchipod Crustacea) of the genera Leptestheria and Eulimnadia were collected at three stations in Chihuahua. One Sonoran locality yielded Triassic fossils of the family Cyzicidae, a widespread North American group. The geographic rangeof the geologically younger families Leptestheriidae and Limnadidae (particularly the genus Eulimnadia) thus extended to Chihuahua during post-Mesozoic time."

Nevertheless, a unique study was made of the hydrologic cycle of small stream basins in Wisconsin and New Jersey on the basis of measurements relative to the peak of tritium fallout in the spring of 1958. The continental and the coastal basins receivedapproximately the same tritium fallout. Approximately 30 percent went into ground-water storage, the remainder being exported as runoff and evapotranspiration. The mean residence time for ground-water recharge for the two basins was 45 and 30 days, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1965995069,"During pulse incubations of onion roots with RNA precursors, incorporation into meristematic nucleoli is asynchronous for some, but not for all, cells. After a 30-minute labeling period, the ""zero-class"" is as large as 25 percent, and the asynchrony is intracellular rather than cellular. This suggests an individual specificity of nucleolar function in a population of differentiating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012171189,"Snowstorm petunias grown in the greenhouse developed a necrotic banding of the actively expanding foliage characteristic of injury ascribed to various photochemically produced pollutants in the atmosphere. In this case the damage appeared to be related to the high aldehyde content of the ambient air. Each time the aldehyde concentration exceeded 0.20 parts per million for 2 hours, injury appeared within a day or two. From July to September 1963 such plant injury was observed on seven occasions."
https://openalex.org/W2022944567,A wide variety of free radicals can be produced thermally at temperatures as low as 40Â°C by a new catalytic method which provides a means for studying the mechanism of many catalytic hydrogenation-dehydrogenation processes. Initial results include the first chemical evidence for the existence of the H3 molecule.
