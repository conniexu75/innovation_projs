Recently, we have shown that the human CAV-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus, and mutations in Cav-1 have been implicated in human cancer. Here, we created a caveolin-1 null (CAV-1 −/−) mouse model, using standard homologous recombination techniques, to assess the role of caveolin-1 in caveolae biogenesis, endocytosis, cell proliferation, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling. Surprisingly, Cav-1 null mice are viable. We show that these mice lack caveolin-1 protein expression and plasmalemmal caveolae. In addition, analysis of cultured fibroblasts from Cav-1 null embryos reveals the following: (i) a loss of caveolin-2 protein expression; (ii) defects in the endocytosis of a known caveolar ligand, i.e.fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin; and (iii) a hyperproliferative phenotype. Importantly, these phenotypic changes are reversed by recombinant expression of the caveolin-1 cDNA. Furthermore, examination of the lung parenchyma (an endothelial-rich tissue) shows hypercellularity with thickened alveolar septa and an increase in the number of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (Flk-1)-positive endothelial cells. As predicted, endothelial cells from Cav-1 null mice lack caveolae membranes. Finally, we examined eNOS signaling by measuring the physiological response of aortic rings to various stimuli. Our results indicate that eNOS activity is up-regulated in Cav-1 null animals, and this activity can be blunted by using a specific NOS inhibitor, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. These findings are in accordance with previous in vitro studies showing that caveolin-1 is an endogenous inhibitor of eNOS. Thus, caveolin-1 expression is required to stabilize the caveolin-2 protein product, to mediate the caveolar endocytosis of specific ligands, to negatively regulate the proliferation of certain cell types, and to provide tonic inhibition of eNOS activity in endothelial cells.

Interestingly, this same protein was found to be the primary structural component of caveolae microdomains, 50–100 nm vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane (3Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Caveolae were morphologically described as early as the 1950s by Yamada (4Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and Palade (5Farquhar M. Palade G. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). They are curious structures that can be found individually or in clusters at the surfaces of numerous cell types, the best examples of which are adipocytes, endothelial cells, muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Research in the past decade has shown that caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains formed as a result of localized accumulation of cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and caveolin (6Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 7Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Caveolin, an integral membrane protein that can directly bind cholesterol, most likely plays a major role in the invagination of caveolae from the plasma membrane proper, although our understanding of the mechanisms behind this process remains rudimentary. Two other members of the caveolin gene family have recently been identified and cloned, caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 (9Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they have also been implicated in signal transduction at the plasma membrane (15Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Biochemical and morphological experiments have shown that a variety of lipid-modified signaling molecules are concentrated within these plasma membrane microdomains, such as Src family tyrosine kinases, Ha-Ras, eNOS, and heterotrimeric G-proteins (17Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 18Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In many ways, caveolin-1 is intricately involved in caveolar functioning. In the years after the discovery that caveolae might serve to compartmentalize signaling molecules and facilitate cross-talk among signaling cascades (the so-called “caveolae signaling hypothesis” (16Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar)), Cav-1 has been found to be a key regulator of some of these proteins. Both in vitro and cell culture experiments indicate that Cav-1 can directly interact with and maintain some of these signaling molecules in an inactive conformation (reviewed in Ref.23Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). In effect, Cav-1 seems to act as a scaffolding protein, able to negatively regulate the activity of other molecules by binding to and releasing them in a timely fashion. Research in the past few years has established a recurring theme in this regulation. Many of the proteins that either interact with, transcriptionally repress, or are inhibited by Cav-1 fall under the pro-proliferative, oncogenic, and anti-apoptotic category of molecules. Cav-1 interacts with and negatively regulates the EGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Neu tyrosine kinases (24Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Conversely, caveolin-1 levels are transcriptionally reduced upon activation of the oncogenes Ha-ras, v-abl, myc, neu, the HPV oncogeneE6, among others (26Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A.

For some time, it has been known that a certain locus (D7S522; 7q31.1) is an aphidicolin-induced fragile site in the human genome (38Shridhar V. Sun Q.C. Miller O.J. Kalemkerian G.P. Petros J.

Pederzoli P. Perucho M. Scarpa A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3808-3813PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, determination of the genomic organization of the human CAV-1 locus revealed that it maps to 7q31.1, adjacent to the LOH marker D7S522, and as of yet it still remains the closest known gene to this putative tumor suppressor locus (35Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 47Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Sotgia F. Pestell R.G. Minetti C. Scherer P.E.

Taken together, the results described above have led many investigators to propose the possibility that Cav-1 is indeed a “tumor suppressor” whose reduction/deletion in cells would provide growth advantages and expedite tumorigenesis. In support of this idea, the only two methods thus far used to abolish Cav-1 expression have arrived at similar conclusions. Antisense-mediated down-regulation of Cav-1 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts leads to a hyperactivation of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway and anchorage-independent growth (48Galbiati F. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An RNA interference-based ablation of Cav-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to progression of the meiotic cell cycle, a phenotype that mirrors that of Ras activation (49Scheel J. Srinivasan J. Honnert U. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report indicates that the caveolin-1 gene is mutated in up to 16% of human breast cancer samples examined (50Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of the caveolin-1 cDNA harboring this mutation (P132L) was sufficient to transform NIH 3T3 cells (50Hayashi K. Matsuda S. Machida K. Yamamoto T. Fukuda Y. Nimura Y. Hayakawa T. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). As similar results have been obtained previously using an antisense approach to ablate caveolin-1 expression (48Galbiati F. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the caveolin-1 (P132L) mutation may behave in a dominant-negative fashion. Interestingly, an analogous mutation occurs within the caveolin-3 gene (P104L) in patients with a novel form of autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD-1C) (51Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco P. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonte' D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In order to gain a better understanding of caveolae and caveolin-1 functioning in a mammalian organism, we used a gene targeting strategy to disrupt the Cav-1 locus in the mouse. In this way, we could observe the role Cav-1 plays in animal physiology (i.e. during development and into adult life) as well as molecularly (i.e. caveolar biogenesis, its interaction with caveolin-2, and its functional roles in endocytosis, cellular proliferation, and signal transduction). In this study, we describe the generation of mice lacking the cav-1 gene and determine some of the molecular side effects that result from a deficiency of Cav-1 expression. Undoubtedly, the generation of viable/fertile Cav-1-deficient mice (and cells derived from these animals) will allow us and others to critically evaluate the many proposed functions of caveolae organelles and the caveolin-1 protein in vivo. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin-1 mAb 2297, anti-caveolin-2 mAb 65, and anti-caveolin-3 mAb 26 (10, 11, 52) (gifts of Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez, BD Transduction Laboratories, Inc.); anti-caveolin-1 pAb N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-p42/44 pAb and phospho-specific anti-p42/44 pAb (New England Biolabs); anti-β-tubulin mAb TUB-2.1 and anti-β-actin mAb AC-15 (Sigma). A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially as follows: cell culture reagents and the LipofectAMINE liposomal transfection reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. Genomic clones containing the murine Cav-1 locus were isolated from a 129/Sv(J1) λ-phage genomic library (53Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 54Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) by using probes corresponding to the murine Cav-1 cDNA. The genomic organization of the locus was determined by subcloning portions of these genomic inserts into the vector pBS-SK+ (Stratagene) and using Southern blotting to determine a detailed restriction map of the region (55Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One of the genomic clones (containing the first and second exons of Cav-1) was used to construct the targeting vector. Briefly, a 2.7-kbNotI-EcoRI fragment that is immediately 5′ to the first exon and a 2.1-kb BamHI-BamHI fragment that is immediately 3′ to the second exon of the cav-1 gene were used to flank the NEO cassette in the targeting vector pGT-N29 (New England Biolabs) (as shown in Fig. 1). WW6 ES cells (gift of Dr. Pamela Stanley (56Ioffe E. Liu Y. Bhaumik M. Poirier F. Factor S.M. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) were electroporated with the linearized targeting construct (40 μg) and selected with G418 (150 μg/ml of active component, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (57Edelmann W. Yang K. Umar A. Heyer J. Lau K. Fan K. Liedtke W. Cohen P.E. Kane M.F. Lipford J.R. Yu N. Crouse G.F. Pollard J.W. Kunkel T. Lipkin M. Kolodner R. Kucherlapati R. Cell. 1997; 91: 467-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination in 360 selected ES clones was assessed via Southern blot analysis. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with PstI orXbaI and hybridized with a 1.1-kbXbaI-SacI probe; Cav-1+/− clones produced an 8.0-kb wild-type and a 5.5-kb knockout band (PstI digest) or a 10.0-kb wild-type and a 4.0-kb knockout band (XbaI digest) (as shown in Fig. 1). Four Cav-1+/− ES clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and three gave rise to male chimeras with a significant ES cell contribution (as determined by an Agouti coat color). By mating with C57BL/6 females and genotyping of offspring tail DNA via Southern and PCR analysis, germ line transmission was confirmed for two separate clones (Fig. 1). F1 male and female heterozygous animals were interbred to obtain Cav-1-deficient animals. To facilitate the genotyping of all future mice, we also devised a 3-primer PCR-based screening strategy. The wild-type specific forward primer was derived from Cav-1 exon 2 (5′-GTGTATGACGCGCACACCAAG-3′); the knockout-specific forward primer was derived from the neomycin cassette (5′-CTAGTGAGACGTGCTACTTCC-3′), and the common reverse primer was derived from Cav-1 intron 2 (5′-CTTGAGTTCTGTTAGCCCAG-3′). PCR conditions were 95 °C/5 min, 35 cycles of (95 °C/1 min, 56 °C/1 min, 72 °C/1 min 20 s) and then 72 °C/7 min, which resulted in a ∼650-bp wild-type band and a ∼330-bp knockout band. Animals were analyzed at 2–4.5 months of age. Experiments were conducted under the direct supervision of the trained veterinarians of the Einstein Animal Institute, and animal protocols were approved by the Animal Use Committee. Primary MEFs were obtained from Day 13.5 embryos essentially as described (58Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J.

Briefly, embryos were decapitated, thoroughly minced, and trypsinized in 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min at 37 °C. Ten ml of complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.)) was used to inactivate the trypsin and resuspend the dissociated cells. Cells were plated on a 10-cm plate and cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. These “passage 1” cells were further propagated using a defined 3T3 passaging protocol (i.e. 3 × 105 cells were plated per 60-mm dish every 3 days). For all experiments early passage primary MEFs (<5) were used. To immortalize MEFs, cells were passaged according to the 3T3 protocol continuously until growth rates in culture resumed the rapid rates seen in early passage MEFs (i.e. Passage 25 cells and beyond). MEFs were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer post-fixed with OsO4, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. A cryotome was used to yield sections, and the samples were examined under a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope and photographed at a magnification of × 16,000 (59Sargiacomo M. Sudol M.

The cDNA encoding full-length caveolin-1 was subcloned into pCB7, a mammalian expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (62Song K.S. Tang Z.-L. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The cDNAs encoding GFP and GFP-Cav-1 (containing the full-length Cav-1 cDNA C-terminal to GFP) were as described previously (63Volonte D. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in their respective media and allowed to reach 80–90% confluency. Subsequently, they were washed with PBS and incubated with lysis buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 60 mm octyl glucoside) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and the volume required for 10 μg of protein was determined. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% BSA for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Pierce) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Caveolae-enriched membrane fractions were purified essentially as we described previously (59Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). 200 mg of lung tissue was placed in 2 ml of MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and solubilized by using quick 10-s bursts of a rotor homogenizer and passing 10 times through a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. The sample was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (prepared in MBS lacking Triton X-100), transferred to a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 30% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in MBS, lacking detergent). The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g (39,000 rpm in a Sorval rotor TH-641) for 16 h. A light scattering band was observed at the 5–30% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and 50-μl aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The procedure was performed as we described previously (17Li S. Couet J.

About 5% of peripheral blood T cells bear gammadelta TCRs, most of which recognize non-peptide phosphorylated antigens. Here we describe the 3.1 A resolution structure of a human gammadelta TCR from a T-cell clone that is phosphoantigen-reactive. The orientation of the variable (V) and constant (C) regions of the gammadelta TCR is unique when compared with alphabeta TCRs or antibodies, and results from an unusually small angle between the Vgamma and Cgamma domains. The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the V domains exhibit a chemically reasonable binding site for phosphorylated antigens, providing a possible explanation for the canonical usage of the Vgamma9 and Vdelta2 gene segments by phosphoantigen-reactive receptors. Although the gammadelta TCR V domains are similar in overall structure to those of alphabeta TCRs, gammadelta TCR C domains are markedly different. Structural differences in Cgamma and Cdelta, and in the location of the disulphide bond between them, may enable gammadelta TCRs to form different recognition/signalling complexes than alphabeta TCRs."

The dRP lyase activity of Pol λ, in coordination with its polymerization activity, efficiently repaired uracil-containing DNA in an in vitroreconstituted BER reaction.

Either happening spontaneously, induced by radiation, alkylating mutagens, or as the result of enzymatic processes, the loss of a base in DNA must be efficiently repaired to sustain cellular function (1Lindahl T.

BER is a multistep process that is initiated with the removal of the modified base by a DNA glycosylase (7McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), followed by incision by an AP endonuclease (8Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol.

Subsequently, the remaining dRP residue can be either removed by a dRP lyase activity or displaced by DNA polymerase action, leading to “single-nucleotide” or “long patch” repair, respectively (3Krokan H.E.

DNA polymerase β (Pol β) is a small (39 kDa) mammalian nuclear DNA polymerase likely involved in gap-filling synthesis during DNA repair (13Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA polymerization, Pol β was shown to contain an intrinsic dRP lyase activity (14Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence indicates that Pol β is the main mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of dRP groups (15Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Sobol R. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X. Horton J. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), a step that has proven to be limiting for efficient BER of lesions generated by monofunctional alkylating agents in vivo (16Sobol R. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X. Horton J. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pol β is thought to be almost fully responsible for DNA synthesis in single-nucleotide BER (17Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H.

The dRP lyase of Pol β resides in its N-terminal 8 kDa domain (14Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and has been shown to proceed through a β-elimination mechanism that involves a Schiff-base intermediate (23Piersen C.E.

Extensive mutagenesis studies carried out with Pol β have identified several amino acid residues critical for the different functions inherent to the 8-kDa domain (24Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y.

Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, Lys72 has been unequivocally determined as the nucleophile responsible for Schiff-base formation (26Deterding L.J. Prasad R. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Tomer K.B.

Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of these enzymes in the BER process remains to be elucidated. DNA polymerase λ (Pol λ) is a recently described eukaryotic DNA polymerase belonging to Pol X family. It is the closest homologue to Pol β, sharing 32% identity at the protein level (30Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M.

Based on three-dimensional structure modeling, Pol λ is predicted to have a Pol β-like core formed by two domains: a 31-kDa polymerase domain (with three subdomains, named fingers, palm, and thumb) and the 8-kDa domain (30Garcı́a-Dı́az M.

The predominant expression of Pol λ in testis has led to the hypothesis that Pol λ participates in meiotic recombination. This is further supported by immunolocalization of Pol λ in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes (30Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F.

We address here if Pol λ, as Pol β, is endowed with a dRP lyase activity, an activity essential for “short patch” BER in eukaryotic cells. Synthetic oligonucleotides purified by PAGE were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]ddATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was from Promega. Human recombinant Pol λ and Pol λ K310A mutant were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified nearly to homogeneity. The purified fractions were devoid of detectable nuclease activity.2 Purified human Pol β, hUDG, hAPE, and hligase I were generous gifts of Dr. S. H. Wilson (NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC). A 34-mer oligonucleotide containing uracil at position 16 (P6: 5′ CTGCAGCTGATGCGCUGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC 3′) was labeled at the 3′-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase using [α-32P]ddATP and annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide (T4: 5′ GTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG 3′). This labeled double-stranded substrate (300 nm) was treated with hUDG (100 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT to remove the uracil. After incubation, the mixture was supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 40 nm hAPE, thus generating the substrate for dRP lyase activity (Fig. 1 B). The labeled P6 was annealed to T4 oligonucleotide and treated with hUDG as described above. Following hUDG treatment, 340 mm NaBH4was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. The reduced DNA was then purified by ethanol precipitation and preincubated with hAPE prior to use. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 30 nm concentration of the labeled substrate described in the previous section. The reaction was initiated by adding different amounts of Pol λ or Pol β and incubated at 37 °C as indicated. After incubation, NaBH4 was added to a final concentration of 340 mm, and the reactions were kept for 20 min on ice. Stabilized (reduced) DNA products were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml of tRNA, resuspended in water, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 16% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Alternatively, normal AP DNA was substituted by equal amounts of a reduced substrate. Reactions were performed essentially as described for dRP lyase activity assays, but using a substrate that had not been preincised by AP endonuclease. After incubation, the samples were processed and analyzed as described above. 10-μl reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 nm concentration of the labeled substrate used for dRP lyase activity assays. Reactions were initiated by adding the indicated amounts of Pol λ or Pol β and 20 mm NaBH4 or 20 mm NaCl. After 30 min on ice, reactions were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and the trapped polymerase/DNA complex was visualized in a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. A 34-mer double-stranded DNA substrate was used that contained a G opposite a uracil at position 16. Reactions (10 μl) contained 250 nmsubstrate, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 2 μm dCTP or dTTP, 10 nm hUDG, 40 nm hAPE, 200 nm hLigase I, and 0.3 μm[α-32P]dCTP. Reactions were initiated by addition of different amounts of Pol λ or Pol β (100 nm and 5 nm, respectively) and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA, analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. Amino acid residues 240–575 of human Pol λ, the closest homologue of human Pol β, are predicted to form a Pol β-like fold, formed by two different domains: the 8-kDa domain and a 31-kDa polymerization domain, constituted by the “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains (13Beard W.A.

The 8-kDa domain of Pol β is responsible for single-stranded DNA binding, 5′-phosphate recognition and binding, and dRP lyase activity (for review, see Ref. 13Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). With the exception of African Swine Fever Virus PolX (35Oliveros M. Yañez R.J. Salas M.L. Salas J. Viñuela E. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30899-30910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this domain can be predicted by sequence comparison in all Pol X family enzymes, even though some of these proteins are known or presumed to lack dRP lyase activity (i.e. Pol μ, see below). Therefore, conservation of this domain suggests a more general function, perhaps related to its DNA binding capacity. Indeed, structural (36Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 37Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), cross-linking (38Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and kinetic studies (38Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the 8-kDa domain plays a major role in the positioning of the enzyme in gapped or nicked DNA templates. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the 8-kDa domain of human Pol λ (residues 240–325) bears a significant amino acid similarity (30% identity) with that of Pol β (residues 1–87). Moreover, the 8-kDa domain of human Pol β can be aligned with the same region of the other two human DNA polymerases belonging to the Pol X family: TdT (residues 154–239) and the recently described Pol μ (residues 142–227; Ref. 39Domı́nguez O. Ruiz J.F. Laı́n de Lera T. Garcı́a-Dı́az M. González M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martı́nez-A C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the region aligned, both TdT and Pol μ share only a 22% identity with Pol β. Extensive mutational analysis of the 8-kDa domain of Pol β has identified several amino acid residues critical for its different activities (24Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Strikingly, all Pol β residues proposed to play a role in dRP lyase catalysis (His34, Tyr39, Lys60, Lys68, Glu71, Lys72, and Glu84; shown in black boxes in Fig. 1 A) are identical or conserved in Pol λ, with the exception of Lys60. Most of these residues are absent from TdT or Pol μ. Particularly, Lys72, identified as the nucleophile in Pol β responsible for Schiff-base formation during β-elimination of the dRP moiety (26Deterding L.J. Prasad R. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Tomer K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10463-10471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is present in Pol λ (Lys310) but is lacking in the other two Pol X enzymes. Interestingly, Tyr39, suggested to play a role in both DNA binding, through base-stacking interactions (25Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and dRP lyase activity through the action of its hydroxyl residue (40Maciejewski M.W. Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), is conserved in Pol λ but substituted by a phenylalanine residue in TdT (Phe191) and Pol μ (Phe179). This is consistent with the lack of dRP lyase activity in these two enzymes and supports previous work by Maciejewski et al. (40Maciejewski M.W. Liu D. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, although an overall sequence similarity along the 8-kDa domain is shared by all human DNA polymerases of the Pol X family, the conservation of the identified Pol β dRP lyase catalytic residues only in Pol λ suggests a close functional relatedness between these two proteins. To test the ability of Pol λ to remove a dRP group, we used a 34-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue at position 16. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the uracil-containing strand was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP, annealed to its complementary strand, treated with hUDG to remove the uracil residue, and finally incubated with hAPE1 to release a dRP containing substrate (see scheme in Fig. 1 B). This substrate was incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of either Pol β or Pol λ. As shown in Fig. 1 C, both enzymes removed the dRP moiety, as detected by the reduction in size of the labeled substrate. Under these conditions, as indicated by an initial time course, the rate of dRP excision by Pol λ was ∼25% of the rate catalyzed by Pol β (data not shown). As predicted from the alignment shown in Fig. 1 A, Pol μ lacked significant dRP lyase activity (≤3% of the activity of Pol β, data not shown). The dRP lyase activity of Pol β proceeds through β-elimination, a mechanism that involves generation of a Schiff-base intermediate (23Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether this was also the case with Pol λ, we took advantage of the fact that sodium borohydride is able to reduce a Schiff-base intermediate to form a covalent protein-DNA complex. Therefore, if the mechanism of catalysis of Pol λ involves a Schiff-base intermediate, addition of sodium borohydride in a dRP lyase assay should allow trapping of a DNA-protein complex that should be detected by autoradiography after separation by SDS-PAGE. Fig.2 A shows the result of a borohydride trapping experiment, where a single labeled band of the expected size can clearly be seen migrating slower than the free DNA and presenting a different mobility for each polymerase-DNA complex. The appearance of this band was dependent on both the presence of either Pol β or Pol λ and on the presence of NaBH4. As a control of specificity, and in agreement with its lack of dRP lyase activity, no polymerase-DNA complex was seen when using Pol μ. These results suggest that the dRP removal activity of Pol λ proceeds through β-elimination. Therefore, it is very likely that Pol λ shares a common mechanism of catalysis with Pol β and other dRP lyases described. Further supporting this idea, Pol λ was unable to excise a reduced dRP residue, a substrate that is resistant to β-elimination (Fig. 1 C). Amino acid sequence comparison between Pol λ and Pol β (Fig. 1 A) suggests that the Pol λ residue Lys310 may be the nucleophile responsible for the Schiff-base formation during dRP lyase catalysis. Consequently, a single mutation at Lys310 (K310A) of Pol λ, although not affecting its DNA polymerization capacity (not shown), reduced dRP lyase activity to less than 10% of that observed with wild-type Pol λ (Fig. 1 C). As it has been suggested previously (24Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), Schiff-base formation likely involves a preferred nucleophile that, albeit with lower efficiency, could be substituted by other nearby alternate nucleophiles, thus accounting for the residual activity of the mutant. Accordingly, as described for the Pol β K72A mutant (23Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Schiff-base intermediate of the Pol λ K310A mutant was trapped with very low efficiency compared with the wild-type (Fig. 2 A). These results implicate Lys310 as the preferred Pol λ nucleophile involved in Schiff-base formation. Pol β has an intrinsic AP lyase activity, i.e. it is able to incise DNA on the 3′ side of an unincised AP site (41Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). AP lyase has been proposed to involve the same reaction mechanism as dRP lyase, suggesting involvement of the same catalytic residues (42Piersen C.E. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested Pol λ for AP lyase activity. Fig. 2 B shows that, unlike Pol β, Pol λ did not exhibit AP lyase activity. However, similar amounts of enzyme were proficient in both DNA polymerization and dRP excision (data not shown). Given the structural and functional similarities between Pol λ and Pol β, the presence or absence of AP lyase activity can be considered as a feature distinguishing these enzymes. Removal of a dRP residue is an essential step for completion of single-nucleotide BER. Pol β is able to efficiently promote in vitro BER of a uracil-containing duplex DNA in the presence of hUDG, hAPE, and DNA ligase I (43Nicholl I.D. Nealon K. Kenny M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (352) Google Scholar). After hUDG and hAPE action, the substrate is accessible for a DNA repair polymerase. Thus, as shown in Fig.3, two main products are observed in a Pol β-based reconstituted BER reaction. 1) A 16-mer product is generated by a single nucleotide insertion (labeled) at the 3′ terminus of the 5′-incised AP site without ligation. This product can correspond to two different repair intermediates (Fig. 3), in which the dRP residue is not (a) or is (b) excised. 2) A 34-mer product is also generated that corresponds to the complete repair of the DNA strand (c). This product, that originates from the 16-mer (b) product, requires that the dRP group be excised and strictly depends on DNA ligase addition (data not shown). We examined whether Pol λ could substitute for Pol β to promote repair of a BER intermediate. As shown in Fig. 3 B, addition of Pol λ and DNA ligase I also produced the same 16-mer- and 34-mer-labeled products. Therefore, Pol λ was able to coordinate both gap-filling and dRP excision steps of repair preceding DNA ligase action. These data are consistent with a role for human Pol λ in BER. Although Pol β is a crucial enzyme for single-nucleotide BER, it is well known that in its absence, single-base repair activity can be observed (18Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 45Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hübscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This implies that proteins other than Pol β exist in mammalian cells that are able to conduct single-nucleotide BER. As it has been shown recently, the dRP lyase activity of Pol β, and not its DNA polymerization capacity, determines the sensitivity of Pol β-null fibroblasts to monofunctional DNA-methylating agents (16Sobol R. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X. Horton J. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This highlights the importance of the dRP removal step in vivo and suggests that a dRP lyase-containing enzyme like Pol λ could participate to some extent in single-nucleotide BER in vivo. This work describes a novel dRP lyase activity associated with DNA Pol λ, a β-like polymerase. Pol λ is the fourth polymerase in human cells, along with DNA polymerases β, γ, and ι, to exhibit this activity. Furthermore, as demonstrated for Pol γ (27Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12509-12514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ι (29Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), Pol λ can also substitute for Pol β in an in vitro BER reaction. These results suggest that Pol λ could participate in some form of BER in vivo. DNA polymerase β is the main DNA polymerase involved in BER of lesions generated by monofunctional alkylating agents in nuclear DNA in eukaryotic cells (17Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The three other polymerases may be involved in other types of BER that are differentiated by lesion or location in the cell. For example, the biochemical properties of pol ι suggest that it could be involved in repairing uracil present in DNA due to incorporation of dUTP during DNA replication or in maintaining the stability of G·C base pairs upon deamination of 5-methyl-C (29Bebenek K. Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Woodgate R. Kunkel T. Science. 2001; 291: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase γ is the only DNA polymerase found in mitochondria, suggesting that it may conduct BER of damaged mitochondrial DNA (27Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,28Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12509-12514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the relative contribution to BER of DNA polymerases with intrinsic dRP lyase activities may depend on their expression levels, perhaps related to different stages of the cell cycle or particular developmental processes or cell types. For example, Pol λ may play an active role in DNA repair synthesis in spermatogenic cells (30Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M.

Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), where high levels of BER activity have been described (46Intano G.W. McMahan C.A. Walter R.B. McCarrey J.R. Walter C.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on unique features such as its BRCT domain that likely mediates specific protein-protein interactions, Pol λ may be recruited to specific BER subpathways that are not accessible to Pol β. Interestingly, we have recently observed that Pol λ performs a limited but significant strand displacement synthesis on gapped DNA substrates,2 a capacity that would be essential to allow the participation of Pol λ in long patch BER. This issue, however, remains to be ascertained. Being or not restricted to certain tissues or specific transactions, the participation of Pol λ during BER should be further investigated and considered when trying to get a full picture of DNA repair. We thank Drs. Samuel Wilson and Rajendra Prasad for providing human BER enzymes and Dr. Rosario Sabariegos for help with expression and purification of human Pol λ. We are also grateful to Drs. William Beard, Rajendra Prasad, and Margarita Salas for critical reading of the manuscript."

Their function in the central nervous system is less documented. An important role of ASICs in signal transduction associated with local pH variations during normal neuronal activity has been proposed (27Krishtal O.A. Osipchuk Y.V. Shelest T.N. Smirnoff S.V.

They might also be involved in pathological situations such as brain ischemia and epilepsy that produce significant extracellular acidification.Some ASICs are expressed in brain regions that contain large amounts of chelatable Zn2+. For instance, presynaptic vesicles of glutamatergic hippocampal terminals contain Zn2+ in up to millimolar concentrations (29Slomianka L.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the structural determinants of Zn2+coactivation in the extracellular loop of the ASIC2a subunit. We have identified two histidine residues, His-162 and His-339, that are essential for the Zn2+ potentiating effect, but also another histidine residue, His-72, which causes a large shift in pH sensitivity of ASIC2a when mutated and could be an important component of the pH sensor. Acid-sensing ionicchannels (ASICs)1are H+-gated cation channels expressed in sensory neurons and in neurons of the central nervous system.

Both ASIC1a and ASIC1b mediate fast inactivating currents upon modest but rapid acidification of the external medium. ASIC2a is substantially expressed in the brain, whereas its variant ASIC2b is present in both brain and sensory neurons. ASIC2b has no activity on its own but can form functional heteromers with other ASIC subunits and particularly ASIC3 (7Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R.

We show here that YidC is involved in the translocation but not in the targeting of the Procoat protein, because we found the protein was partitioned into the membrane in the absence of YidC. YidC can function also to promote membrane insertion of Procoat mutants that insert independently of the membrane potential, proving that the effect of YidC depletion is not due to a dissipation of the membrane potential. We also found that YidC is absolutely required for Sec-dependent translocation of a long periplasmic loop of a mutant Procoat in which the periplasmic region has been extended from 20 to 194 residues. Furthermore, when Sec-dependent membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains were overproduced under YidC-limited conditions, we found that the exported proteins pro-OmpA and pre-peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein accumulated in the cytoplasm. This suggests for Sec-dependent proteins that YidC functions at a late stage in membrane insertion, after the Sec translocase interacts with the translocating membrane protein. These studies are consistent with the understanding that YidC cooperates with the Sec translocase for membrane translocation and that YidC is required for clearing the protein-conducting channel.

Recently, a new protein component called YidC has been identified to play a key role in the membrane insertion of bacterial proteins (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). YidC is the bacterial homologue of mitochondrial Oxa1p, shown to mediate insertion of proteins from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane (24Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W.

Using a YidC depletion strain, YidC was shown to be absolutely essential for the insertion of the M13 Procoat protein into the Escherichia coli inner membrane (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F.

YidC appeared less important for insertion of proteins that require the Sec translocase, although it was needed for efficient transfer. During membrane insertion YidC makes contact with membrane-spanning regions of nascent chains of FtsQ (12Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and leader peptidase (14Houben E.N. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.L. Oudega B. Luirink J.

Indeed, it was found that some YidC copurifies with the Sec translocase (12Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined in more detail the role of YidC in the membrane biogenesis of the M13 Procoat protein. In cells where YidC was depleted, the localization of Procoat was analyzed by fractionation and protease mapping techniques. We tested whether a Procoat mutant that inserts in the absence of an electrochemical membrane potential (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) requires YidC. Procoat mutants that utilize a Sec-dependent insertion pathway were also investigated. We show that Procoat can partition into the membrane even in the absence of YidC, demonstrating that YidC is not a membrane receptor. We also show that Procoat mutants require YidC even if they insert in a potential independent or in a Sec-dependent manner. Interestingly, we observed an interfering effect on OmpA and PAL1 export when YidC is depleted and when a Sec-dependent Procoat protein with a long periplasmic loop is overexpressed, consistent with the idea that the absence of YidC causes jamming within the Sec translocase. The E. coliJS7131 YidC depletion strain is from our laboratory collection (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E.

Amino acids, lysozyme, and azide were from Sigma. Tran35S-label, a mixture of 85% [35S]methionine and 15% [35S]cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol, was from ICN. JS7131, the YidC depletion strain, bearing plasmids encoding Procoat or Procoat-Lep derivatives, was grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose. To deplete cells of YidC, cells were grown for 3 h in glucose. Prior to labeling, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in prewarmed M9 medium containing glucose or arabinose. After 30 min, Procoat and Procoat-Lep derivatives were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 5 min. Cells were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine for 20 s and chased for various times. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to Procoat, leader peptidase (which recognizes Procoat-Lep), OmpA, or PAL and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (30Ito K. Date T. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2123-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell fractionation experiments were performed with sodium carbonate to determine whether Procoat H5 or the Procoat-Lep protein can partition into the membrane when YidC is absent. Cultures (1 ml) of JS7131 bearing Procoat or Procoat-Lep were grown in LB media supplemented with glucose or arabinose and were then switched to M9 media and prepared for labeling as described in the signal peptidase processing assay. IPTG (1 mm) was added for 5 min prior to labeling to induce Procoat or Procoat-Lep. Unless otherwise stated, cells were pulse-labeled for 30 s with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and chased with nonradioactive methionine for 2 min. Samples were chilled on ice and centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of spheroplast buffer (33 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40% sucrose). Lysozyme (5 μg/ml, final concentration) and EDTA (1 mm, final concentration) were added for 15 min. Then 400 μl of water and 700 μl of sodium carbonate (pH 11.5, 0.2 m final concentration) were added, and the samples were vortexed vigorously. After lysis, the sample was centrifuged (110,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fraction. The supernatant and membrane fractions were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, analyzed by immunoprecipitation using antiserum against Procoat, leader peptidase (which precipitates Procoat-Lep), and GroE/Band X (a cytoplasmic control), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Previously, we have shown that the M13 Procoat protein cannot insert across the membrane to expose the central loop into the periplasmic space when YidC is depleted from the cell (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This suggests that M13 Procoat protein is blocked either for partitioning or for the translocation step in the membrane insertion pathway. To investigate in which step yidC is involved, we examined whether the Procoat mutant H5, which spans the membrane twice (see Fig.1; H5 has the same topology as uncleaved Procoat), can integrate into the membrane of JS7131 cells when YidC is depleted. The mutant H5 has an amino acid substitution in the leader sequence at position −3 from Ser to Phe, which prevents cleavage by leader peptidase (31Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15914-15918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Procoat protein remains in the uncleaved form independently of the presence or absence of YidC. To analyze whether Procoat H5 is in the membrane or cytoplasmic fraction, JS7131 cells were pulse-labeled for 1 min with [35S]methionine and chased with nonradioactive methionine (Fig. 2 A). Samples were treated with sodium carbonate, and the membrane was pelleted. When cells were grown with arabinose to express YidC, nearly all of the Procoat was found in the pellet fraction after carbonate extraction. When the cells were grown under YidC deficient conditions (+glucose medium), the majority of the Procoat protein was also in the pellet. This is in contrast to procoat mutants that do not bind to the membrane surface which accumulate in the soluble fraction (32Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a control, we show that the cytoplasmic protein GroE was found mainly in the supernatant. Similarly, the wild-type Procoat protein that accumulated under YidC-depleted conditions fractionated in the membrane pellet (data not shown). In addition, a Procoat mutant protein, Procoat-lep (PCLep, Fig. 1), in which the cytoplasmic region is extended by 103 amino acids of the P2 domain of leader peptidase (27Kuhn A. Wickner W. Kreil G. Nature. 1986; 322: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was analyzed for partitioning into the membrane (Fig. 2 B). Under YidC-depleted conditions the precursor of Procoat-Lep accumulated and was found in about equal amounts in the supernatant and pellet. This shows that Procoat-Lep can partition into the membrane, although the P2 domain increases the solubility of the protein. In addition, Band X, a cytosolic protein, was found in the supernatant fraction. Taken together, this clearly indicates that the targeting of Procoat to the membrane is not affected substantially by the absence of YidC.Figure 2Procoat and Procoat-Lep partition into the membrane in the absence of YidC. Supernatant and pellet fractions derived from JS7131 cells either expressing YidC or depleted of YidC were analyzed for Procoat H5 and Procoat-Lep. Cultures containing pMS119 with Procoat H5 or Procoat-Lep were grown for 3.5 h in the presence of 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose after a 1 to 50 back-dilution of an overnight culture. Procoat H5 or Procoat-Lep was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 5 min. For the Procoat H5 study, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min and chased for 5 min. For PCLep, the cells were labeled for 30 s and chased for 2 min. After labeling, the cells were lysed by adding sodium carbonate (0.2 m, pH 11.5). The sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant and pellet were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. After immunoprecipitation of Procoat H5 using Procoat antiserum (A) and Procoat-Lep (B) using leader peptidase antiserum (which recognizes the Lep domain), samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As a control, the samples were analyzed for the location of the cytoplasmic GroE (A) and band X proteins (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In mitochondria, most of the proteins that are inserted into the inner membrane in an Oxa1p-dependent manner require the membrane electrochemical potential (33Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether YidC, the bacterial Oxa1p homologue, can promote insertion of Procoat proteins that insert independently of the membrane potential. Mutants of Procoat-Lep have been studied extensively to examine the importance of the membrane electrochemical potential in membrane insertion (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The extension of the Procoat with the Lep P2 domain allowed us to immunoprecipitate a wide variety of Procoat mutants, which are not recognized by the Procoat antisera. We investigated whether a mutant Procoat-Lep with a net charge of zero in the periplasmic loop (0PClep) still requires YidC for insertion. 0PCLep has been shown previously to insert independently of an electrochemical potential (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows that 0PCLep is inhibited under conditions in which YidC is depleted, while in the presence of YidC, 0PCLep inserts across the membrane and is processed by leader peptidase. Likewise, the potential-independent Procoat-Lep mutant, PCLep (0) (29Schuenemann T.A. Delgado-Nixon V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6855-6864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), without any charged residues in the periplasmic region was also dependent on YidC (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, wild-type Procoat-Lep, which has five charged residues in the periplasmic region and requires the membrane potential for optimal translocation, depends on YidC more extensively than the potential-independent mutants (Fig. 3 C). This demonstrates that YidC function is not limited to membrane potential-dependent substrates, and the effects of YidC depletion are not due to a dissipation of the potential. We also investigated whether Procoat mutants that show an increased dependence on the membrane potential (as compared with wild-type Procoat) require YidC. Procoat-Lep with an additional glutamyl residue has a net charge of −4 in the periplasmic loop and is completely blocked for membrane translocation in the absence of the electrochemical potential (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 D shows that the membrane insertion of −4PCLep was inhibited in the YidC depletion strain. Therefore, both potential-dependent and -independent Procoat mutants require YidC for insertion. We investigated the YidC requirement for a Sec-dependent Procoat mutant, termed Procoat-828 (Fig. 1), in which the periplasmic loop was lengthened by a 174-amino acid OmpA fragment (20Kuhn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previously we found that YidC is absolutely required only for Sec-independent membrane proteins, whereas Sec-dependent proteins like leader peptidase or ProW are much less affected by YidC depletion (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To our surprise, Procoat-828 was substantially affected for the translocation of the large central loop across the membrane into the periplasm. Fig.4 A shows that Procoat-828 membrane insertion is severely inhibited under YidC-depleted conditions, but Procoat-828 is translocated normally when ample YidC is present. To determine whether Procoat-828 requires YidC because of the presence of the membrane anchor region, we constructed Procoat-828ΔH2 with the membrane anchor deleted. Fig. 4 B shows that this mutant was equally affected by YidC depletion. For both mutants Procoat-828 and Procoat-828ΔH2, we observed that the export of pro-OmpA across the membrane was hindered when YidC was depleted. Previous studies showed that the signal peptide processing of several Procoat mutants (for example, −3MPCLep and −5PCLep) was slightly inhibited by sodium azide (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Azide has been shown to be an inhibitor of the SecA activity (34Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The results suggested that these mutants require SecA function for optimal insertion. Cells bearing −3MPCLep were pulse-labeled for 20 s and chased for the indicated times in media containing glucose or arabinose (Fig.4 C). The mutant protein −3MPCLep was rapidly inserted across the membrane and processed by leader peptidase when expressed in the presence of ample YidC. However, the membrane insertion of −3MPCLep was completely blocked when expressed in cells with deficient levels of YidC. Similar results were found with the −5PCLep mutant (Fig. 4 D). In contrast to the results with overexpression of Procoat-828, there was no significant effect on OmpA export when the −3MPCLep and −5PCLep mutants were overexpressed in YidC-depleted cells. A delayed processing of pro-OmpA was observed after overexpression of Procoat-828 (Fig. 4) and was also observed in a YidC-depleted strain when the Sec-dependent ProW-Lep or leader peptidase was overexpressed (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This indirect effect on OmpA export is probably due to jamming of the Sec translocase caused by increased traffic of a Sec-dependent membrane protein that becomes stalled in the absence of YidC. To explore this jamming phenomenon further, we investigated whether it was linked to the rate of expression. Two cultures of JS7131 carrying pMS119-lep were grown under conditions to deplete YidC. Only the culture induced with IPTG for 10 min to overexpress leader peptidase displayed an effect on OmpA export (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, when we used another lot of OmpA antisera, we observed that the overexpression of leader peptidase (+IPTG) also caused delayed processing of pre-peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL). (Fig.5 B). The identity of PAL was verified by immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to PAL (Fig. 5 C). PAL, an outer membrane protein (35Hellman J. Loiselle P.M. Tehan M.M. Allaire J.E. Boyle L.A. Kurnick J.T. Andrews D.M. Sik Kim K. Warren H.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2566-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), translocates across the inner membrane in a Sec-dependent fashion, because its export is strongly inhibited by 2 mm azide, an inhibitor of SecA (Fig.5 C). To show that the jamming effect within the Sec translocase is specific to the overexpression of a membrane protein that depends on YidC, we tested whether expression of maltose binding protein (MBP) affects export of OmpA. Two cultures of JS7131 bearing the plasmid encoding preMBP were grown under conditions to deplete YidC. When IPTG was added to overexpress the YidC-independent (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) periplasmic protein MBP, no accumulation of pro-OmpA was observed as compared with uninduced cells (Fig. 5 D). Accumulation of preproteins was observed only when Procoat-828 or Lep was overexpressed. Therefore, the block in OmpA export is specific to overexpression of a Sec-dependent membrane protein with a large periplasmic domain. The absence of YidC thus causes a secondary effect on Sec-mediated protein export. In mitochondria, Oxa1p, the YidC homologue, plays a key role in the insertion of proteins from the matrix into the membrane (24Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,36Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Most of the substrate proteins that use Oxa1p require the electrochemical membrane potential for insertion (33Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because mitochondria lack Sec homologues (37Glick B.S. Von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the Oxa1 pathway may correspond to the Sec-independent pathway in bacteria (38Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which is distinct from the bacterial preprotein translocase pathway (39Wickner W. Leonard M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29514-29516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, the bacterial homologue of Oxa1p, YidC, has been discovered to be absolutely essential for the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 Procoat protein. Similar to the mitochondrial membrane proteins, the membrane insertion of the Procoat protein requires the electrochemical membrane potential (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In this report, we have tested whether the YidC pathway functions only with substrates that require the membrane electrochemical potential for insertion. To carry out this test, we examined two Procoat mutants, which previously have been shown to insert independent of the electrochemical membrane potential (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Schuenemann T.A. Delgado-Nixon V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6855-6864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that membrane insertion of both mutants is YidC-dependent (Fig. 3,A and B); this demonstrates that the effect of YidC depletion on the membrane insertion of Procoat is not because of dissipation of the membrane potential. A possible role of YidC for the membrane insertion of Procoat is that it may be necessary for hydrophobic partitioning of Procoat into the membrane or for the translocation event across the membrane. In the absence of YidC, we found that a significant amount of the Procoat protein and also Procoat-Lep fractionated with the membrane under alkaline conditions (Fig. 2), suggesting that YidC is not involved in the targeting and partitioning steps of the Procoat protein but rather in the translocation event across the membrane. This translocation step is known to depend on the electrochemical membrane potential (40Date T. Goodman J.M. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4669-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)-treated cells, the Procoat protein partitions into the membrane but is not translocated (32Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Procoat mutants that have a zero net charge within the periplasmic residues were found to insert independently of the membrane potential (26Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These Procoat mutants still require YidC for the translocation step. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of how YidC supports membrane translocation is not linked to the action of the membrane potential. We also show here that YidC is absolutely required for the insertion of the Sec-dependent mutant Procoat-828 (Fig. 4 A). This protein contains a 194-amino acid residue periplasmic loop that is followed by the membrane anchor. These results confirm that YidC plays a key role not only for Sec-independent proteins but also for Sec-dependent proteins. It is interesting that YidC can play a more critical role for Procoat-828 than for the Sec-dependent leader peptidase or for ProW-Lep (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We ruled out the possibility that this difference is because Procoat-828 has a C-terminal membrane anchor, whereas leader peptidase and ProW-Lep have a hydrophilic domain that is released to the periplasm. We found that Procoat-828, even missing the membrane anchor in the mature region of the protein, still inserts in a YidC-dependent manner. This finding was surprising because the protein should have behaved as a secretory protein; previously we have shown that secretory proteins are unaffected by YidC depletion (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the Procoat-828 proteins with or without the membrane anchor is recognized by YidC through the leader sequence; this is being tested currently. The results presented in this paper are consistent with YidC having two functions. First, YidC functions to insert Sec-independent proteins and in certain cases can also make insertion more efficient for Sec-dependent proteins (Fig. 4 B). This may not be a general function, as YidC was not required for export of several preproteins (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Second, YidC may function to facilitate the movement of a hydrophobic domain of a membrane protein from within the Sec channel into the lipid bilayer. Although proOmpA and pre-PAL are translocated normally by the Sec translocase in the absence of YidC, when a Sec-dependent membrane protein was overexpressed (23Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) these exported proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm. The inhibition of the Sec translocase may arise because the hydrophobic domains of a Sec-dependent membrane protein cannot efficiently leave the Sec translocase in the absence of YidC and therefore may cause jamming of the translocase resulting in an accumulation of the preprotein in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with recent work described by Luirink and co-workers (41Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which demonstrates that there is a sequential interaction of a nascent membrane protein with SecY and YidC. Jamming of the translocase because of YidC depletion may also occur when a hydrophilic domain blocks the Sec channel, as is the case for Procoat-828ΔH2. Also, for the Sec-dependent Procoat mutants −3MPCLep and −5PCLep, we observed no jamming. This is possibly because the 20-residue hydrophilic domain is too short to block the Sec channel. The proposed function that YidC supports the translocation of transmembrane segments into the bilayer is similar to the proposed function of translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM) protein, an integral component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (42Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). TRAM, like YidC, was found to be associated with the transmembrane segment of a protein during its integration into the bilayer (43Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 44Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Like YidC, it is a multispanning membrane protein that may function to insert hydrophobic regions into the bilayer. The close cooperation of YidC and Sec in bacteria and TRAM and Sec61 in the endoplasmic reticulum would predict cooperation between the Sec components and the YidC homologue Albino3 in chloroplasts. However, recent data have show that antibodies to the stromal domain of Albino3 blocks translocation of LHCP but has no effect on the translocation of Sec-dependent luminal proteins of the thylakoid (45Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that YidC is involved directly in the translocation step of an inserting membrane protein and is not involved in targeting of the Sec-independent protein Procoat. Second, we have also ruled out that the observed accumulation of Procoat after YidC depletion is simply a result of the loss of the membrane electrochemical potential. For example, YidC is also required for the insertion of two Procoat mutants that do not require the membrane potential for insertion. Third, we find that YidC plays an essential role for the insertion of a Sec-dependent Procoat mutant in which the periplasmic domain is lengthened. Fourth, we find that overproduction of Sec-dependent membrane proteins in the absence of YidC leads to jamming of the Sec translocase, which has an inhibitory effect on protein export. We thank Judith Hellman for providing antibody against PAL and a plasmid overproducing PAL."

Furthermore, activators (phorbol esters and forskolin) and inhibitors (Ro 31-8220 and H89) of protein kinase C or A, respectively, exhibit differential effects on NKA binding and associated responses; activated protein kinase C facilitates a switch between calcium and cAMP responses, whereas activation of protein kinase A diminishes cAMP responses. NK2 receptors thus adopt multiple activatable, active, and desensitized conformations with low, intermediate, or high affinities and with distinct signaling specificities.

NK2 receptors thus adopt multiple activatable, active, and desensitized conformations with low, intermediate, or high affinities and with distinct signaling specificities. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate neurokinin A phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C protein kinase A N-[2((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)- ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide Texas Red mitogen-activated protein enhanced green fluorescent protein 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid Signaling by G protein-coupled receptors takes place through transient interactions between different proteins, the receptor, GTP-binding proteins, and effector enzymes or channels. Each interaction constitutes potential branching for multiple response pathways with different time courses, targets, and regulatory processes (1Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Depending on the activated signaling pathway, cell responsiveness has been shown to be regulated at the level of the receptor itself and/or at the level of one of the intracellular effectors. For example, Gq-mediated intracellular calcium release declines as a result of IP31 receptor inactivation (8Honda Z. Takano T. Hirose N. Suzuki T. Muto A. Kume S. Mikoshiba K. Itoh K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4840-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the receptor can be subject directly to short or long term regulations that play determinant roles in the control of olfaction, vision, or neurotransmission in mammals (9Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), for example. The most prevalent mechanisms for short term regulation of G protein-coupled receptors involve their phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor protein kinases or second messenger-dependent protein kinases such as protein kinases A (PKA) or C (PKC). Such regulation, which generally leads to termination of one signaling pathway, may turn on alternative intracellular responses (Gs to Gi). Subsequent interactions of the phosphorylated receptors with arrestins constitute the initial step for receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits and also lead to scaffolding complexes that activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade (2Daaka Y.

The possibility that receptors exist in multiple active states is documented by a growing body of experimental evidence. Distinct agonists of opioid receptors differentially stimulate receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis (10Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar); cholecystokinin receptor antagonists lead to receptor internalization without promoting its phosphorylation (11Roettger B.F. Ghanekar D. Rao R. Toledo C. Yingling J. Pinon D. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 357-362PubMed Google Scholar); and phosphorylation of the angiotensin receptor occurs in a conformation that differs from the active state (12Thomas W.G. Qian H. Chang C.S.

Although theoretical descriptions of G protein-coupled receptors within a framework of multiple conformational states have been reported (13Leff P. Scaramellini C. Law C. McKechnie K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 355-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), very few experimental approaches were developed to address this issue in dynamic terms.

Stimulation of these receptors by selective agonists leads to multiple intracellular events such as elevation of intracellular calcium concentration through phospholipase C activation, stimulation of cyclic AMP formation, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, or stimulation of phospholipases (3DeFea K.A.

Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we have described a fluorescent NK2 receptor labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) that allows simultaneous real time recording of ligand binding and calcium responses to be carried out in living cells. We showed that two natural agonists, NKA and its truncated form, NKA-(4–10) (24Theodorsson-Norheim E. Jornvall H. Andersson M. Norheim I. Oberg K. Jacobsson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), differed in that NKA triggers rapidly desensitizing calcium responses, whereas repetitive NKA-(4–10) administration did not alter cell responsiveness (23Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Nemeth K. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27601-27605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that at least part of response desensitization to NKA was due to lack of receptor responsiveness. In this study, we further analyze the action of the two agonist peptides, NKA and NKA-(4–10), fluorescently labeled with Texas Red. Monitoring ligand binding kinetics, time-resolved agonist-evoked calcium and cAMP responses, and sensitivity of binding and responses to protein kinase activators and inhibitors support a multistate receptor model with differential stabilization of discrete conformations of the receptor by NKA and NKA-(4–10). Two peptides, NKA (HKTDSFVGLM-NH2) and a cysteine-containing analog of NKA-(4–10) (DSFCGLM-NH2), were derivatized with iodoacetyl-C 5-Texas Red, purified as described (23Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and characterized as the mono-Texas Red derivative of neurokinin A (labeled on the N terminus and designated as TR1-NKA) or of neurokinin A-(4–10) (labeled at residue Cys-4 and designated as TR7-NKA-(4–10)) by spectrofluorometry and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-mass spectrometry (calculated molecular mass, 1865.3 daltons; determined as 1865.5 for TR1-NKA; calculated molecular mass, 1501.7 daltons; determined as 1501.8 for TR7-NKA-(4–10)). Preparation of HEK 293 cells expressing the EGFP-labeled fluorescent NK2 receptor and radioligand binding assays using [3H]SR 48968 were as described (23Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements from cell suspensions were made as described (23Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in Hepes buffer (in mm: 137.5 NaCl, 1.25 MgCl2, 1.25 CaCl2, 6 KCl, 5.6 glucose, 10 Hepes, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (bestatin, aprotinin, phosphoramidon, chymostatin, and leupeptin). Rapid kinetic experiments were carried out with an Applied Photophysics SK1E rapid mixing apparatus modified for rapid and non-damaging mixing of living cells. The valves located at syringe output were modified to allow linear liquid flow in a 2-mm internal diameter tubing that progressively decreased to 1 mm internal diameter. The mixing chamber was composed of a 1-mm internal diameter T-shaped Teflon connector. The observation chamber was a Hellma 176.002 (100 μl) quartz circulation cuvette placed on the cuvette holder of the SPEX fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in the photon counting mode (integration times 1–100 ms depending on ligand concentration) and were corrected for light flux variations with a reference photomultiplier measuring rhodamine fluorescence. All measurements were made at 21 °C. At a typical 12 bar air ram pressure the flow rate was 4 ± 0.5 ml/s. Cell counting before and after mixing indicated that less than 5% of the cells were damaged. Each measurement started after renewal of 7–8 times the volume of the observation cuvette. The dead volume (100 μl) and dead time of the apparatus (25 ± 5 ms) were experimentally determined. Such configuration of the mixing device typically allows measurement of fluorescence relaxations with apparent rate constants up to 10 s−1. Data were stored using the DM3000 software provided with the spectrofluorometer and analyzed with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) by various analytical expressions such as exponentials, sum of exponentials, or sum of exponentials and linear relationships (26Heidmann T. Changeux J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each relaxation process was characterized by the values of its amplitude and of its rate constant kapp. The uniqueness of the fit was checked by repeated calculations performed with distinct experimental data points (from several experiments) or with distinct values for the initiation of the fitting procedure. Some variations among different cell batches were noted but within modest limits. Linear kapp versus [ligand] relationships were analyzed according to a bimolecular interaction Scheme 1, R+L↔RL SCHEME 1and fitted using the corresponding Equation 1, kapp=k1×L+k−1Equation 1 where k1, the slope of the line, is the association rate constant, and k-1, the intercept with the ordinate, is the dissociation rate constant. Non-linear kapp versus [ligand] relationships were analyzed according to Scheme 2 comprising a bimolecular interaction followed by the interconversion to a second conformation, R+L↔RL↔R′L SCHEME 2and were fitted using the corresponding expression in Equation2, kapp=k2×(L/(L+KD))+k−2Equation 2 where KD is the dissociation constant for the formation of the RL complex, and k2is the forward and k-2 the backward rate constant of the equilibration between RL andR′L. Intracellular calcium elevation was recorded in triplicate with the rapid mixing apparatus, using indo-1 as the fluorescent probe and analyzed as described (27Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Comparison with binding was carried out on data obtained on the same day using unique cell and ligand batches. After preincubation for 15 min at 22 °C in the absence or presence of various agents (10 mm LiCl being systematically added during the last 5 min of preincubation), cells (2 × 106 cells per assay) were challenged for 30 s at 22 °C in the absence (basal level) or the presence of agonist. IP3 content was determined using a [3H]IP3 radioreceptor assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase was determined in 24-well plates as described (28Cailla H.L. Racine-Weisbuch M.S. Delaage M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Experimental binding curves were fit with either a two- or a three-state allosteric model as described (29Edelstein S.J. Schaad O. Henry E. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Biol. Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The theoretical model simulates ligand binding for a protein with 1–5 ligand-binding sites and 1–4 conformational states in a hierarchical cascade based on increasing affinity for ligand. The conformational states are in freely interconverting equilibria, such that all states are present in defined proportions in the absence of ligand, and their equilibria shift as a function of the kinetics of ligand binding. Each state is characterized by intrinsic ligand binding on- and off-rates and by interconversion rates between neighboring conformational states in the hierarchy that vary with site occupancy according to linear free energy relations. For any set of parameters, the differential equations for ligand binding are solved in the MATLAB computing environment using a program called STOIC. Synthetic peptides were obtained from Bachem or Neosystem. Forskolin, protein kinase activators and inhibitors, and protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. Fluorescent labels and ion chelators were from Molecular Probes. [3H]SR 48968 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The two natural peptide agonists, NKA and NKA-(4–10), have been fluorescently labeled with Texas Red. The fluorescent NKA labeled at position 1 is referred to as TR1-NKA. NKA-(4–10) is labeled at position 4 (i.e. position 7 of full-length NKA) after substitution of a glycine by a cysteine residue to yield the fluorescent compound hereafter referred to as TR7-NKA-(4–10). TR1-NKA and TR7-NKA-(4–10) both activate intracellular calcium responses upon interacting with the fluorescent NK2 receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells (Figs. 1 D and2 D). As in the case of their underivatized congeners, they trigger unique (TR1-NKA) or repetitive (TR7-NKA-(4–10)) responses when applied to cells as short pulses of 1 μm solutions (data not shown). In equilibrium binding experiments on cells, they displace the antagonist [3H]SR 48968 with apparent inhibition constants (TR1-NKA, KI = 100 ± 15 nm; TR7-NKA-(4–10), KI = 540 ± 170 nm), about 2-fold higher than those of unlabeled NKA (KI = 60 nm) and NKA-(4–10) (290 ± 65 nm).Figure 2Real time recording of TR1-NKA binding and associated calcium response carried out under the same experimental conditions described in the legend to Fig. 1.

The dotted lines are best fits obtained with two exponentials and relative rapid/slow amplitudes (in percent) equal to 35/65 (17 s), 28/72 (40 s), 15/85 (2 min), and 6/94 (15 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction of the two fluorescent peptides with the cell surface-expressed fluorescent NK2 receptor, when followed on a spectrofluorometer with excitation set at 470 ± 10 nm, is monitored as a decrease of EGFP emission at 510 nm due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer. This decrease of EGFP fluorescence is rapid (in the time range of seconds) with TR7-NKA-(4–10) (Fig.1 A) and exhibits fast (seconds) and slow (in the time range of minutes) components with TR1-NKA (Fig.2 A). At equilibrium, both peptides bind to a saturable number of receptor sites with apparent dissociation constants of KD = 9.4 ± 0.8 nm (TR1-NKA) and 37 ± 4 nm(TR7-NKA-(4–10)). At temperatures ranging from 10 to 21 °C, 95–100% of the interaction is reversed upon addition of an excess (10–20 μm) of the antagonist SR 48968 or of unlabeled NKA. We also observed previously (23Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that in the presence of agonist, fluorescent receptor molecules remain localized to the plasma membrane. Thus, slow processes such as internalization of receptor-ligand complexes are not likely to occur under the conditions of measurements reported here. The kinetics of the interaction of TR1-NKA and TR7-NKA-(4–10) with cells expressing EGFP-NK2 receptors were studied using a stopped-flow apparatus modified for cell mixing and equipped for fluorescence recording. Real time agonist binding (Fig. 1 Aand 2 A) and associated calcium responses (Fig. 1 Dand 2 D) were recorded in the same experiment, in successive mixings with alternate settings for EGFP or calcium detection. Binding traces (Fig. 1 A) can be analyzed with a single pseudo first-order relaxation (in the time range of seconds) plus a slow exponential drift found in control mixing with ligand-free buffer. This exponential drift, probably due to sedimentation of cells, takes place with a constant rate (0.05 ± 0.005 s−1) at all agonist concentrations. Its amplitude is constant up to 100 nm ligand and progressively increases beyond this concentration but remains within the experimental error for amplitude determination. Binding of TR7-NKA-(4–10) is therefore best described by a single exponential. The apparent rate constant of TR7-NKA-(4–10) can be followed up to the experimental limit of the equipment (2 μm). It increases linearly (Fig.1 B) with ligand concentration, with a slope equal to 5.3 ± 0.2 × 106m−1s−1 and an intercept with the ordinate at about 0.21 s−1, i.e. with a kinetically determinedKD value of about 40 nm. The association rate constant is close to that found for formyl peptide binding to its cognate receptor in neutrophils (30Neubig R.R. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 734-740PubMed Google Scholar, 31Posner R.G. Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). The amplitude of the fluorescence signal increases with increasing ligand concentration up to a plateau value around 600 nm. The plot of the amplitudes of EGFP fluorescence as a function of TR7-NKA-(4–10) (Fig. 1 F) can be fitted with the empirical Hill equation to yield a dissociation constant of 43 ± 8 nm (n = 3) and a Hill coefficient of 1.02 ± 0.06, in overall good agreement with equilibrium and kinetic measurement data. Dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes, obtained at equilibrium with 260 nmTR7-NKA-(4–10), was initiated by rapid mixing with a large excess (20 μm) of the antagonist SR 48968 (Fig. 1 C). Identical dissociation relaxations were obtained for preincubation times (association step) lasting from 1 to 10 min. They were not satisfactorily described by a single exponential time course but were best represented using a sum of two exponentials revealing a rapid process (koff = 0.5 ± 0.02 s−1) representing ∼40% of the amplitude and a slow (koff = 0.08 ± 0.004 s−1) dissociation step. Intracellular calcium responses (Fig. 1 D) exhibit maximum amplitudes that are nearly identical within the agonist concentration range that allows significant receptor occupancy to be detected (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the delay (time to peak) and the rate at which intracellular calcium concentrations rise follow inverse proportionality with ligand concentration. Responses were therefore analyzed as described by Horn and Marty (27Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar), i.e. as the time required to reach half-maximal response using the peak of the first derivative of each response trace (Fig. 1 E) as a measure of the delay of the response. A plot of the reciprocal of response delays versusligand concentration superimposes with the corresponding amplitude of receptor fluorescence extinction (Fig. 1 F). The EC50 value (≈45 nm) derived from fitting the plot of delays as a function of ligand concentration is in good agreement with TR7-NKA-(4–10) binding affinity. It thus appears that the rate of intracellular calcium elevation correlates with the extent of receptor occupancy. The experimental data show that association of TR7-NKA-(4–10) with the receptor can be described in terms of a simple bimolecular reaction that is correlated with activation of the calcium response. However, two populations of receptors sites appear to be occupied by the ligand at equilibrium, as reflected by the biphasic ligand dissociation curves. Analysis of TR1-NKA binding traces reveals two pseudo-first order relaxation processes that account for more than 95% of the signal and will be referred to as rapid and slow binding steps. This relaxation process develops in the millisecond to second time range (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with a bimolecular reaction scheme, its apparent rate increases linearly with ligand concentration (Fig. 2 B), with a slope equal to 2 ± 0.1 × 106m−1 s−1, and can be followed up to the limit of the equipment (3 μm). The intercept with the ordinate axis (≈0.04 s−1) gives an estimate of the dissociation rate constant for the rapid relaxation. The amplitude of the rapid relaxation increases with ligand concentration (Fig. 3 A) and reaches a plateau above 200 nm. Fitting of the plot of amplitudes versus ligand concentration with the empirical Hill equation yields a KD value of 20 ± 4 nm and a Hill coefficient close to unity (1.07 ± 0.05). The slow relaxation process develops in the second to minute time range. The variation of the amplitude of this signal increases with TR1-NKA concentration and reaches a plateau value beyond 100 nm (Fig. 3 B). Half-maximal amplitude is obtained with ligand concentrations in the 3–4 nmrange. The apparent rate constant for this relaxation does not increase linearly with TR1-NKA concentration but tends to reach a plateau value (≈0.05 s−1) at high ligand concentration (Fig.2 C). A simple kinetic scheme, involving the binding of TR1-NKA to the receptor, followed by a rate-limiting isomerization toward a higher affinity state, fits the data (Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures”). The experimental rate constants (kapp) can be adequately fit by Equation 2 to give an estimate of the dissociation constant of the initial binding step (best fit obtained with KD = 190 ± 80 nm), of the intrinsic forward rate of interconversion (k2 = 0.042 ± 0.09 s−1), and of the backward rate of interconversion (k-2 = 0.005 ± 0.002 s−1). Dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes obtained at equilibrium (≥20 min) with 100 or 300 nm TR1-NKA was monitored after rapid mixing with excess NKA (10 μm). The dissociation traces obtained are best described by a single exponential relaxation (Fig. 2 E) with a rate constant (0.0055 ± 0.0002 s−1) indicating that TR1-NKA apparently occupies a single category of high affinity sites at equilibrium. In contrast, TR1-NKA dissociates faster when preincubation times are shorter (Fig. 2 F). Dissociation traces obtained after 17- and 40-s and 2- and 15-min incubations of the receptor with 50 nm TR1-NKA are satisfactorily represented with two exponentials comprising a slow step with a rate constant identical to that determined after equilibrium binding (0.0055 ± 0.0002 s−1) and a rapid step with a 6-fold higher apparent rate constant (0.03 ± 0.01 s−1). These two steps exhibit different proportions depending on the time of incubation; after 17 s of binding, rapid dissociation represents more than 30% of total signal amplitude, and after 15 min, it represents less than 10% of the dissociation signal, supporting the hypothesis that stabilization of the receptor in a high affinity state occurs during prolonged exposure to TR1-NKA. As noted above with TR7-NKA-(4–10), intracellular calcium responses to TR1-NKA reach maximal amplitudes for partial receptor sites occupancies (Fig.2 D). The plot of the reciprocal of response delaysversus ligand concentration yields an EC50 value of ≈15 nm. Superimposition of the rapid binding amplitudes (Fig. 3 A) or the slow binding amplitudes (Fig.3 B) with the reciprocal of response delays clearly illustrates a better correlation between rapid binding an"
https://openalex.org/W1981240931,"Competitive interactions between plants determine the success of individuals and species. In developing forests, competition for light is the predominant factor. Shade tolerators acclimate photosynthetically to low light and are capable of long-term survival under the shade cast by others, whereas shade avoiders rapidly dominate gaps but are overtaken in due course by shade-tolerant, later successional species. Shade avoidance results from the phytochrome-mediated perception of far-red radiation (700-800 nm) scattered from the leaves of neighbours, provides early warning of shading, and induces developmental responses that, when successful, result in the overgrowth of those neighbours. Shade tolerators cast a deep shade, whereas less-tolerant species cast light shade, and saplings tend to have high survivorship in shade cast by conspecific adults, but high rates of mortality when shaded by more-tolerant species. Here we report a parallel relationship in which the shade-avoidance responses of three tree species are inversely proportional to proximity signals generated by those species. On this basis, early successional species generate small proximity signals but react strongly to them, whereas late successional species react weakly but generate strong signals."

(2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 20896–20902). In the current study, we examined the genomic structure of the mouse AQPap gene and its regulation by insulin. The mouse AQPap gene spanned 12 kilobase pairs in chromosome 4 and consisted of 8 exons and 7 introns. The first two exons, designated exon 1 and exon 1′, are alternatively spliced to common exon 2, and thus the AQPap gene possessed two potential promoters. The exon 1-derived transcript is dominant in both adipose tissues and adipocytes on the basis of RNase protection assay and promoter analysis. The mRNA increased after fasting and decreased with refeeding. Insulin deficiency generated by streptozotocin enhanced the mRNA in adipose tissue. Insulin down-regulated AQPap mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The AQPap promoter contained heptanucleotide sequences, TGTTTTT at −443/−437, similar to the insulin-response element identified previously in the promoters of insulin-repressed genes. Deletion and single base pair substitution analysis of the promoter revealed that these sequences were required for insulin-mediated repression of AQPap gene transcription. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was involved in this inhibition. We conclude that insulin represses the transcription of AQPap gene via insulin response element in its promoter. Sustained up-regulation of AQPap mRNA in adipose tissue in the insulin-resistant condition may disturb glucose homeostasis by increasing plasma glycerol.

AQP3 was identified from the kidney (4Echevarria M. Windhager E.E. Tate S.S. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10997-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Ishibashi K.

Recently, we cloned AQPap as a novel cDNA belonging to the AQP family from the human adipose tissue cDNA library, and we showed that its mRNA was highly and almost exclusively expressed in human adipose tissue (3Kuriyama H.

Therefore, we named it aquaporin adipose (AQPap). AQP7 was independently cloned from rat testis and that was a rat homologue for AQPap (7Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Gu Y. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A.

Adipocytes continuously synthesize and hydrolyze triglycerides in response to energy balance. When energy is required in other organs, triglyceride stored in adipose tissue is hydrolyzed into the glycerol and free fatty acid, releasing both products into the bloodstream (9Ramsay T.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 847-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Molecules facilitating the transport of free fatty acid were identified and characterized. These include fatty acid translocase (10Ibrahimi A. Sfeir Z. Magharaie H. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (11Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, the molecule responsible for glycerol release from adipocyte has not been identified. We consider AQPap to be the adipose-specific glycerol channel for the following reasons. 1) AQPap had glycerol permeability and was abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 2) During the differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased the epinephrine-stimulated release of glycerol in parallel with the induction of AQPap mRNA. 3) Incubation with HgCl2 totally blocked and addition of mercaptoethanol recovered the epinephrine-stimulated glycerol release in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which are the phenomena generally seen for proteins belonging to the AQP family. 4) The mRNA of AQP3 or AQP9, which are other AQPs with the capability of glycerol transport, was undetectable in adipose tissue or cultured adipocytes (2Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Takahashi M. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Tochino Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol.

All these results support the notion that AQPap is the major transporter of glycerol in adipose tissue. The levels of AQPap mRNA were regulated nutritionally. Fasting enhanced and refeeding suppressed the levels of AQPap mRNA in adipose tissue, leading to increased levels of plasma glycerol with fasting and a decrease with refeeding. The mechanism controlling the expression of this putative glycerol channel has not been clarified. Insulin is one of the factors implicated in the mediation of these regulations of AQPap mRNA. There have been several genes reported to be suppressed by insulin (13O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), including the genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (14Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. Waltner-Law M.

The promoter regions of these genes contain the consensus heptanucleotide sequence, T(G/A)TTTT(G/T), designated as insulin-response element (IRE). Several candidate factors have been proposed as insulin-responsive transcriptional factors, including hepatic nuclear factor 3, forkhead/winged-helix family, FKHR, and FKHRL1 (18Tomizawa M. Kumar A.

Glycerol, produced and released from adipose tissue, is an important substrate for gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, both of which have glycerokinase to convert the glycerol into glycero-6-phosphate forde novo synthesis of glucose (21Klein S. Holland O.B. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E32-E39PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baba H. Zhang X.J. Wolfe R.R. Nutrition. 1995; 11: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that AQPap mRNA was increased in the adipose tissue of insulin-resistant mice, leading to hyperglycerolemia. A high concentration of plasma glycerol has been shown to cause hyperglycemia by enhancing gluconeogenesis (23Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar, 24Nurjhan N. Consoli A. Gerich J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Bergman R.N.

Metab. 1992; 75: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the regulatory mechanism of AQPap mRNA in adipose tissue is important for understanding the physiological and pathological significance of glycerol release from adipose tissue. In the current studies, we determined the genomic structure of the mouse AQPap gene, identified two putative IREs in the 5′-flanking region of the AQPap gene, and introduced the luciferase assay to show that one of the IREs is required for insulin-mediated repression of AQPap gene transcription in adipocytes. Furthermore, we showed that the PI3K pathway mediates this inhibitory effect of insulin on AQPap gene transcription. These results suggest a potential mechanism for insulin-mediated inhibition of the AQPap gene and thereby help to understand regulation of the amount of glycerol in plasma in the normal and insulin-resistant status. Bovine pancreatic insulin was obtained from Sigma. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, were purchased from Calbiochem. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J and ICR (MCH) mice were purchased from Clea Japan, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The animals were kept at 22 °C with a 12-h dark-light cycle (light cycle, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.). They were acclimated to the new environment for a week before the experiment. A mouse 3T3-L1 cell line was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). For the experiment of insulin deficiency, streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma) or phosphate-buffered saline was administered via intraperitoneal injection (100 mg/kg in 0.05 m citrate buffer (pH 4.5)) into 9-week-old male ICR (MCH) mice. On day 3 after STZ treatment, both groups of mice were anesthetized with 5 mg/ml pentobarbital sodium salt prior to sacrifice and analysis. For the experiment on fasting and refeeding, 9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (each group, n = 3) were used. The fasted group was deprived of food for 18 h before sacrifice (fasted group). The refed group was allowed free access to standard laboratory chow for 12 h (refed group) after 18 h of fasting. All mice were phlebotomized quickly from the vena cava. Plasma glycerol and insulin were measured by a fluorometric/colorimetric enzyme method (27Winartasaputra H. Mallet V.N. Kuan S.S. Guilbault G.G. Clin. Chem. 1980; 26: 613-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a double-antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay using a Glazyme Insulin EIA Kit (Sanyo, Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan). Mouse AQPap cDNA was inserted into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega), designated as pSP64-AQPap.In vitro transcription of the entire encoding of AQPap and injection of the resulting cRNA into Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (3Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of AQPap cRNA (0.5 μg/μl) and incubated in modified Barth's buffer (NaCl 96 mm, KCl 2 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, HEPES 5 mm) at 18 °C. After 48 h of incubation, osmotic water permeability and uptake of glycerol was measured as described previously (3Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, for measurement of osmotic water permeability, the oocytes were transferred from 200 to 20 mOsm modified Barth's buffer, and the swelling was monitored with a Nicon phase-contrast microscope equipped for video recording. The oocyte volume was calculated from the recorded images with a microcomputer-imaging device (MCID-M2, Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). Osmotic water permeability (Pf, cm/s) was calculated from the initial rates of swelling, d(V/V0)/dt, oocyte surface-to-volume ratio (S/V0 = 50 cm−1), and partial molar volume of water (Vw = 18 cm3/mol) from the relation, Pf = (d(V/V0)/dt)/((S/V0)Vw/(osmin− osmout)), where osmin − osmout= 180 mOsm. For measurement of the uptake of glycerol, groups of 5–8 oocytes were incubated in Barth's buffer containing 2 μCi/ml [U-14C] glycerol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, nonradioactive glycerol was added to give a 1 mm final concentration at room temperature). After 20 min of incubation, oocytes were rapidly rinsed five times in ice-cold Barth's buffer. The oocytes were lysed in 400 μl of 5% SDS overnight, and the radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. To determine the stability and size of the AQPap proteins, eight oocytes were homogenized in 160 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 80 mmsucrose, 1 m EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin) at 4 °C on day 3 after injection. Subsequently, the lysates were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 125 × gto remove yolk proteins. On day 3 after injection, plasma membranes were isolated from 25 oocytes according to the method of Wall and Patel (28Wall D.A. Patel S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lysates or plasma membranes equivalent to 8 oocytes were denatured for 30 min at 37 °C in sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 12% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol), electrophoresed through a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (2Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Takahashi M. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Tochino Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20896-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, the membrane was incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-rat AQPap/7-specific affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon international, Inc.). As a secondary antibody, a 1:750 dilution of affinity-purified anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Proteins were visualized using the ECLTM system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 10-μg quantity of mouse genomic DNA (ICR, Swiss mouse (Promega)) was digested overnight with BamHI, EcoRI, orXbaI, respectively, and size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel. Gels were blotted onto nucleic acid transfer membrane (HybondTM-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with mouse AQPap cDNA probe (exon 7–8 regions). The probes were labeled using the Multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [α-32P]CTP. Hybridization was carried out with the QuikHyb® hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 1 h. Washes were performed in 2× sodium saline citrate (SSC) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 24 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. In order to isolate genomic clones, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mouse II hybridization library was screened using the AQPap cDNA probe (Genome Systems, Inc.). The restriction fragments that were digested withEcoRI or XbaI were purified and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pZERO-1™ vector (Invitrogen). The ligated product was used for transformation into the Escherichia coli DH10B, and plasmid DNA was isolated. Positive subclones were identified by Southern blot analysis of the plasmid DNA using mouse full-length AQPap cDNA as the probe. These subclones were then isolated and subjected to various restriction enzyme digestions to map the mouse AQPap gene. Double-stranded sequencing of denatured plasmid DNA was performed to determine the intron/exon boundaries and also to obtain sequence information of the promoters by sequencing (DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), PerkinElmer Life Sciences, ABI PRISM™ 377 Automated DNA Sequencer and Genetic Analyzer 310 Sequencer). Fragments containing various lengths of the mouse AQPap promoter were amplified by PCR with restriction sites engineered for subcloning into the MluI and XhoI site of the promoterless pGL3-basic luciferase expression vector (Promega). Plasmids for transfection were purified using the Qiagen plasmid kit. A mutation of single nucleic acids and deletion mutant of pGL3-AQPap luciferase plasmid were constructed using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrities of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate into adipocytes according to the modified method of Rubin et al. (29Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells were grown on a 9-cm culture dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were grown to confluence and differentiated by incubation in DMEM with 10% FCS containing 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin for 48 h. Cells were then maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Differentiated cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS until the transfection experiments. Typically, for each 12-well culture plate, 1 μg of firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase plasmid constructed from pGL3-basic luciferase expression vector and 10 ng of a sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase control vector, pRL-SV40 (Promega), were complexed with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used for transfection. An equal volume of 20% fetal calf serum in DMEM was added 3 h later. The transfection mixture was removed 24 h later after transfection, and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h before cell lysis for reporter assays. Luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL™ reagent kit (Life Technologies. Inc.) (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). The white adipose tissue cDNA library was generated using Superscript™ choice system (Life Technologies. Inc.) and the Lambda ZAP II Vector kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (2Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Nishida M. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Takahashi M. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Tochino Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20896-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μg quantities of total RNA from various tissues were electrophoresed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nucleic acid transfer membrane (Hybond™-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After fixation by ultraviolet cross-linking, the filter was prehybridized with the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 65 °C for 0.5 h. Mouse AQPap cDNA, obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to mouse adipose tissue RNA, was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The probes were radiolabeled using the multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [α-32P]CTP and used for hybridization (1 × 106 cpm/ml). Hybridization was carried out with the same solution at 65 °C for 1 h after adding 0.2 mg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA. Washes were performed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and in 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min, and the filter was exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film for 24 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. In order to identify the 5′-end of the mouse AQPap gene, rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol (Marathon™ cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) and 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies. Inc.)) using the following primers: first primer (corresponding to the region in exon 6–7), 5′-CAGCATCCCAGTCACGAATGCCTCATC-3′ and nested primer (corresponding to exon 3), 5′-GATTGTATGGTCTCCAGCACAGACCTG-3′. Primer extension was performed essentially according to the method of Ausubel et al. (31Triezenberg, S. J. (1987) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Siedman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) units 4.8.1–4.8.3, Wiley Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar) using total RNA and an end-radiolabeled antisense exon 1 oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCTCTGAAGTGCTCTGTGTCTTTCAGCCTC-3′) and an exon 1′ oligonucleotide probe (5′-CCTCTAGTCCATCCTC CTCTTAGACTGCCA-3′). Next, 20 μg of total RNA were mixed with 5 × 104cpm of primer in a 30-μl volume of hybridization buffer (40 mm pipes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% formamide) and heated to 85 °C for 10 min and hybridized overnight at 45 °C. After extension with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) containing RNase inhibitor and actinomycin D at 37 °C for 30 min and at 42 °C for 30 min, the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. An M13mp18 sequencing reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and radiolabeled φX174 DNA/HinfI dephosphorylated markers (Promega) were used as a size standard. For the RNase protection assay, cDNA fragment (350 bp) in exon 1, 1′, or 8 was subcloned into the plasmid pGEM T-easy (Promega) and linearized with an appropriate restriction enzyme. A radiolabeled antisense cRNA probe was generated using SP6 RNA polymerase fromin vitro transcription kit (MAXIscript SP6/T7 kit, Ambion) and [32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Next, 20 μg of total RNA were hybridized at 68 °C for 10 min and ribonuclease protection assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (HybSpeed™ RPA, Ambion) (32Kinloch R.A. Roller R.J. Wassarman P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The protected fragments were analyzed together with a sequencing reaction on 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to film. Chromosomal localization was determined by the Gene Bridge 4 Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using specific primers (5′-GTGAAAA TTACCATCTCCGCACTGC-3′ and (5′-GATTGTATGGTCTCCAGCACAGACCTG-3′) in AQPap exons 3 and 4. The amplification profile consisted of denaturation for 180 s at 96 °C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 96 °C, annealing for 60 s at 60 °C, and extension for 60 s at 72 °C. The results were analyzed with a WI/MIT mouse radiation hybrid mapper. The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of the difference between the mean values of the groups was evaluated by Student's t test. Previously, we cloned human AQPap, a new member of the aquaporin family, which was exclusively expressed in human adipose tissue (3Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This protein exhibited transport activity of glycerol as well as water. In this study, we have isolated mouse AQPap cDNA from the mouse white adipose tissue cDNA library. This gene encodes a 304-amino acid (GenBankTMaccession number AB056099, Fig.1A), which has 78% homology to human AQPap. To test the function of the mouse AQPap, we injected the entire mouse AQPap cRNA and expressed the protein in theXenopus oocytes. Immunoblotting of the oocytes membrane fraction detected a 28-kDa protein, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of AQPap (Fig. 1B). The osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf) of AQPap cRNA-injected oocytes was 9 times higher than that of water-injected oocytes (Fig.1C). The oocytes injected with AQPap cRNA also showed 10-fold stimulation of glycerol uptake, which was comparable with human AQPap (Fig. 1C) (3Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Genomic Southern blot analysis, using different restriction enzymes and a 1-kb cDNA fragment corresponding to the exon 7 and 8 regions as the probe, detected a single band, which suggested that the mouse AQPap gene is a single copy gene (data not shown). To obtain genomic DNA of mouse AQPap, the BAC mouse II hybridization library (Genome Systems, Inc.,) was screened, using mouse AQPap cDNA (coding region) as a probe. Southern blot analysis using three clones (GS20454, GS20455, and GS20456) from the BAC library a probe showed an identical pattern to the result to mouse genomic DNA, indicating that these clones contained the AQPap gene (data not shown). The XbaI/EcoRI-digested fragment of these clones was subcloned into pZERO-1™ vector (Invitrogen). Intron/exon boundaries and the intron sizes are determined and summarized in Fig.2A. All intron/exon boundaries confirmed to the established consensus G(T/A)G rule (GenBankTM accession numbers AB056092–AB056098, data not shown). The AQPap gene spans around 12 kb and has 8 exons, three of which, exons 1, 1′, and 2, are upstream of the translation initiation site (Fig. 2A). Exon 1 and exon 1′ are alternatively spliced to a common second exon. The translation initiation site ATG was"

In this study, we demonstrate that although rat anterior pituitary lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and gonadotrophs exhibited spontaneous and extracellular calcium-dependent electrical activity, voltage-gated calcium influx triggered secretion only in lactotrophs and somatotrophs. The lack of action potential-driven secretion in gonadotrophs was not due to the proportion of spontaneously firing cells or spike frequency. Gonadotrophs exhibited calcium signals during prolonged depolarization comparable with signals observed in somatotrophs and lactotrophs. The secretory vesicles in all three cell types also had a similar sensitivity to voltage-gated calcium influx. However, the pattern of action potential calcium influx differed among three cell types. Spontaneous activity in gonadotrophs was characterized by high amplitude, sharp spikes that had a limited capacity to promote calcium influx, whereas lactotrophs and somatotrophs fired plateau-bursting action potentials that generated high amplitude calcium signals. Furthermore, a shift in the pattern of firing from sharp spikes to plateau-like spikes in gonadotrophs triggered luteinizing hormone secretion. These results indicate that the cell type-specific action potential secretion coupling in pituitary cells is determined by the capacity of their plasma membrane oscillator to generate threshold calcium signals.

In vitro, basal prolactin (PRL)1 and growth hormone (GH) secretion from pituitary fragments, dispersed pituitary cells, and immortalized lacto-somatotrophs is high and is dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration (1Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S.-I. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holl R.W. Thorner M.O. Leong D.A. Am. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3154-3159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, basal luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion is low and not dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration (1Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S.-I. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, animals bearing ectopic pituitary grafts release high levels of PRL and low levels of LH for a prolonged period, leading to pseudo-pregnancy (5Maric D. Simonovic I. Kovacevic R. Krsmanovic L. Stojilkovic S. Andjus R.K. J. Ensocrinol. Invest. 1982; 5: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because of the high levels of basal GH and PRL secretion, it is not surprising that lactotrophs and somatotrophs are under negative hypothalamic control by Gi/o-coupled dopamine and somatostatin receptors, in addition to positive control by Ca2+-mobilizing and Gs-coupled receptors, such as GH-releasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors. On the other hand, LH secretion from gonadotrophs is under positive hypothalamic control by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and endothelin-A, but no inhibitory hypothalamic factor has been identified (6Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Kwiecien R. Hammond C. Neuroendocrinology. 1998; 68: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is not known what endows lactotrophs and somatotrophs, but not gonadotrophs, with the ability to secrete high levels of hormone in the absence of any stimuli. One possibility is that lactotrophs and somatotrophs fire spontaneous action potentials (APs) that are capable of driving sufficient Ca2+ entry to stimulate hormone secretion, whereas gonadotrophs are quiescent in the absence of any stimuli. Consistent with this, cultured somatotrophs (8Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J. J. Physiol. 1991; 441: 615-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Holl R.W. Thorner M.O. Mandell G.L.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), spontaneously fire APs, and the majority of unstimulated male rat gonadotrophs are quiescent (18Tse A. Hille B. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In ovariectomized rats, however, gonadotropin secretion remained low despite the observation that about 50% of the cells examined exhibited spontaneous AP firing (1Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S.-I. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stojilkovic S.S. Kukuljan M. Iida T. Rojas E. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4081-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the nature of spontaneous AP firing, such as Ca2+-dependent versusNa+-dependent spiking, or variations in the proportion of excitable cells, and/or frequency of spontaneous firing account for the cell type-specific patterns of basal hormone secretion. Finally, the differences in the patterns of basal hormone secretion may be due to differences in the ability of voltage-gated Ca2+influx (VGCI) to increase intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and stimulate secretion in spontaneously active cells. In male gonadotrophs, for example, short membrane depolarization and the ensuing increase in [Ca2+]i do not stimulate exocytosis (20Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), whereas a prolonged membrane depolarization by high potassium is sufficient to stimulate secretion in several anterior pituitary cell types, including gonadotrophs (1Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S.-I. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kehl S.J. Wong K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the profile of the AP wave form,i.e. the AP duration, may determine the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i and secretory responses. In the present study, we examined the patterns of AP-driven Ca2+ entry and their relationship to basal hormone secretion in each cell type under identical culture and recording conditions. Spontaneous electrical membrane activity and [Ca2+]i were recorded simultaneously to determine the ability of AP firing in each cell type to drive VGCI. To monitor basal hormone secretion and its dependence on AP-driven Ca2+ entry at a similar time scale to that used in electrophysiological experiments, a rapid perifusion system was used. Our results indicate specific profiles of the AP wave forms in three cell types, and their ability to drive Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) accounts for the cell type-specific patterns of basal hormone secretion. Specifically, gonadotrophs fired sharp, high amplitude APs with a limited capacity to drive Ca2+ influx, whereas lactotrophs and somatotrophs exhibited plateau-bursting activity that had a high capacity to drive Ca2+ entry. Experiments were performed on anterior pituitary cells from normal postpuberal female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Taconic Farm (Germantown, NY). Pituitary cells were dispersed as described previously (22Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Wong A.O.L. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4091-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cultured as mixed cells or enriched lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and gonadotrophs in medium 199 containing Earle's salts, sodium bicarbonate, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and antibiotics. A two-stage Percoll discontinuous density gradient procedure (22Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Wong A.O.L. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4091-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used to obtain enriched lactotroph and somatotroph populations. Somatotrophs were further identified by their cell type-specific morphologies and by their responses to GH-releasing hormone. In enriched lactotroph populations, lactotrophs were further identified by their cell type-specific morphology and by the addition of thyrotopin-releasing hormone. Gonadotrophs were initially identified by their cell type-specific morphology and, subsequent to experimentation by addition of GnRH, which stimulates small conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ current and [Ca2+]i oscillations only in gonadotrophs (23Kukuljan M. Stojilkovic S.S. Rojas E. Catt K.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,24Tse A. Hille B. Science. 1992; 255: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hormone secretion was monitored using rapid cell column perifusion experiments as previously described (25Chang J.P. Stojilkovic S.S. Graeter J.S. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 107 cells were incubated with preswollen cytodex-1 beads in 60-mm Petri dishes for 2 days. The beads were then transferred to 0.5-ml chambers and perifused with Hanks' M199 containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 37 °C to establish a stable basal secretion. During the experiment, 1-min fractions were collected, stored at −20 °C, and later assayed for GH, PRL, and LH content using radioimmunoassay. All reagents and standards were provided by the National Pituitary Agency and Dr. Parlow. Standard curves for three radioimmunoassays were constructed in a concentration range of 1–100 nm, and the displacement of labeled hormones with unlabeled hormones was done at 30% specific binding. The averaged IC50 was 6.30 ± 0.44 (n = 9), 6.52 ± 0.48 (n = 9), and 6.93 ± 0.73 (n = 8) ng/ml for GH, PRL, and LH, respectively, indicating similar sensitivity of three radioimmunoassays. To account for differences in the total number of the three hormone secreting cell types found in the anterior pituitary, hormone content from the same samples was measured and then normalized to the percentage of each cell type occurring in mixed cell populations. To normalize hormone secretion to the total number of each cell type in the anterior pituitary, immunostaining of GH, LH, and PRL was performed using a avidin-biotin (ABC) peroxidase method. Dispersed cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/slide, fixed in Bouin's fluid for 20 min, thoroughly washed, dehydrated, and kept dry at −70 °C. On the day of immunocytochemical processing, fixed cells were sequentially rehydrated, treated with 3% H2O2, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked by incubation in 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-LH serum (1:75,000; NIDDK, National Institutes of Health), monkey anti-GH serum (1:75,000; NIDDK, National Institutes of Health), or rabbit anti-PRL serum (1:75,000; National Pituitary Agency). On the second day, the slides were rinsed and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG-biotin conjugate (1:9,000 dilution; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), or goat anti-human IgG-biotin conjugate (1:10,000 dilution; Vector Laboratories). This was followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex incubation for 45-min period at room temperature. Specific staining was visualized with a diaminobenzidine substrate kit for peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Antibody specificity was determined by incubating cells with LH, GH, or PRL antiserum preabsorbed with homologous or related peptides. Current and voltage clamp recordings were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200 B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were low pass filtered at 2 kHz. Membrane potential (Vm) was measured using the perforated patch recording technique (26Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Briefly, an amphotericin B (Sigma) stock solution (60 mg/ml) was prepared in Me2SO and stored for up to 1 week at −20 °C. Just prior to use, the stock solution was diluted in pipette solution and sonicated for 30 s to yield a final amphotericin B concentration of 240 μg/ml. Patch electrodes used for perforated patch recordings were fabricated from borosilicate glass (outer diameter, 1.5 mm; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a Flaming Brown horizontal puller (P-87; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Electrodes were heat polished to a final tip resistance of 3–6 MΩ and then coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI) to reduce pipette capacitance. Pipette tips were briefly immersed in amphotericin B-free solution and then backfilled with the amphotericin B-containing solution. A series resistance of <15 MΩ was reached 10 min following the formation of a gigaohm seal (seal resistance > 5 GΩ) and remained stable for up to 1 h. Pulse generation, data acquisition and analysis were done with a PC equipped with a Digidata 1200 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments). For recording Vm, the extracellular medium contained 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), and the pipette solution contained 50 mm KCl, 90 mm K+-aspartate, 1 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). The bath contained <500 μl of saline and was continuously perifused at a rate of 2 ml/min using a gravity-driven perfusion system. Pituitary cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in phenol red-free medium 199 containing Hanks' salts, 20 mm sodium bicarbonate, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.5 μm indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The Vm was recorded as described above, and bulk [Ca2+]i was simultaneously monitored using a Nikon photon counter system as previously described (27Van Goor F. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1222-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Vm and bulk [Ca2+]i were captured simultaneously at rate of 5 kHz using a PC equipped with a Digidata 1200 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments). The [Ca2+]i was calibrated in vivo according to Kao (28Kao J.P.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and the values forRmin, Rmax,Sf, 480/Sb, 480 andKd were determined to be 0.75, 3.40, 2.45, and 230 nm, respectively. The pattern of basal GH, PRL, and LH secretion from dispersed anterior pituitary cells was compared using rapid perifusion (1-min fractions) experiments. Basal hormone secretion was normalized to account for differences in the size of somatotroph, lactotroph, and gonadotroph populations in mixed anterior pituitary cell preparations (Fig. 1 A; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In all of the experiments, the level of GH and PRL release was severalfold higher than that of LH release,i.e. 50–70 ng/ml for GH and PRL and below 1 ng/ml for LH. The normalized secretory profiles for each hormone from a representative experiment and the mean ± S.E. from 10 separate experiments are shown in Fig. 1 B. These results demonstrate that basal GH and PRL secretion from perifused anterior pituitary cells is ≈ 25- and 40-fold higher, respectively, than LH secretion. To investigate the involvement of voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels in controlling basal GH, PRL, and LH secretion, we used blockers of these channels. Application of the specific voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker, TTX (1 μm), did not alter the pattern of basal GH, PRL, or LH secretion (Fig. 2 A), indicating that these channels are not involved in the regulation of basal pituitary hormone secretion. In contrast, application of the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, and the nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker, Cd2+, inhibited basal GH and PRL secretion but did not alter basal LH secretion (Fig. 2,B and C). Similarly, extracellular Ca2+ removal abolished GH and PRL secretion without affecting the pattern of basal LH secretion (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that the main fraction of basal GH and PRL secretion from perifused anterior pituitary cells is due to regulated, Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in response to VGCI. The residual, Ca2+-independent GH and PRL secretion, as well as total basal LH secretion, could be due to constitutive exocytosis or nonspecific leak of hormones during perifusion. In further experiments, we focused on VGCI-dependent basal hormone secretion. The involvement of VGCCs in regulating GH and PRL secretion, but not LH secretion, could be due to the inability of gonadotrophs to fire spontaneous APs. To test this, we compared the electrical membrane activity in all three hormone-secreting cell types under identical recording conditions using the perforated patch whole cell configuration. Spontaneous AP firing with a frequency of ≈0.3 Hz was observed in a majority (>80%) of the somatotrophs and lactotrophs examined (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, half of the gonadotrophs examined exhibited spontaneous AP firing with a frequency of 0.7 Hz (Fig. 3 A). To test whether the lower percentage of gonadotrophs exhibiting spontaneous electrical activity accounts for the low levels of basal LH secretion compared with that of GH and PRL, we increased the percentage of gonadotrophs firing APs by the addition of 5 mm K+ to 4.7 mm K+-containing M199. Potassium-induced membrane depolarization increased spike frequency in spontaneously active gonadotrophs (Fig. 3 B, left traces) but did not alter the profile of the AP wave form (Fig. 3 C,left traces). In addition, K+-induced membrane depolarization initiated firing in all quiescent gonadotrophs examined (Fig. 3 B, right traces). These changes inVm were accompanied with a small (less than 100 nm) increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.3 B, bottom traces). Despite the changes in the pattern of AP firing, application of 5 mm K+did not trigger LH secretion, whereas it increased GH and PRL secretion in the same fractions. Moreover, the level of LH secretion remained lower than that of both GH and PRL secretion (Fig. 3 C,right panel). In further experiments, we examined whether differences in the ionic mechanisms of AP firing (Ca2+-dependentversus Na+-dependent spiking), the profile of the AP wave form, and/or the capacity of AP firing to drive extracellular Ca2+ entry accounts for the cell type-specific patterns of hormone secretion. To do this, we simultaneously monitored Vm activity and [Ca2+]i in all three cell types under identical recording conditions. In spontaneously active somatotrophs and lactotrophs, extracellular Ca2+ removal abolished AP firing and markedly decreased [Ca2+]i (Fig.4, left and center traces). In spontaneously active gonadotrophs, extracellular Ca2+ removal also abolished AP firing but had only a minor effect on the already low levels of basal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, right traces). Thus, although all three cell types fired Ca2+-dependent APs, their capacity to drive extracellular Ca2+ entry is greater in somatotrophs and lactotrophs than in gonadotrophs. We next examined whether differences in the profile of the AP wave form account for the cell type-specific AP-driven Ca2+ signals. Somatotrophs and lactotrophs fired low amplitude, plateau-bursting APs with a duration of ≈1.3 and 0.75 s, respectively (Fig.5, left and center traces). In contrast, gonadotrophs fired high amplitude, single spikes (Fig. 5, right traces) with a duration at one-half the amplitude of < 50 ms. The two patterns of AP firing, plateau-bursting versus single spiking, had different capacities to drive extracellular Ca2+ influx via VGCCs. The spontaneous plateau-bursting in somatotrophs and lactotrophs generated high amplitude [Ca2+]i signals that ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 μm, whereas spontaneous single spiking in gonadotrophs generated low amplitude [Ca2+]i signals ranging from 20 to 70 nm (Fig. 5). To test whether the AP duration alone accounts for their different capacities to drive Ca2+ influx, somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs were depolarized to −10 mV for variable times (from 25 ms to 2 s), and the accompanying increase in [Ca2+]i was monitored (Fig.6 A). In all three hormone-secreting cell types, the peak amplitude in the [Ca2+]i increased progressively with an increase in the duration of the depolarizing membrane potential step. A similar increase in the peak [Ca2+]i was observed between somatotrophs and gonadotrophs, whereas a lower [Ca2+]i response was observed in lactotrophs (Fig. 6, B–D). Nevertheless, these results indicate that the duration of VGCI alone accounts for the cell type-specific patterns of AP-driven Ca2+ signaling. Our results indicate that the prolonged duration of the AP wave form in somatotrophs and lactotrophs account for the high amplitude [Ca2+]i signals and the high levels of basal hormone secretion. To test whether an increase in the duration of the AP wave form in spontaneously active gonadotrophs can increase AP-driven Ca2+ entry and stimulate LH secretion, we used the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644. In spontaneously active somatotrophs and lactotrophs, the addition of 1 μm Bay K 8644 increased the frequency of firing (Fig.7 A, upper traces) and the base-line [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7, Aand B, bottom traces). In addition, Bay K 8644 application increased GH and PRL secretion (Fig. 7 C). In spontaneously active gonadotrophs, Bay K 8644 increased the frequency of spiking and the duration of the AP wave form (Fig. 7 B,e versus f). These changes in the pattern of AP firing elevated [Ca2+]i to the levels observed in unstimulated somatotrophs and lactotrophs (Fig.7 A, dashed line). Moreover, the Bay K 8644-induced increase in AP-driven Ca2+ entry was sufficient to trigger calcium-dependent LH secretion. As shown in Fig. 7 C, Bay K 8644-induced LH secretion was comparable with that observed in untreated somatotrophs and lactotrophs (dashed line). These results indicate that basal pituitary hormone secretion is dependent on the duration of the AP wave form, which determines their capacity to drive Ca2+ entry through VGCCs. We next compared the capacity of VGCI to stimulate hormone secretion in each hormone-secreting cell type. To do this, we examined whether the levels of [Ca2+]i and hormone secretion in response to steady-state Vm depolarization were similar between the three cell types. In gonadotrophs, K+-inducedVm depolarization stimulated a dose dependent increase in LH secretion (Fig.8 A). Similar results were observed in somatotrophs and lactotrophs (data not shown). Sustained membrane depolarization in all three cell types by addition of 50 mm K+ evoked a similar rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 8 B). Moreover, the normalized secretory response to 50 mm K+ was comparable in all three hormone-secreting cell types (Fig.8 C). These results argue against the hypothesis that secretory vesicles in gonadotrophs are less sensitive to VGCI compared with that in somatotrophs and lactotrophs. They also suggest that secretory vesicles in lactotrophs are more sensitive to VGCI compared with somatotrophs, because the [Ca2+]i response to Vm depolarization in lactotrophs was consistently smaller than that in somatotrophs and lactotrophs (Figs.6 C and 8 B), whereas basal (Figs. 1 and 2) and K+-induced (Fig. 8 C) PRL secretion was higher. In this study, we examined the ionic mechanisms underlying the different patterns of basal hormone secretion from anterior pituitary somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs. In general, unstimulated cells secrete in a constitutive and regulated manner, the latter through AP-driven Ca2+ influx and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (29von Ruden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 30Mulkey R.M. Zucker R.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Jackson M.B. Konnerth A.

Nature. 1990; 344: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our results using perifused anterior pituitary cells indicated that basal GH and PRL secretion was much higher than basal LH secretion. As in other studies (3Cota G. Hiriart M. Horta J. Torres-Escalante J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C949-C959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Enyeart J.J. Sheu S.S. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9682-9685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the majority of basal GH and PRL secretion was extracellular Ca2+-dependent and sensitive to blockade of VGCI through L-type channels. On the other hand, extracellular Ca2+ removal or VGCC blocker did not alter basal LH release. Basal hormone secretion from all three cell types was unaffected by the voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker, TTX. These results indicate that Ca2+ influx via VGCCs accounts for basal GH and PRL release but not basal LH secretion. Consistent with VGCI-dependent GH and PRL secretion shown here and by others (2Holl R.W. Thorner M.O. Leong D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E373-E379Google Scholar, 8Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J.

Bicknell R.J. Mason W.T. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), somatotrophs and lactotrophs fire APs spontaneously. The TTX insensitivity and Ca2+ sensitivity of spontaneous firing of APs in somatotrophs and lactotrophs and basal GH and PRL secretion further indicates that VGGCs are major players in AP-dependent hormone secretion. However, our data show that gonadotrophs from normal females also exhibit spontaneous and extracellular Ca2+-dependent excitability but not AP-dependent secretion. These data argue against the hypothesis that the lack of spontaneous excitability of gonadotrophs accounts for low basal LH release. Also, basal LH secretion was not related to the number of cells exhibiting spontaneous firing of APs nor to the frequency of spontaneous firing, because depolarization of cells with 5 mm K+ initiated firing in quiescent gonadotrophs and increased frequency of firing in spontaneously active cells but did not initiate LH release. Thus, although spontaneous AP firing was observed in all three-cell types, only GH and PRL were dependent on AP-driven Ca2+ entry. The ability of AP to trigger secretion depends, in part, on the distance between secretory vesicles and VGCCs. In synapses, predocked release-ready vesicles are molecularly linked to calcium channels (33Stanley E.F. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 782-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Sheng Z.-H. Retting J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which facilitates their rapid release in response to VGCI (35Mennerick S. Matthews G. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In contrast, single APs trigger only a minor amount of secretion in chromaffin cells, whereas a prolonged step depolarization induces massive secretion that persists after VGCI has stopped (36Zhou Z. Misler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 24: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In rat melanotrophs, the distance between secretory vesicles and VGCCs is also large. As a result, short (40 ms) depolarizations evoked only a minor amount of secretion (37Mansvelder H.D. Kits K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 81-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell secretory studies, using capacitance measurements, in male rat gonadotrophs also indicate that short Vm depolarizations are insufficient to stimulate exocytosis (20Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These experiments raised the possibility that secretory vesicles in somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs differ in their sensitivity to VGCI, i.e. that secretory vesicles in somatotrophs and lactotrophs are close to VGCCs, whereas in gonadotrophs the localized VGCI cannot reach them. However, the results shown here indicate the opposite. The [Ca2+]i response to square depolarizing pulses in duration of 50 ms to 2 s were comparable in the three cell types. This is in accord with earlier published results indicating that L-type Ca2+ channel density is similar among the three cell types (27Van Goor F. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1222-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gonadotrophs, lactotrophs, and somatotrophs exhibited comparative [Ca2+]i and secretory responses during steady-state depolarization of cells with 50 mmK+, indicating that the secretory vesicles in gonadotrophs, as in somatotrophs and lactotrophs, respond to high amplitude VGCI signals. Therefore, like chromaffin cells and melanotrophs, all three anterior pituitary cell types require global [Ca2+]i signaling to trigger substantial exocytosis. Activation of exocytosis in unstimulated cells appears to be determined by the duration of AP wave form and its capacity to drive global Ca2+ signals. Somatotrophs and lactotrophs exhibit plateau-bursting activity, which leads to prolong activation of L-type channels, and sustain Ca2+ influx and hormone secretion. On the other hand, gonadotrophs fire single APs with a limited capacity to elevate [Ca2+]i and stimulate hormone secretion. A shift in the firing pattern induced by Bay K 8644, from single spiking to plateau AP accompanied with an increase in the frequency of firing in gonadotrophs was sufficient to trigger LH secretion. Although the AP duration in gonadotrophs stimulated with Bay K 8644 was shorter compared with that of plateau-bursting in somatotrophs and lactotrophs, when combined with an increase in the firing frequency it was adequate to elevate [Ca2+]i and LH secretion to the levels observed in unstimulated somatotrophs and lactotrophs. It should be noted, however, that an increase in spike frequency alone was not sufficient to stimulate LH secretion, as demonstrated by the inability of 5 mm K+-induced depolarization to stimulate exocytosis in gonadotrophs. In line with this, it has been shown that AP broadening contributes to the frequency-dependent facilitation of [Ca2+]i signals in pituitary nerve terminals (31Jackson M.B. Konnerth A. Augustine G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The ability of somatotrophs and lactotrophs to fire low amplitude plateau-bursting type of APs and gonadotrophs to fire high amplitude single spikes indicates the cell type-specific expression of plasma membrane channels. In general, a similar group of ionic channels are expressed in each cell type, including transient and sustained VGCCs, TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, transient and delayed rectifying K+ channels, and multiple Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel subtypes (3Cota G. Hiriart M. Horta J. Torres-Escalante J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C949-C959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J. J.

In accordance with the above hypothesis, there were marked differences in the expression levels of some of the ionic channels when analyzed in the same preparation. Specifically, lactotrophs and somatotrophs exhibited low expression levels of TTX-sensitive Na+ channels and high expression levels of the large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel compared with those observed in gonadotrophs. In addition, functional expression of the transient K+ channel was much higher in lactotrophs and gonadotrophs than in somatotrophs. The expression of the transient VGCCs was also higher in somatotrophs than in lactotrophs and gonadotrophs (27Van Goor F. Zivadinovic D. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1222-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Within these channels, it appears that BK channel activation in somatotrophs prolongs membrane depolarization, leading to the generation of plateau-bursting activity and facilitated Ca2+ entry. Such a paradoxical role of BK channels is determined by their rapid activation by domain Ca2+, which truncates the AP amplitude and thereby limits the participation of delayed rectifying K+ channels during membrane repolarization. Conversely, pituitary gonadotrophs express relatively few BK channels and fire single spikes with a low capacity to promote Ca2+ entry. Elevation in BK channel expression in a gonadotroph model system converted single spiking activity into plateau-bursting activity that had a high capacity to drive Ca2+ entry (47Van Goor, F., Li, Y.-X., and Stojilkovic, S. S. (2001)J. Neurosci., in press.Google Scholar). The cell type-specific AP secretion coupling observed here is consistent with hypothalamic control of pituitary hormone secretionin vivo. Initially, it was believed that all anterior pituitary cell types were under dual hypothalamic control by stimulatory and inhibitory factors. This remains true for somatotrophs and lactotrophs, in which the dual hypothalamic control of GH and PRL secretion is well established (reviewed in Refs. 48Bluet-Pajot M.-T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 49Freeman M.E. Kanicska B. Lernat A. Nagy G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1523-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). A negative hypothalamic factor controlling gonadotropin secretion, however, has not been identified. Moreover, the data shown here confirm that there is no need for such regulation, because basal LH secretion is very low. The dual control of somatotrophs and lactotrophs is essential for generating the episodic release of GH and PRL (48Bluet-Pajot M.-T. Epelbaum J. Gourdji D. Hammond C. Kordon C. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 49Freeman M.E. Kanicska B. Lernat A. Nagy G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1523-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar), whereas the work by Knobil (50Knobil E. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 163: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and others (51Dyer R.G. Robinson J.E. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 123: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has established that the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator itself accounts for the pulsatile release of LH. Furthermore, episodic LH release is required for normal reproductive functions, and AP secretion coupling in spontaneously active gonadotrophs, like continuous GnRH administration (50Knobil E. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 163: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), would inhibit the reproductive cycle. The lack of AP-induced secretion in unstimulated gonadotrophs does not diminish the importance of AP firing in these cells. Although subthreshold for activation of exocytosis, spontaneous VGCI in gonadotrophs maintains the [Ca2+]i at the optimal level required for interactions between inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and Ca2+ in their dual control of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate channel gating (52Stojilkovic S.S. Tomic M. Kukuljan M. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar, 53Li Y.-X. Stojilkovic S.S. Keizer J. Rinzel J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1080-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GnRH-induced and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations in gonadotrophs generate transient Vm hyperpolarizations, upon which bursting firing is observed (23Kukuljan M. Stojilkovic S.S. Rojas E. Catt K.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Tse A. Hille B. Science. 1992; 255: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the agonist-induced shift in the pattern of AP firing alone cannot protect against depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, it provides a steady-state increase in VGCI during prolonged GnRH stimulation (53Li Y.-X. Stojilkovic S.S. Keizer J. Rinzel J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1080-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Combined with the redistribution of Ca2+ between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (54Kaftan E.J. Xu T. Abercrombie R.F. Hille B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25465-25470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), such VGCI is sufficient to maintain agonist-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations and LH release for several hours (19Stojilkovic S.S. Kukuljan M. Iida T. Rojas E. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4081-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results indicate that spontaneous, extracellular Ca2+-dependent AP firing is a common feature of pituitary somatotrophs, lactotrophs, and gonadotrophs. SuchVm oscillations were sufficient to stimulate GH and PRL but not LH release. This indicates that cell excitabilityper se is not sufficient for an effective AP secretion coupling in excitable endocrine cells as it is in neuronal cells during synaptic transmission. Our results further indicate that the pattern of spontaneous electrical activity encodes the cell type-specific basal hormone secretion. Specifically, somatotrophs and lactotrophs fire plateau-bursting APs with a high capacity to drive Ca2+entry, whereas gonadotrophs fire single spikes with a low capacity to drive Ca2+ entry. The cell type-specific AP secretion coupling in pituitary cells described here provides a rationale for the existence of negative hypothalamic control of PRL and GH but not LH secretion."

The most active area of research on MCH has focused on the role of MCH in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy balance. Several studies provide evidence for a role for MCH in regulation of body weight.1) Mice that lack MCH are hypophagic and exhibit an increased metabolic rate, resulting in decreased body weight and body fat content (5Shimada M.

MCH-R1 is composed of seven transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors and binds to MCH with high affinity. MCH-R1 is coupled to Gi, Go, and Gq-type G proteins and mediates decreases in intracellular cAMP and increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels, inositol phosphate production, and mitogen-activate protein kinase activity (26Hawes B.E.

In this report, we describe a novel MCH receptor identified through bioinformatic and molecular cloning approaches. The receptor is similar (35% identical) to the previously published MCH receptor, is able to bind125I-labeled MCH, and can be activated by MCH leading to intracellular signaling. In addition, the expression of the receptor is localized to distinct regions of the brain.MATERIALS AND METHODSHuman Marathon-Ready cDNAs and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The 293-EBNA cell line (293 cells) was obtained from Invitrogen. MCH and other peptides were purchased from Sigma or BACHEM.125I-MCH was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Isolation of cDNA for MCH-R2The amino acid sequences of known G protein-coupled receptors were used to conduct a BLAST search of the public data base GenBankTM. The search identified a BAC clone (accession number AQ492353) with a sequence of 429 bp. The fragment contained an ∼120-bp coding sequence belonging to the transmembrane regions 2 and 3 of a putative G protein-coupled receptor, and the rest was a portion of an intron. A BLAST analysis revealed high homology of the 120-bp coding sequence to the recently published MCH receptor (MCH-R1) (21Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M.

RACE was used to obtain the full-length cDNA for this putative G protein-coupled receptor (MCH-R2). The 5′-fragment containing the translation start codon and the 3′-fragment containing the stop codon were generated using the Marathon RACE kit for PCR reactions and human brain and brain cerebral cortex Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as the PCR template (see Fig. 1 A). PCR conditions for this reaction were 94 °C, 30 s; 35 cycles at 94 °C, 30 s and 68 °C, 3 min; and 68 °C 7 min. For each RACE, nested PCR primers specific to the MCH-R2 cDNA sequence and primers AP1 and AP2 that bind to Marathon-Ready cDNA adapter (CLONTECH) were used. Multiple RACE reactions were run to extend the sequence to the start codon of the MCH-R2 full-length cDNA. Similar conditions were used to obtain the 3′-RACE products to obtain the stop codon of the open reading frame (ORF).To clone the full length of MCH-R2 cDNA, a new PCR primer pair (oligoJ634 and oligoJ636) was designed to amplify in a PCR by usingCLONTECH Marathon-Ready cDNA as template (see Fig. 1 A). The PCR product containing the full-length cDNA was cloned into expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) to form an expression construct pCR3.1-MCH-R2. PCR conditions were 95 °C, 3 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 62 °C, 30 s, 68 °C, 2 min; and 72 °C, 7 min. The sequences of the PCR primers are 5′-gccgccaccatgaatccatttcatgcatct (oligoJ634) and 5′-tcatgctgatcccatgtactttcctaa (oligoJ636).Radioligand Binding AssayCHO cells stably expressing MCH-R2 (CHO/MCH-R2) or MCH-R1 (CHO/MCH-R1) were plated in six-well culture plates and incubated for 24–48 h. Cells were washed with binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then pretreated with 300 μl of binding buffer containing unlabeled MCH (mammalian MCH, ([Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, or salmon MCH as indicated in the figures) for 5 min. Cells were then treated with an additional 300 μl of binding buffer containing 125I-MCH at concentrations described in the figures for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were then placed on ice and washed four times with cold binding buffer. Cells were scraped into 12 × 75-mm test tubes and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. Excess fluid was aspirated, and the radioactivity bound to the cell pellet was counted in a γ counter.Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+LevelsCHO/MCH-R2 and CHO/MCH-R1 cells were split into 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Subsequently the medium was removed, and 100 μl of FLIPR buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm probenecid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 4 μm Fluo-3/AM was added to the wells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times with 150 μl of FLIPR buffer. Subsequently 150 μl of FLIPR buffer was added to each well, and changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured after addition of 50 μl of assay buffer containing the appropriate concentration of ligands. The FLIPR instrument (Molecular Devices) was used to monitor intracellular free Ca2+ levels over a 3-min stimulation period. The maximum increase in fluorescence was determined and compared for each well. All data were analyzed, and EC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software.Measurement of Inositol Phosphate ProductionCHO/MCH-R2 and CHO/MCH-R1 cells were split into 12-well culture plates. Cells were prelabeled with [3H]inositol (1.0 μCi/well) for 18 h. Cells were then washed with inositol phosphate (IP) assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 20 mm LiCl, 1 mmCaCl2) and stimulated as indicated in the figures for 45 min. Cells were lysed by the addition of 1 ml of 0.4 mperchloric acid. The perchloric acid was then removed from the wells and added to 0.5 ml of 0.7 m KOH, 0.6 mKHCO3. A 1.0-ml aliquot from each sample was applied to a Dowex anion exchange column. Columns were washed twice with water (10 ml each), and IPs were eluted with 3.0 ml of 0.1 m formic acid, 1.0 m ammonium formate. Samples were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. All data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software.Messenger RNA Expression Analysis of MCH-R2Tissue expression of MCH-R2 was examined using dot blots and Northern blots obtained from a commercial source (CLONTECH). Hybridization to blots was carried out using a PCR-generated DNA fragment encompassing 800 bp at the 3′-end of the MCH-R2 cDNA. The primer sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5′-ttggaacacctctgccgaactt; reverse primer, 5′-aacccacatagaaggccagtgt. The DNA fragments were random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP, and the blots were hybridized for 14 h in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) containing ∼2 million cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe. The following day the blots were washed and exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film for 3 days at −70 °C. The films were analyzed for relative expression levels using the MCID M4 image analysis system (Imaging Research, Ontario, Canada).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe 120-bp coding sequence (Fig.1 A) was used as a starting sequence for the 5′- and 3′-RACE extensions. Multiple RACE reactions were performed to obtain the 5′ translation initiation codon and the 3′ translation termination codon by using human brain cDNA preparations. Based on the 5′- and 3′-end sequences, a full-length ORF was generated by PCR. The ORF is 1023 bp long (Fig. 1 A) and encodes a protein of 340 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon is a short stretch of untranslated sequence with an in-frame termination codon (TAA tcc ctg gaa agt cca cga aca ATG), suggesting a correct assignment of the Met as the N terminus of the receptor.Comparison with other G protein-coupled receptor amino acid sequences and hydrophobicity analysis of the 340-amino acid protein suggests that there are seven transmembrane-spanning regions within the protein, a feature shared by the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. BLAST analysis with the amino acid sequence of MCH-R2 against the GenBankTM data base revealed moderately high homology to known receptors, i.e. the MCH-R1 receptor, somatostatin receptor types 5, 3, 2, and 1, and the κ and δ opioid receptor subtypes. The alignment analysis of the protein sequences by the J. Hein method (27Hein J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 626-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) showed that the highest homology of MCH-R2 is to the human MCH-R1 receptor (35%). Fig. 1 B illustrates the alignment of the MCH-R2 amino acid sequence with human MCH-R1. These analyses suggest that the protein encoded by the ORF sequence may be a novel MCH receptor. The amino acid sequence is identical to that in recent reports that also concluded it to be MCH-R2 (28Hill J. Duckworth M. Murdock P. Rennie G. Sabido-David C. Ames R.S. Szekeres P. Wilson S.

MCH-R2 ORF cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pME18. A CHO cell line was generated that stably expressed MCH-R2 (CHO/MCH-R2). Subsequent studies were performed using this cell line. Specific binding of 125I-MCH to the CHO/MCH-R2 cells was detected (Fig.2 A). No specific binding was observed with wild type CHO cells. Nonradiolabeled MCH competitively inhibited 125I-MCH (0.5 nm) binding to CHO/MCH-R2 with an IC50 of 5.0 ± 1.0 nm(Fig. 2 B). This data demonstrates that MCH specifically binds to MCH-R2 with high affinity.Figure 2Whole cell binding of 125I-MCH to MCH-R2. A, CHO/MCHR-2 cells (circles) and wild type CHO cells (triangles) were exposed to the indicated concentrations of 125I-MCH for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific (nonspec.) binding was determined by the inclusion of 1 μm unlabeled MCH in the binding incubation (open symbols). B, MCH competes with125I-MCH for binding to MCH-R2. CHO/MCH-R2 cells were exposed to 500 pm125I-MCH and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled MCH for 30 min at room temperature. In bothA and B, 125I-MCH bound to the cells was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are means ± S.D. (n = 3) from representative experiments. Similar results were observed in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of MCH to activate MCH-R2 and regulate intracellular signaling is shown in Fig. 3. MCH dose dependently stimulated an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3 A) and IP production (Fig.3 B) in CHO/MCH-R2 cells and in CHO cells expressing MCH-R1 (CHO/MCH-R1). The EC50 values of MCH at MCH-R2 (0.54 ± 0.05 nm in the Ca2+ assay and 3.4 ± 0.2 nm in the IP assay) were lower in both functional assays compared with the EC50 values of MCH at MCH-R1 (5.0 ± 0.6 nm in the Ca2+ assay and 27 ± 9 nm in the IP assay). MCH stimulation of CHO/MCH-R2 cells had no effect on basal (data not shown) or forskolin-stimulated (Fig. 3 C) cAMP production. By contrast MCH stimulation of CHO/MCH-R1 cells inhibited forskolin-provoked increases in cAMP production (Fig. 3 C). Cells expressing MCH-R2 were not responsive to stimulation by somatostatin, dynorphin A, dynorphin B, neuropeptide EI, or neuropeptide GE at concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). These data demonstrate that MCH specifically activates MCH-R2 and suggest that MCH-R2 couples to a Gq-type G protein to mediate intracellular effects. By comparison, MCH-R1 couples to Gi/Go (as demonstrated by inhibition of cAMP production) and Gq-type G proteins in CHO cells (26Hawes B.E. Kil E. Green B. O'Neill K. Fried S. Graziano M.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4524-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Figure 3Comparison of MCH-R2 and MCH-R1 coupling to intracellular signaling. CHO/MCH-R2 and CHO/MCH-R1 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of MCH, and the subsequent changes in intracellular free Ca2+ levels (A), IP accumulation (B), or cAMP production (C) were measured. The data are means ± S.D. from representative experiments. Experiments were performed at least three times producing similar results in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the pharmacological profile of MCH-R2 to MCH-R1, the abilities of mammalian MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and salmon MCH to stimulate increases in intracellular free Ca2+ levels and IP production in CHO/MCH-R1 and CHO/MCH-R2 were assessed. As shown in Fig.4 A, the EC50 for mammalian MCH-stimulated increases in intracellular free Ca2+ levels in CHO/MCH-R2 cells was 0.54 ± 0.05 nm. By comparison, the EC50 of [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH was higher (2.26 ± 0.43 nm). The EC50 for salmon MCH (4.0 ± 0.4 nm) was an order of magnitude higher than that for mammalian MCH. In contrast, in CHO/MCH-R1 cells (Fig. 4 B), EC50 values for mammalian MCH and salmon MCH were quite similar (5.0 ± 0.6 nm for mammalian MCH and 7.1 ± 0.8 nm for salmon MCH). By comparison, the EC50 value of [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH at MCH-R1 in increasing intracellular free Ca2+ was higher (38.5 ± 3.2 nm). The abilities of mammalian MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and salmon MCH to stimulate IP production in CHO/MCH-R1 and CHO/MCH-R2 cells were determined in Fig. 4, C and D. In CHO/MCH-R2 cells (Fig.4 C), the EC50 for salmon MCH-stimulated IP production was much higher compared with that for mammalian MCH or [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH. EC50 values were 3.4 ± 0.2 nm for mammalian MCH, 3.9 ± 0.8 nm for [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and 95 ± 20 nm for salmon MCH. In contrast, mammalian MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and salmon MCH provoked IP production with relatively similar potencies in CHO/MCH-R1 cells (Fig. 4 B). EC50 values were 34 ± 10 nm for mammalian MCH, 64 ± 15 nm for [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and 88 ± 10 nm for salmon MCH. The results in Fig. 4 illustrate different pharmacological profiles between the two cloned MCH receptors. The EC50 of mammalian MCH at MCH-R2 is an order of magnitude lower than that at MCH-R1 in both functional assays. The potency of salmon MCH is much less (10 times in the Ca2+assay and 30 times in the IP assay) than mammalian MCH at MCH-R2. In contrast, the potencies of salmon MCH and mammalian MCH at MCH-R1 are relatively similar.Figure 4Pharmacological comparison of MCH-R2 and MCH-R1. CHO/MCH-R2 cells (A and C) and CHO-MCH-R1 cells (B and D) were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of mammalian MCH (open circles), [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH (filled circles), or salmon MCH (filled triangles). The stimulated increases in intracellular free Ca2+ levels (A and B) and IP production (C andD) were determined. The data in A, B, and C are from representative experiments that were repeated three times with similar results. The data in D are averaged from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the binding affinity of mammalian MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and salmon MCH for MCH-R2 differed, whole cell binding experiments were performed. Binding of125I-MCH to CHO/MCH-R2 cells was competitively inhibited by increasing concentrations of mammalian MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and salmon MCH (Fig.5 A). The affinity of salmon MCH was markedly lower for MCH-R2 compared with that of mammalian MCH and [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH. The IC50values were 5.0 ± 1.0 nm for mammalian MCH, 4.0 ± 2.0 nm for [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and 100 ± 20 nm for salmon MCH. By comparison, the affinities for the three MCH peptides for MCH-R1 appear to be relatively similar (Fig. 5 B). The IC50 values were 3.0 ± 1.0 nm for mammalian MCH, 5.0 ± 1.0 nm for [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH, and 4.0 ± 1.0 nm for salmon MCH at MCH-R1. These data are consistent with the functional data in Fig. 4 and with recent reports characterizing MCH-R2 (28Hill J. Duckworth M. Murdock P. Rennie G. Sabido-David C. Ames R.S. Szekeres P. Wilson S.

C, comparison of the amino acid sequence of mammalian and salmon MCH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The interaction of a ligand with its receptor is a major determinant of affinity. Comparison of mammalian MCH (DFDMLRCMLGRVYRPCWQV) with salmon MCH (DTMRCMVGRVYRPCWEV) reveals that the primary difference between the two ligands is near the N terminus (FDML) outside of the cyclic structure formed by the disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys16. Thus the lower affinity of salmon MCH for MCH-R2 suggests that the 4-amino acid stretch FDML as well as Leu9 and Gln18 may play a role in ligand binding of mammalian MCH with MCH-R2.The expression of MCH-R2 mRNA was determined with Northern and dot blot hybridization with an 800-bp MCH-R2 cDNA fragment in the ORF as probe. The MCH-R2 mRNA was localized primarily to telencephalic regions of the human brain (Fig.6 A). As shown by Northern blot, there is a prominent 4.4-kilobase pair band in total brain and all of the cortical RNAs (Fig. 6 A). The multiple tissue expression array shows strong signals in the amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens as well as in the fetal brain (Fig. 6 B). Previous studies in rat and human brain have defined the expression of MCH-R1. Northern blot and in situ hybridization studies have shown MCH-R1 to be expressed in brain, eye, skeletal muscle, and tongue (21Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G.

Mason P.J. Vulliamy T.J. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Previous NMR studies concluded that its action led to the formation of two 6-phosphogluconolactones (6-P-G-Ls), δ and γ forms (see Fig.6 for structures and interconversions of 6-phosphogluconolactones), but the proposed reaction scheme was still questionable (2Jarori G.K. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The requirement of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL, EC 3.1.1.31) to catalyze hydrolysis of the lactones has been subject to controversy for a long time, because 6-phosphogluconolactones were supposed to hydrolyze spontaneously. Although early studies described the presence of such an enzyme in mammalian cells (e.g. Ref. 3Bauer H.P. Srihari T. Jochims J.C. Hofer H.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a gene encoding a protein with 6PGL activity was only reported two years ago for human cells (4Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This recent unequivocal proof of the existence of a 6PGL resulted in a renewed interest for this protein. Since then, 6PGL enzymes have been identified in several organisms includingPseudomonas aeruginosa, in which it appeared to be essential in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (5Hager P.W. Calfee M.W. Phibbs P.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3934-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other factors that hampered the identification of 6PGL beyond doubt were the fact that its activity could be only assayed using an indirect test (4Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) involving two linking enzymes (G6PDH and the third labile enzyme of the pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.44) and the nature of the chemical species resulting from Glc-6-P oxidation. Taking advantage of the presence of a phosphorus nucleus in each intermediate of this pathway, we undertook 31P and13C NMR studies, first on glucose 6-phosphate oxidation by G6PDH and then on both the spontaneous and enzymatic hydrolysis of 6-P-G-Ls. Our results confirm that human and Trypanosoma brucei 6PGLs are highly active enzymes and highlight their important role in the cell. Particularly, they seem to prevent the accumulation of 6-P-G-Ls that were described previously as highly electrophilic compounds capable of affecting the integrity of endogenous cell compounds (6Rakitzis E.T. Papandreou P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 113: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is assessed by this investigation, and both 6-P-G-L forms (δ and γ) are compared with respect to their reactivity. Furthermore, we report that the N-terminal extension of the unusual G6PDH from Plasmodium falciparum has 6PGL activity, indicating the existence of a bifunctional 6PGL-G6PDH enzyme in this organism. Differences between human, trypanosomal, and malarial 6PGL activities and the reactivity of 6-P-G-Ls are discussed. The nucleotide sequences used in this paper are: AJ249254 (T. bruceiG6PDH), AJ249255 (T. brucei 6PGL), and AJ243972 (human 6PGL) from the EMBL data base and X74988 (P. falciparum G6PDH) from GenBank. All recombinant proteins were made with an N-terminal tag containing a histidine hexapeptide, allowing their purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The T. brucei enzymes (TbG6PDH and Tb6PGL) were produced and purified as described previously (7Duffieux F. Van Roy J. Michels P.A.M. Opperdoes F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27559-27565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human 6PGL cDNA in pBluescript vector (4Collard F. Collet J.-F. Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was provided kindly by Dr. E. Van Schaftingen (Institute of Cellular Pathology, Brussels) and subcloned in the pET-28b vector (Novagen) afterBamHI/NdeI digestion. Overexpression of human 6PGL was performed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen) in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C. When theA600 reached 0.5, induction was performed with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for 3 h. After chilling, the cells were centrifuged, and purification was performed as described for the trypanosomal enzyme. The N-terminal P. falciparum lactonase domain (Pf6PGL) of the bifunctional enzyme was expressed separately. To that end, it was decided, based on a sequence alignment with the T. brucei protein, to replace the codon of residue Cys-276 just before the peptide linker (8O'Brien E. Kurdi-Haidar B.

Kaslow D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 219: 191-194Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) by a stop codon. This would yield a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32,743 Da. The Pf6PGL sequence was amplified with primers containing anNdeI site at the start codon and an XhoI site adjacent to the new stop codon (restriction sites underlined): PFN (sense) 5′-TCCATATGGATTATGAGAATTTTGTAAAAAGTGC-3′ and PFCi (antisense) 5′-TACTCGAGTCAATTAATATCTCTAACAAATCG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction reactions were carried out with genomic DNA from P. falciparum isolate HB3, kindly provided by Dr. A. Scherf (Institut Pasteur, Paris). The Expand high fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche) was used under standard conditions for the amplification. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified with the Qiaex II purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). After selection of a positive recombinant clone by restriction and sequencing, its insert was subcloned in pET-28b using appropriate restriction enzymes. Overexpression of malarial 6PGL was performed in E. coliBL21(DE3) harboring the RIG plasmid (10Baca A.M. Hol W.G.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (courtesy of Dr. W. Hol, University of Washington, Seattle) or in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS. A culture was grown in 1 liter of LB at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.2 and then transferred to 16 °C. Growth was continued until an A600 of 0.4 followed by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside during 18 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 100 mm triethanolamine (TEA), pH 7.4, 350 mmNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, a protease-inhibitor set (Roche), and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl (Fluka). Cells were lysed by two passages through an SLM-Aminco French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Inc.) at 13,000 psi. Nucleic acids were removed by treatment with 315 units of Benzonase (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and protamine sulfate (0.5 mg·ml−1) followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant containing soluble Pf6PGL was applied onto the Talon resin (CLONTECH) for IMAC purification. Subsequent purification steps were performed as recommended by the resin manufacturer at room temperature and lysis buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol and 10 mm imidazole was used to wash the column. Elution of the His6-tagged protein was achieved with lysis buffer plus 150 mmimidazole. The purified recombinant protein was dialyzed for 3 h at 4 °C in 100 mm TEA, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl and stored at 4 °C for several days. Concentration of recombinant proteins was performed using an 8003 Stirred Cell (Amicon) and a YM ultrafiltration membrane (MWCO 10,000, Millipore). Protein samples were separated on size by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were Coomassie Blue-stained or electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for Western blot immunodetection by using a semidry system (11Laurière M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were first blocked in 5% nonfat milk in NaCl-Tris buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation with an anti-His tag antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:5000 dilution in NaCl-Tris/0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was treated with phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted at 1:30,000 for 1 h at room temperature. A 0.5% nitro-blue tetrazolium/0.5% 5-bromo-4-chloroindol-2-yl phosphate solution was used to reveal the phosphatase activity. Glucose 6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconic acid (6-P-G-A) and NADP+ were purchased from Sigma. 6-P-G-Ls were enzymatically prepared in two ways. In both cases, an excess of Glc-6-P was used to provide a quantitative internal reference in NMR spectra. When the purpose was to use the Glc-6-P for the determination of the activity of trypanosomal, human, and malarial 6PGLs, the lactones were prepared using 20 mm Glc-6-P, 5 mm NADP+, 5 mm MgCl2, and 300 nm TbG6PDH in 500 mm TEA, pH 7.2, at 25 °C. 6PGL concentrations ranged from 3 to 500 nm and were added when the oxidation reaction was completed 6 min after the addition of G6PDH. When monitoring the spontaneous hydrolysis and exchange between the γ and δ lactones was the purpose, experiments were performed using 10 mm Glc-6-P, 3 mm NADP+, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm TbG6PDH at 5 °C in 1 mTEA, pH 6.7, in the absence or presence of Tb6PGL (to a final concentration of 3.5 μm). The data were analyzed as described below. These conditions of temperature and pH were also used to test the lactone reactivity toward hydroxylamine. A concentrated solution of NH2OH hydrochloride (Merck) in 1 mTEA, pH 6.7 was added to a final concentration of 25 mm 33 min after the introduction of TbG6PDH. Uniformly 13C-enriched Glc-6-P ([U-13C]Glc-6-P), was used to identify oxidation products by 13C NMR spectroscopy. It was prepared by the phosphorylation of 10 mm of uniformly13C-enriched glucose ([U-13C]glucose) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) at 25 °C with 10 units of yeast hexokinase (Sigma) and 12 mm ATP (Sigma) in 500 mm TEA, pH 6.7. Spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple-resonance1H/13C/15N gradient probe for13C experiments or with a 5-mm reverse broad band probe for31P experiments. For 13C and 31P experiments, 1H broad band decoupling was used. Kinetics were performed by recording a series of one-dimensional spectra accumulated for 2 min (80 scans each). The quantitative determination of compounds was carried out by integration of their corresponding 31P peaks. The known concentration excess of Glc-6-P was used to relate peak height to concentration. The Levenberg-Marquardt χ2 minimization algorithm was used to fit data. Several different initial parameter values were applied to ascertain that the absolute minimum was reached. All samples contained 10% D20 for field/frequency lock. The data were processed with the GIFA software (version 4.31) (12Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.-A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reference for 31P chemical shifts was measured with an external sample of 85% H3PO4 at 25 °C. A dioxane sample (10% in D2O) was used for the13C reference at 25 °C. Human 6PGL was expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain as recombinant His-tagged protein under standard conditions. The overexpression level was very high (120 mg/liter of culture), and the purification by IMAC was efficient (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Plasmodial lactonase (M1-S275) was not detectable even by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) when expressed in strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Nevertheless, recombinant Pf6PGL was successfully expressed in BL21(DE3)RIG but in insoluble form (Fig.1 B, lane 5). Lowering the growth temperature of BL21(DE3)RIG to 16 °C increased the quantity of soluble protein. Under these conditions, the amounts of soluble Pf6PGL recovered after IMAC were still very low (10 μg/liter of culture, Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Growth in minimal medium M9 or under osmotic stress (13Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) did not improve the solubility. At 25 °C and a pH of 7.2, Glc-6-P gave two resonance peaks at 6.65 and 6.70 ppm corresponding to the α and β anomers, respectively (Fig.2, 0 min). The terminal phosphate of NADP+ was observed as a singlet in this region at 5.80 ppm. By starting the reaction by adding TbG6PDH, a global shift to lower ppm values was observed. This shift was caused by the acidification of the sample by NADPH + H+ formation. A new resonance appeared (Fig. 2, 15 min) at 6.4 ppm, which was later resolved into two peaks corresponding to the δ and γ forms of 6-P-G-L (Fig. 2, 45 min). They underwent spontaneous hydrolysis, leading to stable 6-P-G-A, observed as the most downfield peak. This resonance peak was found at 6.20 ppm upon completion of the oxidation reaction (Fig. 2, 120 min) and could be assigned by comparison with the spectrum of commercial 6-P-G-A. The NADPH formed had a resonance beside that of NADP+ in this region. As it has been shown that low pH values slow down the spontaneous hydrolysis of lactones (14Medina-Puerta M.M. Gallego-Iniesta M. Garrido-Pertierra A. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar), we used a lower pH (6.7) in addition to a lower temperature (5 °C) to reduce the reaction velocities. The consequential increase in the lifetime of δ- and γ-6-phosphogluconolactones allowed us to study their individual properties. Moreover, using a high buffer concentration (1m TEA) reduced the pH shift observed in Fig. 2. These conditions also avoided the overlap in chemical shift of both forms of 6-P-G-L (see Fig. 5), allowing the separate integration of their peaks. A high concentration of TbG6PDH (2 μm) has been used to produce high concentrations of the lactones so that their evolution could be followed. Under these conditions, the formation of only one 6-P-G-L could be observed when the oxidation was almost finished, with Glc-6-P reaching a plateau corresponding to its excess with respect to NADP+ (Fig.3). This result clearly shows that the oxidation of Glc-6-P leads to only one form of 6-P-G-L. Emergence of the second 6-P-G-L after completion of oxidation can therefore only be attributed to conversion of the first one. However, 31P NMR alone did not allow us to determine whether the γ- or δ-6-P-G-L was formed by G6PDH. Therefore, 13C NMR spectra were recorded under the same conditions to identify the product of the oxidation. [U-13C]Glucose was used to produce [U-13C]Glc-6-P. This phosphorylation was followed by31P NMR: the 31P spectrum of the produced [U-13C]Glc-6-P was identical to that of unlabeled Glc-6-P (data not shown). The 13C spectrum of [U-13C]Glc-6-P presented 2 doublets at 97 and 93 ppm, which were attributed to the C1 of the β and α forms, respectively (Fig. 4) (15Breitmaier E. Voelter W. Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy: High-resolution Methods and Applications in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. VCH Publishers, Inc., Weinheim, Germany1987Google Scholar). Both peaks decreased when the oxidation reaction started. Emergence of the carboxyl C1 of the first 6-P-G-L (doublet at 175.4 ppm) followed by the formation of a second one a few minutes later (doublet at 178.4 ppm) was observed. At the end of the reaction, only the 6-P-G-A remained in the sample (doublet at 180.1 ppm) (Fig. 4). These chemical shift values indicate unambiguously that the first 6-P-G-L formed is the δ-6-phosphogluconolactone referring to standard tables of 13C chemical shifts (15Breitmaier E. Voelter W. Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy: High-resolution Methods and Applications in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. VCH Publishers, Inc., Weinheim, Germany1987Google Scholar).Figure 331 P peak integration of Glc-6-P , δ-6-P-G-L, and γ-6-P-G-L. The reaction was performed at 5 °C and pH 6.7. The oxidation of Glc-6-P, leading to formation of δ-6-P-G-L, was arrested by the exhaustion of NADP+ 6 min after the addition of 2 μm TbG6PDH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 413 C spectra recorded during (U13C) Glc-6-P oxidation byTb G6PDH at 5 °C and pH 6.7. Total [U-13C]Glc-6-P consumption (α-Glc-6-P at 93 ppm and β-Glc-6-P at 97 ppm) led to δ-6-P-G-L formation (175.4 ppm). γ-6-P-G-L and 6-P-G-A resonance peaks were observed at 178.4 ppm and 180.1 ppm, respectively. The C1 signal is observed as a doublet because of its coupling with C2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under stabilizing conditions for 6-P-G-Ls (5 °C, pH 6.7), the γ-6-phosphogluconolactone concentration reached after 33 min is the same value as that of δ-6-phosphogluconolactone (Fig. 3). At this point, a high concentration of Tb6PGL (3.5 μm) was added to determine the specificity of the enzyme toward 6-P-G-Ls. As shown in Fig. 5, the δ-6-phosphogluconolactone disappeared instantaneously, and the γ-6-phosphogluconolactone was still present for more than 30 min. This result demonstrates that δ-6-P-G-L is the specific substrate for 6-phosphogluconolactonase. The NMR analysis of Glc-6-P oxidation byTbG6PDH allowed us to propose the pathway presented in Fig.6. δ-6-P-G-L, the onlyTbG6PDH product, is in exchange with γ-6-P-G-L.ka, kb,k1, and k2 are the rate constants of the conversion of δ-6-P-G-L into γ-6-P-G-L, the conversion of γ-6-P-G-L into δ-6-P-G-L, the spontaneous hydrolysis of γ-6-P-G-L, and the spontaneous hydrolysis of δ-6-P-G-L, respectively. Moreover, we have shown that only δ-6-P-G-L served as the 6PGL substrate. k6PGL refers to the rate constant of enzymatic hydrolysis and depends also on 6PGL concentrations. In the following, we will use two experiments to determine the rate constants of this scheme. Integration of31P NMR peaks will allow the determination of the concentration of both 6-phosphogluconolactone forms (Fig. 3). In the first experiment, δ(t) and γ(t) correspond to the δ-6-P-G-L, and γ-6-P-G-L concentrations (as a function of time) and are followed in the absence of lactonase (k6PGL = 0). Thus, three relations involving the rate constants are derived. (i) When the Glc-6-P oxidation is arrested (by total consumption of NADP+), spontaneous hydrolysis of the two 6-P-G-Ls and their interchange (Fig. 6) is described by two coupled differential equations. dδdt=−(ka+k2)δ+(kb)γEquation 1 dγdt=(ka)δ−(kb+k1)γEquation 2 We experimentally observed that total NADP+consumption is reached 6 min after the addition of the dehydrogenase, as shown by the constant concentration of Glc-6-P (7 mm, Fig. 3). Analytical resolution is done by matrix diagonalization (16Murray J.D. Mathematical Biology. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) and leads to solutions that are sums of two exponentials. Therefore, the experimental data δ(t) and γ(t) have been fitted by the following expressions, δ(t)=A1exp(λ1t)+A2exp(λ2t)Equation 3 γ(t)=A3exp(λ1t)+A4exp(λ2t))Equation 4 leading to λ1=−0.009 min−1;λ2=−0.050 min−1.Equation 5 According to analytical resolution (16Murray J.D. Mathematical Biology. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) of the system of Equations 1 and 2, expressions depend on the rate constants ofλ1 and λ2. λ1,λ2=Equation 6 −(kb+k1+ka+k2)±(ka+kb+k1+k2) 2−4(kb+k1)(ka+k2)+4kakb2Therefore, λ1+λ2=−(kb+k1+k2+ka).Equation 7 Consequently, (kb+k1+k2+ka)=0.059 min−1.Equation 8 (ii) In Fig. 3, a maximum is observed at 65 min. At this point, dγ/dt = 0. Then, Equation 2 becomes Equation 9. kaδ=(kb+k1)γEquation 9 At this point, δ(t) and γ(t) are directly measured from the curves (Fig. 3), which leads to Equation10. ka=(kb+k1)×1.3 min−1Equation 10 (iii) In this same experiment, we observed that the γ/δ ratio remained constant (γ/δ = 1.6) from 75 min after the beginning of the oxidation reaction until the end of the period of spontaneous hydrolysis. Therefore, by derivation of γ/δ = cte, we obtain Equation 11. 1γ×dγdt=1δ×dδdtEquation 11 Substituting dδ/dt and dγ/dt by Equations 1 and 2, this relation leads to Equations 12 and 13. kb(1+γ/δ)+k1=ka(1+δ/γ)+k2 with γ/δ=1.6Equation 12 k1+2.6×kb=k2+1.6×ka min−1Equation 13 In a second experiment, a large excess of lactonase was used. Thus, the δ-6-phosphogluconolactone concentration remained negligible and Equation 2 can be simplified to Equation 14. dγdt=−(kb+k1)γEquation 14 Then, fitting the γ-6-P-G-L concentration decay by a first-order exponential leads to the fourth relation (Equation 15). kb+k1=0.021 min−1Equation 15 In conclusion, the above experiments enabled us to measure the following. kb+k1+k2+ka=0.059 min−1Equation 8 ka=(kb+k1)×1.3 min−1Equation 10 k1+2.6×kb=k2+1.6×ka min−1Equation 13 kb+k1=0.021 min−1Equation 15 This leads to ka = 0.028 min−1,kb = 0.021 min−1,k1 = 0 min−1, andk2 = 0.010 min−1. The 6-P-G-L reactivity toward a nucleophile model compound, hydroxylamine, was assayed at 5 °C and a pH of 6.7 by measuring its conversion into hydroxamate (6Rakitzis E.T. Papandreou P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 113: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rate constant values were estimated by fitting the increase in hydroxamate concentration and the γ(t) curves upon the addition of 25 mm hydroxylamine. Under these conditions, the decrease in the δ-6-P-G-L concentration became faster and, to a lesser extent, γ-6-P-G-L did also. As a result, only γ-6-P-G-L remained present in the solution (Fig.7). Moreover, we observed that no more 6-P-G-A formation occurred, suggesting that 6-P-G-Ls mainly reacted with hydroxylamine. Hydroxamate formation has been fitted with a pseudo first-order constant (hydroxylamine being in large excess), considering that during the 20 first minutes it was exclusively caused by the δ-6-P-G-L reaction. Thus, an approximate rate constant value (kN2) for the reaction between δ-6-P-G-L and hydroxylamine, at 5 °C and a pH of 6.7, was obtained: kN2 = 5.5 liters.mol−1·min−1. The corresponding constant for γ-6-P-G-L (kN1) was obtained by fitting the second part of kinetics where no more δ-6-P-G-L remained in the solution. Because no spontaneous hydrolysis occurred, the decay of γ-6-P-G-L can be described by Equation 16. dγdt=(kb+kN1)γEquation 16 After the subtraction of kb, value fitting leads to kN1 = 1.0 liters·mol−1·min−1. Lactonase activity was determined at 25 °C and a pH of 7.2 by direct measurement of 6-P-G-A production under conditions of saturating substrate (2 mm). The growth of the 31P NMR peak was first recorded without lactonase as a function of time. This curve was then subtracted from those obtained in the presence of 6PGL (3–500 nm). Hence, the rate constant k6PGL is the slope at the origin of the resulting curve. By using different 6PGL concentrations, we have been able to measure trypanosomal, human, and malarial lactonase activities. 6PGL activities were 60 units/mg of protein, 180 units/mg of protein, and 3330 units/mg of protein for P. falciparum, T. brucei, and human, respectively (one activity uni"
https://openalex.org/W2148232342,"Vaccinia virus (VV) triggers a mitogenic signal at an early stage of infection. VV-induced proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA with kinetics paralleling that stimulated by serum. The VV virokine, or vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), was not crucial for c-fosinduction because it was observed upon infection with the virokine-minus mutant VV (VGF−). Furthermore, c-fos expression did not require infectious virus particles, as it occurred even with UV-inactivated VV and was equally induced by the different multiplicities of infection, i.e.1.0, 5.0, and 25.0. c-fos expression was preceded by VV-induced DNA binding activity and was mediated via the cis-acting elements serum response element (SRE), activating protein-1 (AP-1), and cAMP-response element (CRE). VV activated the protein kinases p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1 and the transcription factor ATF1 in a time-dependent manner with kinetics that paralleled those of VV-stimulated DNA-protein complex formation. The mitogenic signal transmission pathways leading to c-fos activation upon VV infection were apparently mediated by the protein kinases MEK, ERK, and PKA. This assumption was based on the findings that: 1) c-fos transcript was down-regulated; 2) the SRE, AP-1, and CRE binding activities were significantly reduced; and 3) the activation of p42MAPK/ERK2, p44MAPK/ERK1, and ATF1 were drastically affected when the viral infections were carried out in the presence of specific protein kinase inhibitor. Moreover, the mutant VV (VGF−) was also able to activate ERK1/2. It is noteworthy that virus multiplication was equally affected by the same kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the early mitogenic signal triggered upon VV infection relies upon the activation of the protein kinases MEK, ERK, and PKA, which are needed for both signal transduction and virus multiplication. Vaccinia virus (VV) triggers a mitogenic signal at an early stage of infection. VV-induced proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA with kinetics paralleling that stimulated by serum. The VV virokine, or vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), was not crucial for c-fosinduction because it was observed upon infection with the virokine-minus mutant VV (VGF−). Furthermore, c-fos expression did not require infectious virus particles, as it occurred even with UV-inactivated VV and was equally induced by the different multiplicities of infection, i.e.1.0, 5.0, and 25.0. c-fos expression was preceded by VV-induced DNA binding activity and was mediated via the cis-acting elements serum response element (SRE), activating protein-1 (AP-1), and cAMP-response element (CRE). VV activated the protein kinases p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1 and the transcription factor ATF1 in a time-dependent manner with kinetics that paralleled those of VV-stimulated DNA-protein complex formation. The mitogenic signal transmission pathways leading to c-fos activation upon VV infection were apparently mediated by the protein kinases MEK, ERK, and PKA. This assumption was based on the findings that: 1) c-fos transcript was down-regulated; 2) the SRE, AP-1, and CRE binding activities were significantly reduced; and 3) the activation of p42MAPK/ERK2, p44MAPK/ERK1, and ATF1 were drastically affected when the viral infections were carried out in the presence of specific protein kinase inhibitor. Moreover, the mutant VV (VGF−) was also able to activate ERK1/2. It is noteworthy that virus multiplication was equally affected by the same kinase inhibitors.

Special Report Series 220. Medical Research Council, London1936: 4-57Google Scholar), which is associated to the release of soluble growth factor by the infected cells (4Twardzik D.R. Brown J.P.

Studies concerning the mitogenic signals transmitted to the nucleus upon viral infection and leading to proto-oncogene expression have been concentrated on the characterization of the specific signaling pathways involved in the process. For instance, hepatitis B virus activates c-fos and c-jun genes via the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK and JNK (26Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HIV up-regulates c-fos expression leading to AP-1 activation (24Gibellini D. Caputo A. Capitani S. La Placa M. Zauli G.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8392-8395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study was aimed at addressing the proliferative signals triggered at the early stage of VV infection. We provide evidence that the VV-induced c-fos mRNA accumulation occurred on an MOI-, (VGF−)-, and infectious virus particle-independent manner and that the mitogenic signals do not seem to rely on the activation of p38/JNK MAPKs, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We also demonstrated that by orchestrating the coordinated activation of the signaling pathways involving MEK, ERK, and PKA, VV may create an appropriated intracellular environment to facilitate its own multiplication, which seems to be the same for the mutant VV (VGF−). A31 cells (a clone derived from mouse Balb/c 3T3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Cells were infected in the absence of FBS at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) and for the times shown. When indicated, cells were treated with the IPK H89 (PKA) (20 µm), PD98059 (MEK) (100 µm), Ro318220 (PKC) (5 µm), or tyrphostin AG126 (ERK1/2 substrate) (50 µm) for 20 min prior to VV infection and throughout the infection. The doses of drugs used throughout the experiments were established based on the necessary concentration to block the PK without, nonetheless, causing any harm to the cells (34Chijiwa T. Mishima A.

The VV (WR) was UV-inactivated after exposure of the virus stock for 5 min to a UV lamp producing irradiation predominantly at 365 nm. After that time, the UV-irradiated virus was tested for virus infectivity, and no plaque-forming unit was observed as compared with the cells infected with nonirradiated virus. Cells were cultured as described above at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well on a 6-well culture dish and were then VV-infected. Infections were carried out at MOI 10 for 10 h to make sure that 90% of the cells were infected, as was verified microscopically by the cytopathic effect at the end of the experiment. IPK at the indicated concentration was added to the culture 20 min prior to virus infection and remained throughout the experiment (Table I) or was added to the cultures as shown in the diagram depicted on Fig. 7. Viruses were then collected and their infectivity assayed. Viruse plaques were visualized by adding 1 ml of 0.3% crystal violet formalin solution as described (5Buller R.M.L. Chakrabarti S. Moss B.

Then the cells were re-stimulated with FBS, pre-treated with different IPK, or virus-infected for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated as described elsewhere (17Oliveira J.G. Kroon E.G. Ferreira P.C.P. Bonjardim C.A. Placenta. 1997; 18: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and 15 µg of RNA/sample were loaded, eletrophoresed on a 1.5% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK), UV cross-linked for 5 min, and hybridized to the indicated probe labeled with α[32P]dCTP or γ[32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) to a specific activity of 1–5 × 108cpm/µg DNA using a Multiprime DNA labeling system fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK. Hybridizations were carried out as described (36Church G.M Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar), and washing procedures were performed essentially as described (37Franco G.R. Carvalho A.F. Kroon E.G. Lovagie S. Werenne J. Golgher R.R. Ferreira P.C. Bonjardim C.A. Placenta. 1999; 20: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The membranes were stripped of the probe and re-probed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S rRNA, which were used as internal controls for RNA loading. A31 cells were cultured and starved as described above and then VV infected with an MOI of 5.0 for the indicated times. When appropriate, cells were incubated with the specific IPK for 15–60 min prior to and throughout VV infection. EMSA was carried out essentially as described (38Bonjardim C.A. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1997; 30: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by a modification of the method already described (39Zimarino W. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen-cell pellets were thawed on ice and lysed with an equal volume of extraction buffer (0.76 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 m EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were dialyzed against the same buffer as described above, except that 0.1 m NaCl was used, for ∼4 h at 4 °C, and the concentration of protein was determined by the Bio-Rad assay. Twenty µg of protein were pre-incubated with 1.2 µl of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK; 5.4 mg/ml) at room temperature for 10 min followed by the addition of 1.25 µg of BSA, 0.125 µg of Escherichia coli DNA, 0.25 µg of yeast tRNA, 2% Ficoll 400, and 0.32 ng of labeled probe. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 5′ 32P end-labeled double-stranded probes (only one strand is shown) corresponding to the c-fos cis-acting elements (SRE, 5′-GATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′; and CRE, 5′-TGAGCCCGTGACGTTTAC-3′) or to a consensus AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were used in the assays. Cells were grown and starved as described above and then were infected with VV at MOI 1.0, 5.0, or 25.0 for the indicated times. Cells were incubated for 15 min with the IPK PD98059, tyrphostin AG126, H89, or Ro318220 prior to VV infection and throughout the infection. The cells were washed and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.27m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were scraped and collected into Eppendorf tubes and were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate samples (100 µg) were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as described. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with specific rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. After washing the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody and then processed for ECL detection as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). In order to examine a mitogenic signal triggered in the cells early during VV infection, as part of its multiplication strategy, we analyzed the steady-state mRNA level of the primary response gene, c-fos (40Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 41Cooper G.M. Oncogenes—Transcription Factors. 2nd Ed.

VV induction of c-fos transcripts at MOI 1.0 was transient, increased after 10 min, peaked at 30 min, and returned to basal level thereafter (Fig. 1A). We also determined whether the virokine VGF played any role in regulating c-fos expression, because it shares structural and functional similarities with the mitogen EGF. Cells infected with either VV (VGF+) or VV (VGF−) showed similar kinetics of c-fos induction (Fig.1B), and the same was also observed with the UV-inactivated VV (VGF+), although VV (VGF−) induced to a lower level. We conclude that neither VGF nor the infectious virus particles are crucial for c-fos expression. We then investigated the effect of different MOI on c-fos mRNA accumulation and found that the gene was expressed to the same extent regardless differences in the MOI, i.e. MOI 1.0, 5.0, or 25.0 (Fig. 1C). c-fosgene expression is controlled by cis-acting elements positioned at its 5′-untranslated region (43Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19583-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether VV infection could activate proteins with DNA binding properties, whole cells extracts were prepared from cells infected with VV and incubated with double-stranded DNA probes corresponding to the cis-acting elements found in the c-fos promoters SRE (Fig.2A), CRE (Fig. 2B), and AP-1 (Fig. 2C). The results show that upon VV infection, an increasing SRE binding activity was observed as early as 2 min post-infection (lane 3), reaching maximal DNA-protein interaction at 5 min p.i. (lane 4) and decreasing thereafter. Increasing CRE binding activity was also induced by VV (Fig. 2B). The kinetics was delayed compared with both FBS stimulation and SRE DNA binding; it was observed at 10 min p.i. (lane 4), peaked at 60 min p.i. (lane 7), and then returned to basal level at 120 min p.i. (data not shown). The kinetics of AP-1 binding activity upon VV infection (Fig.2C, lanes 1–7) was transient, and an increase over the basal level was seen 5 min p.i. (lane 2), which decreased at 10–15 min p.i. (lanes 3 and 4), respectively. Interestingly, maximal DNA binding activity was found 30 min p.i. (lane 5), which returned to intermediate levels 45 min p.i. (lane 6), and then reached basal level 60 min p.i. (lane 7). To investigate which protein kinases/transcription factors could be activated by VV during the process of c-fos induction, Western blot analysis was performed using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies to ERK1/2, p38MAPK, JNK, and CREB/ATF1. VV activates both p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3A). The kinetics of ERK phosphorylation occurred soon after VV infection, being observed at the earliest time tested p.i. (lane 2) and increasing thereafter up to 60 min (lanes 3–6), whereas ATF1 activation peaked at 15 min p.i. (lane 4) and decreased slightly at 30 and 60 min (lanes 5–6), respectively. CREB phosphorylation remained unaffected (Fig. 3D). In contrast to the strong activation seen for ERK1/ERK2 and ATF1 upon VV infection, JNK/SAPK and p38MAPK were only weakly activated or not activated at all (Fig. 3, B and C), respectively. We also investigated whether differences in the MOI could play a role on the kinetic of ERK1/2 activation. We found that there was not a temporal difference among the MOI used (Fig. 3E), although an MOI-dependent quantitative difference was observed. Fig.3F shows that VV activated ATF1 to the same extent regardless of differences in the MOI, i.e. MOI 1.0, 5.0, or 25.0. To address the question of whether IPK could suppress the VV activation of ERK1/2 and ATF1, the phosphorylation of p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1 and ATF1 was investigated in VV-infected cells pre-treated with different kinase inhibitors. Our findings show that PD98059 or H89 (Fig. 4A, lane 4and B, lane 6) specifically suppresses the VV-induced phosphorylation of p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1 and ATF1, respectively, whereas Ro318220 and AG126 were ineffective. We then asked whether the mutant VV (VGF−) could also activate ERK1/2. We found that the virokine VGF is not a prerequisite for ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that their levels of activation were to the same extent observed with the wild-type virus (Fig. 4C). Moreover, ERK1/2 activation upon VV (VGF−) infection was selectively suppressed by PD98059 (Fig. 4C, lane 3). To investigate whether the VV-induced c-fos DNA binding activity was affected by different IPK, EMSA were conducted after treating the cells with the inhibitor prior to VV infection. The results (Fig. 5A) show that VV induced an SRE binding activity (lane 2), which was drastically reduced in the presence of Ro318220 (lane 3). A significant decrease was also observed when the infections were carried out in the presence of PD98059 and H89 (lanes 4 and5), respectively. The complex formation was mediated by the DNA-binding protein SRF, probably in association with Elk-1 or another TCF family protein, because the anti-SRF antibody caused a strong reduction in binding (lane 6). The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by competition with unlabeled SRE (lane 7), whereas unrelated cold oligonucleotide was not able to compete with the probe (data not shown). VV induced an increased CRE binding activity (Fig. 5B) over the basal level (lane 2), which was down-regulated by both Ro318220 and H89 (lanes 3and 4), respectively. In contrast, PD98059 caused no reduction in VV-induced protein complex formation (lane 5). The specificity of the complex formed was confirmed by competition with a molar excess of cold CRE oligonucleotide (lane 7), although a partial reduction was also observed with molar excess of NF-κB (lane 6). To better characterize the protein with CRE binding activity, specific antibody raised against CREB/ATF1 was used, causing a reduction in the complex formed (lane 8), suggesting that ATF1 was activated (see Fig. 3D) and acquired DNA-binding activity in response to VV infection. VV also stimulated an increased AP-1 binding activity, which was down-regulated upon Ro318220, PD98059, or H89 treatment (data not shown). To determine whether c-fos induction upon VV infection was also affected by pre-incubating the cells with IPK, a panel including Ro318220, H89, PD98059, and tyrphostin AG126 was used. A remarkable reduction in VV-induced c-fos mRNA upon Ro318220, tyrphostin AG126, and PD98059 treatment was observed (Fig.6A, lanes 3, 5, and6), respectively, although H89 (lane 4), to a lesser extent, was also effective in decreasing the proto-oncogene's expression. We then analyzed whether c-fos expression upon VV (VGF−) infection was also affected by the same IPK described above. Our findings (Fig. 6B) showed that VV (VGF−)-induced proto-oncogene mRNA accumulation was similarly repressed by the IPK analyzed. The biological consequences of inhibition of the different PKs were determined by testing the effect of distinct IPK on virus growth. Cells were incubated with the indicated IPK and then infected with VV. We first investigated whether the effects of IPK on virus multiplication were dose-dependent. Table I shows that the different IPK provoked a dose-dependent decrease in virus yields. We then investigated whether the IPK exert their effect on different steps of virus growth. Cells were treated with the IPK Ro318220 (Fig.7A), H89 (Fig. 7B), AG126 (Fig. 7C), or PD98059 (Fig. 7D) according to the scheme depicted in Fig. 7. A significant reduction in viral yields was observed when the infections were carried out in the continued presence of the indicated IPK (94, 82, 96, and 84%, respectively; see Fig. 7, A—D, and Diagram, line 1). We also investigated the effects of these IPK on VV (VGF−) multiplication and found that the mutant was affected to the very same extent as the wild-type virus did (data not shown). Overall, the effect of Ro318220 on VV multiplication paralleled that of tyrphostin AG126 (Fig. 7, A and C). PD98059 also followed the same pattern, except for the last two experimental conditions (Fig. 7D, columns 6 and 7), where its effect on virus growth is similar to H89. Ro318220 affected VV multiplication up to 7 h p.i. (Fig.7A, column 6, 75% r"

Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Studies of the molecular components in the bioluminescence mechanism of fireflies have shown that the substrate of luciferase is firefly luciferin, a polyheterocyclic organic acid, 2-(6-hydroxybenzothiazol-2-yl)-2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (3Bitler B. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 72: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oxyluciferin, which is the product of the luciferase reaction, has a strong inhibitory effect on the firefly luciferase in a manner competitive with firefly luciferin (4Gates B.J. DeLuca M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1971; 22: 2021-2024Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Suzuki and Goto injected [14C]oxyluciferin and 2-[14C]cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole into live fireflies and detected [14C]luciferin after several hours (6Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1974; 32: 2771-2774Google Scholar). They concluded that the luminescence product, oxyluciferin, is supplied as the substrate luciferin for next light emission. Their results may be explained by the following two-step reaction: 1) transformation of oxyluciferin to 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, and 2) condensation of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole with d-cysteine to yield luciferin. The second step can occur under non-enzymatic conditions (Ref. 6Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1974; 32: 2771-2774Google Scholar, Fig. 1). They also suggested that this transformation (the first step) might not be catalyzed by an enzyme because 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole was produced from oxyluciferin without firefly extract for several hours in vitro. We also detected luciferin regeneration from oxyluciferin under non-enzymatic conditions, although this was a very slow reaction. We found an activity that enhanced luciferin regeneration from oxyluciferin in the protein fraction of some firefly extracts (P. pyralis, Luciola cruciata and Luciola lateralis). In this study, we purified the proteins from these fireflies to homogeneity and compared some of their properties. Moreover, we cloned the LRE1cDNA from P. pyralis and confirmed expression the cDNA in Escherichia coli. Activity measurement of LRE was carried out by the following three steps: 1) the fraction was mixed with oxyluciferin, 2) the generated substance, 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, was reacted withd-cysteine, 3) and the amount of the generated substance,d-luciferin, was measured by reacting with luciferase. Oxyluciferin was synthesized by Prof. Isobe of Nagoya Univ. The protein fraction was incubated with 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm oxyluciferin and 5.4 mmMgSO4 at 37 °C for 5 h in the dark. Next, 10 μl of the reaction solution was added to 100 μl of 0.01 mmd-cysteine. After 5 min, 100 μl of 10 mm ATP containing 5 mg/ml of luciferase was added, and luminescence from regenerated luciferin was quantified with a luminometer (BLR-201, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Desiccated extract from 100 mg of firefly lanterns (Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl). After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min), 100 μl of supernatant was injected into a TSKgel G3000 SWXL column (0.78 × 60 cm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). HPLC conditions were as follows: solution, Buffer A; flow rate, 1 ml/min; detector, 280 nm. The eluate was fractionated every 30 s and was analyzed for luciferase activity, amount of luciferin, and luciferin regenerating activity. Desiccated extract from 4 g of dried firefly lanterns (Sigma) was dissolved in 200 ml of Buffer A containing 10% saturation ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant up to a concentration of 39% saturation and kept on ice for 2 h. After a second centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant up to a concentration of 62% saturation and kept on ice overnight. The precipitate was collected and dissolved in 6 ml of Buffer A. The dissolved sample was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Ultrogel AcA34) equilibrated with Buffer A. A-LRE was eluted at 300 ml. The active fractions were combined and concentrated with Centriprep 10 (Amicon), and the buffer was replaced with Buffer B (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mmNaCl). The sample was loaded onto an S-Sepharose FF column. A-LRE was eluted at 100 mm NaCl using a NaCl concentration gradient of 1–200 mm in 500 ml of Buffer B. The active fractions were combined and concentrated with Centriprep 10, and the buffer was replaced with Buffer C (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm NaCl). The sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column. A-LRE was eluted at 100 mm NaCl using a NaCl concentration gradient of 1–200 mm in 500 ml of Buffer C. The active fractions were combined and concentrated with Centriprep 10 to a volume of 2 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a TSKgel super Q 5pw column and subjected to HPLC. A-LRE was eluted at 70 mm NaCl in 50 ml of a 0–200 mm NaCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated with Centriprep 10 to 2 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a TSKgel G3000 SWXL column equilibrated with Buffer A and subjected to HPLC under the same conditions as in Fig.3. A-LRE was eluted at 21 ml. Lanterns (wet weight, 2 g) of frozen L. lateralis were homogenized in 15 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmdithiothreitol using Ace homogenizer AM-3 (Nihon Seiki, Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant of the homogenate was used for purification according the same procedure as described for A-LRE except for 30–60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation. G-LRE was purified from lanterns of L. cruciata according the same procedure as described for H-LRE. Some fractions containing A-LRE were electrophoresed in 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels with SDS. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of A-LRE was determined using a peptide sequencer (ABI 492; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To analyze internal amino acid sequences, LRE was digested by trypsin (7Jenö P. Mini T. Moss S. Hintermann E. Horst M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Purified LRE (∼0.5 mg) was separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 for 5 min and destained with 30% methanol for 5 min, followed by water until the protein band was visible. The band of LRE was cut out and washed with 0.1 mNH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile three times in a microtube. After drying, the gel was stored at −20 °C. The gel was homogenized in 40 μl of digestion buffer containing 50 mmNH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 ng/μl modified trypsin (Promega). After incubation overnight at 37 °C, a supernatant was removed after centrifugation, and the precipitate was washed a total of four times with 40 μl of the following solutions; first, 0.1 mNH4HCO3, and then 5% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile (three times). The supernatant was pooled and concentrated in a centrifugal evaporator. The amino acid sequences of six peptides were determined using an ABI 492 peptide sequencer. Desiccated firefly tails (Sigma) were ground with a mortar and suspended to 10 ml of ISOGEN (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). After centrifugation, total RNA was precipitated with isopropanol from the solution of upper layer. Finally, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex-dT30 (Super) (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). To isolate the cDNA of A-LRE, nine oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: KN3, KN4, KN6, KN7, KC6, KC9, KC10, KC11, and KC12 (Fig. 2). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2.5 pmol of the oligo(dT) primer, 1 μl of P. pyralis mRNA, 1 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates and 5 units of reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 30 min, 99 °C for 5 min and 5 °C for 5 min. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 pmol each of the oligonucleotide primers (KN3, KC6), 20 μl of RT solution and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. Amplification was carried out by an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. Reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis, and the amplified DNA band (0.7 kbp) was recovered from the gel. The 3′-RACE reaction was carried out under the same conditions as RT-PCR except for the primers used. Oligo(dT)-adapter primer (Takara) was used for reverse transcription, and oligonucleotide primers KN4 and M13-M4 (Takara) were used for PCR. The reactions were performed according to Maruyama's protocol (8Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). KC9 primer was phosphorylated by T4 kinase. The first reaction (reverse transcription) was carried out in a final volume of 15 μl containing 200 pmol of phosphorylated primer KC9, 0.6 μg of P. pyralis mRNA, 1 mm of the each four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and 5 units of reverse transcriptase at 30 °C for 10 min, 55 °C for 45 min, 80 °C for 2 min, and 5 °C for 5 min. The second reaction (degeneration of RNA) was carried out in a final volume of 76 μl containing 15 μl of the first reaction solution and 60 units of RNaseH at 30 °C for 60 min. After the reaction, single-stranded DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The third reaction (single-stranded DNA ligation) was carried out in a final volume of 41 μl containing single-stranded DNA from the second reaction, 20 μl of 40% PEG 6000 and 40 units of T4 RNA ligase, at 16 °C overnight. The fourth reaction (first PCR) was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl of 1/10 diluted third reaction solution, 0.4 mm of each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer (KC10, KN4) and 2.5 units of Ex-Taqpolymerase at 94 °C for 3 min followed 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The fifth reaction (nested PCR) was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1 μl of the fourth reaction solution, 0.4 mmof each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer (KC11, KN6) and 2.5 units of Ex-Taq polymerase by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis, and the amplified DNA band (0.4 kbp) was recovered from the gel. The full-length LRE cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR. Reverse transcription of 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA using 2.5 pmol of oligo(dT)-M13-M4 primer was performed for 30 min at 42 °C using 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus RT-XL. The sample was kept at 99 °C for 5 min and used for PCR under the following conditions: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. Primers were KN7 and KC12. PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI site of pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) yielding the expression plasmid pLRE. JM109 carrying pKK223–3 and pLRE were cultivated in L-broth containing 100 μ/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C. When the cell density reached around 2 × 108 cells/ml, the cultures were supplemented with isoprooyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm and further incubated for 4 h. The harvested cells were resuspended in an equal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) and disrupted by ultrasonication and centrifuged to obtain the cell extracts. cDNA fragments of the A-LRE gene were sequenced using a dye terminator sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) running on an ABI 373A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The complete reaction mixtures contained 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmoxyluciferin, 5 mm d-cysteine, and 27.6 μg of LRE. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were injected into a TSKgel super ODS column (4.6 × 50 mm, Tosoh) and eluted at a constant flow rate (0.8 ml/min) with 2 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) in 32% methanol (9Fontes R. Ortiz B. de Diego A. Sillero A. Sillero M.A.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chromatograms were registered simultaneously at a wavelength of 330 nm. Oxyluciferin, luciferin and the nitrile (2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole) were analyzed using super ODS columns under the same conditions. 2-Cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole was synthesized according to the procedure described by White et al. (10White E.H. McCapra F. Field G.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 337-343Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The chromatographic peaks 1, 2, and 3 corresponded to luciferin, the nitrile, and oxyluciferin, respectively. The effects of LRE on the luciferase assay were determined using a luminometer (BLR-201, Aloka) at 25 °C with readings taken every 30 s. The reaction mixture contained 190 μl of 25 mm glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.8), 5.4 mm MgSO4, 0.25 mm luciferin, 2.5 × 10−5 mg/ml luciferase, 5 mm d-cysteine, and 10 μl of purified LRE (13.8 μg) or Buffer A. The resolved firefly lantern extract of P. pyralis(Sigma) was fractionated by HPLC with TSKgel G3000 SWXL. Each fraction was assayed with oxyluciferin and d-cysteine and the amount of regenerated luciferin was measured by luminescence of luciferase and ATP. LRE activity was eluted from the column in the ∼40-kDa protein fraction and was separated from luciferase and luciferin (Fig. 3). The activity in the protein fraction suggested that oxyluciferin could be enzymatically regenerated into luciferin in the firefly lantern. A-LRE, luciferin-regenerating enzyme, was purified from firefly lantern extract of P. pyralis by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by successive column chromatography on Ultrogel AcA34, S-Sepharose FF, Q-Sepharose FF, TSKgel super Q 5pw and TSKgel G3000 SWXL. The purified A-LRE had a molecular mass of ∼38 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 3) and showed maximum activity at pH 7–8 and 40 °C (data not shown). LRE activities were also found in the extracts of two Japanese fireflies (L. cruciata and L. lateralis). Both LREs were purified according to the purification procedure described for P. pyralis except for 30–60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation. LREs from three fireflies, A-LRE (P. pyralis), G-LRE (L. cruciata), and H-LRE (L. lateralis) were characterized together. As shown in Fig.5, the stability of the LREs at different temperatures was investigated. LREs were found to be relatively stable up to 50 °C. However, A-LRE and G-LRE were unstable at temperatures of 60 °C or more. On the other hand, the remaining activity of H-LRE was about 50% after heat treatment at 70 °C for 30 min. H-LRE was found to be most stable among these LREs. The optimum pH value for the reaction was 7.0 for A-LRE and G-LRE and 8.0 for H-LRE (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was determined to be GPVVEKIAELGKYTVGEGP by Edman degradation with an automated protein sequencer (model 492, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A homology search for this sequence in the Swiss-Prot protein sequence data base revealed no matches. This indicated that LRE was a novel protein. LRE was the only enzyme found that acted on oxyluciferin. To analyze the internal amino acid sequence, purified LRE was hydrolyzed by trypsin in gel. An ABI 492 peptide sequencer was used to analyze some peptides separated using the C18 column of the μ-blotter system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the following sequences were determined: IPDPQVTSVAFGGPNLDELH (seq. 1), LNDGKADPLGNLWTGTMAIDAGLPVGPVTG (seq. 2), YTVGEGPHWDHETQTLYFVDT (seq. 3), MHESNIAIANGLAWSNDLK (seq. 4), FVVSLER (seq. 5), VDEYDYDASTLSISNQRPLFTFEK (seq. 6). The N-terminal seven residues of sequence 3 matched the N-terminal region amino acid sequence of LRE, which had already been determined. To obtain a part of the cDNA of A-LRE, we used RT-PCR amplification with oligo(dT) primer and oligonucleotide primers KN3 and KC6. KN3, a sense primer, was designed and synthesized on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified A-LRE. KC6 was synthesized as an antisense primer on the basis of the internal amino acid sequence of a trypsin-hydrolyzed peptide from purified A-LRE. A DNA fragment of ∼0.7 kbp was amplified and sequenced. The N-terminal region amino acid sequence and several amino acid sequences of internal peptides were found in the amino acid sequence deduced from the 0.7-kbp DNA fragment. A new primer, KN4 was synthesized on the basis of the 0.7 kbp DNA fragment and was used for 3′-RACE (11Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment of 0.53 kbp was amplified and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of an internal peptide was found in the amino acid sequence deduced from this fragment. To obtain the 5′-terminal DNA sequence of the cDNA encoding LRE by 5′-RACE, four new primers, KC9, KC10, KC11, and KN6, were synthesized on the basis of the DNA sequence of a 0.7-kbp fragment (8Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). KC9 primer was phosphorylated by T4 kinase and used for reverse transcriptase reaction with avian myeloblastosis virus RT-XL. The resultant single-stranded DNA was ligated with T4 RNA ligase and used for first PCR amplification with KC10 and KN4 primers. Diluted first PCR solution was used for nested PCR amplification with KC11 and KN6 primers. A DNA fragment of 0.4 kbp was amplified and sequenced. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was found in the amino acid sequence deduced from the 0.4-kbp fragment. New primers for the full-length gene, KN7 and KC12, were synthesized, and were used for RT-PCR with oligo(dT) primer for reverse transcription. A DNA fragment of ∼0.9 kbp was amplified and inserted into the pKK223–3 vector. E. coli JM109 was transformed with the ligated plasmid. Plasmid DNA (pLRE) from the transformant, E. coli JM109 (pLRE), was isolated and sequenced. Fig. 6 shows the nucleotide sequence of the A-LRE cDNA consisting of 927 bp. The nucleotide sequences determined by RT-PCR, 3′-RACE, and 5′-RACE existed in this full sequence. The identified N-terminal amino acid sequence was GPVVEKIAELGKYTVGEGP. Although no residue could be assigned to the first position, the remaining sequence is consistent with the ATG codon being used as the initiator methionine codon. The A-LRE polypeptide consists of 308 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33619 Da. This is in agreement with the observed molecular mass of LRE (38 kDa) determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sequence comparison at the amino acid level (deduced from the nucleotide sequence) indicated low levels of similarity to some genes. The alignments revealed 33% similarity to Bacillus hypothetical 33.2-kDa protein in the gerac-fhuc intergenic region and 23% to yeast PCF11 protein. Recombinant E. coli cells, JM109 (pLRE) and JM109 (pKK223–3), were cultured with the addition of 1 mmisoprooyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at the Klett 100, and cell extracts were tested for LRE activity. As shown in TableI, LRE activity was detected in the extract of JM109 (pLRE).Table ILRE activity in E. coli JM 109 containing pLRE and pKK223–3StrainLRE activityE. coli JM 109 (pLRE)0.529E. coli JM 109 (pKK223–3)0.047 Open table in a new tab R-LRE was purified from E. coli (pLRE) cells according to the method for purification of native A-LRE from P. pyralis. Purified R-LRE was assayed with oxyluciferin, and products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse phase chromatography with HPLC (Fig.7). When LRE and d-cysteine were not contained in the reaction mixtures, two major peaks of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole and oxyluciferin and a minor peak of luciferin were observed (Fig.7a). When LRE was added to this reaction mixture, the peak of oxyluciferin was lost, and the peak of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole increased markedly (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, after adding d-cysteine, the peak of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole decreased, and the peak of luciferin became the major peak (Fig. 7c). Luminescence of each reaction mixture was measured by adding luciferase and ATP. Luminescence of the reaction mixture containing LRE andd-cysteine was increased to a greater extent than the others (data not shown). Fig. 8 shows the effects of R-LRE on luciferin-luciferase reaction. Luminescence of luciferase and luciferin with or without R-LRE was monitored with a luminometer. The peak of luminescence with LRE doubled without LRE, and it decreased more slowly than that without LRE. In this paper, we have described the detection, purification, and characterization of novel enzyme, LRE, from three fireflies. Moreover, we have succeeded in cloning, sequence analysis, and expression in E. coli of A-LRE cDNA isolated fromP. pyralis. We found the activity regenerating oxyluciferin intod-luciferin in the extract of the firefly P. pyralis. The activity was eluted in the protein fractions after gel filtration (Fig. 3), which indicated that the regeneration reaction was enzymatic in contrast to Suzuki and Goto's suggestion (6Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1974; 32: 2771-2774Google Scholar). They suggested that d-luciferin was regenerated by a two-step reaction, which was non-enzymatic because d-luciferin was regenerated from oxyluciferin in buffer containing onlyd-cysteine. Our results indicated, however, thatd-luciferin was efficiently regenerated from oxyluciferin by an enzyme, LRE, in the firefly. The molecular size of the purified A-LRE was 38 kDa as determined from its mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4) and 40 kDa as judged from the retention time on the gel filtration column. The value obtained by SDS-PAGE was slightly smaller than that determined by gel filtration, but A-LRE seems to be comprised of a single polypeptide. Intact A-LRE was not modified because R-LRE and A-LRE showed the same mobility on SDS-PAGE. We also purified LREs from two Japanese fireflies (L. cruciata and L. lateralis). Molecular sizes of both LREs were ∼35 kDa as judged from their mobility on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). These two Japanese fireflies are expected to have the same luciferin-regenerating system as P. pyralis, despite the distance between their habitat. Adult fireflies do not eat, drink only water, and therefore must make luciferin without intake of organic compounds. Thus, a system for recycling of luciferin would be necessary for fireflies. The purified LREs were characterized together. Especially, H-LRE was found to be the most stable among these LREs (Fig. 5). Previously, we reported purification and characterization of luciferases from three fireflies (12Kajiyama N. Masuda T. Tatsumi H. Nakano E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Luciferase of L. lateralis was the most stable, similar to LRE. The stability of enzymes originating from insects may be influenced by environmental factors such as the temperature during the growth season becauseL. lateralis is active at a warmer time of the year thanL. cruciata. The cDNA sequence showed that the open reading frame consists of 927 bp, which encodes 308 amino acids. A homology search for amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned LRE cDNA in the Swiss-Prot protein sequence data base revealed some sequences with low levels of homology. This indicated that LRE was a novel protein. Purified recombinant LRE was assayed with oxyluciferin, and products of the reaction were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 7). When oxyluciferin was assayed with LRE, the peak of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole became high. When oxyluciferin was assayed with LRE andd-cysteine, however, a peak of luciferin was found, and the peak of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole had disappeared. These results suggested that LRE catalyzed the conversion from oxyluciferin to 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, and 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole produced by LRE was non-enzymatically converted to luciferin withd-cysteine. These observations agreed with those reported by Suzuki and Goto that condensation of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole with d-cysteine yielded luciferin (6Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1974; 32: 2771-2774Google Scholar). However, they also concluded that oxyluciferin was non-enzymatically converted into 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole. Although luciferin can be reproduced non-enzymatically, LRE markedly increased the efficiency of the reaction. Despite the absence of d-cysteine, very small peaks of luciferin were detected (Fig. 7, a andb). These peaks may have been seen due to contamination by luciferin or d-cysteine in the reaction mixture. Oxyluciferin has a strong inhibitory effect on luciferase in a manner competitive with luciferin (4Gates B.J. DeLuca M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki N. Goto T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1971; 22: 2021-2024Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, conversion of oxyluciferin by LRE appears to result in the rapid turnover of luciferase for the next light emission. To confirm this, purified recombinant LRE was assayed with luciferin and luciferase (Fig. 8). LRE showed some effects on the reaction. Luminescence without LRE was almost zero at 9 min under these conditions. Interestingly, the amount of luminescence integration for 20 min was increased by 25-fold in the presence of LRE as compared with that in its absence. Under these conditions, luminescence was not maintained at the same level as the peak of the reaction. Luciferin is thought to be efficiently recycled in the body of the firefly. Our data are still inadequate, and the reaction system still requires further optimization or other factors may be required. Other factors may be found by the same means as used in the present study; that is, incubation of all gel filtration fractions with oxyluciferin and LRE and analysis of the amount of luciferin regenerated by LRE andd-cysteine by monitoring the luminescence of luciferin. Fractions containing the factors will affect the luciferin regeneration reaction. Luciferase assays have been used to determine the amounts of ATP in the various biological samples, and biotinylated luciferase has been used for immunological detection of various compounds and microorganisms (13Tatsumi H. Fukuda S. Kikuchi M. Koyama Y. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Eisaki et al. have reported a system for recycling of ATP by pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK, E.C. 2.7.9.1) (14Eisaki N. Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Horiuchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Sakakibara T. Murakami S. Eisaki N. Nakajima M. Imai K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this system, AMP and pyrophosphate produced from ATP by luciferase were converted back into ATP by PPDK. The ATP generated by PPDK was used by luciferase, and luminescence of luciferase was amplified. Recycling of ATP is useful to increase the sensitivity of luciferase assays. The system with LRE is also expected to increase the sensitivity of luciferase assays to detect target compounds. Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to determine the optimum conditions for luminescence assays with LRE. We are grateful to Prof. M. Isobe of Nagoya Univ. for oxyluciferin synthesis."

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There is a considerable amount of information about the location of amino acid residues within the SHBG steroid-binding site (2Namkung P.C. Kumar S. Walsh K.A. Petra P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18345-18350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Grenot C. De Montard A. Blachere T. de Ravel M.R. Mappus E. Cuilleron C.-Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7609-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but little is known about the location and topography of the homodimer interface. Recently, it has become possible to resolve these issues in the context of a detailed understanding of the tertiary structure of the amino-terminal laminin G4-like (LG4) domain of human SHBG (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This region of human SHBG comprises the steroid-binding site, as well as residues important for dimer formation (3Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Hildebrand C. Bocchinfuso W.P. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and crystal structure analysis has revealed a potential interface between two SHBG LG4 domains that could account for the homodimerization of SHBG monomers (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Measurements of the steroid binding capacity and protein concentration of purified SHBG have led to the prevailing opinion that an equimolar relationship exists between SHBG homodimer and steroid ligand (7Hammond G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and this has supported the notion that a single steroid-binding site is located within the dimer interface (8Petra P.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 735-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, our crystal structure data indicated that amino acid residues within what appears to be the most likely dimer interface do not participate in steroid binding and that each monomer of the SHBG homodimer contains a steroid-binding site (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is known that SHBG monomers interact very strongly (Kd about 10−12m) with each other (9Strel'chyonok O.A. Avvakumov G.V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 35: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and can be effectively dissociated only under denaturing conditions such as treatment with guanidinium chloride (10Sui L.-M. Hughes W. Hoppe A.J. Petra P.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that dimer formation is promoted in the presence of steroid ligand (6Hildebrand C. Bocchinfuso W.P. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been virtually impossible to determine whether each monomer binds steroid or if the process of dimerization somehow creates a single high affinity steroid-binding site. Although a homodimeric preparation of the human SHBG LG4 domain was used for crystal structure determination (11Grishkovskaya I. Sklenar G. Avvakumov G.V. Dales D. Behlke J. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 2053-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the steroid-binding sites in each subunit of this structure were completely occupied (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), these complexes were obtained in the presence of a great excess of steroid ligand. Under these conditions, both steroid-binding sites may have been artificially saturated. Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that dimer formation somehow blocks the access of ligand to one binding site or substantially reduces the binding affinity of one site within the homodimer under physiological conditions. The crystal structure of the human SHBG LG4 domain suggested that dimerization occurs through β-strand pairing between strands β7 of one monomer and β10 of another (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this configuration, a 2-fold symmetry axis across the dimer interface allows β-strand pairing to be repeated with the formation of a large hydrophobic interaction patch at the center of the proposed interface. To test this model, we created a series of SHBG variants containing amino acid substitutions that would cause steric clashes at predicted points of interaction between SHBG monomers and thereby disrupt dimer formation. In this way, we have been able to verify the topography of the dimerization interface, and the dimerization-deficient SHBG variants we produced have allowed us to demonstrate unequivocally that the SHBG homodimer contains two high affinity steroid-binding sites. Analysis of the dimerization interface was based on the 1.55 Å crystal structure 2PDB number: 1D2S. of the human SHBG LG4 domain (residues 1–205) in complex with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (PDB:1D2S). Model visualizations were performed with program O (12Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Accessible surface areas were calculated with program AREAIMOL of the CCP4 program suite (13The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Number 4 Collaborative ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å. A cDNA encoding the human SHBG precursor 3GenBank™ Accession Number NM_001040. was inserted into a pSelect-1 phagemid (Promega) for site-directed mutagenesis (14Bocchinfuso W.P. Ma K.-L. Lee W.M. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer sequences for mutagenesis were: V89E, 5′-TGGTCCAGCACCCTCCGTAAGCTGGGC; A85S/V89E/A91S, 5′-TCTCCCATCATCCAGCCGTGGTCCAGAACCCTCCGTAAGCTGGGACCAGTGTAAGTGCAGTTGGATCTC; L122E, 5′-TGTCTCAGGCGCTCCACCTCCTCCCCATC; Q126A, 5′-AGGGGCCCAGAGACTGCTCTCAGGCGCAGCA (the altered nucleotides are underlined). The mutated cDNAs were subcloned into a pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that only the targeted mutations were present. The resulting plasmids were used for transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO pro−, wild type) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. After selection in the presence of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), stably transformed cells were grown to near confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove fetal bovine serum, and were then cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2–4 days. Cell culture medium from CHO cells expressing wild-type (14Bocchinfuso W.P. Ma K.-L. Lee W.M. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mutated human SHBG cDNAs were collected, concentrated using Ultrafree 15 devices (Amicon), and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in Slide-a-lyzers (Sigma) against 100 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm DHT. A standard saturation analysis method employing dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) as a separation agent and [3H]DHT (42 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as labeled ligand was used to determine the steroid binding capacity, affinity, and specificity of SHBG (15Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To compare the steroid binding capacities of wild-type SHBG and dimerization-deficient SHBG variants, the concentrations of SHBG monomers in samples were equalized based on their immunoreactivity on a Western blot prior to steroid binding assays. Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under non-denaturing or denaturing conditions and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting. The blots were blocked and then incubated with 1:500 diluted rabbit anti-human SHBG antiserum (16Hammond G.L. Langley M.S. Robinson P.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Blots were scanned with a ScanJet 5370C scanner (Hewlett-Packard) and quantified using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Gel filtration chromatography of concentrated cell culture media containing wild-type SHBG or dimerization-deficient SHBG variants was performed using an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples (150–200 μl) were loaded onto a 1 × 30-cm Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 μm DHT, 0.05% NaN3, and calibrated using gel filtration marker proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was performed with the same buffer, and 250-μl fractions were collected and analyzed for steroid binding activity by Western blotting. To verify that wild-type SHBG and the dimerization-deficient SHBG variants produced by CHO cells were equally capable of binding steroid ligand, we used a steroid affinity matrix to adsorb them from the culture medium. This was also done to exclude the possibility that some undefined fraction of these recombinant products lacked steroid binding activity. To this end, 300 μl of concentrated culture medium, containing either wild-type SHBG or SHBG variants, was first treated with a DCC pellet to remove steroid and was then incubated (2 h at room temperature) with 30 μl of 5α-dihydrotestosterone-17α-hexanoic acid-Sepharose (HAHA-Sepharose) (17Hammond G.L. Robinson P.A. Sugino H. Ward D.N. Finne J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g, samples of the supernatants were taken for a steroid binding capacity assay and Western blotting. In this way, the amounts of SHBG in these samples were compared using two independent methods against samples of the corresponding proteins prior to affinity adsorption. Furthermore, to assess nonspecific adsorption of proteins to the affinity resin, similar experiments were performed either in the presence of 1 μm DHT or with Sepharose CL-4B instead of the affinity resin. Analysis of the human SHBG LG4 domain crystal structure indicated that homodimerization occurs through a 2-fold symmetry axis located at the edge of the β-sheet sandwich of each SHBG monomer (Fig.1). This symmetry axis places strand β7 of one monomer next to strand β10 of the other monomer and vice versa. As a consequence, the main chain hydrogen bond pairing characteristic for β-sheets extends across the interface, and two contiguous 14-stranded β-sheets are generated in the SHBG homodimer (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In total, 8 main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds are formed across the interface, and 24 residues from each monomer participate in the process of dimerization with each monomer contributing about 760 Å2 to the interface surface. Contributions are from four different segments of the SHBG LG4 domain, i.e. from the loop connecting strand β5 to β6, from strand β7, from strand β10, and from the large insertion between strands β11 and β12 (Fig. 2). However, strands β7 and β10 account for about 580 Å2 (76%) of the interface surface and far exceed the contributions of the other segments.Figure 2Surface area contributed by individual amino acids to the dimer interface. The values were calculated from differences in the solvent accessibility of individual amino acids in the context of the monomer and the dimer. As indicated in theupper part of the graph, residues from four different segments of SHBG contribute to the interface. The secondary structure designation is as defined previously (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the numbering of residues refers to their position in the mature polypeptide (7Hammond G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The central region of the interface is very hydrophobic in nature and involves residues Ala-85, Leu-87, Val-89, Leu-122, and Leu-124, which are strictly conserved in SHBG from different species, as well as the largely conserved residues Ala-91 and Val-121 (18Hammond G.L. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. IRL Press, Oxford University, Oxford1993: 1-25Google Scholar). The hydrophobic core is surrounded by inter-β-sheet main chain:main chain hydrogen bonds, as well as a number of hydrophilic side chain contacts provided for example by residues Arg-75, Glu-120, Arg-125, Gln-126, and Arg-154 (Fig. 1). The side chain of each of these residues contributes more than 40 Å2 to the interface. The contribution of single amino acids to the affinity of interaction between proteins often correlates poorly with the surface area that individual amino acids contribute to the interaction (19Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). In addition, in the case of SHBG, the dimer interface contains numerous main chain-main chain interactions. Thus, we anticipated that it would be difficult to abolish SHBG dimer formation by removing side chain-side chain interactions through the substitution of individual amino acids with alanine. Instead, we opted to disrupt the dimer interface by introducing larger side chains, which would cause severe steric clashes at the proposed dimerization interface. In this context, residues Val-89 and Leu-122, as well as Ala-85 and Ala-91, which are located in the center of the hydrophobic core region of the interface, were identified as the most promising candidates for substitution, and we therefore prepared the following SHBG variants: V89E, L122E, and A85S/V89E/A91S. In addition, previous data suggest a possible role for the large loop connecting strands β11 to β12 in the dimerization of human SHBG (3Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two residues from this segment, namely Arg-154 and Leu-155, are located within the dimerization site (Fig. 2), and Arg-154 contacts Gln-126 at the dimer interface. Accordingly, an SHBG Q126A variant was also produced to evaluate the possible contribution of this residue to dimer formation. This model of the homodimer interface is based on crystal structure data obtained using only the first 205 residues of human SHBG produced in bacteria, and it does not take into account any possible influences that glycosylation or the carboxyl-terminal LG5 domain might have on dimer formation. To circumvent this shortcoming, all the SHBG variants we have studied were produced in mammalian cells as fully glycosylated, intact SHBG molecules. The ability of these SHBG variants to form homodimers was also assessed by two independent methods, namely Western blotting after electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions and gel filtration chromatography. The Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) shows that the Q126A SHBG variant migrates as a dimeric protein similar to wild-type SHBG during PAGE under non-denaturing conditions, whereas the A85S/V89E/A91S, V89E, and L122E SHBG variants have an increased electrophoretic mobility consistent with the presence of only a monomer (3Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, although contacts between Arg-154 and Gln-126 are not critical for dimer formation, disruption of the hydrophobic patch between strands β7 and β10 completely abolishes dimerization (Fig.3), and this was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4). The chromatographic profile shown in Fig. 4 clearly indicates that the hydrodynamic properties of the SHBG V89E dimerization-deficient variant are consistent with a molecular mass of ∼48 kDa. By contrast, the elution volume of wild-type SHBG corresponds to a homodimer with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, which agrees with a previous report (17Hammond G.L. Robinson P.A. Sugino H. Ward D.N. Finne J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The latter experiment in which chromatography fractions were monitored for steroid binding activity also provided the first evidence that dimerization-deficient mutants are capable of binding steroid.Figure 4Gel filtration of wild-type SHBG (circles) and SHBG V89E (triangles). Specific binding of [3H]DHT was determined in the fractions eluted from a Superdex 75 column (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).Arrows indicate positions of the peaks of marker proteins, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results indicate that the hydrophobic patch at the center of the dimer interface plays a predominant role in the homodimerization of SHBG. Our data also indicate that appropriate dimerization will not occur if this region contains amino acids with larger side chains. We therefore conclude that the hydrophobic side chains pack tightly within the dimer interface and that the interface shape complementarity is high. Moreover, these data are consistent with our predicted structure of the intact human SHBG homodimer (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and its rod-shaped appearance on electron micrographs (20Beck K. Gruber T.M. Ridgway C.C. Hughes W. Sui L.-M. Petra P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although our data do not preclude involvement of the LG5 domain of SHBG in the dimerization process, any such contribution must be minor. However, the LG5 domain may influence the overall stability of the homodimer in some way because removal of steroid destabilizes SHBG LG4 homodimers much more effectively (6Hildebrand C. Bocchinfuso W.P. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) than full-length SHBG produced in mammalian cells or purified from blood (3Bocchinfuso W.P. Hammond G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10622-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that occupancy of the steroid-binding site alters the conformation of the dimerization interface and that this is less constrained in the absence of the LG5 domain. To date, we have been unable to obtain a crystal structure of the SHBG LG4 domain in the absence of ligand, and this may be due to the presence of a heterogeneous mixture of incomplete or unstable dimers. The availability of dimerization-deficient human SHBG variants may help resolve this problem. If crystallization of the dimerization-deficient variants can be accomplished, it may be possible to resolve any conformational changes that occur upon steroid binding and that indirectly enhance dimer formation. The assumption that human SHBG contains only a single high affinity steroid-binding site is based primarily on comparative measurements of the steroid binding capacity and protein concentration of purified human SHBG (16Hammond G.L. Langley M.S. Robinson P.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the dye binding assays used to determine the concentrations of pure SHBG are subject to error (21Macart M. Gerbaut L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 122: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the question of its steroid binding stoichiometry has never been adequately investigated. The availability of dimerization-deficient SHBG variants has enabled us to address this issue in a manner that does not rely on conventional protein concentration measurements. This was accomplished by comparing the steroid binding capacities of wild-type SHBG and SHBG dimerization-deficient variants after equalization of their molar concentrations with respect to monomer content (Fig.5). On this Western blot, the concentrations of SHBG monomers present in samples of the wild-type homodimer (lane 1) and the dimerization-deficient variants (lanes 2–4) have been equalized based on their immunoreactivity by appropriate dilution. It could be argued that the immunoreactivity of mutant monomers may be impaired, but this is unlikely because all protein samples were denatured prior to PAGE, and all three dimerization-deficient variants exhibit essentially identical immunoreactivity with respect to their steroid binding capacity (Fig.5). Under denaturing conditions, SHBG migrates as two major electrophoretic isoforms (22Cheng C.Y. Musto N.A. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 22: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which reflects differences in N-linked glycosylation within the carboxyl-terminal LG5 domain (14Bocchinfuso W.P. Ma K.-L. Lee W.M. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this context, it is of interest that the electrophoretic microheterogeneity of the V89E and A85S/V89E/A91S SHBG variants resembles that of wild-type SHBG, whereas the two main electrophoretic isoforms of the L122E SHBG variant migrate differently, consistent with a difference inN-linked glycosylation (Fig. 5). This suggests that amino acid substitutions within the LG4 domain can influence the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides within the LG5 domain, but this has no effect on dimerization (Fig. 3) or steroid binding (Fig. 5). More importantly, when these samples of wild-type SHBG and the dimerization-deficient variants containing equal concentrations of the SHBG monomer were compared with respect to their steroid binding capacities, these were within 5% of each other (Fig. 5). Although these data indicate that each monomer within the homodimer has essentially the same steroid binding capacity as the dimerization-deficient SHBG variants, we also considered the possibility that a portion of the dimerization-deficient variants might be defective and lack steroid binding activity. However, this was excluded by the complete and specific adsorption of both wild-type SHBG and SHBG V89E by a steroid-affinity resin (Fig.6). Furthermore, in contrast to the micromolar concentrations of steroid ligand used to obtain SHBG crystals (11Grishkovskaya I. Sklenar G. Avvakumov G.V. Dales D. Behlke J. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 2053-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), these analyses employed nanomolar concentrations of steroids, and we obtained no evidence for more than one class of steroid-binding site in wild-type SHBG or the dimerization-deficient SHBG variants by Scatchard analysis (data not shown). There was also no difference in their steroid binding affinities or ligand specificity (Table I). Thus, these data allow us to conclude for the first time that the human SHBG homodimer contains two equally active steroid-binding sites and to raise some interesting issues related to the biological function of human SHBG. For instance, they suggest that the two steroid-binding sites within the SHBG homodimer can be partially occupied or even occupied by different classes of steroid ligands. These possibilities need to be considered particularly in the context of ligand-dependent interactions between SHBG and plasma membrane proteins, which have been proposed to play a role in the non-genomic mechanism of steroid hormone action (23Hryb D.J.

Measurements of serum SHBG levels are widely used in the evaluation of clinical conditions associated with androgen excess because they provide an indication of the amount of free testosterone in the blood (24Siiteri P.K.

Diagnostic assays used for this purpose are based largely on immunoassays, which are standardized using reference samples calibrated in terms of their steroid binding capacity.

The reduced binding of both 125I-IGF1 and αIR3 anti-IGFR antibody to whole cells showed that IGFR are lost from the surface of MCF7 cells as cell density increases, and this occurred irrespective of the presence or absence of estradiol. Western immunoblotting further confirmed loss of type I IGFR from MCF7 cells with increasing cell density. Long term estrogen deprivation was found to increase the levels of IGFR at all cell densities, such that after 96 weeks of estrogen deprivation, IGFR levels had become similar at the highest cell density in the absence of estradiol to the IGFR levels at the lowest cell density in the estrogen-maintained cells, and the levels of IGFR could be increased still further by estradiol. This overexpression of IGFR in the estrogen-deprived cells correlated with a reversal of response to exogenously added ligand, in that concentrations of insulin, IGFI, and IGFII that had stimulated growth of the estrogen-maintained cells became growth inhibitory to the estrogen-deprived cells. Blockade of the IGFIR with the αIR3 anti-IGFR antibody could partially inhibit the growth of the estrogen-deprived cells, suggesting that up-regulation of IGFR in these cells may contribute to the mechanism of adaptation to growth in steroid-deprived conditions which results in progression to estrogen independence of cell growth.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 1-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The extensive clinical literature provides evidence that, when estrogen receptors (ER) are present, estrogen is a main stimulus for growth of breast cancer cells both in vitro (2Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Regulatory Mechanisms in Breast Cancer: Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Breast Cancer. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 1-452Google Scholar) and in vivo (3Miller W.R. Estrogen and Breast Cancer. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 1-203Google Scholar). IGFs have been implicated in growth regulation of breast cancer cells (4Rasmussen A.A. Cullen K.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) since they are mitogenic to such cells (5Cullen K.J. Yee D. Sly W.S. Perdue J. Hampton B. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar) and also because blockade of the IGF receptor can reduce growth of the cells in the absence of estrogen (6Arteaga C.L. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6237-6241PubMed Google Scholar). Breast cancer cell lines possess IGFII (7Yee D. Cullen K.J. Paik S. Perdue J.F. Hampton B. Schwartz A. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6691-6696PubMed Google Scholar), make several of the IGFBPs (8Oh Y. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and have functional IGF receptors (5Cullen K.J. Yee D. Sly W.S. Perdue J. Hampton B. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 48-53PubMed Google Scholar), both type I (IGFIR) (9Surmacz E. Guvakova M.A. Nolan M.K. Nicosia R.F. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and type II (IGFIIR) (10Oates A.J. Schumaker L.M. Jenkins S.B. Pearce A.A. DaCosta S.A. Arun B. Ellis M.J.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, there appear to be many cross-talk pathways between estrogen and IGF (11Nicholson R.I. McClelland R.A.

Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 128: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and of estrogen-regulated genes such as pS2 (18Chalbos D. Philips A. Galtier F. Rochefort H. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,19Abdul-Wahab K. Corcoran D. Perachiotti A. Darbre P.D. Cell Proliferation. 1999; 32: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies have shown that increasing limiting components of the IGF pathway can negate estrogen regulation (19Abdul-Wahab K. Corcoran D. Perachiotti A. Darbre P.D. Cell Proliferation. 1999; 32: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 20Daly R.J. Harris W.H. Wang D.Y. Darbre P.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cullen K.J. Lippman M.E. Chow D. Hill S. Rosen N. Zwiebel J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IGFII alone could override the need for estrogen in MCF7 human breast cancer cells (20Daly R.J. Harris W.H. Wang D.Y. Darbre P.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cullen K.J. Lippman M.E. Chow D. Hill S. Rosen N. Zwiebel J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) where the limiting component was ligand (20Daly R.J. Harris W.H. Wang D.Y. Darbre P.D. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar) and not receptor (22Daws M.R. Westley B.R. May F.E.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but in ZR-75–1 human breast cancer cells overexpression of IGFII could only override the estrogen requirement when IGFIR (the limiting component) were simultaneously overexpressed (19Abdul-Wahab K. Corcoran D. Perachiotti A. Darbre P.D. Cell Proliferation. 1999; 32: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The interrelationship between IGFR and ER signaling is shown also in vivo through the tendency for levels of IGFR to correlate positively with levels of ER in breast cancers (3Miller W.R. Estrogen and Breast Cancer. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 1-203Google Scholar,9Surmacz E. Guvakova M.A. Nolan M.K. Nicosia R.F. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and it is thought that abnormally high levels of IGFRs may contribute to increase in tumor mass and/or aid tumor recurrence (9Surmacz E. Guvakova M.A. Nolan M.K. Nicosia R.F. Sciacca L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Part of the molecular basis for these cross-talk pathways may relate to an ability of ER to interact with the AP1 pathway (23Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), but the full picture remains far from clear. Although some studies have shown that estrogen can alter IGFR levels (22Daws M.R. Westley B.R. May F.E.B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether this is a mechanism or a consequence of estrogen action on cell growth. Work in other systems has shown that growth factor receptor levels are regulated by cell density (24Clemmons D.R. Elgin R.G. James P.E. J. Clin. Endocinol. & Metab. 1986; 63: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Scott C.D. Baxter R.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Rizzino A.

Pathobiology. 1998; 66: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and estrogen acts to increase cell density including saturation density (35Darbre P.D. Daly R.J. Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. Sect. B. 1989; 95: 119-132Google Scholar). Since regulation of cell density and contact inhibition are fundamental parameters in cell growth control, we have studied here the effects of cell density on IGFR levels in breast cancer cells grown in the presence and absence of estrogen. A further issue in estrogen growth control of breast cancer cells is the ability of these cells to escape from regulation by estrogen. Loss of response to endocrine therapy is a major problem in the clinical management of breast cancer (3Miller W.R. Estrogen and Breast Cancer. Chapman & Hall, New York1996: 1-203Google Scholar), and such loss of response can be modeled in vitro (36Darbre P.D. Daly R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In cell culture systems, breast cancer cells possess a remarkable ability to adapt to prevailing growth conditions and to escape from any imposed growth inhibition. While maintained in the presence of estradiol, estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines remain growth-regulated by estrogen, in that growth is severely reduced by removal of estrogen or addition of anti-estrogen (37Glover J.F. Irwin J.T. Darbre P.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3693-3697PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon long term removal of estrogen from the culture medium, the cells gradually adapt, developing an ability to grow without estrogen until they can eventually grow at the same rate as they had done previously only in the presence of estrogen (38Katzenellenbogen B.S. Kendra K.L. Norman M.J. Berthois Y. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4355-4360PubMed Google Scholar, 39Welshons W.V. Jordan V.C. Eur. J. Cancer Clin.

Similar adaptive processes enable the cells to escape from growth inhibition imposed by the anti-estrogens tamoxifen (41Parisot J.P. Hu X.F. DeLuise M. Zalcberg J.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and ICI 182,780 (42Jensen B.L. Skouv J. Lundholt B.K. Lykkesfeldt A.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or by retinoic acid (43Stephen R. Darbre P.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this growth adaptation remains unknown, but recent work has shown that development of estrogen hypersensitivity resulting from up-regulation of ER and increased estrogen-regulated gene expression may be involved (44Jeng M.H. Shupnik M.A. Bender T.P. Westin E.H. Bandyopadhyay D. Kumar R. Masamura S. Santen R.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4164-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated whether there is any involvement of an IGF cross-talk pathway through development of hypersensitivity to IGF and increased IGFR levels. Stock MCF7 McGrath human breast cancer cells were kindly provided by Dr. K. Osborne at passage number 390 (45Osborne C.K. Hobbs K. Trent J.M. Breast Cancer Res. 1987; 9: 111-121Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and were dependent on estrogen for growth in monolayer culture as described previously (35Darbre P.D. Daly R.J. Proc. R. Soc. Edinb. Sect. B. 1989; 95: 119-132Google Scholar). Cells were maintained routinely as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10−8m 17β-estradiol (Steraloids, Croydon, UK), and 10 µg/ml insulin (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 10% carbon dioxide in air at 37 °C. Estradiol was dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1/10,000 in culture medium. All cell stocks were subcultured at weekly intervals by suspension with 0.06% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, pH 7.3. A new vial of cells was thawed from liquid nitrogen at the start of each experiment, which ensured that control cells of the starting passage number were available for comparison at any time. Freshly thawed cells were grown for 2 weeks as stock cultures (see above) and then suspended with phenol red-free 0.06% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, pH 7.3, washed with phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and replated in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% dextran-charcoal stripped FCS (DCFCS) (46Darbre P. Yates J. Curtis S. King R.J.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were routinely maintained in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium with 5% DCFCS, subculturing every 2–3 weeks during the initial period of slow growth, and increasing to subculturing at weekly intervals as the growth rate increased. Cells were suspended from stock plates (either estrogen-maintained or estrogen-deprived) by treatment with phenol red-free 0.06% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, pH 7.3, added to an equal volume of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% DCFCS (36Darbre P.D. Daly R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and counted on a hemocytometer. Cells were then added to the required volume of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% DCFCS at a concentration of 0.2 × 105 cells/ml and plated in monolayer in 0.5-ml aliquots into 24-well plastic tissue culture dishes (Nunc). After 24 h, the medium was changed to phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% DCFCS and the required concentration of 17β-estradiol, insulin, IGFI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), IGFII (Bachem), αIR3 antibody (Oncogene Science), or mouse IgG (Sigma). Culture medium was changed routinely every 3–4 days in all experiments. Cell counts were performed by counting released nuclei on a model ZBI Coulter Counter, as described previously (46Darbre P. Yates J. Curtis S. King R.J.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 349-354PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 24-well plastic tissue culture dishes in 0.5-ml aliquots in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% DCFCS at densities from 0.05–0.5 × 105 cells per dish and grown for 5 days. Cells were then washed in RPMI 1640 medium, transferred into serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer, 0.25% w/v bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma)), and left overnight. After 24 h, three dishes of each treatment were used to estimate cell numbers by Coulter counting as above, and three dishes were used to assay IGFR by radioligand binding assay. For the binding assay, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with 80,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-I (specific activity 200–250 Ci/mmol made by the IODO-GEN method (47Salacinski P.R.P. McLean C. Sykes E.C. Clement-Jones V.V. Lowry P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar)) with or without 30 µm insulin in 0.2 ml of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 3 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold isotonic saline; the cell layer was solubilized in ice-cold 0.5m sodium hydroxide, and incorporated radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. Since insulin at 30 µmsuppresses only receptor binding and does not bind to binding proteins (48Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), specific receptor binding was assessed by subtraction of non-receptor binding in the presence of insulin from total binding in the absence of insulin. Results are expressed as fmol125I-IGFI bound per 106 cells. Scatchard analysis was carried out as above but by adding increasing amounts of 125I-IGFI and by using 125I-IGFI radiolabeled to a specific activity of 2000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results are expressed on the y axis as ratios of bound (specific) IGFI to free IGFI and on the x axis as pmol of IGFI-specific binding per 1,000,000 cells per liter (pm). Values for the dissociation constant (K d) were calculated from the slope of the best-fit line. Stock MCF7 cells were plated at varying cell densities onto 22-mm diameter glass coverslips inside 3.5-cm plastic tissue culture dishes in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% DCFCS either with or without 10−8m 17β-estradiol for 3 days. Cells were fixed on each coverslip in methanol at room temperature for 10 min and then washed in PBS. Each coverslip was incubated for 10 min with 20 µl of normal rabbit serum/80 µl of 0.5 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6 (TBS), and then washed in TBS. Cells were incubated in 100 µl of TBS containing αIR3 antibody at 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C and then washed in 400 ml TBS for 10 min. Cells were incubated in 100 µl of TBS containing biotinylated anti-chicken antibody (Dako) at 1:500 dilution at room temperature for 4 h and then washed in 400 ml of TBS for 10 min. Cells were finally incubated with 100 ml of PBS with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Dako) at 1:100 dilution at room temperature for 1 h, washed in tap water for 10 min, and wet-mounted using vectoshield sealed with cosmetic nail varnish. Microscopy was performed at once using a Leitz confocal microscope. Stock MCF7 cells were plated at varying densities onto 24-well plastic tissue culture dishes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% DCFCS and 10−8m 17β-estradiol. After 5–7 days, 3 wells were counted (see above) to provide the cell density at the time of harvest. Other wells were harvested directly into 26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue. Samples were sonicated and boiled before loading onto SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), and 150 µg of protein was loaded per gel track. Rainbow-colored high molecular weight protein markers in the 14–220-kDa range were loaded as standards to each gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by semi-dry Western blotting in 48 mm Tris, 39 mmglycine, 1.3 mm SDS, 20% v/v methanol. The membrane was blocked with 0.1% v/v Tween 20, 5% w/v dried milk in PBS at 4 °C for 18 h, and immunoblotted with a 1:100 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-human IGFIR antibody (Ab-3, Oncogene Research) in 0.1% v/v Tween 20, 1% w/v dried milk in PBS (PBS-TM) for 30 min at room temperature. The epitope for this antibody is the extracellular domain of the type I IGFR. After washing 6 times for 5 min with 0.1% v/v Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T), the membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) in PBS-TM for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was washed again 6 times for 5 min in PBS-T and then incubated with a 1:1500 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS-TM for 30 min at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the signal was detected on ECL-Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MCF7 human breast cancer cells are maintained routinely in the presence of 17β-estradiol in order to maintain sensitivity to estrogen (37Glover J.F. Irwin J.T. Darbre P.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3693-3697PubMed Google Scholar, 40Daly R.J. Darbre P.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5868-5875PubMed Google Scholar,43Stephen R. Darbre P.D. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows that these estrogen-maintained MCF7 cells possess receptors capable of binding125I-IGF1. However, following a series of experiments in which the cells were plated at different cell densities, the levels of125I-IGF1 binding were found to drop substantially as the cell density increased (Fig. 1). Levels per cell dropped by around one-fifth as cell numbers increased 10-fold from low density (50,000 cells per well of a 24-well plate) to high density (500,000 cells per well of a 24-well plate). Short term growth of the cells (up to 14 days) in the absence of estradiol resulted in a markedly reduced growth rate (Fig. 2A), but again the levels of 125I-IGF1 binding were found to decrease as cell density increased (Fig. 1). When comparing between cells at equivalent densities, short term removal of estradiol did not appear to have any effect on levels of 125I-IGF1 binding (Fig. 1).Figure 2Effect of long term estrogen deprivation on estrogen-regulated growth of MCF7 human breast cancer cells in monolayer culture. Cells were maintained either as stock cultures in the presence of 10−8m 17β-estradiol (A) or under conditions of estrogen deprivation in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium with 5% DCFCS for 68 weeks (B). Short term growth was then assessed in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium with 5% DCFCS in the absence of estradiol (open circles) or in the presence of 10−8m 17β-estradiol (closed circles). Bars indicate the standard error of triplicate dishes, and where not seen, the error was too small for visual display.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy was used to confirm and to visualize these effects of cell density on IGFR levels. Fig.3shows the immunofluorescent staining of IGFR localized on the cell membrane. The fluorescent staining was much more intense for cells at low density in small clusters on a culture dish (Fig. 3 A) than for cells at high density (Fig.3 B). When the cells formed an even monolayer on a culture dish, almost no fluorescent staining could be seen anymore (Fig.3 B). When cells were in large monolayer groups but at subconfluence, staining tended to be more intense around the edges of those cells not in contact with adjacent cells. The effects of cell density on IGFR levels were further investigated using Western immunoblotting. Antibody Ab-3 was raised to the extracellular domain of the type I IGFR and accordingly detected a band on Western immunoblotting of 135 kDa in size corresponding to the α-subunits of the IGFIR in MCF7 cells (Fig.4). This band was more intense in cells at low density (Fig. 4, track 1) than at high density (Fig.4, track 3). When MCF7 cells are maintained in the continuous presence of estradiol, the cells remain dependent on estradiol for growth. Short term removal of estradiol results in a much reduced growth rate (Fig.2 A). However, following long term estrogen deprivation, short term growth of the cells is no longer influenced by estradiol (Fig. 2 B). This occurs by a gradual adaptive process in which the cells gradually develop an ability over time to increase their growth rate in the absence of estrogen. A representative time course is shown in Fig. 5. The increase in basal growth rate in the absence of estrogen occurred gradually over a period of 12 weeks such that at the end growth in the absence of estrogen had increased to the same rate as that at which the cells had originally grown only in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 5). This time course is reproducible since the results shown in Fig. 5 have been repeated 3 times for this cell line. Levels of IGFR were found to also increase with increasing periods of estrogen deprivation (Fig. 6). At all time points, the levels of IGFR continued to decrease as cell density increased, but the curves were shifted to higher values as length of estrogen deprivation increased (Fig. 6). When the effect of cell density was taken into account, short term readdition of estradiol now increased levels of IGFR (Fig. 6). Thus, although levels of IGFR had been unaffected in the short term by estradiol in the estrogen-maintained cells (Fig. 1), IGFR levels were now increased by estradiol following estrogen deprivation (Fig. 6). Scatchard analysis was performed in order to ascertain whether there were any alterations in binding affinity following long term steroid deprivation (Fig. 7). However,K d values were similar for estrogen-maintained cells (Fig. 7 A, K d 0.11 nm) after 1 week of estrogen deprivation (Fig. 7 B, K d0.11 nm), after 108 weeks of estrogen deprivation (Fig.7 C, K d 0.13 nm), and after 108 weeks of estrogen deprivation followed by 1 week of estrogen readdition (Fig. 7 D, K d 0.12 nm). The K d values are in line with previously published (49Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) values for MCF7 cells assayed using similar methodology. In order to determine whether the increased IGFR levels play any role in the increased basal growth rate of estrogen-deprived cells, we used the αIR3 antibody that has biological blocking activity on IGFIR activity (50Kull F.C. Jacobs S. Su Y.F. Svoboda M.E. vanWyk J.J. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6561-6566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the αIR3 antibody was able to reduce growth of the estrogen-deprived cells in both the absence of estrogen (Fig. 8p = 0.002 for −E+IgG (track 3)versus −E+αIR3 (track 4)) and the presence of estrogen (Fig. 8 p = 0.006 for+E+IgG (track 6) versus +E+αIR3 (track 7)), although only to a limited extent. This was reproducible over 3 separate experiments using two different batches of αIR3 antibody. Since receptor levels are important in determining cellular sensitivity to ligands, we studied the effects of exogenous insulin, IGFI, and IGFII on the estrogen-deprived cells that had raised IGFR levels. Interestingly, whereas all these ligands stimulated growth of estrogen-maintained cells, all ligands showed a dose-dependent inhibition of growth of the estrogen-deprived cells (Fig. 9). Although insulin increased growth of estrogen-maintained cells at 1 and 10 µg/ml (Fig. 9 A, tracks 3 and 4), growth of the estrogen-deprived cells was inhibited by 10 µg/ml insulin (Fig. 9 B, track 3 (p < 0.001)). Whereas 10 and 100 ng/ml IGFI stimulated growth of the estrogen-maintained cells (Fig. 9 A, tracks 5 and6), 100 ng/ml IGFI became growth-inhibitory to the estrogen-deprived cells (Fig. 9 B, track 5 (p< 0.001)). Whereas 10 and 100 ng/ml IGFII s"

DNA double-strand breaks are caused by ionizing radiation, V(D)J recombination, and physiological oxygen free-radical damage. The Ku-dependent repair process is the main DNA double-strand break repair mechanism in mammalian cells and is essential for the preservation of genomic stability. Ku is an integral component of the machinery involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks. The Ku heterodimer binds with high affinity to broken DNA ends (2Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can bridge two proximal DNA ends (3Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J.

Ku also recruits a 465-kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to the DNA double-strand break sites stimulating the DNA-PKcs kinase activity (4Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that Ku70 is mainly responsible for the DNA binding activity of the Ku heterodimer. Ku70 contains two DNA-binding domains; one is located at the N terminus before residue 440, and the other one is located at the C terminus (10Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain is independent of the heterodimer formation with Ku80, whereas the DNA binding activity of the N-terminal domain of Ku70 depends on heterodimer formation with Ku80 (12Wang J. Dong X. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both Ku70 DNA-binding domains are required for the high affinity binding to DNA as demonstrated in gel shift assays (12Wang J. Dong X. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Elimination of either DNA-binding domain resulted in a significant reduction of the DNA binding affinity. This may because of primarily entropic effects. Biochemical studies performed by Reeves and co-workers have shown that the segment spanning residues 536–609 constitutes the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of human Ku70 (10Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Wang J. Dong X. Reeves W.H. J. Biol.

Deletion of the first 25 residues of this domain (residues 536–560) abolished the DNA binding activity of the C-terminal domain (10Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Deletion of the last 10 amino acid residues (residues 600–609) of Ku70 also significantly reduced the DNA binding activity (13Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the study described in this paper, we have expressed the segment encompassing residues 536–609 of human Ku70 and solved the three-dimensional structure of this DNA-binding domain of Ku70. The three-dimensional structure reveals a common helix-extended loop-helix structural motif. Human Ku70 C-terminal fragment 536–609 was cloned into expression vector pET28a (Novagen) and transfected intoEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The resulting protein product is a recombinant fusion protein starting with a 6-histidine tag and a thrombin protease site. Uniformly 15N-labeled protein and 15N- and 13C-labeled protein were produced by growing the expression strain in M9 medium with15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and with15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. The protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The NMR samples contained 1.0 mm protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O or 100%2H2O. All NMR experiments were performed at 20 °C on a Varian Unity-plus 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe, pulsed-field gradient, and pulse-shaping capabilities. Felix 98 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for all NMR data processing.1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments were obtained from the following experiments: HNCACB, C(CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, H(CCO)NH, and HBHA(CO)NH (for reviews, see Refs. 14Bax A.

Stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons were obtained by the analysis of 3JHα-Hβ and3JHN-Hβ coupling constants extracted from the semi-quantitative interpretation of relative peak intensities in the three-dimensional 15N-separated TOCSY-HSQC of 30-ms mixing time (16Clore G.M. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional HNHB (17Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar) spectra, respectively. The dihedral angle φ restraints were obtained based on3JHN-Hα coupling constants measured in an HNHA experiment (18Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from15N-separated (mixing time, 100 ms) and13C-separated (mixing time, 100 ms) three-dimensional NOESY spectra. The distance restraints were grouped into the following ranges: 3.0, 4.0 (3.7 if HN, Hα, or Hβ is involved), and 5.0 Å. Structures were obtained from simulated annealing calculations using Dyana (19Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar) and CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.O. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Golz S. Kemper B. Suck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A sample of 0.5 mm15N-labeled Ku70 domain was titrated to a sample of 10 mm unlabeled DNA to a molar ratio of 1:1. The titration was monitored using one-dimensional and two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra. The final concentration of the protein-DNA complex is ∼0.35 mm. Because Ku binds to the double-strand break sites of DNA, a palindromic DNA sequence was used to ensure that the binding of Ku70 to each end of the DNA forms the same complex. The DNA molecule is a duplex of 16 base pairs with the upper strand sequence being 5′-GCTATGGATCCATAGC-3′. The structure of the Ku70 C-terminal domain was solved with 1144 structural constraints derived from NMR measurements. An ensemble of 20 structures of Ku70 C-terminal domain with the lowest NMR constraint violations and lowest XPLOR energies were used for detailed analysis of the structure. The structural statistics are given in Table I. All experimental NMR constraints are well satisfied. There are no NOE1 constraints violated more than 0.5 Å, no J-coupling constraints violated more than 1 Hz, and no dihedral constraints violated more than 5°. These structures also display only small deviations from idealized covalent geometry (Table I). All peptide bonds are trans. Almost all residues in the structurally well defined regions have Φ and Ψ dihedral angles in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot. The residues in the generally allowed regions and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot are located mainly in the loop between residues 588–595, where the structure is less well defined.Table IStructural statistics of the Ku70 C-terminal DomainTotal restraints used1144Total NOE restraints1087 Intraresidue385 Sequential (‖I − j‖ = 1)230 Medium (1 < ‖I − j‖ ≤ 4)250 Long range (‖I − j‖ > 4)222Dihedral φ Angles44 χ1 Angles13r.m.s.d. from experimental distance restrains Distance restraints (Å)0.0088 Dihedral angles (degrees)0.2476r.m.s.d. from idealized covalent geometry Bonds (Å)0.0014 Bond angles (degrees)0.3805 Improper torsions (degrees)0.1646r.m.s.d. from average structure (Å) Backbone atoms in helical regions1-aHelical regions include residues 562–570, 578–587, and 596–606.0.36 All backbone atoms (residues 561–609)0.69 All heavy atoms in helical regions1-aHelical regions include residues 562–570, 578–587, and 596–606.1.08 All heavy atoms (residues 561–609)1.38Procheck analysis Residues in most favorable region (%)73.0 Residues in additional allowed regions (%)19.1 Residues in generously allowed regions (%)6.8 Residues in disallowed regions (%)1.11-a Helical regions include residues 562–570, 578–587, and 596–606. Open table in a new tab The NMR structure is of high precision. The average root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the average structure for backbone heavy atoms (C′, Cα, N) of residues in α-helices is 0.36 Å. The average r.m.s.d. from the average structure for backbone heavy atoms of all residues from 561 to 609 is 0.58 Å. The overall high precision of the NMR structure is clearly correlated to the high density of experimental constraints. In the structured region, more than 26 NMR constraints per residue have been identified for structural calculation. The C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Ku70 consists of a well structured region and a highly random and flexible N terminus. Residues 536–560, which include the nuclear localization domain (21Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), are completely random and flexible and do not form any defined structure in solution. This is evident by much narrower resonances, absence of any medium and long range NOEs, and chemical shifts that are similar to random coil values. Significant information is now available to correlate primary sequences of proteins to their secondary structures, and secondary structure prediction from amino acid sequence is successful in most cases (22Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 266: 525-539Crossref Google Scholar). Secondary structural prediction of Ku70 using the program PHD (22Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 266: 525-539Crossref Google Scholar) shows that residues 530–560 of Ku70 do not contain helices or β-strands but form a loop. This is consistent with the observation that this region is unstructured in solution. These results suggest that the nuclear localization domain of human Ku70, like the nuclear localization domains of many proteins, is unstructured in solution. Residues 561–609 of Ku70 form a well defined structure. This region contains 3 α-helices. Superposition of the backbone Cα atoms of residues in this region is shown in Fig.1A, and the ribbon diagram of a representative structure is shown in Fig. 1B. On the basis of backbone dihedral angles and characteristic NOEs, the three α-helices encompass residues 562–570, 578–587, and 596–606. Helices Hb and Hc are nearly parallel and connected by an extended loop region. This interhelical loop (residues 588–595) is less well defined than the helical regions and appears to be more flexible. This region has fewer NOE constraints per residue than average. Helices Hb and Hc and the loop connecting them form a unique helix-extended loop-helix motif. The three-dimensional structure suggests that conserved hydrophobic residues are all located in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Fig.2A shows the sequence alignment of the Ku70 C-terminal domain from known species. The following hydrophobic residues are highly conserved throughout these species: 564, 568, 573, 576, 578, 581, 590, 599, 600, 603, and 607. All of these residues are in the hydrophobic core of the Ku70 C-terminal domain structure and are indicated in green in Fig. 2A and shown with their sidechains in Fig. 2B. The extensive hydrophobic core of the Ku70 C-terminal domain is formed with nearly all conserved hydrophobic residues. The structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain is consistent with previous studies (10Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1991; 146: 2678-2686PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that the fragment from residues 560–609 forms an intact structure based on reactions with anti-Ku70 antibodies. Antibodies against full-length Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were used to react with E. coli-expressed recombinant Ku70 and Ku80 fragments. The fragment consisting of residues 560–609 of human Ku70 was the minimum length for a reaction with these antibodies (23Reeves W.H. Pierani A. Chou C. Ng T. Nicastri C. Roeder R.G. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2678-2686PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments that contained this region (e.g. 419–609, 536–609, and 560–609) reacted well with the antibodies. Fragments that do not entirely include this region, such as residues 560–600, 536–600, and 589–609, did not react with the antibodies. Because the fragment containing residues 560–609 can be recognized by antibodies generated by the full-length Ku proteins, this would suggest that the structure of the E. coli-expressed fragment encompassing residues 560–609 has the same structural characteristic as the fragment in the full-length protein. Interaction of the Ku70 C-terminal domain with DNA has been investigated. 15N-Labeled Ku70 C-terminal domain (0.5 mm) was titrated to the solution of 10 mmunlabeled 16-base pair palindromic DNA with the sequence described under “Experimental Procedures.” Chemical shifts of the DNA in the complex were monitored by one-dimensional jump return (24Hore P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 283-300Google Scholar) and one-dimensional 15N-filtered spectra (25Ikura M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2433-2440Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Chemical shift changes of the protein were monitored using1H–15N HSQC spectra. Fig.3 shows the superposition of the1H–15N HSQC spectra of the C-terminal domain of Ku70 free and in complex with DNA. Overall, chemical shift perturbation has been observed for many residues in Ku70. In addition, the HSQC spectra were essentially identical at the protein:DNA molar ratio of 1:2 and 1:1. This suggests that the percentages of the Ku70 domain in the complex were the same at the protein:DNA molar ratio of 1:2 and 1:1 and therefore were close to 100%. Therefore, the dissociation constant should be in the micromolar range or smaller. The DNA signals as monitored by one-dimensional experiments during the titration also suggest that the exchange rate between the free and complex states is slow on the chemical shift time scale. Chemical shift perturbation was used to identify regions of the protein that are involved in the protein-DNA interaction, an approach used successfully in our, as well as other, laboratories (26Chen Y. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Fairbrother W.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Large chemical shift changes (Δδ1H > 0.08 ppm and/or Δδ15N > 0.2 ppm) have been observed for residues 540–544, 554–562, 573–577, 581–588, and 590–604. The first two segments are located in the N-terminal flexible region. The next three segments are in the structured region. These regions are indicated in yellow in the 3-dimensional structure of the Ku70 domain shown in Fig.4A. The residues in the His tag did not form any defined structures as no non-sequential NOE has been observed involving the residues in the His tag. Furthermore, the His tag did not form any interactions with the DNA either, because no significant chemical shift change has been observed for resonances of the His tag residues. The largest chemical shift changes occur in regions where most of the conserved Arg or Lys residues are located and have the strongest positive electrostatic potential. Several residues within the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Ku70 are conserved as Arg or Lys as indicated in blue in Fig. 2A. These residues are 539, 542–544, 553, 554, 556, 565, 575, 582, 586, 591, 595, and 596. Except residue 565, all other conserved positively charged residues are located on the surface, which has a strong positive electrostatic potential (Fig. 4, A and B). In particular, residues 582, 586, 591, 595, and 596 are clustered together forming the strongest positive surface of the structured domain. Residue 582 and 586 are located in α-helix 72 b, and residues 591, 595, and 596 are located in an adjacent flexible loop. Most of these residues are located in the segments where large chemical shift perturbation has been observed (Fig. 4A). The positively charged amino acid residues often play key roles in the binding of nucleic acids. Conservation of these residues suggests their importance in DNA binding. Smaller chemical shift changes in other segments in the structured region may be because of additional structural perturbation as a result of the protein-DNA interaction. The surface shape of the proposed DNA-binding site in the structured region (Hb and the loop containing residues 590–596) suggests that this surface may interact with the major groove of DNA and the phosphate backbone. The size of an α-helix matches that of the major groove of DNA, and α-helices often insert into the major groove of DNA in many DNA-binding proteins. Thus it is possible that the helix, where the conserved residues 582 and 586 are located, may interact with the major groove of DNA. Then the adjacent loop, where the conserved residues 591, 595, and 596 are located, may interact with the phosphate backbone. This is consistent with a previous study using a photocross-linking method that shows that Ku70 binds in the major groove near double-helical ends (27Yoo S. Kimzey A. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20034-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further biochemical studies are needed to define the binding site of the flexible N terminus of the Ku70 C-terminal domain on the DNA. The structure of the C-terminal region of Ku70 does not resemble the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif or other common sequence-specific DNA-binding domains, such as zinc finger, leucine zipper, or helix-loop-helix motif. It contains a helix-extended loop-helix structure that has not been observed in known sequence-specific DNA-binding domains. We have used the program DALI (28Holmes L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) to search for structures in the Protein Data Bank that share structural similarities to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Ku70. The search resulted in the following three hits: T4 endonuclease VII (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar), transcription termination factor rho (30Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct.

Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The superpositions of the C-terminal domain of Ku70 with these proteins are shown in Fig.5, A–C. T4 endonuclease VII binds to and cleaves unusual DNA-structures such as Holiday structures, three-way junctions, single-strand overhangs, heteroduplex loops, base mismatches, bulky adducts, and curved DNA (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). The region of T4 endonuclease VII that shares structural homology to the Ku70 C-terminal domain is located at the C terminus, which is critical for interactions with DNA (33Golz S. Christoph A. Birkenkamp-Detroder K. Kemper B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). rho is a transcriptional terminator in most eubacterial species (30Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F.

Biol. 1998; 5: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). rho functions as a hexamer and binds either single-stranded DNA or RNA. The α-helical domain within the RNA-binding domain shares structural similarity with the C-terminal domain of Ku70. It is not clear whether the N-terminal domain of rho is involved in RNA binding. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes the covalent conjugation of lysine to the cognate tRNA (32Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The complex of an Asp-tRNA synthetase, homologous to the lysyl-tRNA synthetase, in complex with tRNA has been solved (35Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Nature. 1993; 362: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Homology modeling shows that the region in lysyl-tRNA synthetase that shares structural similarity to the Ku70 C-terminal domain is located at one end of double-helical arm of tRNA and may form interactions with tRNA. Sequence similarity among the four proteins has been observed. Fig.5D shows the sequence alignment comparing the Ku70 C-terminal domain with T4 endonuclease VII, rho, and lysyl-tRNA synthetase. The sequence alignment is based on the structural superposition. Most of the conserved hydrophobic residues in Ku70, which are located in the hydrophobic core, are also conserved in the structurally homologous domains of the three other proteins. In particular, the sequence similarity is higher in the helix-extended loop-helix (the second and third helices) region. This region has a high structural similarity among the four proteins. This would suggest that the conserved hydrophobic core is responsible for stabilizing these similar structures. The structural motif represented by the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Ku70 occurs in at least four proteins including itself as discussed here. These proteins are involved in interactions with unusual structures of nucleic acids. The regions that share structural similarity with the Ku70 C-terminal domain in these three proteins are known to interact with nucleic acid or may form interactions with nucleic acids. Thus this motif may be involved in supporting or enhancing binding to nucleic acid by proteins that recognize unusual nucleic acid structures. In conclusion, this is the first study describing the atomic resolution three-dimensional structure of the Ku proteins. Interaction of the Ku with DNA is central for the functions of Ku. The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Ku70 indicates that all conserved hydrophobic residues are in the hydrophobic core and are therefore likely to be important for structural integrity. Most of the conserved positively charged residues are likely to be critical for DNA recognition. The C-terminal domain of human Ku70 may represents a common structural motif that is involved in the recognition of unusual nucleic acid structures."
https://openalex.org/W2082454631,"Heat transfer in the mantle is a key process controlling the Earth's dynamics. Upper-mantle mineral phases, especially olivine, have been shown to display highly anisotropic thermal diffusivity at ambient conditions1,2, and seismic anisotropy data3 show that preferred orientations of olivine induced by deformation4 are coherent at large scales (>50 km) in the upper mantle. Thus heat transport in the upper mantle should be anisotropic. But the thermal anisotropy of mantle minerals at high temperature1,5 and its relationship with deformation have not been well constrained. Here we present petrophysical modelling and laboratory measurements of thermal diffusivity in deformed mantle rocks between temperatures of 290 and 1,250 K that demonstrate that deformation may induce a significant anisotropy of thermal diffusivity in the uppermost mantle. We found that heat transport parallel to the flow direction is up to 30 per cent faster than that normal to the flow plane. Such a strain-induced thermal anisotropy implies that the upper-mantle temperature distribution, rheology and, consequently, its dynamics, will depend on deformation history. In oceans, resistive drag flow would result in lower vertical diffusivities in both the lithosphere and asthenosphere6 and hence in less effective heat transfer from the convective mantle. In continents, olivine orientations frozen in the lithosphere may induce anisotropic heating above mantle plumes, favouring the reactivation of pre-existing structures."

Thebph genes (bphEGF(orf4)A1A2A3BCD(orf1)A4R) constitute an operon, and its expression is strongly dependent on the pE promoter located upstream of the bphE gene. A bphS gene, whose deduced amino acid sequence showed homology with the GntR family transcriptional repressors, was identified at the upstream region of the bphE gene. Disruption of the bphS gene resulted in constitutive expression of bph genes, suggesting that thebphS gene product negatively regulated the pEpromoter. The gel retardation and DNase footprinting analyses demonstrated specific binding of BphS to the pE promoter region and identified four BphS binding sites that were located within and immediately downstream of the −10 box of the pEpromoter. The four binding sites were functional in repression because their respective elimination resulted in derepression of the pE promoter. The binding of BphS was abolished in the presence of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, an intermediate compound in the biphenyl degradation pathway.

The genes coding enzymes for this conversion have been sequenced, characterized, and shown to be clustered asbphEGF(orf4)A1A2A3BCD(orf1)A4R(see Fig. 1B). In many microorganisms capable of degrading chemical compounds, the transcription of genes involved in the degradation is regulated (8Meer J.R.V.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 677-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, the genes coding for the regulator exist near the structural genes, and their protein products activate the transcription in the presence of their cognate inducer molecule. Repressor-mediated regulation is rare for genes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds. However, Mouz et al. (9Mouz S. Merlin C. Springael D. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of bph genes on transposon Tn4371 was repressed by the product of bphS gene, although the molecular events in the repression and derepression have fully remained to be elucidated. The bph genes and their organization in KKS102 are highly homologous to the bph genes on transposon Tn4371(10Merlin C. Springael D. Mergeay M. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen.

These two bph gene clusters share 94% identity at the nucleotide level, but DNA sequences in the upstream region ofbphE are different from each other (10Merlin C. Springael D. Mergeay M. Toussaint A.

This induction requires an inducer molecule, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA), an intermediate metabolite of the biphenyl degradation pathway (12Ohtsubo Y. Nagata Y. Kimbara K. Takagi M. Ohta A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a negative regulator of bph genes and revealed its function in the regulation of bph gene expression in KKS102. This report describes for the first time the detailed regulatory mechanism of PCB/biphenyl degradation genes. Pseudomonas sp. KKS102 (4Kimbara K. Hashimoto T. Fukuda M. Koana T. Takagi M. Oishi M. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2740-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its derivatives were cultivated in 1/3 L broth (0.33% tryptone, 0.16% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) at 30 °C. Escherichia colicells were grown in L broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) at 37 °C. Antibiotics were used at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for ampicillin and 25 μg/ml for kanamycin and chloramphenicol. For the construction of a plasmid for bphS disruption, plasmid pKH1004 carrying a 1.2-kb HincII fragment in the multicloning site of pUC19 was digested by XhoI, and a chloramphenicol resistance gene derived from pHSG399 was inserted into the cleaved site. The resulting plasmid was linearized by BamHI and HindIII digestion and used for electroporation. The gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The Southern blot analysis was performed with an ECL gene detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All of the fusion constructs of the modified upstream region of bphEand lacZ were integrated into the genome of KKS102. For systematic construction of plasmids for integration, plasmid pKLZ-A was constructed. pKLZ-A contains the following DNA fragments: kanamycin resistance gene derived from Tn5 as a marker for integration, a synthetic terminator sequence to prevent read-through of transcription, a multicloning site comprised of EcoRI,SmaI, and BamHI sites, and lacZ gene derived from pMC1403 (13Shapira S.K. Chou J. Richaud F.V. Casadaban M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and these are inserted into randomly selected DNA fragments from the KKS102 genome. The modified promoter-lacZ fusions were constructed by inserting either duplex oligonucleotides or polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments into the multicloning site of pKLZ-A or of its derivative plasmid. The DNA sequences inserted are presented in Fig. 5. For integration into the chromosome of KKS strains, resulting plasmids were digested by HindIII within the vector sequence and introduced into KKS102 by electroporation. Integration of promoter-reporter constructs into the genome results in the disruption of a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a putative member of the NtrC family regulator. This disruption had no effect on the expression level of bph genes under any conditions tested. For the deletion of the chromosomal pE promoter, plasmid pKH966A was constructed. The plasmid pKH966A carries the following DNA fragments in the cloning site of pHSG399 (see Fig. 8): a bphE upstream region (−400 to −1284 where +1 is the start codon forbphE), a DNA fragment derived from pKLZ-A containing the kanamycin resistance gene and a terminator sequence, and abphE upstream region (−242 to +3 where +1 is the start codon for bphE). The plasmid pKH966A was digested byHindIII and BamHI in a vector sequence and used for electroporation. Each of the plasmids was linearized by an appropriate restriction enzyme, extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in water, and introduced into KKS102 by electroporation. The cells from liquid culture were washed five times with chilled sterile water. The Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) was used under the following conditions: 0.1-cm cuvette, 200 ohms, 25 microfarads, 1.8 kV, and a pulse time of 4.7–5.0 ms. A 1-ml aliquot of SOC medium (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm glucose, pH 7.0) was added immediately after the electric pulse. The cells were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h prior to plating onto 1/3 L broth containing the appropriate antibiotics. The total RNA was isolated by the method described by Hopwood et al. (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). Hybridization and detection were performed by using digoxigenin-labeled DNA with a CSPD system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 1.0-kb HincII-ApaI fragment, 1.2-kbSphI-SmaI fragment, and 0.9-kbEcoT22I-KpnI fragment were used to generatebphA1, bphC, and bphE probes, respectively (see Fig. 1B). To measure the BphD activity, the cells were washed once in sample buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. After sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant (crude extract) was assayed for BphD activity. For the assay of BphD activity, BphD substrate (HOPDA) was diluted to an A434 of 0.5 to 1.5 in the sample buffer. HOPDA was prepared as described (12Ohtsubo Y. Nagata Y. Kimbara K. Takagi M. Ohta A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crude extract was added to HOPDA solution prewarmed at 30 °C. The decrease inA434 was measured for 3 min, and the portion in which A434 decreased in proportion to time was used to calculate the BphD activity. We defined 1 unit of BphD activity as the activity necessary to convert 1 nmol of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid/min. A molar extinction coefficient of 19,800 for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid was used to calculate the BphD activity (15Seah S.Y. Terracina G. Bolin J.T. Riebel P. Snieckus V.

The amount of protein in the crude extract was quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For LacZ activity measurement, crude extract was prepared as described above except that Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) was used. The crude extract was added to theO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution (4 mg/ml in Z buffer). After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, stop solution (1 m Na2CO3) was added to terminate the reaction and A420 was measured. We defined 1 unit of LacZ activity as the activity necessary to produce 1 nmol of O-nitrophenyl/min. The total RNA was isolated by the method described by Hopwood et al. (14Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J.

The primer extension was performed with oligonucleotides BPHE10-29 (5′-CTGGTCGAAACCGTATCTGG-3′) (hybridizing to nucleotides 10–29 of the bphE coding sequence). The primer was annealed to ∼20 μg of the isolated RNA. Primer extension reactions with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) were performed at 37 °C, and the extended product was run beside the DNA sequencing ladder generated by the dideoxy chain termination method using the same primer. Samples were run with a LI-COR model 4000L DNA sequencing system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with the Applied Biosystems model 310 DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A 145-bp fragment that contains a pE promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers BPHUP12-BAM (5′-GGCGGATCCGAGTGAAGTGAGTGAAAC-3′) and BPHUP-REV1-SAL (5′-GGCGTCGACCATGATTGCCCCTGCGCG-3′). BPHUP12-BAM and BPHUP-REV1-SAL were designed to introduce a restriction site forBamHI and SalI, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with BamHI andSalI and inserted into the cloning site of pYO2 (a pHSG398 derivative harboring a multicloning site consisting of a restriction site in the order of EcoRI, BamHI,PstI, SalI, BglII, XbaI,XhoI, and HindIII), resulting in pYO12R. A 183-bpHindIII-EcoRI fragment prepared from pYO12R was end-labeled by [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA, and cell-free extract (CFE) containing 0–5 μg of protein. In the competition assay, 40 ng of cold target DNA or 1 μg of unrelated DNA (sermon sperm DNA) was added. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the mixtures were separated by electrophoresis at 60 V constant voltage in 5% polyacrylamide gels buffered with 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For preparation of CFE, E. coli harboring plasmid pKH701, which carries the bphS gene under the control of thelac promoter, was cultivated in L broth. When the turbidity reached a value of 0.5, isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm. After 5 h of additional incubation, cells were collected, washed once with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), resuspended in the same buffer, and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation of the sonicated cell suspension, the supernatant was used as CFE. The protein concentration in the CFE was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. A 183-bp fragment used for gel retardation with both ends labeled with 32P was used after the following procedures were performed. The fragment was digested by either BamHI or XhoI. In either digestion, 177- and 6-bp fragments were generated. The longer fragments, digested byBamHI and XhoI had 32P in the coding and noncoding strand, respectively. Two rounds of ethanol precipitation removed the shorter fragment. The single end-labeled fragments were incubated with CFE prepared from E. coli cells expressing BphS protein in the same buffer conditions as were present for the gel retardation assay. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 40 μl, and 0–20 μg of protein in CFE was used. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, DNase I solution (diluted in 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2) was added and incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of phenol followed by vortexing and addition of 100 μl of stop solution. Protected bands were identified by comparison with the migration of the same fragment treated for A + G sequencing reactions by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5422) Google Scholar). The upstream region of bphE, the first gene of thebph gene cluster, was sequenced for about 3 kb. Two ORFs were found in this region in an orientation opposite that of thebph genes cluster (Fig.1B). The start codon of the ORF proximal to bphE was 511 bp distant from that ofbphE. Their nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF proximal tobphE showed homology to transposases of several transposons. These are IS1405from Ralstonia solanacearum (DDBJ accession number AF167984), IS1384 from Pseudomonas putida(DDBJ accession number AF052751), and ISPSMC fromPseudomonas syringae (DDBJ accession number AB023075). Identities between this ORF and their transposases are 74, 64, and 62%, respectively. Typical terminal 4-bp direct repeats and 16-bp inverted repeats flank this ORF. Because these are common features of an insertion sequence, we designated this region and the transposase ORF as ISBPH and tnpBPH, respectively. Southern blot analysis using a 1374-bp SphI fragment (Fig.1B) as a probe revealed that this insertion sequence existed as a single copy in the genome of KKS102 (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of another ORF distal frombphE showed homology to transcriptional repressors of the GntR family (17Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), BphS of transposon Tn4371 (9Mouz S. Merlin C. Springael D. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and AphS ofComamonas testosteroni (18Arai H. Akahira S. Ohishi T. Kudo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This ORF had 74.4 and 37.0% identities to these repressors, respectively. The sequence also showed 40.2% identity to ORF0 from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenesKF707, which also belongs to the GntR family but exceptionally works as a positive regulator (19Watanabe T. Inoue R. Kimura N. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31016-31023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because the product of this ORF functioned as a regulator of the bph genes (see below), we designated it as bphS. ThebphS gene of KKS102 was disrupted as indicated in Fig.3A (for details see “Experimental Procedures”), and we analyzed the effects of disruption on the expression of the bph genes. The strains were grown in liquid culture with or without biphenyl, and their BphD activities were measured at 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after the addition of biphenyl. In the wild type KKS102, BphD activity was kept at a low level in the absence of biphenyl, whereas it gradually increased in the presence of biphenyl and reached a level of activity 5-fold that of the original level after 5 h. In the bphS disruptant (KKSΔS), a high level of BphD activity was detected even in the absence of biphenyl (Fig. 3B). We also measured the bph mRNA level in thebphS disruptant by Northern blot analysis. Strains were incubated with or without biphenyl before mRNA preparation. mRNAs were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and were hybridized with bphA1-, bphC-, orbphE-specific probe. Signals on the membranes were quantitatively analyzed, and the amounts of bph mRNAs that were detected with the above probes were compared with those of uninduced wild type strain (Fig. 3C). In the wild type strain KKS102, the bph mRNA level was high in the presence of biphenyl but not in its absence. In contrast, a high level of bph mRNA was detected in the bphSdisruptant even in the absence of biphenyl. To rule out the possible polar effect of the disruption ofbphS with a chloramphenicol resistance gene on the expression of bph genes, a fusion construct of thebphE upstream region and lacZ as a reporter gene (Fig. 3D) was integrated into a randomly selected site on the KKS102 genome (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the effect of bphS disruption was analyzed. In the bphS+ strain (KLZ12), LacZ activity was about 3 times higher in the presence of biphenyl than in its absence. In contrast, we detected a high level of LacZ activity in the bphS disruptant (KLZ12ΔS) in the absence of biphenyl, and this level was even higher than that in the presence of biphenyl. These results clearly demonstrate that thebphS gene product negatively regulates bph gene expression in KKS102. Because the bphE gene, the first gene in thebph gene cluster, is induced by biphenyl, we searched for a promoter in the upstream region of bphE. To identify the transcription start site in vivo, primer extension analysis was performed. When the primer BPHE10-29, which hybridized to the nucleotides 10–29 of the BphE-coding sequence, was used, a single band corresponding to a T residue located at 317 nucleotides upstream from the bphE start codon was detected (Fig.4). The transcription start site was preceded by a conserved E. coli −10 box (TATAAT). The −35 box was not highly consistent with that of E. coli (GTGTTTversus TTGACA of E. coli). The location of these elements was in good agreement with the results from the LacZ reporter assay (see below). No other transcriptional start site was identified. Hereafter we refer to the DNA region that includes the −10 and −35 boxes (−326 to −354 where +1 is the translation start point forbphE) as the pE core promoter and the DNA region that includes the pE core promoter and the other elements involved in the transcriptional regulation as the pEpromoter. We performed a deletion analysis of thebphE upstream region to define the sequence necessary for inducible promoter activity. A series of fusion constructs of the partially deleted 5′ region of the bphE and lacZgene were integrated into the genome of KKS102 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), and LacZ activity was measured in the presence or absence of biphenyl. By integrating the lacZfusion constructs into the genome, the effect of difference in copy number of the reporter gene could be excluded from the measurement of the promoter activity. The results are summarized in Fig.5A. First, pE is the sole promoter that resides within 1555 bp upstream of thebphE start codon. The same level of LacZ activity was observed in strain KLZ10 (containing up to 1555 bp from thebphE translation start site) and in strain KLZ12 (containing up to 387 bp from the bphE translation start site), indicating that there is no promoter activity between nucleotides −388 and −1555. The deletion of the pE core promoter resulted in a markedly low level of LacZ activity (compare strains KLZ12 and KLZ9). Deletion of the sequence just upstream of the −35 box resulted in a decrease in LacZ activity (see strains KLZ14 and KLZ8). This decrease may be due to deletion of the UP element, the third DNA element of the prokaryotic core promoter (20Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Second, the DNA region from −387 to −243 (where +1 is the bphE translation start site) is sufficient and necessary for promoter activity and the inducible expression because strain KLZ23 (which contains −387 to −243) showed enhanced LacZ activity that was much higher in the presence of biphenyl. The results described above suggested that the bphS gene product binds within the DNA region spanning from nucleotides −387 to −243. To determine whether the BphS binds to this DNA region, we conducted gel retardation experiments. The DNA region from −387 to −243 of the pE promoter was excised as anEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pYO12R and was end-labeled with 32P (Fig.6A). The BphS protein was expressed in E. coli, and the CFE was used for the gel retardation assay. The retarded bands were observed only in the reactions containing BphS protein (Fig. 6B). There were two shifted bands at higher protein concentrations, suggesting that BphS binds to multiple sites within the fragment. When the nonradioactive DNA fragment was added to the binding reaction in excess of the32P-labeled fragment, the retarded band was greatly reduced (Fig. 6B, lane 6). The addition of an unrelated DNA fragment did not affect the BphS binding (Fig. 6B,lane 7). The retarded band was not observed when CFE ofE. coli harboring vector pHSG399 was used (Fig.6B, lane 8). These results clearly indicate that BphS specifically binds to the DNA region spanning −387 to −243. In our previous work, we demonstrated that HOPDA, the intermediate metabolite of the biphenyl degradation pathway, is the inducer molecule of bph genes in KKS102 (12Ohtsubo Y. Nagata Y. Kimbara K. Takagi M. Ohta A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we performed a gel retardation assay in the presence of varying concentrations of HOPDA (0–0.5 mm). The amount of protein of CFE was fixed at 3 μg. Under this condition only one retarded band was observed (Fig.6B, lane 3). As shown in Fig. 6C, the intensity of the retarded band was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of HOPDA at 0.5 mm, the retarded band disappeared almost completely (Fig. 6C, lane 6). In contrast, a saturated concentration of biphenyl (∼0.1 mm) or 0.5 mm2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl did not inhibit the binding. These results indicate that the BphS protein loses its ability to bind to the pE promoter in the presence of the inducer molecule HOPDA. This inhibition of binding of BphS to the pE promoter by HOPDA is consistent with the in vivo function of HOPDA as an inducer. To obtain further information on the binding site of the BphS protein, DNase I footprinting analysis was carried out. A 183-bp pE promoter fragment containing the region from −387 to −243 was analyzed with both coding and noncoding strands (Fig. 7). The results of the DNase I footprinting are summarized in Fig. 7B. We identified four BphS binding sites and named them (beginning with the furthest upstream) BS I (binding site I), BS II, BS III, and BS IV. When DNA labeled in the coding strand was incubated with a relatively low amount of CFE containing BphS, two regions ranging from nucleotides −333 to −319 (BS I) and −315 to −299 (BS II) were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 7A, lane 3). When DNA labeled in the noncoding strand was used under the same protein and DNA concentrations, DNA regions ranging from −329 to −315 (BS I) and −312 to −295 (BS II) were protected (Fig. 7A, lane 8). At higher protein concentrations, additional DNA regions from −296 to −281 (BS III) and −279 to −263 (BS IV) (Fig. 7A,lane 5, analyzing coding strand) and from −291 to −278 (BS III) and −274 to −260 (BS IV) (Fig. 7A, lane 10, analyzing noncoding strand) were protected. In Fig. 7, the DNA regions protected at low and high protein concentrations are indicated by thick and thin lines, respectively. No protection was observed when CFE of E. coli harboring vector plasmid was used (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the BphS protein binds to four sites near the pE core promoter and has greater affinity to the two upstream binding sites (BS I and BS II) than to the two downstream sites (BS III and BS IV). That a part of the −10 box hexamer of the pE promoter overlaps with BS I and was protected from DNase digestion suggests the essential role of BS I in BphS-mediated repression of the pE promoter. The results of the DNase footprinting demonstrated several interesting properties of the four binding sites. The protection of BS I and BS II, but not BS III and BS IV, under low protein concentration of BphS-containing CFE indicates that BS I and BS II have greater affinity for BphS protein than do BS III and BS IV. To investigate the function of these two sets of BphS binding sites in the repression of the pE promoter in vivo, a series of promoter constructs was integrated into the genome of KKS102 as described under “Identification of the DNA Region Required for Inducible Expression of the pE Promoter” and assayed for promoter activity (Fig. 5B). The strain KLZ23, which had a construct with all four binding sites as well as the pE core promoter, showed low LacZ activity when grown in the absence of biphenyl. In contrast, the strain KLZ22, the integrated construct of which had BS I and BS II but lacked BS III and BS IV, showed high LacZ activity even in the absence of biphenyl. The LacZ activity in the absence of biphenyl was increased ∼3-fold, although it did not exceed that in the presence of biphenyl, by deletion of BS III and BS IV (compare strains KLZ23 and KLZ22 in the absence of biphenyl), demonstrating the in vivo function of BS III and BS IV. In strain KLZ21, where the integrated construct had no BphS binding site, LacZ activity in the absence of biphenyl was further elevated to the level observed in the strain KLZ15, whose integrated construct lacked BSI and BS II but had BS III and BS IV. This result indicates that the presence of"

Despite the apparent segregation of the PV from the host cell endocytic network, metabolites essential for the parasite are known to exchange with the intravacuolar space. Aqueous soluble molecules of less than 1300 daltons enter the vacuole through non-selective pores in the PV membrane, thus satisfying the parasite's auxotrophy for purines and tryptophan (14Schwab J.C.

Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the uptake and metabolism of lipids byT. gondii. Since proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis such as acyl carrier proteins and subunits of type II fatty-acyl synthase have been shown to localize in the apicoplasts, the plastid organelle may play a role in the lipid metabolism of T. gondii (16Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T. gondii membranes contain cholesterol and are characterized by a low cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and consequent high level of fluidity (17Foussard F. Gallois Y. Girault A. Menez J.F. Parasitol. Res. 1991; 77: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Foussard F. Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the parasite depends on host cell cholesterol derived from endocytosed LDL and not from endogenous synthesis (19Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of cholesterol uptake by intravacuolar parasites has not been completely elucidated. An essential enzyme for the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis is acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1). ACAT-1 covalently joins excess free cholesterol (FC) with fatty acyl-CoA to form cholesterol esters (CE), which can then be stored in the form of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The enzyme is a transmembrane protein located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear region (20Khelef N. Buton X. Beatini N. Wang H. Meiner V. Chang T.Y. Farese Jr., R.V. Maxfield F.R.

Because the parasite depends on cholesterol acquired by host cell endocytosis but inhabits a vacuole that does not interact with host cell endocytic vesicles, one or more intermediate steps of cholesterol uptake by the parasite must exist and remain to be identified. Because cholesterol esters formed by ACAT are an effective way to store cholesterol in the cytoplasm, we reasoned that ACAT activity with its role in cholesterol ester formation and cellular cholesterol homeostasis plays a role in the optimal parasite proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed T. gondii replication in cells where ACAT enzyme activity was absent through either genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. The acyl amide ACAT inhibitors SaH 58-035 and CI 976 were obtained from Sandoz Inc., East Hanover, NJ, and Parke-Davis, respectively. Stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared at a concentration of 2 mm in Me2SO and were freshly diluted to the concentrations required for each experiment. Radiolabeled lipids were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cell types used for infection assays with T. gondii were human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), murine peritoneal fibroblasts (MPF), and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from ACAT-1+/+and ACAT-1−/− mice, which were obtained by targeted gene disruption (27Meiner V.L.

MPF were isolated by a combination of mechanical separation and collagenase digestion. Under sterile conditions, the anterior abdominal wall was exposed and removed en bloc to a Petri dish containing a solution of 0.02% collagenase (Crescent Chemical Co., Hauppauge, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The peritoneal surface was scraped gently with a razor blade to release lining cells, and the remaining tissue was finely minced. The entire mixture was then transferred to a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 30 min, pelleted at 1,000 ×g, and grown to confluence in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). HFF and MPF cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. MEF cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the same supplements described above. Cultures were passaged by trypsinization at least once a week, and cells were used up to the 20th passage. T. gondii tachyzoites of the βRH strain were used for infection. This strain expresses Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase under control of the T. gondii sag1promoter (28Seeber F. Boothroyd J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and has been used previously to assay parasite proliferation (29McFadden D.C. Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Parasites were harvested from host cells, passed through a 27-gauge needle, and purified as described (30Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Purified tachyzoites were counted in a hemocytometer chamber and used for a new cycle of host cell invasion at the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) stated in the individual figure legends. T. gondii was quantitated in infected cells by colorimetric detection of β-galactosidase activity expressed by the parasite strain βRH as described (29McFadden D.C. Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, either ACAT-1+/+ MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF or HFF were grown to confluence in 96-well plates in medium lacking phenol red, and HFF were treated for 12 h with different concentrations of SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone. Cells were then infected with purified parasites at m.o.i. 0.1. After 72 h, 10 μl of the β-galactosidase substrate chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 100 μm. Following an additional incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1–4 h until color development, plates were read at a dual wavelength of 570/630 nm using a Spectra MAX 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments, parasites were directly counted following nuclear staining using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope (Deerfield, IL). Consistent results of parasite quantitation were obtained by using both the colorimetric and the direct counting methods. ACAT-1−/− MEF and HFF were grown to confluence on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, and HFF were treated with 40 μm SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone for 12 h. Purified T. gondii tachyzoites were allowed to infect the cells for 1 h at m.o.i. of 0.1. Extracellular parasites were removed by washing the coverslips in PBS, and cells were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or incubated for an additional 24 h prior the fixation. Parasites were then counted following nuclear staining using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope (Deerfield, IL). Cholesterol esterification activity was assessed by pulse labeling of cells as described (31Goldstein J. Basu S. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) using radiolabeled fatty acid as substrate. Briefly, ACAT-1+/+MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF, and HFF were grown to confluence in 12-well plates, and HFF were treated with SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone. ACAT activity was stimulated for 5 h by addition of 5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol, and cells were then pulse-labeled for 2 h with 20 μl of sodium [14C]oleate-albumin complex (10 mm sodium [14C]oleate, 120 mg/ml albumin, ∼10,000 dpm/nmol). After washing with ice-cold 0.2% albumin in PBS followed by PBS alone, lipids were extracted at room temperature with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) for 30 min, and the organic solvents were evaporated under a N2 stream. 10 μl of [3H]cholesteryl oleate (∼22,000 dpm) was added as an internal standard. Lipids were then resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform, spotted on TLC silica gel G plates (Fisher), and separated in hexane/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (80:20:1). Cholesterol ester bands were identified with iodine vapors, scraped into scintillation vials, and counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Research Products Division, Costa Mesa, CA). The amount of cholesterol esters was expressed as pmol 14C/min/mg protein. For ACAT activity assay in T. gondii, tachyzoites were harvested from ACAT-1−/− MEF after 2 lysis cycles, washed in PBS to remove cellular debris, and aliquots of 107parasites tested for incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesterol esters as described above. Different concentrations of SaH 58-035 and CI 976 or solvent alone were added to the parasites during the ACAT stimulation with 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol; the total time of inhibitor treatment of T. gondii tachyzoites was limited to 7 h to maintain the viability of extracellular parasites. Cell viability was tested using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, HFF were grown to confluence in 96-well plates, treated with different concentrations of SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone for 72 h, and processed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Absorbance was measured at wavelength of 490 nm using the microplate reader described previously. ACAT-1+/+ MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF, and HFF were grown to confluence in 96-well plates, and HFF were treated with different concentrations of SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone for 72 h. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 75 μl of lysis buffer (0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 2600 × g for 20 min, 20 μl of supernatant was collected and added to 100 μl of firefly luciferase/luciferin solution (Sigma). Bioluminescence was detected with a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), and ATP concentration of the samples was calculated by comparison with an ATP standard curve. ACAT-1+/+ MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF, and HFF were grown to confluence in 12-well plates, and HFF were treated for 72 h with different concentrations of SaH 58-035, CI 976, or solvent alone. After washing in 0.2% albumin in PBS, cellular lipids were extracted and separated by TLC using hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) or chloroform/n-heptane (40:60) for developing FC and CE, respectively. Bands of lipids were visualized using a solution of 3% cupric acetate in 15% aqueous phosphoric acid followed by charring of the plates at 120 °C for 15 min. The intensity of the bands was analyzed with an Alpha Imager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA), and the FC and CE amounts were determined by comparison with standard curve. For immunoblot analysis, total extracts of ACAT-1+/+ MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF, and ACAT inhibitor-treated HFF were obtained by trypsinizing and resuspending confluent monolayers in SDS sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents. Proteins (5 μg) from total extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a precast gradient gel (4–15% acrylamide, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking of unspecific binding sites with TBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.3% Tween 20, bands were incubated with a rabbit antiserum recognizing the LDL receptor (32Simmons T. Newhouse Y.M. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25531-25536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and the RenaissanceR Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Polyclonal antibodies against annexin I were used to normalize the amount of proteins present in the gel (33Ernst J.D. Hoye E. Blackwood R.A. Mok T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6670-6673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For flow cytometry analysis, confluent monolayers of ACAT-1+/+ MEF, ACAT-1−/− MEF, and ACAT inhibitor-treated HFF were trypsinized, washed in chilled PBS, and resuspended in PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of 106 cells were incubated on ice with the previously described anti-LDL receptor antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Five thousand cells were analyzed for LDL receptor expression on a FACSort flow cytometer with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Background fluorescence of the secondary antibodies alone was subtracted, using the CellQuest software, from sample fluorescence before analyzing the mean fluorescence. For staining of neutral lipids in T. gondii, purified tachyzoites were applied to poly-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed in 4% PFA, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 5 μg/ml Nile Red in PBS (stock solution 0.5 mg/ml in acetone). Coverslips were then rinsed in PBS and mounted in glycerol for fluorescence microscopy employing a filter set for fluorescein (450–500 nm band pass excitation filter) for yellow-gold fluorescence. A similar procedure was used for cytochemical staining of cellular free cholesterol with the antibiotic filipin at concentration of 50 μg/ml in PBS (stock solution 2.5 mg/ml in dimethyl formamide), using an excitation filter of 350–410 nm. Protein content was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Bovine serum albumin was used for the standard curve. To determine whether T. gondii replication is affected by alteration in cholesterol ester formation, tachyzoites were used to infect either MEF deficient for ACAT-1 or HFF treated with ACAT inhibitors SaH 58-035 and CI 976 (34Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). In ACAT-1−/− MEF, parasite replication was reduced by 60% compared with that in ACAT-1+/+ MEF. In addition, the two structurally distinct pharmacological ACAT inhibitors, SaH 58-035 and CI 976, exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of T. gondii replication in HFF. This anti-T. gondii effect was also present when the ACAT inhibitor treatment followed theT. gondii infection of the host cells (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that an aberrant initial formation of the PV is not the cause of the observed reduction in parasite replication. The lack of cholesterol esterification impaired parasite replication, but it did not kill the parasites. In both ACAT-1−/− and inhibitor-treated cells, T. gondii tachyzoites were able to induce host cell lysis. However, this process was delayed by an average of 48 h compared with that in cells with normal ACAT activity. The reduction in parasite number seen in cells lacking ACAT activity could have been a consequence of decreased invasion efficiency, decreased parasite replication, or both. In order to assess whether the alteration in cholesterol ester metabolism compromises the ability of T. gondii to enter host cells, an invasion assay was performed. The number of intracellular parasites in both ACAT-1−/− MEF (Fig.2 A) and inhibitor-treated HFF (Fig. 2 B) was comparable to the number of parasites in control cells at 1 h postinfection but was significantly decreased at 24 h postinfection. Therefore, it appears that ACAT activity is not required for efficient invasion of host cells by T. gondii but for subsequent intracellular replication. Deficiency or inhibition of ACAT results in an increase in the doubling time of intracellular tachyzoites from between 6 and 8 h to over 10 h (data not shown). To determine whether the proliferation of parasites in cells with compromised cholesterol esterification impairs the ability of T. gondii to accomplish additional cycles of invasion, parasites were isolated from ACAT-1−/− MEF or inhibitor-treated HFF after two lysis passages and allowed to invade and proliferate in untreated HFF. We found that parasites isolated from cells with compromised cholesterol esterification were as efficient at invading and replicating in HFF as were parasites isolated from control cells (not shown). Therefore, alteration of cholesterol esterification does not permanently impair intracellular cycles of T. gondii. While the impairment of T. gondii replication in both ACAT-1−/− MEF and in ACAT inhibitor-treated HFF implied that the lack of ACAT activity was responsible for the anti-T. gondii effect, it was necessary to obtain direct evidence in support of this mechanism. Therefore, we examined the ACAT enzymatic activity in these cells, measured as incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acid into cholesterol esters. The amount of newly formed cholesterol esters was decreased by ≥95% in ACAT-1−/− MEF compared with control ACAT-1+/+MEF. Similarly, the formation of new cholesterol esters was inhibited by ≥95% in HFF treated with 1.0 μm or higher concentrations of either SaH 58-035 or CI 976 (Fig.3). This finding is consistent with the published observation that SaH 58-035 and CI 976 inhibit cholesterol esterification in other cell types with IC50 values of average 0.5 μm (34Ross A.C. Go K.J. Heider J.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 815-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bocan T.M. Mueller S.B. Uhlendorf P.D. Newton R.S. Krause B.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1830-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the anti-T. gondii effect of ACAT inhibitors required significantly higher concentrations of the inhibitors than those required for maximal inhibition of cellular ACAT activity raised the possibility that the ACAT inhibitors exerted their effects on parasite replication through nonspecific host cell toxicity. Although neither visual inspection of the morphology nor trypan blue staining of HFF indicated obvious host cell toxicity at concentrations of inhibitors that slowed T. gondii replication, we further examined host cell toxicity using two distinct biochemical assays. First, we used a colorimetric assay of cell viability based on functionality of dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. This revealed that host cell metabolism was not affected by the presence of the inhibitors except at the highest dose (100 μm) of CI 976, a concentration much higher than that required to reduce T. gondii replication (data not shown). Some morphologic alteration of the cells and loss of adherence were also observed at this concentration of CI 976. Second, we assayed the ATP content of host cells to determine whether ACAT inhibitors reduced the proliferation of T. gondii by blocking the production of this host cell metabolite on which T. gondii is known to depend (15Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Sorensen S.W. Billington C.J. Norris S.A. Briggs J.E. Reding M.T. Filice G.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). ATP levels were not reduced in ACAT-1−/−MEF or inhibitor-treated HFF, indicating that ATP depletion did not account for the anti-T. gondii effect (data not shown). The anti-T. gondii effect observed in the absence of cholesterol esterification could have resulted from accumulation of free cholesterol that is known to be toxic to mammalian cells (37Yao P.M. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23807-23813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the free cholesterol content in both ACAT-1−/− MEF and ACAT inhibitor-treated HFF. Quantitative analysis of free cholesterol by TLC showed that the free cholesterol content did not increase in the absence of ACAT activity (data not shown). In addition, cells were stained for free cholesterol using the fluorescent polyene antibiotic filipin and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence did not increase in cells with compromised ACAT activity compared with control cells (not shown). This indicates that homeostatic mechanisms used by mammalian cells to maintain the cholesterol at physiological levels are effective when ACAT activity is reduced in cultured cells and provide evidence that the anti-T. gondii effect of deficiency of ACAT is not mediated by toxicity of excess free cholesterol (38Tabas I. Weiland D.A. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3147-3155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rodriguez A. Bachorik P.S. Wee S.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Possible cellular mechanisms to maintain the free cholesterol at physiological levels are efflux of free cholesterol (40Johnson W.J. Kilsdonk E.P. van Tol A. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1993-2000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,41Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and regulation of the enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, as well as LDL uptake (42Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 43Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Since it has been shown that receptor-mediated endocytosis of plasma LDL in the host cell is a key element for intravacuolar proliferation of T. gondii (19Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we asked whether the inhibition of the enzymatic ACAT activity might cause a decrease in LDL endocytosis through down-regulation of LDL receptors and consequent decrease in parasite proliferation. To examine this possibility, the presence of LDL receptor was analyzed by Western blot in ACAT-1−/−MEF (Fig. 4 A) and inhibitor-treated HFF (Fig. 4 B). The expression of the LDL receptor did not significantly decrease in cells lacking ACAT activity compared with the amount observed in control cells. To assess the amount of LDL receptor present on the surface of the host cells, inhibitor-treated HFF were incubated at 4 °C with an antiserum recognizing the LDL receptor and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4 C). Surface LDL receptor expression was similar in control and inhibitor-treated cells, confirming that decreased LDL receptor expression did not account for the anti-T. gondii effect. Previously we demonstrated that the treatment with ACAT inhibitors causes an efficient block in the formation of new cholesterol esters in the host cell (Fig. 3). However, it is possible that even in the presence of ACAT inhibitors residual stores of cholesterol esters are still present in the host cytoplasm in form of lipid droplets. To determine whether 72 h of inhibitor treatment was sufficient to deplete the host cells of cholesterol esters, we performed a direct quantitation of CE. As shown in Fig.5, the amount of CE was virtually absent as expected in ACAT-1−/− MEF, whereas it decreased"
https://openalex.org/W2004617563,"The importance of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on maintenance of skeletal integrity has been widely recognized. Although osteoblasts secrete some IGF-I, the liver is the primary endocrine source for IGF-I. We have studied the regulation of the human IGF-I promoter in the hepatocyte cell line Hep3B, and we have shown that the IGF-I promoter, when co-transfected in Hep3B cells together with an estrogen receptor (ER)-α expression vector, was transcriptionally regulated by raloxifene or raloxifene-like molecules but not by 17β-estradiol and 4(OH)-tamoxifen. The induction mediated by raloxifene is antagonized by 17β-estradiol and mediated selectively by ER-α, but not by ER-β. Transfer of IGF-I promoter sequences from −733 to −65 or from −375 to −65 to a minimal Fos promoter resulted in a comparable responsiveness to raloxifene. This region contains two CAAT/enhancer-binding protein sites and an activator protein 1 site, both of which have been shown to be involved in estrogen receptor-mediated transactivation. When the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein sites were mutated in a construct bearing the sequence from −375 to −65 in front of the minimal Fos promoter, raloxifene induction was reduced, whereas mutation of the other elements did not affect induction. In addition, using chimeric proteins, we delineated the domains of ER-α that confer to ER-α transactivation abilities on the IGF-I promoter that are not exhibited by ER-β. These data shed new light on the mechanism of action of antiestrogens and might help explain, at least in part, the bone-protective effects observed for some antiestrogens in ovariectomized animals.

Donahue L.R. Hunter S.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 83-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the skeletal tissue, IGF-I originates from the circulation and from the osteoblasts, where its production is regulated by several major bone hormones, such as parathyroid hormone (2McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), prostaglandins (3McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Raisz L.G. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2895-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and estrogen (4Ernst M. Heath J.K. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5Kassem M. Okazaki R. Harris S.A. Spelsberg T.C. Conover C.A. Riggs B.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 62: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The main endocrine source of IGF-I is the liver, where it is produced under the control of growth hormone (6Rotwein P. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As aging progresses, a decrease in growth hormone release by the pituitary glands causes a reduction in the production of circulating IGF-I by the liver (7Lamberts S.W.J. van den Beld A.W Van der Lely A.-J. Science. 1997; 278: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), and, in addition, the local skeletal IGF-I concentration declines. The dramatic decrease in circulating estrogen occurring at menopause might play a central role in the decrease of this local skeletal IGF-I production. This continuous decline in IGF-I activity with age may be a major cause of bone loss (8Pfeilschifter J. Ziegler R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 617-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Estrogen and antiestrogen effects are mediated through the estrogen receptor (ER), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. The ER exerts its transcriptional control after interaction of receptor dimers with specific DNA sequences such as the classical estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) or other DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of target gene promoters (9Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Antiestrogens can act as estrogen antagonists or partial agonists. Three distinct classes of antiestrogens have been described, ranging from pure antagonists such as ICI 182,780 to partial agonists such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, which exert tissue-selective estrogen-like effects (10McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of these mixed agonists/antagonists is still not completely unraveled. The elucidation of the crystal structure of ER in complex with estrogen or raloxifene (11Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) has provided some molecular evidence for the mechanism of antagonism of this antiestrogen. Recent data indicate that differences in tissue selectivity between raloxifene and tamoxifen are based upon differences in ligand-dependent conformation of the ligand-binding domain (12Grese T.A. Sluka J.P. Bryant H.U. Cullinan G.J. Glasebrook A.L. Jones C.D. Matsumoto K. Palkowitz A.D. Sato M. Termine J.D. Winter M.A. Yang N.N. Dodge J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14105-14110Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, the existence of a second recently discovered estrogen receptor, ER-β (13Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5295-5930Crossref Scopus (4239) Google Scholar), could also help explain various aspects of the agonist and antagonist profile of antiestrogens in different tissues and cell contexts (14Barkheim T. Carlsson B. Nilsson Y. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.-A. Nilsson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Raloxifene and its derivatives have recently drawn a lot of attention because they are being proposed as a first generation of specific estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (15Mitlak B.H. Cohen F.H. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1997; 48: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with beneficial effects on bone and the cardiovascular system and a limited effect on the uterus and acting as an antiestrogen on breast. The mechanism of action of raloxifene has previously been studied using the TGF-β3 promoter, in which a raloxifene response element (RRE) bearing no homology to the classical ERE has been described (16Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1996; 273: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In this case, the RRE appeared to be essential but not sufficient to support the raloxifene response; an additional, as yet unidentified element of the TGF-β3 promoter was also required for raloxifene induction (17Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1997; 275: 1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Because of the potential impact of liver IGF-I production on bone and more generally on the aging process (6Rotwein P. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Lamberts S.W.J. van den Beld A.W Van der Lely A.-J. Science. 1997; 278: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 8Pfeilschifter J. Ziegler R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 138: 617-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we studied the effects of estrogen and antiestrogens on transcription of the human IGF-I gene. The human IGF-I gene contains two promoters, which show cell-specific expression. A preferential usage of the more proximal promoter I has been seen in the adult human liver, where it accounts for 80% of IGF-I transcripts (18Jansen E. Steenbergh P.H. van Schaik F.M.A. Sussenbach J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For this reason, in this study we used a piece of promoter I and tested its regulation in a liver-derived cell line, Hep3B. Estrogen regulation of the chicken IGF-I gene has already been demonstrated (19Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the effects of antiestrogens were not investigated. Here we show that the antiestrogens raloxifene, arzoxifene, and the so-called pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 all increase IGF-I gene transcription, whereas 17β-estradiol and 4(OH)-tamoxifen, another class of antiestrogens, did not elicit any increase in IGF-I transcriptional activity. Strikingly, induction of the IGF-I promoter by these antiestrogens is mediated specifically by ER-α, but not by ER-β, although ER-β efficiently activated an ERE-tk-luc reporter in an estrogen-dependent manner. We also found that both the AF1 and AF2 domains of ER-α are responsible for specific transactivation of the IGF-I promoter by ER-α. Furthermore, we found that two C/EBP sites are necessary for this ER-α-mediated induction of the IGF-I promoter. The human hepatoma cell line Hep3B was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HB 80 64). The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-Glu. During the experiments, cells were kept in phenol red-free medium complemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum. The IGF-I plasmid IGF-I-luc corresponding to region −733 to +55 of the IGF-I promoter I was cloned as described in Ref. 20Nolten L.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The reporter (ERE)2tk-luc was a kind gift from Dr. R. Schule (Tumor Biology Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). The human estrogen receptor expression vector HEO and HEGO were obtained from Dr. P. Chambon's laboratory (21Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), and the ER cDNA was transferred into pcDNA3 expression vector (InVitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The human estrogen receptor β expression vector was made by inserting full-length human ER-β (22Ogawa S. Inoue S. Watanabe T. Hiroi H. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The plasmids IGF-733-CAT and IGF-375-CAT were generated by inserting the region corresponding to −733 to −65 (Asp-718; PvuII fragment) or the region from −375 to −65 (XbaI;PvuII fragment) in both orientations upstream of a minimal Fos promoter driving a CAT reporter (23Pierce J.W. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A C/EBP mutant IGF-375-CAT construct was generated using a Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The modified oligonucleotides for the mutation of the first C/EBP site (−119, −111) were GCCCAAAAAAGTCCCTCGAGAATAACTTTGCCAG (upstream) and CTG GCA AAG TTA TTC TCG AGG GAC TTT TTT GGG C (downstream). The oligonucleotides for the mutation of the second C/EBP site (−151, −143) were GCAAAGGTATCATATTCTTTGTCACCATGC (upstream) and GCATGGTGACAAAGAATATGATACCTTTGC (downstream). The oligonucleotides for the mutation of the RRE site were CCTTACTCAATAACTTTGCCAGAGGATCCGAGAGAGAAGGCAAA (upstream) and TTTGCCTTCT-CTCTCTTCTCCTCTGGCAAAGTTATTGAGTA (downstream). The oligonucleotides for mutation of the AP-1 site were CCCAGCAGAAAGTTACCTAGAAAACAGATCCTT (upstream) and GGGTCGTCTTTTCAATGGATCTTTTGTCTAGGAA (downstream). To create chimeric molecules, the A/B domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the ligand-binding domain from ER-α or ER-β were polymerase chain reaction-amplified in such a way that in-frame restriction sites (NsiI and SalI, respectively) were introduced at the beginning and/or end of these fragments. These different fragments were cloned in pGEMT, sequenced, and used to construct chimeras by recombining them at the introduced restriction site; these chimeras have the structure A/B domain-NsiI site-DNA-binding domain-SalI site-ligand-binding domain. Detailed structure is available upon request. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. DNA-mediated gene transfer was performed using 2 μl of Fugene6 fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Transfection time was 4 h, and total DNA amount was 0.5 μg consisting of the reporter plasmid (0.45 μg) and 0.05 μg of estrogen receptor α or estrogen receptor β expression vector. Cells were cultured for another 24 h in the presence of vehicle (in general, ethanol at a final concentration of 0.01%; we used Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.01% for arzoxifene and raloxifene) or tested with hormones 17β-estradiol, 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, or the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. After incubation with different hormones or antihormones, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 250 μl of the reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell lysate was scraped out of the plates, and luminescence was measured using an automatic LB96P luminometer (Berthold, Regensdorf, Switzerland). Results were expressed in relative luminescence units/μg protein. CAT activity was analyzed in cell extracts (prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles) using a procedure described previously (23Pierce J.W. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Samples were run for 1 h on TLC plates (Merck), and radioactivity was measured by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CAT activity represents the percentage of the acetylated substrate. Results are expressed as the percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol/mg protein. We compared the effects of estrogen and antiestrogens on the regulation of the human IGF-I gene. To examine the respective induction of estrogens and antiestrogens, we transfected Hep3B cells with a reporter construct containing the IGF-I promoter in front of the luciferase gene (IGF-luc) and co-transfected an expression vector for ER-α. We found that raloxifene, arzoxifene, and ICI 182,780, but not 4(OH)-tamoxifen, dose-dependently stimulated transcription from the IGF-luc reporter. By contrast, 17β-estradiol was not able to activate the IGF-I promoter (Fig. 1). However, raloxifene-induced transcription activation was partially counteracted by 17β-estradiol, confirming that the activation of transcription by raloxifene is dependent on the estrogen receptor (Fig.2).Figure 2Estrogen inhibits raloxifene-mediated induction of the IGF-I promoter in Hep3B cells. Hep3B cells were transfected with the IGF-I-luc construct and the expression vector for ER-α. Cells were exposed for 24 h to either an increasing concentration of 17β-estradiol alone or a constant raloxifene concentration (10 nm) with increasing concentrations of 17β-estradiol, as indicated.

Pelto-Huikko M. Grandien K. Lagercrantz S. Lagercrantz J. Fried G. Nordenskjöld M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4258-4265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transactivation properties of ER-β and ER-α have already been compared using reporter systems containing classical EREs and AP-1 sites (25Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar): different ligands, such as estrogen or the antiestrogens raloxifene, 4(OH)-tamoxifen, or ICI 164,384, displayed very different activity profiles, depending on both the ER subtype and the response elements. We therefore tested the effect of 4(OH)-tamoxifen, raloxifene, arzoxifene, and ICI 182,780 on transactivation of the IGF-I promoter by ER-β in this case, we could not detect activation (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig.3 a, ER-β was fully functional when tested on a classical ERE reporter construct and displayed in this assay a response to estrogen that was twice as great as the one observed with ER-α. In a recent study using full-length human ER-β, similar results were obtained (26Jones P.S. Parrott E. White I.N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32008-32014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that estrogen receptors α and β, which may be co-expressed in cells, are able to form functional heterodimers on DNA. We therefore compared ER-α and ER-β with their heterodimers ER-α/ER-β on an ERE-driven luciferase reporter. To do this, we performed transfections using equivalent amounts of expression vectors for ER-α and ER-β, conditions that have been shown to lead predominantly to the formation of heterodimers (27Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 28Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.J.M. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, we found that transcription of the ERE reporter is stimulated to a level similar to that of ER-α alone (Fig.3 a). A similar experiment was done using the IGF-I promoter and confirmed that raloxifene is able to activate the IGF-I promoter through ER-α, but not through ER-β; in addition, when ER-α and ER-β expression vectors were co-transfected at equimolar levels in Hep3B cells, raloxifene induction of the IGF-I promoter was fully maintained (Fig. 3 b). This may indicate that the ER domains implicated in activation of the IGF-I promoter may be different from those involved in ERE activation. It is interesting to note that ER-α and, to a lesser extent, ER-β are both expressed in Hep3B cells (data not shown). Because only ER-α was able to mediate induction of the IGF-I promoter by raloxifene, we sought to define which part of the receptor was responsible for this selective effect. To do so, we created chimeric proteins that replaced the A/B domain (bearing the transactivation function 1 (AF-1)), the DNA-binding domain, or the ligand-binding domain (bearing the activating function 2 (AF-2)) of ER-α with the corresponding region from ER-β. As shown in Fig. 4, a andb, the general pattern of activity of these chimeras was found to be qualitatively the same when looking at the response to the antiestrogens arzoxifene and ICI 182,780. Similar but somewhat weaker results were obtained with raloxifene (data not shown). Replacement of the A/B domain of ER-α with the corresponding domain of ER-β resulted in a dramatic decrease of transactivation activity by antiestrogens. Replacement of the ligand-binding domain, which bears the AF-2 function, also led to a similar effect. In addition, exchange of both domains (βαβ) did not lead to a further impairment of activation. By contrast, the chimeric protein αβα, which has the DNA-binding domain from ER-β, displayed an activity similar to that of intact ER-α, indicating that the DNA-binding domain is not implicated in this effect. These observations suggest that both the A/B domain and the ligand-binding domain of ER-α are needed to specifically mediate antiestrogen induction of the IGF-I promoter. When tested on an ERE reporter and using 17β-estradiol as an inducer (Fig.4 c), we show that only the chimeric proteins βαβ displayed an activity that is almost twice that of ER-α, as already shown with full-length ER-β (Fig. 3 a). The differences in activity between ER-α and ER-β would rely not only on the A/B domain of ER-β, which displays a low homology with the A/B domain of ER-α, but also on its ligand-binding domain. A response element mediating raloxifene induction has only been identified in the TGF-β3 promoter, where it has been defined as a so-called RRE (16Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1996; 273: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1997; 275: 1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). By computer analysis of the IGF-I promoter, we identified a stretch of nucleotides in the −82 to −100 region showing 90% identity to 18 of the 40 nucleotides described as RRE in the TGF-β3 promoter (Fig. 5). By analogy, we called this region IGF-I-RRE. To test whether the region encompassing the putative IGF-I RRE was responsible for the raloxifene response, we made chimeric constructs, which contained −773 to −65 (IGF-773-CAT) or −375 to −65 (IGF-375-CAT) from the IGF-I promoter sequence in front of a minimal Fos promoter. Hep3B cells were transfected with these reporter plasmids together with the ER-α expression vector, and their raloxifene response was tested. As shown in Fig. 6, raloxifene was able to activate both the longer construct (data not shown) and the shorter construct (IGF-375-CAT). This result confirms that the raloxifene-responsive region is located between position −375 and −65. Examination of the sequences between −375 and −65 revealed, in addition to the RRE-like element mentioned above, two C/EBP sites and an AP-1 site (see Fig. 5). To test the role of these different binding sites, we introduced mutations in each of them in the context of the IGF-375-CAT reporter (Fig. 6) and tested the resulting constructs in transfections. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 6, mutation of the RRE-like sequence had no deleterious effect on the induction of the IGF-I promoter by raloxifene. Previous work has shown that ER-α and ER-β can act through AP-1 sites (25Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar), and in particular, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI 164,384 have been shown to be potent transcriptional activators with ER-β at AP-1 sites. Moreover, Umayahara et al. (19Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the chicken IGF-I gene promoter I is controlled by estrogen through an AP-1 site. However, mutation of the AP-1 site did not affect the inducibility of the IGF-375-CAT reporter by raloxifene (Fig. 6). Finally, we examined the two C/EBP sites. As shown in Fig. 6, mutation of either of these two sites dramatically decreased the inducibility of the IGF-I promoter by raloxifene. Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays demonstrated that both C/EBP-α and C/EBP-β can bind to the IGF-I promoter in vitro (data not shown). Since the cloning of the new ER subtype, ER-β, the central question has been the biological significance of this second estrogen receptor. It has been hypothesized that ER-β might explain, at least in part, the selective actions of estrogens and antiestrogens in different target tissues. The transactivation properties of the two receptors have first been examined in presence of 17β-estradiol as a ligand with classical ERE reporter genes. Under these conditions, full-length ER-β was found to be a better activator than ER-α (27Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar,28Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.J.M. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that these initial studies were performed with constructs lacking the N-terminal region including the AF-1 domain of ER-β and thus led to the erroneous conclusion that ER-β is weaker than ER-α. Our results with a complete ER-β show that ER-β is in fact a better activator than ER-α on an ERE reporter. In this study, we show that the IGF-I gene is preferentially activated by antiestrogens such as raloxifene or raloxifene-like compounds and the so-called pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780, but not by 4(OH)-tamoxifen and 17β-estradiol. Estrogen was able to counteract the effects of raloxifene, as is the case for the TGF-β3 promoter and the quinone reductase promoter (17Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1997; 275: 1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 29Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This suggests a competition between these ligands for the binding domain of the estrogen receptor and confirms that these antiestrogen effects are indeed mediated by the estrogen receptor. Activation of the IGF-I promoter by antiestrogens is specifically mediated by ER-α, not by ER-β. In this case, antiestrogens act as activators of transcription. These findings illustrate that, depending on the promoter context and the ligand used, ER-α and ER-β can regulate gene activity differentially. Interestingly, and in agreement with our observations, in a recentin vivo study (30Klotz D.M. Curtis Hewitt S. Korach K.S. Diaugustine R.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3430-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) it was shown that antiestrogens are able to increase IGF-I mRNA levels in the mouse uterus and that ER-β does not play a role in mediating this activation. Furthermore, by using chimeras between ER-α and ER-β, we found that both AF-1 and AF-2 of ER-α are required to mediate activation of the IGF-I promoter by antiestrogens. Within the IGF-I promoter, several potential binding sites were examined for their contribution to activation by ER-α in response to antiestrogens such as raloxifene. By mutation analysis, we showed that both C/EBP sites have a major contribution to the raloxifene inducibility of the IGF-I promoter. C/EBPs are transcriptional regulators that are highly expressed in liver and have previously been shown to be involved in ER-mediated promoter activation (31Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Galien R. Evans H.F. Garcia T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Calkhoven C.F. Snippe L. Ab G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). C/EBP-β has been shown to be necessary for ER-α mediated down-regulation of the interleukin 6 promoter and to cooperate with a nuclear factor κB site (32Galien R. Evans H.F. Garcia T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Stein and Yang (31Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a direct in vitro interaction between a glutathioneS-transferase-ER-α fusion protein and C/EBPβ. Furthermore, both ER-α and C/EBPα are required for maximal activation of the promoter of the very low density apolipoprotein gene promoter by estrogen (33Calkhoven C.F. Snippe L. Ab G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, although it is known that ER-α and C/EBP can interact and form a complex in solution, the demonstration of complex formation between these two proteins has not been done by gel shift assay in any of the reports cited above. In line with this, we failed to observe the formation of a C/EBP-ER complex on the IGF-I C/EBP sites. It is worth mentioning that a similar situation has been observed for the glucocorticoid receptor, which was also shown to interact in solution with C/EBP but could not be demonstrated to do so by gel shift assay (34Boruk M. Savory J.G.A. Hache R.J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1749-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, using extracts from transfected cells that were treated or not treated with ER agonists or antagonists, we did not observe any alteration in the affinity of interaction between C/EBP and the corresponding C/EBP sites by band shift analysis (data not shown). Mutation of a sequence in the IGF-I promoter that has a strong homology to the TGF-β3-RRE had no deleterious effect. Similarly, mutation of an AP-1-like site, another potentially important site for ER-mediated transcription, did not affect activation of the IGF-I promoter by ER-α. Regulation of the IGF-I gene by estrogen has already been described in different tissues or cell types. Previous studies have shown that estradiol treatment increases IGF-I mRNA in the uterus of ovariectomized rats (35Murphy L.J. Murphy L.C. Friesen H.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 120: 1882-1888Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and in osteoblastic cells (4Ernst M. Heath J.K. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Here we found that 17β-estradiol had no positive effect on IGF-I transcription in Hep3B cells; on the other hand, antiestrogens such as raloxifene led to an increase in IGF-I transcription. In contrast, the chicken IGF-I promoter was found to be induced by estrogen in another hepatocyte cell line, HepG2 (19Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with recent clinical studies showing that tamoxifen and 17β-estradiol decrease the circulating IGF-I levels in women (36Decensi A. Robertson C. Ballardini B. Paggi D.

Harman M. Blackman M.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and with the fact that the predominant source of circulating IGF-I is the liver. Our findings might also partially explain the bone-protective effect of raloxifene or raloxifene derivatives such as arzoxifene. A recent study (38Ammann P. Bourrin S. Bonjour J.-P. Brunner F. Meyer J.-M. Rizzoli R Osteoporosis Int. 1999; 10: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that a new SERM, MDL 103,323, increases the circulating level of IGF-I and postulates that the increase in IGF-I induced by MDL 103,323 might contribute to its favorable effects on bone strength because an increase in bone density has been observed. Thus, an increase in IGF-I transcription might represent a general mode of action of antiestrogens, except for those of the tamoxifen class, which display agonistic activity in bone in vivo. Finally, a recent clinical study from Garnero et al. (39Garnero P. Sornay-Rendu E. Delmas P.D. Lancet. 2000; 355: 898-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) established a clear link between a decrease in IGF-I serum concentration and an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures independent of bone mineral density, supporting the possible relevance of the IGF-I increase for the prediction of the effects of SERMs on bone metabolism. In addition, we showed that the so-called pure antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, was also able to trigger IGF-I transcription through ER-α. The terminology of pure antiestrogens for these compounds was defined based on the absence of agonism in reproductive tissue. However, ICI 182,780 has already been shown to modulate transcription of the TGF-β3 and quinone reductase promoters through ER-α or ER-β (16Yang N.N. Venugopalan M. Hardikar S. Glasebrook A. Science. 1996; 273: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S.

A. 1997; 94: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a new example of estrogen agonism for these compounds. A recent in vivo study (40Sibonga J.D. Dobnig H. Harden R.M. Turner R.T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3736-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showed that at high doses, the compound ICI 182,780 displays partial agonism for cancellous bone protection. Taken together, these data call into question the application of the term “pure antiestrogens” to these compounds. In conclusion, in this study we propose a new mechanism of action of SERMs that positively regulate the IGF-I gene through ER-α. These findings might have useful implications for the monitoring of SERM activity in osteoporotic patients. We thank J. Wirsching for excellent technical help and H. J. Keller for the kind gift of ER-β plasmid. We thank R. Gamse for careful reading of the manuscript and helpful discussion."

Utilizing mice harboring a transgene that directs the expression of a constitutively activated, GTPase-deficient mutant of Gαi2 (Q205L) in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver, we demonstrate that Gαi2 regulates the translocation of the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The expression of Q205L Gαi2 increased glucose transport and translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in vivo in the absence of insulin stimulation. Adipocytes from the Q205L Gαi2 mice displayed enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane to levels nearly twice that of those from littermate controls. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activities were constitutively activated in tissues expressing the Q205L Gαi2.

Earlier we reported a unique role for heterotrimeric G-protein Gαi2 in modulating insulin signaling and glucose disposal (14Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Deficiency of Gαi2 in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle results in frank insulin resistance (16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active form of Gαi2, in sharp contrast, leads to enhanced glucose tolerance (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the current work we sought to determine if activation of Gαi2 signals to and thereby modulates glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation. We make use of the inducible, tissue-specific expression of the Q205L mutant form of Gαi2 that is constitutively active in transgenic mice (iQ205L mice). When expressed in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, Q205L Gαi2leads to increased glucose tolerance (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This increase in glucose tolerance of iQ205L mice is observed even after treatment of the animals with the cytotoxic drug streptozotocin, rendering the mice insulin-deficient (18Zheng X.L. Guo J. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23649-23651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest the possibility that Gαi2 may be regulating glucose transport activity in the absence of insulin. We explore this possibility and discovered increased glucose transport activity and GLUT4 abundance in the cell membrane of adipocytes from iQ205L mice. The adipose tissue of iQ205L mice display constitutively active PI 3-kinase activity, Akt activation, increased glucose transport activity, and a higher abundance of GLUT4 transporters in the cell membrane in the resting state. These results elucidate a new, important role of Gαi2 in glucose disposal at the level of GLUT4. Mice of the FVB strain were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at SUNY/Stony Brook. Mice were maintained on a normal light/dark cycle. The transgenic mice were constructed using the rat Q205L Gαi2 under the control of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter, as described elsewhere (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter is silent in utero and is strongly activated at birth, yielding 2–3% of cellular mRNA in tissues targeted for expression, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (19Wang H.Y. Lin F. Malbon C.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 241-258PubMed Google Scholar). Tail DNA samples were extracted, and the presence of Q205L Gαi2 transgene was detected by polymerase chain reaction using primers described elsewhere (14Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Targeted tissues such as epididymal white fat were taken to monitor the tissue-specific expression of Q205L Gαi2 with anti-Gαi2 antibody according to standard procedures (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Six founder lines were bred for 10 generations, and mice used in these experiments were 8–16 weeks of age, with no age-related differences observed in the parameters measured. Male transgenic and non-transgenic littermates or wild-type FVB male mice of the age were fed ad libitum and maintained on normal light/dark cycles. The evening before experiments, mice were allowed access to drinking water only. Experiments were routinely conducted between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Mice were anesthetized and insulin (5 IU) was administered via intravenous injection as described previously (20Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Control mice received injections with vehicle alone. Mouse epididymal fat pads or skeletal muscle from mouse hind limb were removed and trimmed off connective tissue. Then the fat or muscle tissue were minced and homogenized on ice in TES buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 m sucrose, protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 2.5 μmNa3VO4 using either a Polytron homogenizer for skeletal muscle or a Dounce glass/Teflon homogenizer for adipose tissue. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 750 ×g for 10 min. The pellet, which contained connective tissue and nuclei, was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The 16,000 × gpellet represented a plasma membrane-enriched fraction (PM). The supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min. The 48,000 × g pellet was enriched in high density microsomes (HDM). The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 60 min. The 200,000 × g pellet was enriched in low density microsomes (LDM), and the supernatant is referred to as the high speed supernatant (HS) fraction. All pellets were resuspended in TES buffer with standard protease inhibitors listed above. All centrifugation and subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Mice (9–14 weeks in age), fasted over night before experiments, were anesthetized using a mixture containing ketamine (120 mg/kg body weight) and xylozine (8 mg/kg body weight), injected intraperitoneally. Once deep anesthesia was achieved, the abdominal cavity was opened and insulin (5 IU) or vehicle was administered via injection into inferior vena cava. At the time indicated after injection, epididymal fat pads and skeletal muscle from hind limb were removed. Protein determination was performed as described (21Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8692-8699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μg of protein) from each subcellular fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots and probed with anti-GLUT4 antibodies (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Upon secondary staining, the GLUT4 immune complexes were quantified on the blots by scanning densitometry. The total protein content was determined as was the relative abundance of GLUT4 per unit protein, providing an index of total and subcellular distribution of GLUT4. Throughout the manuscript the amounts of GLUT4 in the various subcellular fractions are reported as percents of the GLUT4 content. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of mouse epididymal fat pads in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 4% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min, as described (22Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. Kerman K. Gitomer W. Pilch P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The digested tissue was washed 3 times in Krebs-Ringer phosphate with 2% bovine serum albumin. For insulin treatment, the isolated adipocytes were dispersed into two equal aliquots for cells from both the wild-type and transgenic mice and then pre-equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min. Glucose (2.5 mm) with or without insulin (100 nm) was added to each tube, and the adipocytes were harvested after a 5-min incubation. Cells were homogenized by glass homogenizer for 10 strokes in HME buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min, and supernatant (post-nucleus fraction) was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. This 16,000 × g pellet is a PM fraction. Glucose transport activity was determined by analysis of the initial rates for the transport of 3-O-[3H]methylglucose in white fat cells acutely isolated from the iQ205L mice, as described earlier (22Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. Kerman K. Gitomer W. Pilch P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PM or lysate fractions were resuspended in a reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. An aliquot of membrane protein (5 μg) or lysate (100 μg) was added to the reaction buffer containing 20 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm phosphoinositol, phosphoserine (0.2 μg/μl), and 20 mm ATP (containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was initiated by addition of the protein sample and maintained at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 2 n HCl, and then an aliquot (160 μl) of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mixture was added. The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the lower phase was transferred to a new tube and washed by chloroform, methanol, 0.1 n HCl (1:1:1) twice. The lower phase was collected and dried under vacuum. The samples were resuspended in 10 μl of chloroform:methanol (95:5) then spotted onto the origin of a thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in chloroform, methanol, NH4OH (25%), H2O (100:70:25:15). The resolved plate was dried and exposed to Kodak film or phosphoimaging cassette. The assay of Akt activity was performed using a kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs). Epididymal fat pads were homogenized in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and subjected to centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and 1% Triton X-100 was added. Skeletal muscle from hind limb also was homogenized in lysis buffer and the slurry was rotated at 4 °C for 15 min. The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of supernatant (100 μg of protein from adipose tissue or 200 μg of protein from skeletal muscle) was mixed with 20 μl of beads to which Akt antibody was immobilized, and the mixture was then rotated at 4 °C for 3 h in 500 μl of lysis buffer. The beads were washed three times, and the assay of Akt activity was performed using a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 fusion protein (Mr 30,000 kDa), as described by the vendor (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Akt activity was analyzed by immunoblotting. The blots were stained with phospho-GSK-3α/β(Ser21/9) antibody. Pertussis toxin at 20 ng/ml was added to the collagenase digestion medium at the start of the adipocyte preparation. After washing of the isolated cells, 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin was added, providing a total of 4 h of intoxication. Cells were washed and then treated either with or without lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 1 μm) for 15 min. Cells were collected and homogenized in HME buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 2.5 mmNa3VO4. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose blots, and stained with primary antibodies to the indicated antigens. The quantification of relative abundance of the immune complexes was performed by scanning densitometry. Transgenic mice carrying the pPEPCK expression vector harboring the GTPase-deficient mutant (Q205L) of Gαi2 were newly created, characterized, and propagated (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Guo J.H. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16487-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter-based transgene directs robust expression of the Q205L Gαi2 in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver, providing the mice with markedly enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A possible linkage between Gαi2 and insulin action was explored by testing the hypothesis that Gαi2 regulates glucose transport. Mice with tissue-specific ablation of Gαi2 display poor glucose tolerance (16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), although no direct linkage between the heterotrimeric G-protein Gαi2 and glucose transport has been established. To test the hypothesis, we created four new founder lines, each carrying a pPEPCK Q205LGαi2 transgene that is expressed in target (adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle), but not non-target (lung) tissues. Expression of the constitutively active Q205L Gαi2 was found to be approximately equivalent to the amount of endogenous Gαi2 alone in tissues from the control mice, thus effectively doubling the amount of immunoreactive Gαi2 in the tissues from the iQ205L mice (Fig.1). To explore if changes in glucose transport could explain some of insulinomimetic effects of expression of Q205L Gαi2, hexose transport rates were measured in adipocytes of iQ205L mice and their non-transgenic littermates (Fig.2). Initial rates of 3-O-[3H]methylglucose were determined in acutely prepared adipocytes. Adipocytes prepared from wild-type controls displayed a 4–5-fold increase in initial rates in response to insulin stimulation. The basal, unstimulated rates of hexose transport were 3–4-fold greater in the adipocytes from the iQ205L mice than in the wild-type controls. Insulin was able to stimulate increased hexose transport in the iQ205L mouse adipocytes, achieving a level of transport nearly 10-fold greater than the basal rates of adipocytes from the non-transgenic mouse controls. By comparing the unstimulated, basal states of hexose transport in the Q205L and control mouse adipocytes, it is clear that without stimulation by insulin, the transgenic mice adipocytes transport as much glucose as the control mice adipocytes in the presence of insulin.Figure 2Expression of Q205L Gαi2 in adipocytes leads to enhanced glucose transport activity. Adipocytes were isolated from Q205L Gαi2 transgenic mice and their wild-type counterparts. Adipocytes were assayed acutely for glucose transport activity in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin by measurement of the initial rates of hexose transport using [3H]3-O-methylglucose uptake. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The data presented are mean values from at least four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane appears to be the dominate feature of insulin action in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (6Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Analysis of GLUT4 translocation was performed first with the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), examining the abundance of GLUT4 in four subcellular fractions: PM, HDM, HS, and LDMs (Fig.3). The LDM fractions display the greatest membrane-associated fraction of GLUT4 in both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Within minutes of administration of insulin to the vena cava, GLUT4 translocates to the PM fraction, increasing the cell membrane-localized GLUT4 by 2–3-fold. The results from the two tissues, constituting major sites of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, were quite similar with respect to GLUT4 translocation. We compared the localization of GLUT4 between tissues obtained from the iQ205L mice and their non-transgenic, wild-type controls (Fig.4). The abundance of GLUT4 was not altered in the iQ205L mice. The amount of GLUT4 localized to the PM fraction prepared from either adipose tissue or skeletal muscle in the absence of insulin was significantly greater in the iQ205L mice than in the wild-type controls (Fig. 4 A). The changes in GLUT4 translocation were quantified from a number of separate experiments for both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4, B andC, respectively). Tissue samples from iQ205L as compared with wild-type mice display two major differences in GLUT4 localization in the absence of added insulin; they are 1) increased levels of GLUT4 in the PM fractions and 2) relatively similar abundances of GLUT4 in the LDM fraction of adipose tissue while lower abundances of GLUT4 in LDM of skeletal muscle. These data obtained by immunoblotting of subcellular fractions and staining with anti-GLUT4 antibodies are in good agreement with the results from the measurements of hexose transport measured independently by analysis of 3-O-methylglucose uptake in adipocytes derived from the iQ205L and wild-type mice (Fig. 2). These studies provide a compelling case that expression of the constitutively active Gαi2results in greater abundance of GLUT4 in the cell membrane and that this distribution of GLUT4 contributes to the enhanced glucose tolerance of the iQ205L mice. We explored the observation obtained in vivo by analysis of GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes prepared acutely from iQ205L mice and their controls (Fig. 5). The insulin response of GLUT4 translocation in vivo peaks at 5 min after administration of insulin to the vena cava (not shown). The GLUT4 translocation to the PM of adipocytes in response to insulin was observed to peak also at 5 min post-stimulation with insulin and was sustained for the next 30 min (Fig. 5 A). Adipocytes from the iQ205L and control mice displayed the same time course (not shown). When measured in the absence of insulin, the abundance of GLUT4 in the PM was significantly greater in the adipocytes from the iQ205L mice than in their control counterparts (Fig. 5 B), confirming the analysis of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle sampled in vivo (Fig. 3). Insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes from both the wild-type and iQ205L mice. Quantification of the amounts of PM-localized GLUT4 in adipocytes from the two sources reveals a 2-fold increase in the amount of GLUT4 for iQ205L mice adipocytes in the absence of insulin, remarkably a level of GLUT4 localization equivalent to wild-type mouse adipocytes in the presence of insulin (Fig.5 C). Thus, analysis of GLUT4 localization sampled in vivo as well as GLUT4 translocation and hexose transport sampled in isolated adipocytes in vitro provide compelling evidence for Gαi2 regulating GLUT4 localization to the cell membrane in the absence of insulin stimulation. The fact that adipocytes of iQ205L mice with elevated hexose transport and GLUT4 abundance in the cell membrane still respond to insulin with increased GLUT4 translocation and hexose transport activity suggests the existence of an additional Gαi2-mediated pathway for modulating GLUT4 translocation. We explored signaling at the level of PI 3-kinase activity to evaluate a possible role of this key element of insulin signaling to GLUT4 translocation by Gαi2. PI 3-kinase activity was sampled in isolated adipocytes and skeletal muscle prepared from iQ205L mice and their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 6). The adipocytes were treated with insulin in vitro, whereas determinations in skeletal muscle were made from mice that were administered insulin in vivo. The results in both adipocytes and skeletal muscle in the absence of insulin were qualitatively the same, i.e. the expression of Q205L Gαi2 leads to constitutive activation of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 6, A andB). Administration of insulin leads to increased PI 3-kinase activation in adipocytes and skeletal muscle from both the iQ205L mice and control counterparts. In agreement with the results obtained by analysis of hexose transport and GLUT4 translocation (Figs. 2 and 4), the activation of PI 3-kinase in the iQ205L mice in the absence of insulin treatment was greater than or equal to the levels of PI 3-kinase activation observed in the wild-type mice after administration of insulin (Fig. 6, A and B). Results from an additional assay of PI 3-kinase activation, i.e. membrane localization of the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 6 C), confirmed the data provided by enzymatic assay of PI 3-kinase. The amount of p110 PI 3-kinase subunit associated with crude cell membranes was found to be significantly greater in adipocytes from the iQ205L Gαi2 mice than in their normal controls. The phosphoinositide-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase Akt (also referred to as protein kinase B) has been proposed as an important link in the linkage from the insulin receptor, IRS1/2, and PI 3-kinase, to GLUT4 translocation and thereby to glucose uptake in muscle and fat (12Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). When measured in samples of adipose tissue from the iQ205L mice, activation of Akt in the absence of insulin administration was prominent, as determined using Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphospecific antibodies to stain blots of Akt (Fig.7). No changes were observed in the relative abundance of Akt by staining the blots with anti-Akt antibodies. Insulin stimulates increased activation of Akt in adipose tissue of both the iQ205L mice as well as the control mice. As noted above in measurements of hexose transport, GLUT4 abundance in the cell membrane and activation of PI 3-kinase, the activation of Akt in the iQ205L mice in the absence of insulin was greater than that of adipose tissue from control mice administered insulin in vivo. The activity of Akt was measured independently via measurement of the phosphorylation of a fusion protein harboring GSK 3α,β phosphorylation motifs and using, in tandem, phospho-specific antibodies that recognize both phospho-Ser-21 of GSK-3α and phospho-Ser-9 of GSK-3β (Fig.7 B). The immunoblotting and quantification results confirm that constitutive activation of Akt is associated with the expression of the Q205L Gαi2 in adipose tissue of mice (Fig.7 B). The assay of Akt activity, in contrast to the immunoblotting data with phosphospecific-antibodies, suggests that Akt activity is already near maximal in the absence of insulin and that, when sampled from iQ205L mice administered insulin in vivo, no further increase in Akt activation was observed using this assay. When Akt phosphorylation and activation were sampled in skeletal muscle of iQ205L mice, a set of observations different from those in adipose tissue sampling were observed (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation of Ser-473 of skeletal muscle Akt displayed the same profile with regard to iQ205L versus control mice as well as with regard to without versus with insulin stimulation, as was noted in adipose tissue (Fig. 7). To our surprise, the phosphorylation of Thr-308 was largely unaffected by either the expression of the Q205L Gαi2 or the stimulation with insulin in vivo. In four separate samplings, increased phosphorylation of Thr-308 was not detected. Levels of expressed Akt were similar to those observed in adipose tissue and relatively unchanged. To further explore the activation state of Akt in skeletal muscle, we employed the enzymatic assay (Fig. 8 B). In good agreement with the immunoblotting data, the enzymatic assay failed to detect increased activity of Akt in skeletal muscle in response to expression of Q205L Gαi2. Curiously, the enzymatic assay failed to detect activation of Akt in skeletal muscle of wild-type mice in response to insulin. The ability of Q205L Gαi2 to influence GLUT4 translocation and activation of hexose transport illuminates an unexpected linkage between Gαi2 and insulin action. The expression of a constitutively active version of Gαi2 is invaluable in exploring new possible signal linkages between heterotrimeric G-proteins and tyrosine kinase actions. It is important, however, to be able to test if the results obtained in the iQ205L mice are demonstrable over the short term through receptor-mediated activation of Gαi2. LPA is a potent stimulator of receptor-medicated activation of the Gαi2 pathway. Adipocytes were isolated from wild-type mice and challenged with LPA, and the abundance of GLUT4 in the cell membrane-enriched fraction was assayed by immunoblotting (Fig. 9). LPA stimulated a marked translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane. Pertussis toxin, in contrast, is known to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of Gαi2, rendering it inactive. This LPA-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 was abolished by pretreated the adipocytes with pertussis toxin (Fig. 9 A). The second read-out for these experiments was activation of PI 3-kinase. The products of PI 3-kinase activation were isolated by thin layer chromatography and abundance of inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was found to be increased dramatically in adipocytes challenged with LPA (Fig. 9 B). This activation of PI 3-kinase was, like the GLUT4 translocation, abolished by pertussis toxin. Last, the activation and phosphorylation state of Akt was measured in adipocytes after acute stimulation with LPA (Fig. 9 C). LPA increased by 50% the activity of Akt, measured using a GSK-3 fusion protein as a substrate. The phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308 also increased in response to LPA stimulation, albeit the phosphorylation of the Thr-308 residue was to a lesser extent. These data extend the observations derived from study of the iQ205L mouse and demonstrate a linkage between activation of Gαi2 and GLUT4 translocation. Signaling via heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled pathways and tyrosine kinase pathways constitute the bulk of cell signaling (24Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Elucidating how signals that originate from two or more of these pathways are integrated has evolved as a central task in modern biology. The convergence of G-protein-coupled signaling and tyrosine kinase action is best exemplified in the case of the well known counter-regulatory interactions between catecholamines and insulin. The β2-adrenergic receptor and insulin receptor converge in the control of metabolic regulation and include receptor-to-receptor cross-talk as well as multiple downstream overlaps that balance the demands of energy needs and availability of sources (25Karoor V. Malbon C.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The linkages between G-proteins such as Gαq (26Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

Mice deficient in Gαi2 in target tissues like liver and adipose tissue display frank insulin resistance (16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C.

Understanding of the mechanisms by which deficiency in either Gαi2 or Gαsregulates insulin signaling is limited at best. A complementary approach to the targeted knock-out of heterotrimeric G-proteins is the targeted overexpression of their α subunits or expression of GTPase-deficient, constitutively active forms in vivo. Complementing the targeted deficiency of Gαi2that provokes insulin resistance (16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) is the creation of transgenic mice that express the constitutively active (Q205L) version of Gαi2, which provokes enhanced glucose tolerance (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the current work we sought to understand one critical aspect of the iO205L mouse, its ability to tolerate and rapidly rectify a glucose load (17Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), even after insulin deficiency in response to streptozotocin (18Zheng X.L. Guo J. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23649-23651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Examination of the hexose transport activity of adipocytes prepared from the iQ205L mice revealed increased initial rates of 3-O-methylglucose. The initial rates of hexose transport of adipocytes from iQ205L mice in the absence of insulin treatment were greater than those of the adipocytes from wild-type control mice in the presence of insulin. This same relationship was observed when the read-outs were extended to GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, to PI 3-kinase activation, and to Akt activation studied in adipocytesin vitro or in adipose tissue excised from mice treated with insulin in vivo. From these studies it can be concluded that expression of Q205L Gαi2 does result in enhanced signaling from PI 3-kinase to enhanced abundance of GLUT4 in the cell membrane. Since GLUT4 translocation remains sensitive to insulin administration, the control by Q205L Gαi2 does not appear to operate as precisely as insulin does, although clearly insulinomimetic in nature. These observations provide a wealth of understanding of why the iQ205L mice are so tolerant of glucose loading. Other G proteins have been implicated in modulating insulin action and GLUT4 translocation, especially Gαq (26Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Artemyev N.O. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7167-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results were obtained from studies NIH 3T3-L1 cells in culture and add to the growing literature in which heterotrimeric G proteins and insulin signaling converge. The details of the signal linkage path from expression of Q205L Gαi2 and GLUT4 are not complete, but we provide some important features. The role of PI 3-kinase seems central, as PI 3-kinase activity has been reported to be essential for insulin signaling to GLUT4 (7Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We evaluated further the possible role of PI 3-kinase by the use of the inhibitor LY294002 to examine if inhibition of PI 3-kinase in adipocytes from iQ205L mice reverses the translocation of GLUT4, and it does not (not shown). In adipocytes, PI 3-kinase and Akt are activated constitutively by the expression of the Q205L mice, which according to the literature leads to GLUT4 translocation (10Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Calera M.R. Martinez C. Liu H. Jack A.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). How Q205L Gαi2 leads to the activation of PI 3-kinase remains unknown, although we have shown Gαi2 to be linked to the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (16Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Further studies will be directed at providing these additional pieces to the puzzle. Finally, it is important to address the limitation of studies targeting the expression of an activated G protein α subunit in vivo, namely adaptive changes. To address this concern we made use of LPA, a potent activator of Gαi2, and pertussis toxin, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Gαi2. In acutely prepared mouse adipocytes, LPA stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase, Akt activation, and GLUT4 translocation. Each of these responses to LPA was abolished by prior treatment with pertussis toxin. Based upon the data gleaned from the iQ205L mice in vivo and their adipocytes in vitro, a compelling case can be made for Gαi2modulating GLUT4 as well as insulin signaling."

Rate constants for the formation of the reduced CYP11A1·CO and CYP11B1·CO complexes by wild type adrenodoxin, the adrenodoxin mutants Adx-(4–108), Adx-(4–114), T54S, T54A, and S112W, and the double mutants Y82F/S112W, Y82L/S112W, and Y82S/S112W (the last four mutants are Δ113–128) are presented. The rate constants observed differ by a factor of up to 10 among the respective adrenodoxin mutants for CYP11A1 but not for CYP11B1. According to their apparent rate constants for CYP11A1, the adrenodoxin mutants can be grouped into a slow (wild type, T54A, and T54S) and a fast group (all the other mutants). The adrenodoxin mutants forming the most stable complexes with CYP11A1 show the fastest rates of reduction and the highest rate constants for cholesterol to pregnenolone conversion. This strong correlation suggests that C-terminal truncation of adrenodoxin in combination with the introduction of a C-terminal tryptophan residue enables a modified protein-protein interaction rendering the system almost as effective as the bacterial putidaredoxin/CYP101 system. Such a variation of the adrenodoxin structure resulted in a mutant protein (S112W) showing a 100-fold increased efficiency in conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone."

However, the cleavage of eIF4GI is unaffected by the inhibition of self-processing. Removal of the 18-amino acid C-terminal extension of Lpro slowed eIF4GI cleavage; replacement of the C-terminal extension by unrelated amino acid sequences further delayed this cleavage. Surprisingly, wild-type Lpro and the C-terminal variants all processed the polyprotein cleavage site in an intermolecular reaction at the same rate. However, when the polyprotein cleavage site was part of the same polypeptide chain as the wild-type Lbpro, the rate of processing was much more rapid.

Virally encoded proteinases are required not only to process viral protein precursors into the mature proteins but also to cleave host proteins to modulate the physiology of the infected cell (1Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Krausslich H.G. Wimmer E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A classic example is the inhibition of host protein synthesis from capped cellular mRNA that occurs during the replication of most picornaviruses (3Rueckert R. Fields B. Nkipe D. Howley P. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). These viruses mediate this through the cleavage of the two homologues of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4GI1 and eIF4GII) by either the Lpro of FMDV or by the 2A proteinase of human rhinoviruses, Coxsackie virus, and polioviruses (4Devaney M.A. Vakharia V.N.

A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the cleavage of the eIF4G homologues, the domain of eIF4G that binds the cap-binding protein eIF4E is severed from the domain of eIF4G which binds eIF3, so that the infected cell is unable to recruit its own capped mRNA to the 40 S ribosome (Fig.1 A (9Lamphear B.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4900-4997Crossref Google Scholar)). Translation of viral mRNA is unaffected as it initiates internally via an IRES (11Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jackson R. Howell M. Kaminski A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 477-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of the cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the picornaviral proteinases is still unresolved. As this cleavage occurs before measurable amounts of viral proteins can be detected in vivo (13Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the viral proteinases induce cleavage of the eIF4G homologues by activating an as yet unidentified cellular proteinase (5Kräusslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Toyoda H. Etchison D. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2711-2718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wyckoff E.E. Lloyd R.E. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2943-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This idea was supported by the inability to imitate in vitro the efficiency of eIF4GI cleavage using purified recombinant proteinases (15Bovee M.L. Marissen W.E. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Bovee M.L. Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Belsham G.J. McInerney G.M. Ross Smith N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that eIF4GI can be efficiently cleaved in RRLs by nascently translated proteinases at concentrations close to those calculatedin vivo (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Lpro of FMDV, which carries out the cleavage of the eIF4G homologues, is a papain-like cysteine proteinase (19Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); it is the first protein encoded on the FMDV polyprotein (Fig. 1, Band C). Lpro frees itself by cleavage between its own C terminus and the N terminus of VP4. As the initiation of protein synthesis on the FMDV RNA can occur at one of two AUG codons lying 84 nucleotides apart, two forms of the Lpro are synthesized (designated Labpro and Lbpro). The reason for this is not clear, as both forms appear to have the same enzymatic properties (21Medina M. Domingo E. Brangwyn J.K. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All work described here was carried out with the Lbpro form. Recognition and cleavage of the sites on the polyprotein and on the eIF4G homologues present a number of questions. Cleavage at the junction of Lbpro and VP4 occurs at Lys-Leu-Lys201-↓-Gly202-Ala-Gly, whereas that on eIF4GI takes place at the sequence Asn-Leu-Gly634-↓-Arg635-Thr-Thr (13Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of Lbpro cleavage on eIF4GII has not yet been determined, but it would appear by comparison to be between Asn-Phe-Gly685-↓-Arg686-Gln-Thr (22Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To achieve this unusual specificity, the Lbpro has evolved to be able to bind basic residues at P1 or P1′, while maintaining the requirement of papain-like enzymes for a hydrophobic residue at P2 (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,23Guarné A. Hampoelz B. Glaser W. Carpena X. Tormo J. Fita I. Skern T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the exact determinants of specificity are still not clear. A further open question is the mechanism of self-processing (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Medina M. Domingo E. Brangwyn J.K. Belsham G.J.

Virology. 1990; 176: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). X-ray structural data provided evidence for an intermolecular mechanism, as the CTE of one Lbpro molecule was bound by the active site of the neighboring molecule (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, modeling studies using this structure suggested that a CTE would be able to reach into the active site of the same molecule, hinting that an intramolecular reaction was possible. Finally, it is not known whether self-processing is a prerequisite for cleavage of the eIF4G homologues. In this paper, we examine these questions by expressing various mutants of Lbpro in RRLs and investigating the kinetics of cleavage of the polyprotein and eIF4GI. The plasmid pet8cFMDV Lbpro (encoding the mature Lbpro that consists of amino acids 29–201 of the FMDV polyprotein) contains the FMDV nucleotides 892–1413 of the FMDV O1k cDNA (25Forss S. Strebel K. Beck E. Schaller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6587-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) followed by two stop codons, cloned into the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites of the T7 polymerase expression vector pET8c (Novagen). The plasmid pet8cFMDV LbproVP4VP2 (encoding the mature Lbpro, all 85 amino acids of VP4 and 78 amino acids of VP2) contains the FMDV nucleotides 892–1896 followed by two stop codons similarly cloned into pet8c (13Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In pet8cFMDV LbproC51A VP4VP2, the active site cysteine 51 is replaced by an alanine. The plasmid pet8c ΔLbproVP was constructed by using PCR amplification to delete the amino acids 30–75 of Lbpro in pet8cFMDV LbproVP4VP2 to give pet8cFMDV ΔLbproVP4VP2. To introduce a fragment extending the number of VP2 amino acids encoded to 140, the required fragment was amplified from the original FMDV cDNA subclone p735 (25Forss S. Strebel K. Beck E. Schaller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6587-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Two stop codons followed by a BamHI site were also encoded by the 3′ PCR primer. This sequence was then introduced into pet8cFMDV ΔLbproVP4VP2 as an RsrII BamHI fragment to give pet8c ΔLbproVP. Following linearization with BamHI, transcription of this DNA gives an RNA encoding an inactive Lpro lacking 46 amino acids at the N terminus followed by all 85 amino acids of VP4 and 140 amino acids of VP2. To construct pCITE LbproVP4VP2, the LbproVP4VP2 expression block was excised from pet8cFMDV LbproVP4VP2 using the XbaI site of pET8c and the BamHI site at the 3′ end of the expression block and subcloned into pBluescript. The LbproVP4VP2 was then introduced as an NcoIPstI fragment into pCITE1 which had been cleaved byNcoI and PstI. In this construction, translation initiates at an AUG codon three codons upstream from the first Lbpro codon. On linearization with SalI and transcription with T7 polymerase, an RNA is produced containing the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES which subsequently encodes the Lbpro with three extra amino acids at the N terminus, all 85 amino acids of VP4 and 23 amino acids of VP2. Restriction sites forBpu10I and SacI were introduced into pCITE LbproVP4VP2 at the positions indicated in Fig.2 A using standard methods of PCR mutagenesis; the mutations do not change the amino acid sequence. Replacement of the 38-base pair Bpu10I SacI fragment with synthetic oligonucleotides enables the amino acid substitutions indicated in Table I to be introduced at the Lpro VP4 junction. Lbpro C-terminal variants were generated in pet8cLbpro by replacing the 47-base pair C-terminal BsiWI BamHI fragment with the required synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (23Guarné A. Hampoelz B. Glaser W. Carpena X. Tormo J. Fita I. Skern T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Plasmids were linearized with the indicated restriction enzyme and transcribed as described (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro translation reactions (typically 50 μl) contained 70% RRL (Promega), 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, American Research Company), and amino acids (except methionine) at 20 μm. After preincubation for 2 min at 30 °C, translation was started by addition of RNA. RNA concentrations (typically about 10 ng/μl) were adjusted so that the Lbpro concentration reached between 15 and 20 pg/μl after 8 min of incubation, unless otherwise stated. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at the designated time points, and the reaction was stopped by immediate transfer to ice and the addition of unlabeled methionine and cysteine to a final concentration of 2 mm and Laemmli sample buffer. The PAGE system of Dasso and Jackson (26Dasso M.C. Jackson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6485-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used for separation of translation products (gels contained 15% acrylamide) and for monitoring the state of eIF4GI (gels contained 6% acrylamide). Translation products were detected by fluorography; the state of eIF4GI was determined by immunoblotting using the anti-eIF4GI peptide 7 antiserum (27Yan R.Q. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quantification of protein synthesis using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard) was as described previously, except that calculations were adjusted for the use of [35S]methionine alone (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, radioactivity in a particular band in the dried polyacrylamide gel was counted. By taking into account the counting efficiency (0.8%), the specific activity of the methionine in the assay (163 dpm/fmol), the number of methionines in Lbpro, and the molecular weight of Lbpro (19.8 kDa), the amount of protein present in a particular band can be estimated. To investigate whether self-processing of the Lbpro from the growing polypeptide chain was a prerequisite for the cleavage of eIF4GI, it was necessary to produce mutant enzymes that could not process themselves from the growing polypeptide chain but that still possessed an intact active site and a correctly folded structure. Therefore, we introduced specific mutations into the cleavage site between Lbproand VP4VP2. To simplify this, we noted that restriction sites forBpu10I and SacI could be introduced before and after the site of Lbpro cleavage without affecting the amino acid sequence (Fig. 2 A). However, the previously employed transcription vector pet8c also contained a Bpu10I site, making it necessary to move the LbproVP4VP2 expression cassette into pCITE1 which has itself no restriction sites for Bpu10I and SacI. The ensuing plasmid was designated pCITE LbproVP4VP2 (Fig. 2 A). To examine Lbpro self-processing and eIF4GI cleavage using pCITE LbproVP4VP2, a standard translation reaction was performed (Fig. 2, B and C, left panels). The cleavage products Lbpro and VP4VP2 are visible on this fluorogram after 8 min. Lbpro encoded by pCITE LbproVP4VP2 has four methionines, whereas VP4VP2 has only two; thus, the intensity of the Lbpro band is about twice that of VP4VP2. The high efficiency of self-processing is indicated by the low amount of the uncleaved precursor (LbproVP4VP2). Table I shows the extent of self-processing at 12 min. The cleavage of the endogenous eIF4GI in the RRL under these conditions occurs rapidly (Fig. 2 C, left panel); 50% cleavage was observed between 4 and 8 min. The concentration of Lbpro at 8 min was determined to be 15 pg/μl by counting the band in the Instant Imager. These results are almost identical to those previously reported, using pet8c LbproVP4VP2 driven from an uncapped RNA that did not contain an IRES (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mutations indicated in Table I were then introduced at the Lbpro VP4 cleavage site using synthetic oligonucleotides. First, the P1 lysine was replaced by glutamine (LbproVP4VP2(K201Q)), as the Lbprothree-dimensional structure (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) had revealed that the P1 lysine residue is bound within a deep groove consisting of three glutamate residues. Their aliphatic side chains bind the lysine side chain, whereas the amino group of the lysine interacts with the carboxyl groups of the glutamates. We reasoned that the uncharged glutamine residue would lack the electrostatic interaction and that the shorter side chain would further cause the amide group to clash with the glutamate side chains. Indeed, the pattern of proteins synthesized from this RNA is different from that of the wild-type RNA (Fig. 2 B, middle panel). After 12 min, self-processing drops from over 85% in the wild-type to 37.5% in the mutant protein (Table I). Thus, although the self-processing reaction of Lbpro is impaired by this mutation, it is not completely inhibited. The activity of this mutant protein on the cleavage of endogenous eIF4GI in the RRL was then examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). In contrast to the effect on self-processing, no effect on the processing of eIF4GI was observed. Reduction of the amount of RNA in the RRL also failed to reveal any differences in the rate of eIF4GI processing between the wild-type and the mutant protein (data not shown). As the K201Q mutant protein still possessed some self-processing activity, we wished to examine whether a complete inhibition of self-processing would eliminate the mature Lbpro from the reaction and thus affect the kinetics of eIF4GI processing. Therefore, we substituted the P2 leucine with serine in addition to the P1 lysine to glutamine substitution; the encoded mutant protein was designated LbproVP4VP2(L200S,K201Q). As both the Lbpro and eIF4GI cleavage sites have leucine at the P2 position (13Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Lbpro structure shows a deep hydrophobic pocket for the binding of the P2 residue, we reasoned that a P2 serine residue would not be accepted and that its presence in addition to the P1 mutation would inhibit any self-processing activity. Fig. 2 B(right panel) shows that this is indeed the case. After 12 min, only the uncleaved product was visible. Remarkably, however, no effect on the cleavage of eIF4GI was observed (Fig. 2 C, right panel); the kinetics of cleavage are almost identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. The above changes in the amino acid sequence at the cleavage junction clearly affected the self-processing reaction but not the cleavage of eIF4GI by Lbpro. To produce a second mutant protein that was handicapped in self-processing, we chose to replace the P1 lysine with glycine (LbproVP4VP2(K201G); Table I) and then examined the effect on eIF4GI cleavage. Fig.3 A (compare leftand center panels) shows that the absence of a basic group before the scissile bond reduced self-processing to about the level seen with the K201Q mutant protein (Table I). Once again, however, no reduction in the activity of the Lbpro on eIF4GI was observed (Fig. 3 B, left and center panels). Finally, to confirm the hypothesis that the presence of a basic residue at either P1 or P1′ was sufficient to allow cleavage by the Lbpro, we used the oligonucleotide cassette to introduce an arginine residue into the K201G mutant protein at the P1′ position (i.e. to replace residue glycine 1 of VP4 with arginine) to give the mutant protein LbproVP4VP2(K201G, G202R) (Table I). As can be seen in Fig. 3 A (right panel), the presence of P1′ arginine in the K201G,G202R mutant protein restored the cleavage to almost wild-type levels (compare Fig.3 A, left and right panels and Table I). Once again, no effect on the cleavage of eIF4GI could be observed (Fig.3 B, right panel). It might be argued that the enzyme is recognizing the newly introduced Arg202 as the P1 residue, with cleavage occurring between Arg202 and Ala203. However, we believe this to be unlikely as this would imply that Leu200 would be the P3 residue and Gly201 the P2 residue. As the three-dimensional structure of Lbpro shows that a basic residue is preferred at P3 and a hydrophobic residue at P2, it is improbable that leucine and glycine could provide sufficient binding energy at these positions. In summary, these results support the predictions of the three-dimensional structure about the substrate specificity of Lbpro and demonstrate clearly that Lbpro which is still covalently connected to the capsid proteins can efficiently cleave eIF4GI. Thus, self-processing of the Lbpro is not a prerequisite for the efficient cleavage of eIF4GI. The above experiments confirmed the high efficiency of eIF4GI cleavage in RRLs by Lbpro, regardless of whether self-processing had occurred or not. What are the features of the Lbpro that enable it to cleave eIF4GI so efficiently? One unique feature of Lbpro, which is not found in papain, is the presence of the 18-amino acid CTE in Lbpro. We wished to examine whether this feature was involved in some way in eIF4GI cleavage. To investigate this, we used a second construction pet8cLbpro that contains a synthetic stop codon after the Lys201 residue, so that a mature Lbpro is expressed without the need for self-processing (Fig.4 A). The kinetics of eIF4GI cleavage are the same as those with pet8c LbproVP4VP2 (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletions were introduced into pet8cLbpro by replacing the wild-type BsiWI BamHI fragment with synthetic oligonucleotides. Initially, two deletions in Lbpro were made; the first (designated Lbpro-6; Table II) lacked the six most C-terminal amino acids, i.e. just those which had been found in the active site of the neighboring molecule in the crystal structure. In the second (Lbpro-18), the entire 18 amino acids of the CTE were removed. RNAs were prepared from both deletion mutants and were used to drive protein synthesis in RRLs; synthesis of Lbpro (Fig. 4 B) and cleavage of eIF4GI (Fig. 4 C) were analyzed as before. The mutant protein Lbpro-6 cleaved eIF4GI with kinetics similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, B and C, left andmiddle panels); however, the mutant protein Lbpro-18 had a reduced ability to cleave eIF4GI, cleavage was still incomplete after 12 min (Fig. 4, B andC, left and right panels). This was despite the fact that about twice as much Lbpro-18 had been synthesized than in the wild-type reaction.Table IIAmino acid sequence of the wild-type Lbpro, CTE, and deletion mutantsCTELbpro179VFVPYDQEPL NGEWKAKVQR KLK201Lbpro− 6179VFVPYDQEPL NGEWKAK195Lbpro− 18179VFVPY183Lbpro− 11*179VFVPFNASSN DK191Lbpro+ 9*179VFVPFNASSN DKDPAANKAR KEAELAAATA EQ210Underlined sequences are identical. The start of the CTE in the wild-type sequence is at Tyr183. Open table in a new tab Underlined sequences are identical. The start of the CTE in the wild-type sequence is at Tyr183. Fig. 4 B shows that the deletion Lbpro-6 migrates more slowly than the wild-type Lbpro. This is reminiscent of an observation of Sangar et al. (28Sangar D.V. Clark R.P. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Clarke B.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that prolonged incubation (i.e. longer than 1 h) of Lbpro in RRLs led to a modification of the protein which caused it to migrate more slowly on SDS-PAGE. This modified form appeared to be deleted at its C terminus because it could also be generated by carboxypeptidase A digestion (28Sangar D.V. Clark R.P. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Clarke B.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of a small number of amino acids decreases the mobility of Lbproon SDS-PAGE. We believe that the missing 6 amino acids of the Lbpro-6 deletion are responsible for the reduced mobility of this protein. The above experiment suggested that the presence of the CTE was required for full enzymatic activity. This notion was further strengthened by a serendipitous observation made during the synthesis of the above deletion mutants. A variant plasmid was obtained in which an incorrect, truncated oligonucleotide was inserted between theBsiWI site and the BamHI site at the 3′ end of the Lbpro (Fig. 4 A and Table II). As a consequence, the reading frame is shifted from amino acid 183 onwards and there are only 8 amino acids before the BamHI site. Thus, translation of an RNA transcribed from a template linearized withBamHI produces a variant encoding a C-terminal extension of 8 amino acids, all differing from the wild-type (Table II). This variant was designated Lbpro − 11*, as it lacks 11 amino acids compared with the wild-type Lbpro; the asterisk indicates the aberrant amino acid sequence of the CTE. In addition, RNA encoding a second variant was produced by linearizing the same plasmid with HindIII, which cleaves 481 nucleotides downstream of the BamHI site; due to the position of the first stop codon encountered, the CTE in this case has 28 amino acids, 9 longer than the wild-type. Once again, they are of different sequence (Table II), so that the variant was designated Lbpro + 9*. Although the mutant sequences have a relatively high alanine content and are somewhat hydrophobic, they are not otherwise unusual. Nevertheless, examination of these variants in the RRL system (Fig.5) showed that both Lbpro − 11* and Lbpro + 9* had an impaired ability to cleave eIF4GI. With the Lbpro − 11* variant, about 90% eIF4GI cleavage is observed after 30 min of incubation, even though after 4 and 8 min similar protein concentrations to those of the wild-type experiment shown in Fig. 4 B are present. Processing with the variant Lbpro + 9* (Fig. 5, right panels) was reduced even more dramatically, as 50% eIF4GI cleavage did not occur until 30 min after cleavage, even though the RNA concentration had been adjusted to ensure that twice the amount of protein was synthesized in this experiment compared with the wild-type Lbpro in Fig.4. In the above experiments, the activity of the Lbpro C-terminal variants was monitored only on the endogenous eIF4GI present in the RRL extract. We wished to investigate whether these variants were also impaired in their ability to recognize the polyprotein cleavage site. To generate a suitable substrate, the construction ΔLbproVP was prepared (Fig. 6 A). Following linearization with BamHI, transcription generates an RNA encoding an inactive Lbpro with a 46-amino acid deletion, all 85 amino acids of VP4, and 140 amino acids of VP2. The deletion in the Lbpro part and the extension of the VP2 part make the cleavage products of LbproVP4VP2 and ΔLbproVP distinguishable from each other on PAGE. The protein produced in RRL from the pet8cΔLbproVP construction is of apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa (Fig.6 B, far right lane) and is proteolytically inactive (Fig. 6,B and C, far right lanes). The ability of ΔLbproVP to serve as substrate was examined by simultaneously translating its RNA with the pet8cLbpro RNA (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Initially, after 8 min of incubation, two products of translation were observed, the mature Lbproand the uncleaved substrate ΔLbproVP (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Subsequently, a third product of apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa becomes visible, representing the VP part of the substrate following cleavage at the junction between ΔLbpro and VP. 50% cleavage of ΔLbproVP is achieved between 15 and 30 min. Eventually, all ΔLbproVP is converted to product, as sufficient proteinase is presumably present to cleave rapidly any newly synthesized substrate so that it is no longer observed. The ΔLbpro part of the substrate has a molecular mass of 14.2 kDa; despite this, however, it is not resolved by this gel system. Cleavage of eIF4GI also takes place under these conditions. Examination of the fate of the eIF4GI in the RRLs shows that over 50% is cleaved using Lbpro before 8 min (Fig. 6 C, left panel; Table III); this is comparable with the experiments in which only one RNA was translated. The Lbproconcentration was estimated to be about 20 pg/μl by counting the band. This agrees with previous observations in which 50% cleavage of eIF4GI was achieved when the Lbpro concentration had reached 15 pg/μl (18Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table IIIComparison of cleavage efficiency of wild-type Lbpro and its C-terminal deletionsTime at 50% elF4GIProteinase concn at 50% elF4GI cleavageminpg/μlLbpro<8<20LbproVP4VP2<8<25Lbpro− 188–1520–52Lbpro + 9*4575Data were calculated from Fig. 6, B and C, except for LbproVP4VP2 which was taken from Fig.7. Open table in a new tab Data were calculated from Fig. 6, B and C, except for LbproVP4VP2 which was taken from Fig.7. This experiment was then repeated using mRNAs encoding Lbpro − 18 and Lbpro + 9*. The kinetics of cleavage of ΔLbproVP by these two variants are very similar to those of the wild type (Fig. 6 B, compare themiddle and right panel with the left one; Table III), indicating that the absence of the CTE or the presence of an aberrant one do not affect the ability of the variants to process the polyprotein substrate in an intermolecular reaction. In contrast, cleavage of eIF4GI by the C-terminal variants was once again delayed (Fig. 6 C, middle and right panels; TableIII). For the variant lacking the CTE, Lbpro − 18, 50% cleavage was achieved between 8 and 15 min at a proteinase concentration between 20 and 52 pg/μl; with the variant with the aberrant C terminus, Lbpro + 9*, 50% cleavage was obtained after about 45 min at a concentration of 75 pg/μl. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, Lbpro can only be cleaving ΔLbproVP and eIF4GI intermolecularly. It has been a long-standing question, however, as to whether the initial cleavage of the Lbpro from the growing polyprotein (i.e. from LbproVP4VP2) is also an intra- or an intermolecular event (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Medina M. Domingo E. Brangwyn J.K. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Belsham G.J. Brangwyn J.K. Ryan M.D. Abrams C.C. King A.M.Q. Virology. 1990; 176: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate this, we translated the ΔLbproVP RNA together with that of LbproVP4VP2 to see whether the cleavage kinetics of ΔLbproVP or eIF4GI were changed (Fig.7). This can be achieved because, as stated above, all the cleavage products from LbproVP4VP2 and ΔLbproVP can be separated from one another by SDS-PAGE. The result is shown in Fig. 7 A. Four products are visible during the time course. These are the uncleaved ΔLbproVP (46 kDa) and the VP cleavage products (34 kDa) (the 14.2-kDa ΔLbpro cleavage product is once again not resolved) as well as the mature Lbpro (19.8 kDa) and the VP4VP2 (15 kDa) cleavage product. However, the uncleaved protein LbproVP4VP2 is not a major product of the reaction; the uncleaved precursor is essentially only visible with the inactive leader proteinase mutant LbproC51A VP4VP2 (Fig. 7 A, far right lane). Therefore, the processing of the Lbpro from the growing LbproVP4VP2 polypeptide chain must be extremely efficient, strongly implying that this reaction is an intramolecular one. The processing of the endogenous eIF4GI by Lbpro expressed as LbproVP4VP2 is comparable with that observed when the Lbpro is translated as a mature protein (compare Fig.6 C with Fig. 7 B). The cleavage of ΔLbproVP with Lbpro expressed from LbproVP4VP2 is also comparable to that with Lbpro (compare Fig. 6 B with Fig. 7 A) and is therefore not delayed by self-processing. Furthermore, the self-processing of LbproVP4VP2 occurs much more efficiently than the cleavage of ΔLbproVP, even though the sequence of the cleavage site is the same. This strongly implies that Lbpro frees itself from the growing polypeptide chain by an intramolecular cleavage. In summary, the reactions in order of efficiency catalyzed by the Lbpro are the intramolecular processing at the Lbpro VP4 junction and the cleavage of eIF4GI as part of the eIF4F complex followed by the much less efficient intermolecular cleavage at the Lbpro VP4 junction. The experiments described here examine the relationship of the self-processing reaction of the FMDV Lbpro to the cleavage of the cellular substrate eIF4GI. By using mutagenesis to vary the cleavage site at the Lbpro VP4 junction and to produce C-terminal variants, factors affecting the rate of both reactions could be ascertained. As the polyprotein and eIF4GI substrates examined are those that are cleaved during replication of the virus in vivo, these findings are directly relevant to the biological activity of the Lbpro. We began by investigating whether the inhibition of self-processing affected the rate of eIF4GI cleavage. For this, we mutated the Lbpro to prevent self-processing without affecting either the catalytic residues or the structure of the enzyme. Initially, mutations were introduced at the P1 position (Table I). The substitution of the P1 lysine with either glycine or glutamine impaired self-processing but did not inhibit it completely. Replacement of the P1′ glycine with arginine (thus mimicking the P1′ residue in the eIF4GI cleavage site) in the mutant protein containing glycine at P1 restored self-processing to wild-type levels, thus confirming the unusual requirement of this enzyme for a basic residue at either the P1 or P1′ positions. Complete inhibition of the self-processing reaction was obtained by the introduction of a second mutation, namely leucine to serine at P2, in the P1 lysine to glutamine mutant protein. This stresses the importance of the presence of a hydrophobic residue at P2, a property that Lbpro shares with most other papain-like enzymes (30Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In all of the above self-processing mutant proteins, however, a reduction in the rate or extent of eIF4GI cleavage was not observed. Thus, cleavage at the Lbpro VP4 junction is not an essential prerequisite for cleavage of eIF4GI. This implies that the enzyme is active as part of the growing polypeptide chain and that it may be active while the polypeptide chain is still bound to the ribosome. Why is the cleavage of eIF4GI so efficient, despite the lack of self-processing? To begin, it can be assumed that the substrate eIF4GI is in the optimal conformation, as the binding of eIF4E to eIF4GI stimulates Lbpro cleavage of eIF4GI (31Ohlmann T. Pain V.M. Wood W. Rau M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and most of the eIF4GI in RRLs is complexed to eIF4E (29Rau M. Ohlmann T. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8983-8990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the enzyme, the C-terminal deletion experiments indicate a role for the C terminus. Thus, the mutant protein lacking the entire CTE cleaved eIF4GI at a significantly reduced rate; however, a much more drastic reduction in the reaction rate could be seen with the variants possessing an aberrant CTE. Nevertheless, all C-terminal variants recognized the Lbpro VP4 cleavage site in the intermolecular cleavage at the same rate. Thus, the CTE is required for efficient intermolecular cleavage of eIF4GI but not for that on the polyprotein substrate. Three explanations for this observation appear plausible. First, the C terminus may be involved in a direct interaction with eIF4GI, perhaps fitting specifically into a pocket, or even eIF4E; removal of the CTE would prevent this interaction. However, it is not clear from this theory why the presence of aberrant CTEs would have a further effect on eIF4GI processing than the variants lacking a CTE. Second, the CTE could stabilize the Lbpro in a conformation that favors eIF4GI cleavage but that is not required for intermolecular polyprotein processing. The lack of the CTE would obviate the stabilizing effect; however, the presence of the aberrant CTE might destabilize this conformation or even prevent it from being adopted. The third possibility would require that binding of the Lbpro CTE to eIF4GI induces a conformational change in this protein that exposes the cleavage site. In this case, proteolysis would be the rate-limiting step; in the CTE deletion mutants, the rate-limiting step would be the exposure of the active site in the absence of the CTE. It is interesting to note that, compared with papain, the Lbpro achieves its active conformation without a pro-domain and without activation at low pH (32Turk B. Turk V. Turk D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 141-150PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed the experiments with the CTE variants appear to suggest a much more important role for the C terminus, a region of Lbpro that has no equivalent in papain (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Finally, cleavage reactions of the Lbpro on intra- and intermolecular polyprotein substrates were examined simultaneously. Thus, RNAs were translated so that the rate at which both intra- and intermolecular self-processing occurred could be measured (Fig. 7). These experiments were compared with one in which intramolecular self-processing was not required because the Lbprocontained a stop codon at its C terminus (Fig. 6). No difference in the rates of cleavage of eIF4GI or the polyprotein intermolecular substrate were observed. In contrast, the kinetics of cleavage of the Lbpro VP4 junction were different, depending on whether the enzyme and substrate were part of the same polypeptide chain or not. The cleavage of the substrate when part of the same chain was much more rapid, suggesting that this reaction is an intramolecular one, with the C terminus of Lbpro folding into the active site of the same molecule, as proposed by modeling studies based on the crystal structure (20Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This also implies that the ΔLbproVP substrate adopts a conformation competent for the intramolecular reaction and must unfold so that it can be processed intrans. In summary, we have shown that self-processing is not a prerequisite for cleavage of eIFGI by Lbpro and have established the hierarchy of the Lbpro cleavage reactions. The first two are the extremely efficient intramolecular self-processing and the intermolecular cleavage of eIF4GI followed by the much less efficient intermolecular cleavage of the polyprotein sequence.

About 50% of these proteins are encoded by the chloroplast genome, whereas the other half is encoded by the nuclear genome and is post-translationally imported into the chloroplast. To fulfill their function, the proteins have to be targeted to the thylakoid membrane and assembled into the respective multisubunit complexes. The cytochrome b6f complex (Cytb6f)1 has 9 different subunits and several cofactors (1Choquet Y. Vallon O. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 615-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Hamel P.

These experiments gave rise to the important conclusion that accumulation of the Cytb6f subunits is an assembly-mediated process (3Wollman F.-A. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer, Dordrecht1998: 459-476Google Scholar). Pulse-labeling experiments show that pCytf, in the absence of its assembly partners Cytb6 or subunit IV, was synthesized at only 10% of its rate in the wild-type strain (4Kuras R. Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An increased synthesis rate of pCytf was observed in strains lacking the C-terminal anchor, suggesting that the unassembled stromal C-terminal domain controlled the rate of pCytf translation by a negative feedback mechanism (5Kuras R. Wollman F.A. Joliot P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7468-7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The target for this autoregulation was postulated to be the 5′-untranslated leader (5′-UTL) of petA since assembly-dependent control of pCytf was lost when the petA promoter and the 5′-UTL were replaced by those of the atpA gene (6Choquet Y.

Cytf is a chloroplast-encoded protein bearing a classical N-terminal cleavable signal peptide (SP). The ATPase subunits CFOI and CFOIV also undergo N-terminal processing after insertion into the thylakoid membrane; however, those sequences do not resemble canonic luminal targeting sequences and the physiological relevance of this cleavage for CFO biogenesis remains unclear (7Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nechushtai R. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1411: 21-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After translocation of the pCytf N terminus, the SP is processed, and most of the mature protein is located on the luminal side of the thylakoid membrane. The apoform of the protein is converted to the holoform by covalent binding of the c-heme in the thylakoid lumen. Processing and heme ligation can occur independently (8Howe G. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5824-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As chloroplasts are of prokaryotic origin, the chloroplast transcriptional and translational machinery, as well as most proteins involved in protein targeting, insertion, and translocation show sequence and functional homologies to bacterial proteins. It has been shown previously that the leucine-rich signal peptide of pCytf can replace bacterial presequences conferring Sec-route specificity (9Rothstein S.J. Gatenby A.A. Willey D.L. Gray J.C.

Genetic studies with the maize transposon mutant tha1, disrupted in the cpsecAgene, show that cpSecA is involved in pCytf membrane insertion, as well as in the post-translational translocation of the nuclear-encoded 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex and plastocyanin (11Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Voelker R. Mendel-Hartvig J. Barkan A. Genetics. 1997; 145: 467-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However these in vivo studies do not address the mechanisms of interaction between precursor proteins and cpSecA. Several polytopic chloroplast-encoded proteins, such as D1, D2, CP43, and CP47, are inserted co-translationally (7Wollman F.A. Minai L. Nechushtai R.

However, based on transcript localization, the integral membrane proteins CFOIII (with 2 putative TMs), subunit IV of the Cytb6f complex (with 3 putative TMs), and the two monotopic Cytb-559 subunits are likely to be synthesized on free ribosomes (15Friemann A. Hachtel W. Planta. 1988; 175: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of pCytf, it has been shown thatpetA transcripts are localized at the thylakoid surface (15Friemann A. Hachtel W. Planta. 1988; 175: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting co-translational targeting and insertion. Conflicting reports exist on the translation localization of several soluble stromal proteins. Translation of the large subunit of Rubisco has been reported to take place predominantly on free ribosomes (16Minami E. Watanabe A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Ellis R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. 1986; 244: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) observed synthesis on thylakoid membrane-bound ribosomes. This indicates that thylakoid-bound ribosomes do not necessarily translate integral membrane proteins and that free soluble ribosomes can possibly be engaged in the synthesis of bitopic and even polytopic thylakoid membrane proteins. It is thus important to devise an experimental system to address the relationship between targeting, assembly, and translation of the chloroplast-encoded membrane proteins. In this study we have addressed the requirements of targeting and insertion of pCytf using a chloroplast initiation/translation system in which plasmid-derived transcripts can be faithfully translated (20Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Houben E. de Gier J.W. van Wijk K.J.

We show that an internally truncated form of pCytf is inserted in strict dependence of cpSecA, as well as a functional signal peptide. Importantly, the interaction between cpSecA and the signal peptide required the presence of thylakoid membranes, indicating that cpSecA functions at the membrane surface rather than as a soluble protein in the stroma. The results presented here show the first in vitro reconstitution of co-translational targeting and insertion of a chloroplast-encoded protein. Pea plants (Pisum sativum L. var. de Grace) were grown for 6 to 8 days in a growth chamber with 12 h of artificial light per day. Intact thylakoids were isolated and further prepared for protein targeting essays as described in Ref. 21Houben E. de Gier J.W. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. The isolation of chloroplast translation extracts from pea chloroplasts was principally carried out as described in Ref. 20Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar with the modifications described in Ref. 21Houben E. de Gier J.W. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. Plastid DNA was isolated according to Ref. 23Lui J.-W. Rose R.J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 11: 48-53Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar. The petA gene was amplified with an 88 base pair 5′-UTL by polymerase chain reaction with the forward primer 5′- GGGGGGAAGCTTGAATACGAGTAAATAGCAGAATCATGGATA- GGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCGCGTCTAGACTAAAAATTCATTTCGGACAATTGAACCTTCTC-3′ using pea plastid DNA as a template. After restriction withHindIII/XbaI, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated in pBluescript SKII (Stratagene) under the control of the T7 promoter, resulting in pBSKpetA. All modifications detailed below were carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The point mutation pCytf-L21E/I26E was introduced in two rounds with the forward primer 5′-CGATCTATTTCCGTAGAGCTCATGATCTAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATAGATCATGAGCTCTACGGAAATAGATCG-3′ and with pBSKpetA as a template, resulting in pCytf-L21E. This clone was used as a template for PCR with the forward primer 5′-CTCATGATCTATGAAATAACTCGAGCACCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGTGCTCGAGTTATTTCATAGATCATGAG-3′ to obtain pCytf-L21E/I26E. pCytΔf was obtained with the forward primer 5′-GGGGGGCCCATATGGTCCAAGGTCTCTTGCTCTTCTTGGCAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGGGGGGCATATGCATATCATAAGGAATTCGAACAACTGCTTC-3′ and pBSKpetA as a template. This introduced an NdeI site encoding for histidine and methionine, between amino acids 90 and 286. Constructs pCytΔf-S33V and pCytΔf-A35V were obtained using the forward primer 5′-CGAGCACCCATTGTAAATGCATATCCCATT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AATGGGATATGCATTTACAATGGGTGCTCG-3′ or the forward primer 5′-CCCATTTCAAATGTATATCCCATTTTTGCC-3′and the reverse primer 5′-GGCAAAAATGGGATATACATTTGAAATGGG-3′, respectively, with pBSKpetAΔ as a template. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA templates and mRNAs were purified as described in Ref. 22Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. The different pCytf constructs were translated from purified transcripts in the chloroplast translation system for 25–30 min at 28 °C. Targeting assays were performed in the light (50 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) for 25–30 min at 28 °C in the presence of nuclease-treated thylakoid membranes from pea at 200 μg of chlorophyll/ml, principally as described in Ref. 21Houben E. de Gier J.W. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. After targeting, thylakoids were collected by centrifugation (2 min at 10,000 × g) and resuspended in 500 mm KOAc in HMM buffer (21Houben E. de Gier J.W. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1553-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) unless stated differently. Trypsin treatment (10 μg/ml) was done for 20 min on ice with 200 μg of chlorophyll/ml in HMM buffer and stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration). Ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) were isolated on 500-μl sucrose cushions, and cross-linking using bismaleimidohexane (BMH) orm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (S-MBS) and immunoprecipitations of cross-linked products were carried out as described earlier (22Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). During the course of this work we noticed that the amount of translation product and the accumulation of intermediate products showed some variation, depending on the 30 S preparation; this most likely reflects different levels of nuclease and protease activities as was clearly shown in Ref. 20Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar. Proteins were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE (7–17% acrylamide) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar) or linear tricine gels (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10497) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Fuji). Western blotting and chemiluminescence (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma) was done according to standard protocols. In Western blotting experiments for quantification, we verified that the antibody response was linearly related to the antigen concentration. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined spectroscopically in 80% acetone according to Ref. 26Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4734) Google Scholar. Northern blot and primer extension analysis showed thatpetA is co-transcribed withtrnQ-zfpA-psaI-YCF10-petA. This transcript is further processed leading to a monocistronic transcript for petA of 1.5 kilobases with a 5′-UTL of ∼90 bases (27Willey D.L. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Nagano Y. Matsuno R. Sasaki Y. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To obtain expression of pCytf in the homologous chloroplast translation system, we used monocistronic transcripts of pCytf with 5′-UTLs of 88 bases since the 5′-UTL has clearly been shown to be involved in feedback regulation. This shorter transcript starts 30-base pairs upstream of the ribosome binding site. A transcript with a longer 5′-UTL of 203 bases, which begins directly downstream of the ycf10 stop codon, gave lower translation rates in the translation system (not shown). We have thus used the physiologically correct 5′-UTL for all our experiments. To identify chloroplast components that interact with nascent chains of pCytf, stable RNCs were generated by translation of truncated pCytftranscripts of 96 and 134 amino acids without the stop codon (assigned pCytf96 and pCytf134, respectively; see Fig.1). These stable RNCs were purified and incubated with the homobifunctional cysteine cross-linker BMH or the heterobifunctional cysteine-lysine cross-linker S-MBS. These cross-linkers were selected because the N terminus of pCytfcontains 2 cysteines (at positions 56 and 59) and multiple lysine residues. For both translation products, a cross-linked product of ∼120 kDa appeared after incubation with S-MBS (Fig.2, A and B). This band was only very weakly visible after cross-linking with BMH. The cross-linked product was precipitated with cpSecA-specific antiserum (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoprecipitations with cpSRP54-specific antiserum (Fig.2 B) did not reveal any cross-linked products.Figure 2pCytf interacts with cpSecA. Truncated pCytf nascent chains of 96 and 134 amino acids were synthesized in the chloroplast translation system and stable RNCs were isolated. The RNCs were resuspended and incubated without or with S-MBS or BMH as indicated. The cross-linkers were quenched, and proteins were denatured in SDS and used for immunoprecipitations where indicated. Radiolabeled products were separated on tricine gels and exposed to phosphorimager screens. Molecular masses are indicated.

Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) contained thylakoids at a concentration of less than 1 ng of chlorophyll/μl, as indicated by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antisera against integral PSI core proteins and cpSecY (Fig.3 A). cpSecA is present in the chloroplast as a soluble protein, as well as a peripheral thylakoid membrane protein (10Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but it is unknown if cpSecA can interact with its substrates as a soluble protein. We therefore investigated if the observed interaction of cpSecA with pCytf is membrane-dependent. Thylakoid membranes were removed from the translation extracts by additional centrifugation at different velocities prior to translation. At 20,000 rpm, thylakoid membranes accumulated as a green pellet, and the remaining supernatant was colorless. Western blot analysis of the pellet and an aliquot of the supernatant showed that the thylakoid membranes completely sedimented during this centrifugation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast at least 75% of cpSecA and more than 95% of the 70 S ribosomes remained soluble in the supernatant after centrifugation (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, the centrifugation at 20,000 rpm did not significantly affect the synthesis of pCytf96 and other constructs, indicating that translation of pCytf in vitro does not require thylakoid membranes (Fig. 3 B). Centrifugation of longer duration or with higher g values led to a much lower yield of translation products (Fig. 3 B) due to proportional sedimentation of ribosomes as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). To show the membrane independence of pCytf translation in a different way, translations were carried out in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100. Concentrations of Triton X-100 up to 0.5% had no influence on the translation efficiency of pCytΔf, as can be seen in Fig. 3 B. Translations with pCytf96 were performed in the greenish and colorless stromal extract spun at 20,000 rpm. RNCs were then isolated and incubated with S-MBS, followed by immunoprecipitation with cpSecA antiserum. A cross-linked product of ∼120–125 kDa was observed when translations were carried out in the green membrane-containing extracts, and this product could be precipitated with cpSecA antiserum (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand, only very low amounts (20–50-fold reduction) of cross-linked cpSecA were detected when translating in the thylakoid membrane free stromal extract. These results show that a stable interaction of pCytf and cpSecA requires the presence of thylakoid membranes. pCytf has a classical N-terminal SP with a central hydrophobic core (Fig. 1). We therefore examined if the interaction of cpSecA with nascent chains of pCytf in the translation system was dependent on a functional SP (see Fig. 1). The hydrophobic core of the SP was disrupted by replacing isoleucine at position 21 and leucine at position 26 with two charged glutamic acid residues, leading to pCytf-L21E/I26E (see Fig. 1). Truncated 96-amino acid nascent chains of pCytf and pCytf-L21E/I26E were then synthesized and stable RNCs were isolated, incubated with S-MBS, and immunoprecipitated with cpSecA-specific antiserum. As shown in Fig.4, the interaction between pCytf and cpSecA did absolutely require a functional SP, since no interaction was detected with pCytf-L21E/I26E. To investigate the targeting and insertion of pCytf, we synthesized the wild-type precursor protein in the translation extract (Fig.5 A). However, multiple translation intermediates, premature termination, or degradation products also accumulated. Degradation is the most obvious explanation since the 30-kDa hydrophilic N-terminal domain is unlikely to be a tightly folded structure and will therefore be highly accessible to proteases. These shorter translation products make it difficult to diagnose cross-linking products, insertion, and processing. Therefore, a pCytf construct was engineered in which part of the internal soluble luminal domain (amino acids 91–285) was deleted. In this construct, named pCytΔf, the SP, the heme-coordinating cysteines (Cys-56 and Cys-59), the TM (amino acids 286–305), and the C-terminal stromal extension (amino acids 306–320) are still present, and the transcript ends with a termination stop codon (Fig. 1). Importantly, the C terminus, which has been implied in feedback regulation, is identical to wild-type Cytf. Translation of this shorter protein was successful and gave little accumulation of translation intermediates (Fig. 5 A), making the interpretation of targeting and insertion assays more straightforward. Therefore, pCytΔf was used to investigate the targeting and insertion requirements. pCytΔf was translated in the presence of nuclease-treated thylakoid membranes. Subsequently, the thylakoids were re-isolated, washed with different chaotropic agents, and the membranes were separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation. The soluble translation reaction (supernatant 1), the supernatant of the wash steps (supernatant 2), and the washed membrane pellet (pellet 2) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to monitor membrane association and integration (Fig. 5 B). About 40% of the translation product was tightly membrane-associated or integrated into the membrane, as it could not be extracted by the chaotropic agents (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of thylakoid membranes in the translation reaction, less than 0.5% of translation product was sedimented in the presence of 0.1 mNa2CO3 (Fig. 5 B). Two radiolabeled products between 7 and 9 kDa and a 4.5-kDa product also accumulated in the thylakoid membrane pellets (Fig. 5 B,pellet 2). Based on the molecular mass and further experimentation (see below and Fig.5 E), these membrane-integrated/translocated products were assigned as the processed translation product CytΔf and the cleaved SP, as indicated (Fig. 5 B). Incubation with chaotropic agents could remove neither the processed CytΔf nor the cleaved SP. Only the treatment with 6 m urea extracted a small amount of the processed SP, most likely due to perforation of the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 5 B, supernatant 2). The corresponding Coomassie-stained gel of the autoradiogram shows that the extraction procedure efficiently removed not only soluble stromal proteins (e.g. Rubisco), but also several peripheral thylakoid membrane proteins, such as CFIα,β (Fig.5 C). A cross-section of the signal intensity from the autoradiogram in Fig.5 B shows a quantification of the membrane-associated translation products, the processed CytΔf and the cleaved SP (Fig. 5 D). After correction for the difference in the number of methionines and cysteines in the three products (7, 5, and 2 methionines and cysteines in the pCytΔf, the processed CytΔf, and SP, respectively), we calculated a molar ratio of 1:0.08:0.9 for the membrane-located pCytΔf:CytΔf:SP. Thus processing was ∼47% of the associated precursor translation product (0.9/1.98). The molar excess of SP over mature protein was expected, because proteolysis rates of unassembled proteins in the thylakoid membrane is much higher than unassembled proteins in the lumen (Ref. 29Adam Z. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). The assignment of the SP and processed CytΔf product was firmly established by point mutations in the cleavage site motif. This motif was changed from Ser-Asn-Ala to Ser-Asn-Val, leading to the construct pCytΔf-A35V (Fig. 1). This amino acid substitution disrupts the semiconserved consensus sequence AXA that is recognized by the thylakoid-processing peptidase (TPP) (30Bassham D.C. Bartling D. Mould R.M. Dunbar B. Weisbeek P. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23606-23610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore insertion and translocation of the mutant proteins should not lead to any processing, and the 4.5-kDa SP should not accumulate. As a control, the motif Ser-Asn-Ala was changed to Val-Asn-Ala in the construct pCytΔf-S33V, which is a functional cleavage site, since the −1 position of the processing site remains an alanine. Both mutant and wild-type proteins were synthesized in the presence of thylakoids, and they all tightly associated with the membrane (Fig. 5 E). However, SP and CytΔfappeared only after translation of pCytΔf and pCytΔfS33V in the presence of thylakoids, whereas the proteins were not present with pCytΔf-A35V (Fig.5 E). This completely confirms the assignment of SP and CytfΔf. Since the TPP is located at the luminal side, processing can only occur after translocation of the SP through the membrane. The SP will accumulate on the luminal side of the membrane, and the mature protein is membrane-inserted. Thus, they should both be protected against exogenously added proteases. To test if the processed SP and mature proteins were indeed protected, the thylakoids were treated with trypsin, specifically cleaving the C-terminal of lysine and arginine residues (Fig. 5 E). In the case of the wild-type construct and the pCytΔf-S33V, the mature CytΔf as well as the cleaved SP were indeed protease-protected (Fig. 5 E). We should note that the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of pCytΔf has 3 lysines immediately C-terminal of the TM and that both the SP and the rest of the luminal domain have multiple lysines and arginines. pCytΔf on the other hand was partially digested leading to a loss of intensity and accumulation of a 6.5-kDa degradation product (Fig. 5 E,asterisk). The processing of pCytΔf and pCytΔf-S33V and the protease-insensitive accumulation of the CytΔf and processed SP in the thylakoids prove that the N terminus is correctly translocated across the thylakoid membrane. Complete cleavage of the short hydrophilic N terminus of the LHCP at the stromal side of the membrane by the trypsin treatment was visible on the corresponding Coomassie-stained gel and shows that the trypsin treatment was effective (Fig. 5 E, lower panel). In Fig. 4 we have shown that a functional SP is essential for the membrane-dependent interaction with cpSecA. These results, together with earlier observations in E. coli andChlamydomonas (see the Introduction), strongly suggest that the SP and cpSecA are both required fo"

Campbell K.P Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The dystroglycan complex consists of α-dystroglycan, a highly glycosylated extracellular protein that binds to several extracellular ligands, and β-dystroglycan, a single-pass transmembrane protein that links cytoplasmic dystrophin with α-dystroglycan (2Henry M.D. Campbell K.P Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Both dystroglycan subunits are encoded by a single highly conserved pro-peptide that is proteolytically processed into α- and β-dystroglycan, which remain stably associated through noncovalent interactions (2Henry M.D. Campbell K.P Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Like muscle deficient in dystrophin or other core components in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (1Straub V. Campbell K.P Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 10: 168-175Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar), deficiency of the dystroglycan complex in skeletal muscle results in compromised sarcolemmal integrity (3Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, it is generally thought that the dystroglycan complex in skeletal muscle mainly functions to mechanically protect the sarcolemma against shear stresses imposed during muscle contraction. However, the dystroglycan complex has also been linked with more dynamic developmental or pathological processes (2Henry M.D. Campbell K.P Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, several studies (3Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat.

However, it is presently unclear how the single, invariant dystroglycan protein may subserve different functions within a single cell type.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it is possible that distinct α-dystroglycan glycoforms may perform different functions. With regard to a role in AChR cluster formation at the NMJ, we previously confirmed (6Ervasti J.M. Burwell A.L. Geissler A.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that neural α-dystroglycans express exposed (patent) terminal β-linkedN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, which bound to the GalNAc-specific lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA). Skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan displayed no patent binding to VVA but revealed latent VVA reactivity after digestion with neuraminidase (6Ervasti J.M. Burwell A.L. Geissler A.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the VVA binding properties of neural and skeletal muscle α-dystroglycans were consistent with the characteristics of an unidentified VVA receptor previously implicated in AChR clustering (7Scott L.J.C. Bacou F. Sanes J.R J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 932-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Martin P.T. Sanes J.R Neuron. 1995; 14: 743-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized the expression of two α-dystroglycan glycoforms in skeletal muscle cells: 1) an extrasynaptic form with latent VVA reactivity caused by further modification with terminal sialic acid residues and 2) a motor end plate-specific glycoform marked with exposed β-linked GalNAc residues that may specifically participate in AChR cluster formation (6Ervasti J.M. Burwell A.L. Geissler A.L J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22315-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we show that three α-dystroglycan glycoforms are expressed in skeletal muscle, including two minor glycoforms marked by either patent or latent VVA reactivity. Both minor glycoforms co-isolated with β-dystroglycan but not other dystrophin/utrophin-glycoprotein complex components, suggesting they may perform distinct cellular functions. Although we confirmed that both patent and latent VVA reactive glycoforms are also expressed in C2C12 myotubes, other experiments indicate that neither glycoform is the receptor that mediates VVA-induced AChR clustering. We conclude that the VVA receptor important in AChR cluster formation remains to be identified. C2C12 and L6 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and used for three to seven passages. Proliferating cells were grown in 10-cm dishes or on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgrow; Fisher) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) plus 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5–10% CO2. After reaching confluency, the medium was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% equine serum (Hyclone) plus 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. The cells were incubated until full differentiation to multi-nucleate myotubes was observed morphologically (with C2C12, 4 days; with L6, 9–11 days) with fresh medium exchanged every 2 days. Crude surface membranes (CSM) were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (9Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For small scale lectin chromatography, 1 mg/ml CSM was solubilized in 1% Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmiodoacetamide, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) plus 150 mm NaCl, with end-over-end mixing for 1 h at 4 °C. Solubilized proteins were recovered in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. For large scale chromatography, 500–600 mg of CSM were solubilized in 1% Triton buffer plus 250 mm NaCl and 0.5 m sucrose and centrifuged as described above. Fully differentiated C2C12 or L6 myotubes were rinsed twice with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the dish in 5 ml/dish ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing the following protease inhibitors: 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A. The cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation at 50–200 ×g and solubilized in 0.5 ml/dish 1% Triton buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The resuspended cell pellet was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with end-over-end mixing followed by centrifugation as described above. For small scale lectin chromatography, 0.5 ml of Triton solubilate from CSM was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of either wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose or VVA-agarose beads (from Sigma and EY Labs, San Mateo, CA, respectively) that were pre-equilibrated in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100). The beads were pelleted, and the void volumes were removed. Lectin-bound proteins were then washed extensively and eluted with the appropriate eluting buffer (for WGA, wash buffer containing 0.3m N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc); for VVA, wash buffer containing 50 mm GalNAc). Small scale chromatography was performed in essentially the same way for Triton-solubilized C2C12 or L6 myotubes except that the wash buffer contained 150 mmNaCl and an extra 100 mm NaCl was added to the VVA eluting buffer. For large scale chromatography, ∼100 ml of CSM solubilate was loaded onto a 3-ml VVA-agarose column that was pre-equilibrated with wash buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The column was washed and eluted with wash buffer containing 50 mm GalNAc. The eluates were concentrated by methanol precipitation. CSM solubilates were incubated with or without 0.1 unit/ml of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C and used in small scale VVA chromatography as described above. Fully differentiated C2C12 or L6 myotubes were incubated with or without 0.1 unit/ml neuraminidase diluted in medium for 2 h at 37 °C. C2C12 myotubes were also treated for 6 h at 37 °C with 1 unit/ml β-N-acetylhexosaminidase from beef kidney (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 unit/ml α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from chicken liver (Sigma), or 0.05 unit/ml α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Acremonium sp. (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), each diluted in medium. Following incubation, the cells were analyzed for AChR clustering as described below or rinsed and solubilized for lectin chromatography as described above. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (10Ervasti J.M.

To assay for AChR clustering, C2C12 and L6 myotubes were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After treatment with laminin-1 (the gift of Dr. Hynda Kleinman, NIDR), VVA lectin (Sigma or EY Labs), C-Ag4,8 conditioned medium (17O'Toole J.J. Deyst K.A.

Mark Bowe and Justin Fallon, Brown University), and/or glycosidases, the myotubes were washed with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 500 ng/ml Alexa 488-conjugated bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on slides for immunofluorescence analysis. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal microscope (Keck Center for Biological Imaging) using a 40× oil immersion objective. AChR clusters were counted from five randomly chosen fields for each experiment. 7-μm cross-sections of control andmdx mouse hind limb muscle were adhered to Plus slides (Fisher), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Blocked sections were rinsed and incubated either with Rab 56 antiserum to utrophin for 2 h at 37 °C followed by 20 μg/ml Alexa 568-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C or with 500 ng/ml rhodamine-conjugated bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C. All sections were double-labeled with 50 μg/ml VVA-fluorescein isothiocyanate lectin (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), which was included during the incubation with secondary antibodies or bungarotoxin. The images were collected as described above. To determine whether a VVA-reactive glycoform of α-dystroglycan is expressed in adult skeletal muscle, we attempted to isolate α-dystroglycan from detergent-solubilized rabbit skeletal muscle CSM by small scale VVA-agarose chromatography. The chromatography protocol was first tested with WGA-agarose, a lectin that has previously been shown to bind α-dystroglycan isolated from a wide variety of tissues and species, including rabbit skeletal muscle (11Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). We observed that all α-dystroglycan in 1 mg of solubilized CSM protein quantitatively bound to WGA-agarose and was eluted with buffer containing 0.3 m GlcNAc (Fig.1 a). In addition, several other dystrophin-glycoprotein complex constituents were observed to co-purify with α-dystroglycan in the WGA eluate (Fig. 1 a). However, no α-dystroglycan was detected in the GalNAc eluate from VVA-agarose using the small scale chromatography protocol (Fig.1 b). Because the motor end plate makes up less than 0.1% of the entire muscle cell plasma membrane (18Burden S.J Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it seemed probable that a VVA-reactive species of α-dystroglycan might be present in such low abundance that we could not detect it by small scale chromatography. Therefore, we performed a large scale VVA chromatography protocol in which 500–600 mg of CSM solubilate was loaded onto a 3-ml VVA-agarose column. The GalNAc eluate from the 3-ml VVA-agarose column was then concentrated 300–400-fold, relative to the CSM solubilate. On this scale of amplification, we readily detected two distinct species of α-dystroglycan in the concentrated VVA eluate with molecular weights of ∼156,000 and 110,000 (Fig. 2). Both proteins were reactive with the α-dystroglycan-specific monoclonal antibody IIH6 and an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to α-dystroglycan (Fig. 2).Figure 2Amplification of distinct α-dystroglycan glycoforms from skeletal muscle membranes by large scale VVA chromatography. 600 mg of Triton-solubilized rabbit skeletal muscle CSM were circulated overnight on a 3-ml VVA-agarose column. After washing, the column was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm GalNAc, and the eluates were concentrated by methanol precipitation. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained with antibodies that recognize the following proteins: α-dystroglycan (α-DG polyclonal antibody (pAb) andIIH6), α-dystrobrevins-1 and -2 (Db), β-dystroglycan (β-DG), dystrophin (DYS), utrophin (UTR), α-sarcoglycan (α-SG), ε-sarcoglycan (ε-SG), and syntrophin (Syn). Note that the eluates were concentrated ∼300-fold relative to the CSM solubilate (SUP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One or both of the VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan species could have originated from small amounts of blood vessel or peripheral nerve tissues that may contaminate the muscle membrane preparations used. Indeed, we observed that the 110-kDa species, but not the 156-kDa species, reacted with a monoclonal antibody to the HNK-1 epitope (data not shown). Because HNK-1 antibodies have been observed to react with peripheral nerve but not skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan (19Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) 2A. Combs and J. Ervasti, unpublished results. and because peripheral nerve α-dystroglycan has a molecular weight of ∼120,000 (19Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we concluded that the 110-kDa α-dystroglycan species in the large scale VVA eluate likely originated from peripheral nerve tissue. However, α-dystroglycan from visceral and lung smooth muscle is not reactive with monoclonal antibody IIH6 (20Straub V. Ettinger A.J. Durbeej M. Venzke D.P. Cutshall S. Sanes J.R. Campbell K.P J.

In addition, ε-sarcoglycan, a component of the smooth muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (20Straub V. Ettinger A.J. Durbeej M. Venzke D.P. Cutshall S. Sanes J.R. Campbell K.P J. Biol.

These results suggested that the 156-kDa VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan species likely originated from skeletal muscle cells. Based on the densitometric intensities of IIH6 staining in the solubilate and VVA eluate and taking into account the difference in sample load, we estimated that the 156-kDa VVA-reactive species comprised ∼0.1% of total skeletal muscle α-dystroglycan (TableI).Table Iα-Dystroglycan glycoforms in skeletal muscle cellsTissue/cell typeMrVVA reactivityEstimated abundance%Rabbit156,000No98Skeletal156,000Yes (patent)0.11Muscle156,000Yes (latent)1.7110,000Yes (patent)aNot quantifiable because no IIH6 immune signal was detected in CSM solubiliates.C2C12134,000Yes (patent)80Myotubes134,000Yes (latent)20L6 Myotubes136,000No100a Not quantifiable because no IIH6 immune signal was detected in CSM solubiliates. Open table in a new tab We next examined the large scale VVA eluates for co-purification of other components in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. As expected, β-dystroglycan was observed to co-purify with VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan (Fig. 2). However, other components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex were not detected in the large scale VVA eluates (Fig. 2). Of particular relevance, we did not detect the co-purification of utrophin with VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan, as might be expected if VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan was expressed at the neuromuscular junction (15Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that Triton X-100 may have dissociated VVA-reactive dystroglycan complex from other dystrophin-associated proteins (22Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed the same results when large scale VVA chromatography was performed with CSM solubilized in 1% digitonin (data not shown). We also observed the same results when large scale VVA chromatography was performed using Triton-solubilized rat skeletal muscle (data not shown). The presence of AChRs in both solubilized CSM and rat skeletal muscle was verified by Western blotting with an antibody against AChR β-subunit (data not shown). These results indicate that a small amount of VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan is expressed in skeletal muscle cells in association with β-dystroglycan but is not stably associated with other proteins in the dystrophin-utrophin glycoprotein complexes. The dystrophin homologue utrophin is normally restricted to the adult NMJ (15Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of skeletal muscle from the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse previously revealed an up-regulation in utrophin expression and its redistribution to the extrasynaptic sarcolemma normally occupied by dystrophin (23Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 24Khurana T.S. Watkins S.C. Chafey P. Chelly J. Tome F.M.S. Fardeau M. Kaplan J.C. Kunkel L.M Neuromuscular Disorders. 1991; 1: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). More recently, proteins stably associated with utrophin in biochemical assays were also shown to redistribute with utrophin to the extrasynaptic sarcolemma of mdx muscle (25Lumeng C. Phelps S. Crawford G.E. Walden P.D. Barald K. Chamberlain J.S Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To determine whether VVA receptors in skeletal muscle associate with utrophin in vivo, we double-labeled control andmdx mouse skeletal muscle cross-sections with VVA lectin and utrophin antibody (Fig. 3). From analysis of several fields with identifiable neuromuscular junctions (n = 7), we observed that VVA receptors do not redistribute with utrophin in mdx mouse skeletal muscle. In addition, bungarotoxin-labeled AChRs remained strictly localized at the neuromuscular junctions in mdx mouse skeletal muscle (data not shown and Refs. 27Man N. Ellis J.M. Love D.R. Davies K.E.

Sealock R. Froehner S.C J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results of Figs. 2 and 3 suggested that neither VVA receptors at the neuromuscular junction nor VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan are specifically associated with utrophin. Because AChRs and residual dystroglycan are both retained at the NMJ of dystrophin/utrophin double knock-out mice (29Deconinck A.E. Rafael J.A. Skinner J.A. Brown S.C. Potter A.C. Metzinger L.

Wilkinson R.S. Sanes J.R Cell. 1997; 90: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), it remained possible that the small amount of VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan present in skeletal muscle may participate in AChR clustering independent of an interaction with dystrophin or utrophin. α-Dystroglycan in C2C12 myotubes was recently shown to bind to VVA-agarose (31Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 21: 436-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remained to be determined what fraction of total C2C12 α-dystroglycan was patently reactive with VVA and whether VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan may also be expressed in other clonal myotube cell lines. Therefore, we analyzed both C2C12 and rat L6 myotubes for expression of distinct α-dystroglycan glycoforms. Both C2C12 and L6 myotubes were shown to express α-dystroglycan with similar average molecular weights of 134,000 and 136,000, respectively. Because the polypeptide core of α-dystroglycan is 67,000, the high molecular weights of C2C12 and L6 α-dystroglycan suggested that these cell lines express glycosylated α-dystroglycan. In addition, α-dystroglycan expressed in both cell lines reacted with IIH6 (Fig.4 a), which has been shown to recognize carbohydrate residues on α-dystroglycan (32Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Finally, both C2C12 and L6 myotubes expressed α-dystroglycan that bound WGA-agarose (Fig. 4 a). These results suggested that α-dystroglycan in C2C12 and L6 myotubes is glycosylated in a manner similar to that observed for skeletal muscle CSM α-dystroglycan (Fig. 1). Small scale VVA chromatography indicated that ∼80% of C2C12 myotube α-dystroglycan could bind to VVA-agarose (Fig. 4 a). β-Dystroglycan also co-purified with VVA-reactive α-dystroglycan from C2C12 myotubes, whereas other components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex were only detected in the VVA void (Fig. 4 b). To determine whether the small fraction of α-dystroglycan left in the VVA void (Fig. 4 a) was due to saturation of the lectin beads, we incubated the VVA void with a fresh aliquot of VVA-agarose overnight but did not detect any additional binding of α-dystroglycan to VVA (data not shown). In contrast to C2C12 myotube α-dystroglycan, L6 myotube α-dystroglycan showed no detectable binding to VVA-agarose (Fig. 4 a). These data confirm that C2C12 myotubes express two distinct α-dystroglycan glycoforms, one of which predominates and is marked by its patent reactivity with VVA-agarose. In addition, these results indicate that skeletal muscle cells are capable of expressing three distinct glycoforms of α-dystroglycan. Laminin-1 and VVA can each induce AChR clustering in C2C12 myotubes in a manner that is independent of and additive to the well established agrin/MuSK pathway (31Grow W.A. Ferns M. Gordon H. Dev.

It is also shown that isolated yeast mitochondria degrade their phospholipids at a relatively rapid rate. The activity responsible is also previously unrecognized. It is Ca2+–independent, little affected by the presence or absence of a respiratory substrate, and leads to the hydrolysis of ester linkages at both the sn-1 and sn-2positions of the glycerophospholipids.

It is also shown that isolated yeast mitochondria degrade their phospholipids at a relatively rapid rate. The activity responsible is also previously unrecognized. It is Ca2+–independent, little affected by the presence or absence of a respiratory substrate, and leads to the hydrolysis of ester linkages at both the sn-1 and sn-2positions of the glycerophospholipids. The products of this activity, through their actions on the antiporter, explain the variable behavior of yeast mitochondria treated with Ca2+ plus ETH 129. bovine serum albumin membrane potential, FCCP, carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone tetraethylammonium cation yeast mitochondrial permeability transition pore Ca2+ plays important roles in the cell signaling systems of eucaryotic organisms (1Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, mitochondria participate in these systems through the Ca2+ uptake and release activities that they contain (2Babcock, D. F., and Hille, B. (1998) Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 398–404.Google Scholar). These include a Ca2+ uniporter for accumulation, an Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity for release, a second release activity that is poorly characterized, and a general diffusion pore that is referred to as the permeability transition pore (3Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological roles of the latter structure are not known with certainty but are thought to include the propagation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ waves through repetitive opening and closing of a low conductance state (4Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.-P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 5Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition to influencing extramitochondrial Ca2+–regulated processes, mitochondrial transport activities adjust the free Ca2+ concentration in the matrix space and thereby regulate the production of reducing equivalents and the synthesis of ATP (6Hansford R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In simpler eucaryotes such as yeast, the cell signaling roles of Ca2+ are less developed, and there is a corresponding reduction in the role of mitochondria in maintaining Ca2+homeostasis. Yeast mitochondria do not contain a calcium uniporter (7Balcavage W.X. Lyoyd J.L. Mattoon J.R. Ohnishi T. Scarpa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 1993; 25: 671-678PubMed Google Scholar) and are thought to lack high activity release carriers that oppose the uniporter in other mitochondria (10Weihua L. Shariat-Madar Z. Powers M. Sun X. Lane R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17983-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They do contain a general diffusion pore in the inner membrane and are subject to a permeability transition; however, Ca2+ does not regulate the transition as it does in mammalian mitochondria (8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the production of reducing equivalents and ATP synthesis are not regulated by Ca2+ in yeast mitochondria, in so far as is known (11Nichols B.J. Rigoulet M. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, matrix space pyrophosphatase activity is Ca2+–regulated in mitochondria from both yeast (12Uribe S. Rangel P. Pardo J.P. Pereira-da-Silva L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and mammalian (13Davidson A.M. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) sources, and there may be other roles for Ca2+ that are unidentified at present. A study that employed yeast mitochondria loaded with a Ca2+indicator (fluo-3) showed that the matrix space Ca2+concentration is established by a simple equilibration with the extramitochondrial concentration (14Uribe S. Rangel P. Pardo J.P. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The activity responsible appeared to be slow, and it was not clear whether the range of adjustment would encompass that which is attained in yeast cytoplasm through normal processes. In a related study we utilized a strain of yeast that expresses aequorin in the mitochondria to further investigate the mechanism of equilibration. The presence of a slow Ca2+ transport activity was confirmed, it was found to be reversible, and it was seen that a relatively broad range of matrix space Ca2+ concentrations can be attained via the activity, similar to the physiological range of variation in cytoplasm. 1Submitted for publication. 1Submitted for publication. Our study also showed that yeast mitochondria in vivo accumulate and retain Ca2+ through the action of ionophore ETH 129, whereas accumulation was transient in the case of isolated mitochondria. The latter observation conflicted with another report in which it was seen that isolated yeast mitochondria retain Ca2+ accumulated via the ionophore under a particular set of conditions (8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present report we describe further factors that influence interactions between Ca2+ and yeast mitochondria, particularly as they relate to Ca2+ transport. The results show that mitochondria from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain a vigorous Ca2+ transport activity that has long eluded detection. The activity is regulated by free fatty acids that arise by degradation of mitochondrial phospholipids, and the phospholipase responsible for that process is also newly discovered. Aspects of the data have been described in abstract form (15Bradshaw P.C. Jung D.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (. A): 194Google Scholar). The yeast strain W303–1A (S. cerevisiae) was grown aerobically at 30 °C in a medium containing 2% lactate, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.05% dextrose, and 0.01% adenine at pH 5.0, and cells were harvested during the logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.8–2.2). Mitochondria were isolated from spheroplasts as described previously (8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), except that 0.6 m sucrose was used in the homogenization medium instead of the 0.6 m mannitol that is usually employed (16Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting preparations were maintained on ice and were suspended in 0.6 m mannitol, 20 mmHEPES (K+) (pH 6.8), containing 0.75 mg/ml BSA2 and 0.1 mmEGTA. Protein concentration was determined by a reduced volume Biuret method in which 50 µl of the final preparation were solubilized by adding an equal volume of 10% deoxycholate (Na+), with 0.4 ml of Biuret reagent added to the resulting mixture. BSA was employed as the standard. Unless noted otherwise, mitochondria were incubated at 1 mg protein/ml and at ∼25 °C in a medium that contained 0.6m mannitol, 10 mm Pi(K+), 10 mm HEPES (TEA+), pH 7.2, plus 1 mm ethanol as an oxidizable substrate. Compounds having a low solubility in water were added from stock solutions prepared in methanol or Me2SO. Ca2+transport and membrane potential were monitored using the indicating dyes antipyrylazo III (ΔA720–790) and safranin O (ΔA511–533), respectively (17Åkerman K.E.O. Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 18Scarpa A. Brinley Jr., F.J. Dubyak G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An SLM Aminco DW-2C spectrophotometer operated in the dual wavelength mode was employed for these purposes. The same instrument, operated in split beam mode, was used to monitor swelling as a decrease in apparent absorbance of mitochondrial suspensions at 540 nm. Oxygen consumption data were obtained using a Clark-type electrode in parallel experiments. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the transport of other cations by yeast mitochondria. Briefly, samples were taken at appropriate times, and the mitochondria were sedimented rapidly in a microcentrifuge. After carefully removing supernatants, the pellets were solubilized with 2 N percholoric acid (overnight) and centrifuged a second time. The resulting supernatants were diluted with an appropriate volume of distilled water, and the concentration of the cation in question was subsequently determined. Samples containing 3 mg of mitochondrial protein were extracted by a modified Folch technique (19Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), following the addition of a known amount of heptadecanoic acid (17:0), which was employed as an internal standard (20Pfeiffer D.R. Schmid P.C. Beatrice M.C. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid-containing phase was reacted with diazomethane to produce fatty acid methyl esters (21Schlenk H. Gellerman J. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1412-1414Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar), and silica gel minicolumns were used to separate these from other fractions (19Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid methyl esters were quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography, using an instrument equipped with a capillary column and a computing integrator (19Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pfeiffer D.R. Schmid P.C. Beatrice M.C. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11485-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peak areas were converted to units of nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein by considering the internal standard peak area and the amount of protein represented by the sample (19Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pfeiffer D.R. Schmid P.C. Beatrice M.C. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol.

Total mitochondrial phospholipids were estimated from measurements of lipid phosphorous in an aliquot of the initial extract (22Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETH 129 is an electrogenic ionophore for divalent cations (23Prestipino G. Falugi C. Falchetto R. Gazzotti P. Anal.

J., in press.Google Scholar) that allows yeast mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+in vivo and in vitro (8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).1 Under in vitroconditions an oxidizable substrate must be present, together with inorganic phosphate, which is normally used in the concentration range of 5–10 mm. As in mammalian mitochondria, the substrate is required to support development of ΔΨ, which is the immediate driving force for Ca2+ accumulation. Phosphate is required to maintain the yeast permeability transition pore (yPTP) in a closed state, to reduce the transmembrane pH gradient and thereby to enhance ΔΨ and, presumably, to reduce the free concentration of Ca2+ in the matrix space by participating in the formation of insoluble complexes (8Jung D.W. Bradshaw P.C. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21104-21112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). While investigating the above features we noticed that ETH 129-mediated Ca2+ accumulation by yeast mitochondria is subject to variation in terms of the rate of transport, the external Ca2+ concentration that is attained, and the tendency of previously accumulated Ca2+ to be released during an extended incubation (Fig. 1). This is despite the fact that ETH 129 is a well behaved ionophore for Ca2+ in model systems, displaying properties that are highly reproducible (26Wang, E., Erdahl, W. L., Hamidinia, S. A., Chapman, C. J., Taylor, R. W., and Pfeiffer, D. R. (2001) Biophys. J., in press.Google Scholar), and despite the fact that the Ca2+ transport activities of mammalian mitochondria do not show this degree of variability as long as the permeability transition is avoided. Accordingly, it appeared that variability reflects specific properties of yeast mitochondrial preparations and that it might relate to the differing capacity of these mitochondria to retain Ca2+in vivo and in vitro, as described in the Introduction. Insight into the underlying cause of variability is provided by Fig.2, wherein it is shown that Ca2+ accumulation by freshly prepared yeast mitochondria is slow and limited in a medium that does not contain BSA. The addition of BSA after transport has begun improves both the rate and extent parameters in a concentration-dependent manner. For the particular preparation employed when obtaining that figure, a maximal effect was seen at a BSA concentration near 0.25 mg/ml (∼4 µm). BSA is similarly effective when present from the beginning of incubations, whereas high molecular mass polymers (10 kDa polyethylene glycol, 100 kDa dextran) that have similar effects on medium colloid osmotic properties are ineffective (data not shown). Effects of BSA on ΔΨ are examined in Fig.3. These mitochondria develop and maintain a large ΔΨ during ethanol oxidation when BSA is absent, although BSA increases the magnitude to some degree (Fig.3A). The addition of Ca2+ or ETH 129 alone has little effect on ΔΨ (Fig. 3B); however, both agents together produce a sustained reduction (Fig. 3C). This reduction persists for more time than would be required to complete Ca2+ uptake if BSA were present, based on Fig. 2, and is not duplicated when ionomycin is added with Ca2+ instead of ETH 129 (Fig. 3C). Ionomycin is an electroneutral ionophore for Ca2+ (27Erdahl W.L. Chapman C.J. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1678-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Thomas T.P. Wang E. Pfeiffer D.R. Taylor R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that equilibrates Ca2+ and H+ gradients across membranes. Accordingly, Fig.3C shows that the simple presence of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix space does not effect ΔΨ. Rather it is the entry of Ca2+ via an electrogenic process that is required. The sustained reduction of ΔΨ produced by ETH 129 plus Ca2+ can be reversed by the subsequent addition of BSA (Fig. 4). As in the case of enhanced Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 2), the degree of reversal is a function of the BSA concentration such that a direct correlation is seen between the actions of BSA on ΔΨ and Ca2+transport. When BSA is absent and transport is minimal, ΔΨ is low. Conversely, the efficient transport seen in the presence of BSA is associated with a large ΔΨ. Additional data pertaining to the sustained reduction of ΔΨ are shown in Fig. 5. This reduction is apparently unrelated to the yeast mitochondrial permeability transition given that the large amplitude of swelling that accompanies the transition induced by respiration in the absence of phosphate (compare Fig. 5, A and B) is not seen when ΔΨ is depressed by ETH 129 plus Ca2+ (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, there is little effect of BSA on respiration when ETH 129 and Ca2+ are present (compare Fig. 5, C andD), and in neither case does respiration become inhibited as it does when the transition occurs (compare Fig. 5, A andB). Other features of the respiration data are also of interest and are considered under “Discussion.” BSA binds fatty acids with high affinity but also binds a range of molecules that are hydrophobic in nature (29Elmadhoun B.M. Wang G.Q. Templeton J.F. Burzczynski F.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1998; 275: G638-G644Crossref Google Scholar, 30Nissani E. Koren R. Perlmutter-Hayman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 226: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To determine whether the fatty acid binding activity of BSA is involved in its effects on ETH 129-mediated Ca2+ transport we first investigated the actions of exogenous oleate (18:1) on the process. With BSA present initially at 0.5 mg/ml, the addition of increasing oleate levels during Ca2+ accumulation first inhibited further accumulation and then caused a reversal of the transport that had already occurred (Fig.6). These findings indicate that free fatty acids do indeed diminish Ca2+ transport and that BSA acts by reducing the available fraction. Because fatty acids uncouple yeast mitochondria through a mechanism that requires participation of the adenine nucleotide translocase (31Polcic P. Sabová L. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) it also seemed possible that the Ca2+–releasing activity of fatty acids and opposing effects of BSA might merely reflect uncoupling by that type of mechanism. However, we found no effect of carboxyatractyloside on the depression of ΔΨ produced by ETH 129 plus Ca2+ when BSA was absent (data not shown). As further considered under “Discussion,” this argues against a significant role for fatty acid-derived uncoupling, because carboxyatractyloside is an effective inhibitor of the translocase activity in yeast mitochondria (32Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the depression of ΔΨ is reversed when EGTA is added to the external medium. This is seen regardless of whether Ca2+ transport is occurring early or late during incubation (compare Fig. 7, Aand B) and whether ΔΨ has been suppressed briefly or for an extended period before EGTA is added (compare Fig. 7, Aand C). In addition, there is a graded response to multiple additions of EGTA when the concentration arising from a single addition is less than the total concentration of Ca2+ (Fig.7C). Thus, a continuing presence of free Ca2+ is required to maintain the suppression of ΔΨ even when BSA is not present to bind fatty acids, and the extent of suppression is a function of the free Ca2+ concentration. A further point relating to fatty acid-dependant uncoupling is derived from Fig. 8. There it is seen that suppression of ΔΨ begins immediately during titration with exogenous oleate when ETH 129, free Ca2+, and BSA are available (Fig. 8, dotted lines). This is in contrast to the titration preformed in the presence of excess EGTA where free Ca2+ is not available, but fatty acid-dependant uncoupling could still occur. Under those conditions exogenous oleate does not depress ΔΨ until the level added exceeds 15 nmol/mg protein. This shows that the levels of fatty acids required to produce an extensive uncoupling are higher than those that mediate the decrease in ΔΨ that arises in the presence of free Ca2+ and ETH 129. To determine whether the free fatty acid levels in our yeast mitochondria are sufficient to alter Ca2+transport, these values were determined as a function of incubation time. Indeed, large amounts of free fatty acids accumulate during incubation at 25 °C, at an initial rate of approximately of ∼0.4 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 9). This rate was not altered substantially by the presence or absence of ethanol (Fig. 9, inset), by free Ca2+ and ETH 129, or by the presence of BSA. However, the rate is decreased to ∼0.3 nmol/hr/mg protein when the mitochondria are maintained on ice (data not shown). 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, and 18:1 account for ∼90% of the accumulating fatty acids (Fig. 9). These compounds and their relative proportions are typical of the fatty acid composition found in yeast phospholipids (33Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Parallel determinations of lipid phosphorus showed that the phospholipid content of the preparations decreased at ∼50% of the rate at which the fatty acids accumulate in total (data not shown). Furthermore, there was little change in the rate or composition parameters when Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria (34Broekemeier K.M. Schmid P.C. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20700-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were employed instead of the standard preparation (data not shown). Accordingly, it appears that the free fatty acids that accumulate arise from mitochondrial phospholipids and that both sn-1 and sn-2positions are hydrolyzed by the degradative activities. Mammalian mitochondria that are treated with Ca2+ plus A23187 or ionomycin behave in much the same way as yeast mitochondria that are treated with Ca2+ plus ETH 129. A23178 and ionomycin are electroneutral ionophores that exchange matrix space Ca2+ for two external protons. Accordingly they reverse uniporter-dependent Ca2+accumulation and a futile cycle of accumulation, and release is established when the ionophore and the uniporter are active simultaneously (35Reed P.W. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6970-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cycle dissipates the proton motive force (suppresses ΔΨ), inhibits Ca2+ accumulation, and releases Ca2+ that was accumulated previously, depending on the levels of Ca2+ and the ionophore employed (36Kaufman R.F. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2735-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pfeiffer D.R. Hutson S.M. Kaufman R.F. Lardy H.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given the similarities to those findings, we interpret the present data to indicate that such a cycle is operating in yeast mitochondria that are treated with Ca2+ plus ETH 129. As noted, with yeast mitochondria the cycle arises upon addition of an electrogenic ionophore whereas an electroneutral ionophore must be employed with mammalian mitochondria. Given that both an electrogenic and an electroneutral transporter are required to produce the cycle, the most straightforward explanation for the difference is that yeast mitochondria contain a high activity Ca2+ transport mechanism that is electroneutral, in contrast to mammalian mitochondria where the dominate mechanism is electrogenic (the Ca2+uniporter). We adopt this interpretation and propose further that the yeast activity is regulated by free fatty acids, such that it is poorly active when free fatty acids are not available (e.g. in the presence of excess BSA), and progressively more active as the free fatty acid levels rise. These interpretations explain (i) why efficient Ca2+ accumulation and retention requires the presence of BSA (to limit activity of the endogenous transporter that opposes accumulation), (ii) why ΔΨ remains suppressed in the presence of ETH 129 plus Ca2+when BSA is absent (because the ongoing futile cycle continuously expends the proton motive force), and (iii) why ΔΨ is restored by the addition of BSA or EGTA (both agents interrupt the cycle). In considering the merits of the above interpretation it is worthwhile to evaluate other possibilities. For example, it might be maintained that the free fatty acids are acting as Ca2+ ionophores, to affect a direct Ca2+:2H+ exchange, given reports that this occurs in model systems (e.g. see Refs. 38Utsumi K. Nobori K. Terada S. Miyahara M. Utsumi T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1985; 10: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and39Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. Wrigglesworth J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and that fatty acids facilitate monovalent cation transport in mitochondria (40Wojtczak L. Wieckowski M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We do not favor this interpretation, because the ionophoretic activities of fatty acids are modest when they have not been partially oxidized (e.g. see Ref. 41Serhan C.N. Anderson P. Goodman E. Dunham P. Weissmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2736-2741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is not the case in the present experiments. In addition, we were unable to establish an energy-dissipating cycle of Ca2+ uptake and release by adding exogenous fatty acids to liver mitochondria and then loading them with Ca2+. At the fatty acid levels of interest in this study (0–20 nmol/mg protein) an uncoupling effect of the fatty acid was observed, but this was eliminated substantially upon Ca2+ accumulation (data not shown). Were the fatty acids promoting a significant Ca2+:2H+ exchange, an apparent uncoupling effect would have remained. It might also be maintained that the yPTP is involved in the actions of ETH 129 plus Ca2+, because data like those shown in Fig. 1can be obtained with mammalian mitochondria that are approaching the permeability transition. In further similarity to the data presented, the permeability transition in mammalian mitochondria is stimulated by Ca2+ accumulation, membrane depolarization, and low levels of free fatty acids, whereas it is reversed by Ca2+chelation and other maneuvers that counteract inducing conditions (3Gunter T.E.

https://openalex.org/W2007674120,"Growing evidence suggests an involvement of the endothelin B receptor (ETB-R) in blood pressure-dependent arterial remodeling. To study the molecular mechanisms leading to deformation-induced ETB-R expression, we have cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells on flexible elastomers and, when grown to 70% confluence, periodically stretched them for 6 h (15% elongation, 0.5 Hz). The cells responded with an increase both in ETB-R mRNA (12-fold compared with control) and protein (4-fold). According to nuclear run-on analysis this increase in ETB-R expression occurred at the level of transcription. Among various kinase pathways, Rho kinase (ROCK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) mediated part of the deformation-induced increase in ETB-R expression, as judged by the inhibitory effect of Y27632 (1 μm, 38% inhibition) and SB202190 (10 μm, 44% inhibition), respectively. Gel shift assaying of the three transcription factors principally activated by these kinases revealed a transient deformation-induced activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), but not activating transcription factor, that was sensitive to both Y27632 and SB212190. The potential role of AP-1 and C/EBP in deformation-induced ETB-R expression was verified both by using decoy oligodeoxynucleotides mimicking the DNA-binding sites of these transcription factors and a nuclear run-on-based assay employing specific antibodies directed against AP-1 and C/EBP. Both techniques unequivocally demonstrated that activation of these transcription factors, namely that of C/EBPβ, contribute to the increase of ETB-R gene expression in response to cyclic stretch. Growing evidence suggests an involvement of the endothelin B receptor (ETB-R) in blood pressure-dependent arterial remodeling. To study the molecular mechanisms leading to deformation-induced ETB-R expression, we have cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells on flexible elastomers and, when grown to 70% confluence, periodically stretched them for 6 h (15% elongation, 0.5 Hz). The cells responded with an increase both in ETB-R mRNA (12-fold compared with control) and protein (4-fold). According to nuclear run-on analysis this increase in ETB-R expression occurred at the level of transcription.

The 15 tyrosine residues of the endodomain of this construct (PFR1) were divided into four linear segments (labeled A, B, C, and D) that contained 4, 4, 2, and 5 tyrosine residues, respectively. When stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor, derivatives in which the A, B, or A + B blocs of tyrosines were mutated were about two-thirds as active as the unmodified chimera at 48 h but achieved full activity by 96 h in a neurite outgrowth assay in transfected PC12 cells. Elimination of only the two activation loop tyrosines (C bloc) also inactivated the receptor. All derivatives in which 4 (or 5) of the D bloc tyrosines were mutated were inactive in producing differentiation but showed low levels of kinase activity in in vitro assays. Derivatives in which 1, 2, or 3 tyrosines of the D bloc in different combinations were systematically changed demonstrated that 2 residues (Tyr677 and Tyr701, using hFGFR1 numbering) were essential for bioactivity, but the remaining 3 residues, including Tyr766, the previously identified site for phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) activation, were not. Differentiation activity was paralleled by the activation (phosphorylation) of FRS2, SOS, and ERK1/2. PLCγ activity was dependent on the presence of Tyr766 but also required Tyr677 and/or Tyr701. Although fully active chimeras did not require PLCγ, the responses of chimeras showing reduced activation of FRS2 were significantly enhanced by this activity. These results establish that PFR1 does not utilize any tyrosine residues, phosphorylated or not, to activate FRS2. However, it does require Tyr677 and/or Tyr701, which may function to stabilize the active conformation directly or indirectly.

Activation generally requires ligand binding and a stabilized dimeric structure that allows interaction between the constituent monomers and trans protomer autophosphorylation (1Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Heldin, C. H., and Purton, M. (eds) (1996) Signal Transduction, Chapman and Hall, LondonGoogle Scholar). The modifications (tyrosine phosphorylations) introduced usually contribute to stabilizing the activated form of the kinase and can provide docking sites for downstream transducers and effectors. However, not all RTKs require tyrosine phosphorylation for activation, e.g. the EGFR (3Daub H. Weiss F.U Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), and some of these modifications apparently do not contribute directly to functional responses. The kinase domains of RTKs are homologs of the larger kinase family and show the characteristic bilobal structure of these enzymes (2Heldin, C. H., and Purton, M. (eds) (1996) Signal Transduction, Chapman and Hall, LondonGoogle Scholar). ATP and the protein (peptide) substrate are bound in a cleft formed by the two domains, and several key binding/catalytic residues are universally conserved (1Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Generally, RTK activation is controlled by a loop (or “lip”) that contains one to three tyrosine residues that are sites of phosphorylation. This activation loop (A-loop) is apparently quite flexible and can move readily from a conformation in which it occludes all or part of the cleft to one in which substrate binding is not impeded. In most cases, phosphorylation of the A-loop tyrosines clearly stabilizes the “active” conformation, but it is less clear how ligand binding shifts the equilibrium from the “closed” to “open” form prior to the covalent modification. The three-dimensional structures of several kinases, including those of the insulin receptor (IR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR1), have been particularly valuable in developing an understanding of kinase activation mechanisms (4Hubbard S.R EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 5Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated forms of the FGFR1 and the IR kinase (IRK) domains show quite different orientations of the A-loop, although both occupy the active site cleft to some degree. In the unphosphorylated IRK, both the ATP and protein substrate binding sites are blocked, whereas in the unphosphorylated FGFR1K, an ATP analog is bound but residues of the catalytic loop hinder binding of peptide substrates. So far, there are structures available only for the IRK in both the inhibited and activated forms. There are large changes in conformation between inactive IRK and the tri-phosphorylated structure (4Hubbard S.R EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In the A-loop of the unphosphorylated IRK structure, Tyr1162 is H-bonded to the putative catalytic bases and blocks the nucleotide binding site. In this tri-phosphorylated form of IRK, pTyr1163 contributes to stabilization of the activated A-loop conformation by interaction with Arg1155, and the phosphate group of pTyr1162 H-bonds to the side chain of Arg1164. In FGFR1, mutation of either tyrosine in the A-loop sequence (Tyr653 or Tyr654), which are analogous to Tyr1162 and Tyr1163 of IR, does not inactivate the enzyme (although mutation of both does) (5Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that both tyrosines interact, in the phosphorylated state, to stabilize the open form of the A-loop. There are four major forms of the FGFR (designated FGFR1–4) that are members of the RTK family. Their expression is widely distributed in terms of tissues and developmental periods, reflecting a variety of cellular activities (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; 59: 135-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). All of the principal isoforms activate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and the RAS/MAPK (ERK) pathways, albeit with varying effectiveness (7Raffioni S. Thomas D. Foehr E.D. Thompson L.M. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The former is bound to a specific phosphotyrosine (Tyr776 in FGFR1) found in the same relative position in all of the isoforms (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; 59: 135-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and mutation of this residue (usually to phenylalanine) results in complete loss of PLCγ-dependent responses (8Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. DelRosario M. Mirada D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The induction of ERK1/2 activation (via activated RAS) also occurs through the phosphorylation of FRS2, a signaling scaffold that binds constitutively to FGFRs regardless of their activation state (10Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L.

Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). FRS2 has multiple sites for phosphorylation, which when modified allow binding of Grb2 and Shp2 leading to subsequent ERK activation as well as other responses (13Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The interaction of FRS2 with FGFR1 occurs via the binding of the phosphotyrosine binding domain of FRS2 to a 12-residue segment in the juxtamembrane region of FGFR1 (14Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because the other FGFRs also activate FRS2 and contain this sequence, a similar interaction is likely with these as well. Importantly, this segment does not contain a tyrosine residue, and hence FRS2 interaction and activation apparently do not depend directly on the formation of a phosphotyrosine derivative. FGFRs also induce Shc phosphorylation (10Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although direct interactions with the receptor have not been observed and, at least in PC12 cell differentiation, dominant negative derivatives have demonstrated that it does not play a role in differentiation (6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; 59: 135-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Seven tyrosine residues in the FGFR1 endodomain are phosphorylated in the activated receptor (15Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition to the two found in the A-loop (Tyr653 and Tyr654) and at the site of PLCγ binding (Tyr766), one residue in the juxtamembrane region (Tyr463), two in the kinase insert (Tyr583 and Tyr585), and one in the C-terminal lobe (Tyr730) were identified. Site-directed mutagenesis established that at least one of the A-loop tyrosine residues was necessary, but the mutation of the remainder of the sites did not affect FRS2 activation nor did it affect mitogenic signaling in L6 cells or neuronal differentiation on PC12 cells (8Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. DelRosario M. Mirada D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14419-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Wang and Goldfarb (17Wang J.K. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that the two tyrosine residues in the kinase insert were a necessary (but not sufficient) component of mitogenic signaling by FGFR1 in BaF3 lymphoid cells. To further assess the specific and global contributions of the FGFR1 endodomain tyrosine residues to receptor function, these residues were systematically substituted with phenylalanine residues in a PDGFR/FGFR1 chimera and stably transfected into PC12 cells. Although none of the previously reported sites of phosphorylation outside of the A-loop were found to be required for neural differentiation, two residues adjacent to the A-loop (Tyr677 and Tyr701) were required for induction of PC12 cell differentiation by the chimeric receptors. These residues may function to stabilize the A-loop in an active conformation following ligand binding. A full-length cDNA clone (p31) encoding a 2-Ig loop form of FGFR1 was obtained from a PC12 cDNA library in λ ZAP (Stratagene). The library was screened with a cDNA probe encompassing the extracellular domain of human FGFR1 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Jaye). The clone was sequenced by the dideoxy method using Sequenase and by automated sequencing on an ABI sequencer. As described previously (18Foehr E.D. Raffioni S. Fujii R. Bradshaw R.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the naturally occurring 5′ EcoRI and 3′ MseI cDNA fragment of human PDGFR-β encoding the N-terminal extracellular domain was ligated with a 5′MseI site introduced by polymerase chain reaction at the extracellular/transmembrane junction of the cDNA encloding the rFGFR1 intracellular domain and flanked by a 3′ EcoRI site, also introduced by polymerase chain reaction. The construct, designated PFR1, was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pCMV for mutagenesis and transient expression in 293 cells. Stable transfection into PC12 cells was accomplished with a retroviral vector (see below). Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were generated using theCLONTECH Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit. The substitutions were performed with only single base pair changes. All PFR1 cDNA constructs used in this study were sequenced to confirm that the site-directed mutagenesis was correct. Stable transfections were performed as described previously (18Foehr E.D. Raffioni S. Fujii R. Bradshaw R.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the viral packaging cell line GP+e86 was transfected with the pLEN-PFR1 constructs by the calcium phosphate method. After 2 days, media from retroviral producing GP+e86 cells was filtered (0.45 μm) and added to PC12 cells. After 24 h, PC12 cells were subjected to G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) selection until individual colonies could be selected. PFR1 expressing PC12 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% plasma derived fetal calf serum, 5% plasma-derived horse serum (Cocalico), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). To quantitate the level of differentiation, PFR1 expressing PC12 cell lines were seeded at a density of 1 × 105cells/well on collagen (Collaborative Research)-coated 6-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% plasma-derived horse serum. Cells expressing PFR1 or mock-transfected cells were stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Austral) or with medium alone as a control. The kinetics and extent of neurite outgrowth was measured as the percentage of cells with neurites greater than two cell bodies in length at specified times. Protein was extracted from cells in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaC1, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmNa3VO4) and quantitated. One mg of lysate was immunoprecipited with antibody prior to addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed three times in lysis buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE before electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For immunoblot analysis, the membranes were blocked at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and blotted with primary antibodies. The membranes were washed in TBS and probed with the appropriated horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After three washes in TBS the bands were visualized by ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Before the membranes were reprobed, they were stripped in 0.2 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.l5, 0.05% Tween 20 at 80 °C. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis include anti-FGFR1, PY20, anti-SOS, and anti-PLCγ, which were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the anti-Grb2, anti-Shc, and p13suc-agarose was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-PDGFR antibody used for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Genzyme, and anti-PDGFR antibody used for immunoblot analysis was purchased from Austral. Cells were incubated in eukaryotic lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGFRβ (R & D Systems) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glycerol-2-phosphate, o.1 mm Na3VO4, 4 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm ATP), resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (6000 ci/mmol). The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-FGFR1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine the relative amount of immunoprecipitated chimera. The rat FGFR1 clone (p31) selected to prepare the chimeras used in this study was isolated from a PC12 cDNA library in λ ZAP. This clone was characterized by a 2-Ig domain ectodomain and a Thr-Val insert in the juxtamembrane region. This motif has been shown to be a protein kinase C site that is important for the regulation of receptor activity in a splice variant from Xenopus embryos. Several clones judged to contain 3-Ig domain structures from size considerations were identified but not sequenced. 2S. Raffioni, unpublished data. A comparison of the transmembrane and endodomains of the p31 sequence to those of two other rat FGFR1 clones revealed that they were identical to those of a rat kidney FGFR1 clone (GenBankTM accession no. 554008) (except for the absence of the Val-Thr insert) but differed from a rat brain sequence (GenBankTM accession no. D12498) at five sites (Table I). Two of these sites involve tyrosine residues (Tyr701 and Tyr776). Thus, the brain isoform contains only 13 tyrosine residues in the endodomain as compared with the 15 found in the kidney and PC12 versions.Table IComparison of endodomain sequences of rat FGFR1Position1-aNumbering conforms to human FGFR1 sequence.Brain (D12498)1-bProtein sequence accession number.Kidney (S54008)1-bProtein sequence accession number.PC12 Cells (p31)427ValVal428ThrThr701AsnTyrTyr738AsnHisHis776AspTyrTyr801PheLeuLeu819AsnLysLys1-a Numbering conforms to human FGFR1 sequence.1-b Protein sequence accession number. Open table in a new tab The tyrosine residues have been numbered in this report to correspond to those of human FGFR1 (GenBankTM accession no. P11362) or the 3-Ig domain rat receptor). They do not correspond to the true sequential positions in the chimera (as the PDGFR ectodomain is larger than that of hFGFR1) or the 2-Ig loop sequence of p31. However, using the hFGFR1 numbers allows a direct comparison to several previous studies of FGFR1 and avoids the confusion of multiple numbering systems. PFR1, constructed from the p31 clone, contains 15 tyrosines in the endodomain as illustrated at the top of Fig. 1. In studies with hFGFR1 (and a recombinant kinase domain derivative), Mohammadi et al. (15Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) identified six phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Tyr463, Tyr583, Tyr585, Tyr653, Tyr654, and Tyr730) in the activated receptor. Tyr766 was previously identified as a seventh site (8Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. DelRosario M. Mirada D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These sites are marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1. To evaluate the contributions of all of the endodomain tyrosine residues to the signaling potential of PFR1, and by extrapolation of FGFR1, they were converted to phenylalanine, a substitution normally expected to maintain hydrophobic integrity but lacking the opportunity for post-translational modification or H-bonding capacity. To facilitate these changes, the tyrosine residues were subdivided into four blocs, denoted A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1). Blocs A and B contained four tyrosine sites, and D, five sites. The C bloc comprised only the pair of tyrosines that are situated in the A-loop and whose combined phosphorylation stabilizes the active form of the kinase (5Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The Tyr to Phe mutations were introduced en bloc and the resulting derivatives stably transfected into PC12 cells. These are designated by the bloc and number of residues modified, e.g. PFR1 A4 indicates all of the tyrosine residues of the A bloc have been converted to phenylalanine (Fig. 1). The effect of the Tyr to Phe mutations in blocs A, B, C, and D, singly and in various combinations, on the biological response (neurite outgrowth) of the stably transfected cells is shown in Fig.2A. All of the cells examined showed a moderate ligand-induced decrease in activity (after 48 h) as compared with unmodified PFR1, but the derivatives with modified A or B blocs (or both) eventually achieved full differentiation (data not shown). In contrast, all of the derivatives in which either the first four (D4) or all five (D5) tyrosines of the D bloc had been modified (D4, A4/D4, B4/D4, A4/B4/D4, and A4/B4/D5) were inactive. As expected, the C2 derivative, with all of the other 13 tyrosines of the endodomain intact, was also inactive. These results establish that none of the total of eight tyrosine residues in the N-terminal portion of the kinase domain (including the juxtamembrane sequence and kinase insert) are essential, although the derivatives lacking some or all of these residues are modestly less active than the native (PFR1) receptor (Fig.2A). At the same time, the results indicate that one or more of the first four residues of the D bloc (Tyr677, Tyr701, Tyr730, and Tyr766) is required. To more specifically evaluate the contributions of the D bloc tyrosines, which clearly strongly affect neurite outgrowth activity, a total of 18 constructs (Fig. 3) with each site converted from Tyr to Phe in single, double, or triple combinations were prepared using the A4/B4 construct as a parent. These were stably transfected into PC12 cells and each derivative tested for neurite production by PDGF. The results of these assays are shown in Fig. 2B. The five tyrosines in the D bloc were numbered 1 to 5 (consecutively) for identification and correspond to Tyr677, Tyr701, Tyr730, Tyr766, and Tyr776 (see Fig. 1). Thus, PFR1 A4/B4/D1-1 (designated simply D1-1 in Figs.2B and 3) indicates the derivative in which the first tyrosine of the D bloc (Tyr630) has been converted to phenylalanine (along with the eight residues of blocs A and B). The individual substitution of each of the D bloc tyrosines (the D1 set marked 1F in Fig. 2B) has variable affects on the differentiative activity of the stably transfected chimeras after 48 h. The derivatives with substitutions at Tyr677 or Tyr701 (D1-1 or D1-2, respectively) showed substantially decreased activity (∼10–20% of control); the other three derivatives (Y730F, Y766F, and Y776F) showed activity of about 50% of control. Two of these latter residues (Tyr730 and Tyr766) are phosphorylated when FGFR1 is activated (15Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The pairwise substitutions of the D bloc tyrosines (the D2 set marked2F in Fig. 2B) further supports the view that the substitution of the first two tyrosines (Tyr677 and Tyr701) by phenylalanine is responsible for the loss of activity of the various D4 and D5 derivatives (Fig. 2A). The D2-12 derivative is inactive, whereas the D2-34 derivative is about as active as the chimeras with the single substitutions of these residues. The fifth tyrosine (Tyr776) does not make a significant contribution because the triple mutant (D3-345) in which this residue is also altered is almost as active as the D2-34 derivative (Fig.2B). The particular importance of Tyr701 is emphasized in the observations that every chimera with a double or triple substitution that includes the Y701F mutation is inactive. However, the derivative that contains only Tyr701 (D3-134) is also inactive. (Although these derivatives also contain tyrosine D1-5 (Tyr776), this residue clearly makes no contribution;cf. D2-13 with D3-135 and D2-34 with D3-345, which have effectively the same activities (Fig. 2B)). The low but quite significant activity of D3-135 as compared with D3-134 suggests that tyrosine Tyr766, which has been shown to be the site of PLCγ activation (8Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. DelRosario M. Mirada D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), may contribute somewhat to differentiation (presumably via PLCγ activation) when the level of FRS2 activation is lowered significantly (see below). This would also explain the comparable activation of D2-13 and D2-5 (with D3-135) and the very low activity of D2-4. To correlate the cellular responses with receptor-associated molecular events, several of the stably transfected cell lines were examined with respect to receptor autophosphorylation following PDGF stimulation and by in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig.4A and B, receptor autophosphorylation as measured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of anti-FGFR1-treated PC12 cell lysates closely paralleled the neurite proliferation activities (Fig. 2). Only the A4/B4/D2-23 derivative, which was inactive in the differentiation assay, showed significant autophosphorylation. Interestingly, the amount of modification observed was also generally comparable with the bioactivity even though these measurements are not strictly quantitative. A more sensitive in vitro kinase assay was also used to examine the autophosphorylation of the A4/B4/D2-12 derivatives (Fig.4C). As expected, the C2 chimera did not show any capacity for autophosphorylation in this test either. However, both the D4 and D2-12 derivatives were clearly weakly but significantly labeled. The similar level of modification suggests that it is the C2 tyrosines that are modified (rather than the D3 or D4 tyrosines that are absent in the A4/B4/D4 chimera). These findings also indicate that these (and probably all of the various D bloc mutants) are properly folded as they have low but detectable levels of catalytic activity. The ability of the various PFR1 tyrosine derivatives to activate FGFR1-sensitive signaling pathways was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of cell lysates following PDGF stimulation.

A tandem duplication of the Factor Xa protease cleavage site (IEGRIEGR) was inserted into the central cytoplasmic loop of an OxlT cysteine-less derivative in which an endogenous cleavage site had been eliminated by mutagenesis (R248Q). Using this host, double cysteine derivatives were constructed so as to pair one of seventeen positions in TM2 with one of four positions in TM11. Following treatment of membrane vesicles with Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)(3), molecular iodine, or N,N'-o-phenylenedimaleimide, samples were exposed to Factor Xa, and disulfide bond formation was assessed after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by staining with antibody directed against the OxlT C terminus. In the absence of disulfide bond formation, exposure to Factor Xa revealed the expected C-terminal 22-kDa fragment, a result unaffected by the presence of reductant. By contrast, after disulfide formation, OxlT mobility remained at 35 kDa, and appearance of the 22-kDa fragment required addition of 200 mm dithiothreitol prior to electrophoresis. The four TM11 positions chosen for cysteine substitution lie on a helical face known to interact with substrate. Similarly, TM2 positions supporting disulfide trapping were also confined to a single helical face. We conclude that TM2 and TM11 are in close juxtaposition to one another in the tertiary structure of OxlT."

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). Prochlorophytes represent a deeply branched group of cyanobacteria containing both chlorophyll a and b (10Matthijs H.C.P. van der Staay G.W.M. Mur L.R. Bryant D.A.

Evol. 1995; 12: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that Prochlorothrix Pc reacts with PSI according to a two-step reaction mechanism involving complex formation and electron transfer, the complex being mainly hydrophobic in nature. Cytochrome c6, in its turn, follows a three-step reaction mechanism with rearrangement of redox partners within an intermediate electrostatic complex before electron transfer (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). Such a difference in the kinetic mechanisms reflects interesting differences not only in electrostatic charge surface distribution but also in dynamic properties.The solution structure of Prochlorothrix Pc has been recently solved by NMR spectroscopy (12Babu C.R. Volkman B.F. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4988-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively low number of conserved residues shared with other Pcs, theProchlorothrix molecule has a similar overall folding pattern, including the classical two-sheet β-barrel tertiary structure. Interestingly, Prochlorothrix Pc has an altered hydrophobic patch, a region that is thought to be crucial in Pc interaction with its redox counterparts. Whereas the backbone and loops at the hydrophobic area of Prochlorothrix Pc are as those of other Pc molecules, the presence of two unique residues (Tyr-12 and Pro-14 in Prochlorothrix Pc versus Gly-10 and Leu-12 in all other Pcs) yields a structurally different hydrophobic surface, with Tyr-12 protruding outwards from this patch (12Babu C.R. Volkman B.F. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4988-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In this paper, we are extending our previous studies ofProchlorothrix PSI reduction by wild-type (WT) Pc to analyze the reactivity of Pc mutants at Tyr-12 and Pro-14. The laser-flash absorption spectroscopy analyses herein reported indicate that the replacement of Pro-14 by leucine, which is the “standard” residue in all other Pcs, makes the copper protein react much more efficiently with PSI.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe two variant residues at the hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix Pc, namely Tyr-12 and Pro-14 (Fig.1), were chosen to be mutated to investigate their role in the reactivity of the copper protein toward PSI. By studying the properties of this natural variant of Pc, the minimum structural requirements for complex formation and efficient electron transfer to PSI could be investigated. Tyrosine at position 12 was thus replaced with two different aromatic residues, phenylalanine and tryptophan, as well as with glycine, the latter being a conserved residue at this position in virtually all known sequences of Pc. Additionally, proline at position 14 was replaced with leucine, which is also a conserved residue in all other Pcs. A double mutant with reversion of both tyrosine and proline to the standard residues glycine and leucine, respectively, was likewise constructed.Description of the Mutant PlastocyaninsMost of the mutations do not significantly alter the midpoint redox potential value of the copper protein, with the exception of the P14L mutant and the Y12G/P14L double mutant, whose redox potentials are ∼15 mV lower (TableI). Thus, only those mutations affecting position 14 yield measurable changes in the environment of the copper center, and such changes in redox potential slightly increase the driving force for electron transfer to PSI. Nonetheless, such modifications do not significantly alter the electronic absorption spectra, as all mutant Pcs yield an absorption peak at 602 nm identical to the WT (13Babu C.R. Arudchandran A.

The dependence of the observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) upon donor protein concentration shows a saturation profile (Fig.2). This finding suggests the formation of a bimolecular transient Pc·PSI complex before electron transfer, as previously described for the WT system (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R.

Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4552-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Table I, there are no significant changes inKA with all mutants. This is in contrast to the results obtained from mutations at the amino-terminal patch of other Pcs, from which it has been inferred that both the hydrophobic and charged patches seem to be involved in the interaction of Pc with PSI (3Sigfridsson K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 1-28Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein-protein interactions mediating complex formation in Prochlorothrix are likely located elsewhere on the Pc surface. To check if the hydrophobic nature of the interaction between Pc and PSI in Prochlorothrix (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar) is altered by mutations, the kinetics of PSI reduction were also followed at varying ionic strength. As can be seen in Table I, none of the mutants shows significant changes in KA orket upon increasing salt concentration, as previously described for the WT Pc (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar).Concerning the electron transfer step, Table I shows that none of the mutations at position 12 significantly alters the efficiency of Pc in donating electrons to PSI, with the exception of the replacement of tyrosine by glycine, which induces a decrease of about 30% inket. These results suggest that inProchlorothrix Pc the surface conformation of the hydrophobic patch at position 12 is not essential for productive electron transfer. Much more drastic is the effect obtained by replacing proline at position 14 by leucine, as theket value increases up to three times with respect to the WT species (Table I). This can be explained in part by assuming that Pro-14 in some way distorts the interaction site, its replacement thus making the copper site be ∼1-Å closer to the acceptor (23Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar).Indeed, modeling the hydrophobic patch of the P14L mutant protein suggests subtle alterations in the position of His-85 relative to the WT (Fig. 3). MD calculations also reveal alterations in the copper site, yielding a 0.25-Å displacement of the axial copper ligand Cys-82 in the P14L mutant compared with the WT (Fig. 4). This conformational change is confirmed by the complementary 0.2-Å displacement of the axial ligand, Met-90 (Fig. 4, bottom). By contrast, MD calculations do not reveal such pronounced alterations in the His ligands of the copper center (Table II). Overall, such structural changes may be the basis for the slightly lower redox potential of the leucine mutant. This small increase in driving force may also contribute to the increasedket. Additionally, residues Tyr-12, Met-33, and Ala-88 in or near the hydrophobic patch also exhibit structural alterations that may affect donor-acceptor distance (summarized in Table II). Last, the double mutant Y12G/P14L behaves as expected from the compensating effect of individual mutations. In fact, this mutant yields a ket value that doubles that with WT and is 67% that with the single mutant P14L, a decrease that compares fairly well with that observed with the single mutant Y12G with respect to WT (see above).Figure 3Comparison of the structures of the wild-type and P14L mutant hydrophobic patches.

Open table in a new tab Electron Transfer Kinetics to Heterospecific Photosystem IIt has been previously reported that Prochlorothrix WT Pc does not form any electron transfer complex with PSI from either spinach or the cyanobacteria Anabaena and Synechocystis. The copper protein does exhibit a very low reactivity in all cross-reactions (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). Because the mutants constructed in this study are aimed to revert the “exclusive” hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix to the standard configuration, we have also checked the reactivity of mutants toward heterospecific PSI. In all cases, linear dependences were observed when plotting the observed rate constants versus protein concentration, as shown in Fig.5 for Synechocystis PSI. Because no complex formation was observed, the bimolecular rate constants (k2) for PSI reduction were calculated (Table III). Replacement of Pro-14 with leucine makes the bimolecular rate constant of PSI reduction both with eukaryotic and prokaryotic photosystems increase by 1 order of magnitude. Whereas the mutants at Tyr-12, including that with the reversion to the standard glycine, do not significantly change their reactivity, the double mutant Y12G/P14L shows a significant increased efficiency with spinach PSI and minor changes with cyanobacterial photosystems (Table III). Relatively small increases in reactivity are also observed with the mutant Y12W. These results with mutants at position 12 are in clear contrast with the previously proposed requirement for a flat surface in the area of Gly-12 at the hydrophobic patch of Pc to ensure efficient electron transfer to PSI (24Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In case of cross-reactions with Synechocystis PSI, the mutant P14L was shown to be even more reactive than the Synechocystis WT Pc (Fig. 5 and Table III). Overall, these observations provide some agreement with the suggestion made by Sigfridsson and co-workers (25Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that replacement of leucine in higher plant Pc with the less bulky alanine decreased ket despite a modest increase in the driving force (0.024 eV) for electron transfer to P700. These authors suggested that a bulky hydrophobic residue might yield a better fit to PSI (25Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Figure 5Dependence of the observed rate constant (kobs) for Synechocystisphotosystem I reduction by Prochlorothrixwild-type and mutated plastocyanins as well as bySynechocystis plastocyanin upon donor protein concentration.

Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Concluding RemarksThe fact that WT Pc fromProchlorothrix possesses a residue that is impairing its redox interaction with its physiological electron acceptor may indicate that this organism is using a divergent protein that appeared before evolution selected for leucine at position 14. We can thus say that reversion of Pro-14 to the standard leucine makesProchlorothrix Pc much more reactive toward PSI from any organism, including Prochlorothrix.Last, the influence of distance versus driving force for the enhanced reactivity observed with the P14L mutant should be addressed. Given the fact that the driving force in the mutant increased by 0.015 eV, ket would be expected to increase slightly (∼30%) (26Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) via this parameter alone. However, the large (10-fold) increases in k2 seen in reactions with spinach and Synechocystis PSI suggest that a decrease in distance to the acceptor in the mutant plays an important role in enhancing electron transport. Plastocyanin (Pc)1 is a small redox protein (molecular mass, ∼10.5 kDa) that functions in photosynthesis as a mobile electron carrier between the two membrane-embedded complexes cytochromeb6f and photosystem I (PSI) (1Chitnis P.R. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 11-22Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Sigfridsson K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 1-28Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whereas higher plants produce just Pc, there is a number of intermediate species, both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, that are able to synthesize cytochrome c6 as an alternative redox carrier under copper deficiency (4Ho K.K. Krogmann D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 310-316Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The interaction between these two metalloproteins and PSI has been studied by laser-flash absorption spectroscopy in a wide variety of evolutionarily differentiated organisms, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (5Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All these comparative kinetic analyses have allowed us to propose different reaction mechanisms for PSI reduction (7Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, a comparative analysis of the interaction of Pc and cytochrome c6 with PSI from the prochlorophyteProchlorothrix hollandica has been carried out (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). Prochlorophytes represent a deeply branched group of cyanobacteria containing both chlorophyll a and b (10Matthijs H.C.P. van der Staay G.W.M. Mur L.R. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 49-64Google Scholar, 11Nelissen B. Van der Peer Y. Wilmotte A. De Wachter R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that Prochlorothrix Pc reacts with PSI according to a two-step reaction mechanism involving complex formation and electron transfer, the complex being mainly hydrophobic in nature. Cytochrome c6, in its turn, follows a three-step reaction mechanism with rearrangement of redox partners within an intermediate electrostatic complex before electron transfer (9Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). Such a difference in the kinetic mechanisms reflects interesting differences not only in electrostatic charge surface distribution but also in dynamic properties. The solution structure of Prochlorothrix Pc has been recently solved by NMR spectroscopy (12Babu C.R. Volkman B.F. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4988-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively low number of conserved residues shared with other Pcs, theProchlorothrix molecule has a similar overall folding pattern, including the classical two-sheet β-barrel tertiary structure. Interestingly, Prochlorothrix Pc has an altered hydrophobic patch, a region that is thought to be crucial in Pc interaction with its redox counterparts. Whereas the backbone and loops at the hydrophobic area of Prochlorothrix Pc are as those of other Pc molecules, the presence of two unique residues (Tyr-12 and Pro-14 in Prochlorothrix Pc versus Gly-10 and Leu-12 in all other Pcs) yields a structurally different hydrophobic surface, with Tyr-12 protruding outwards from this patch (12Babu C.R. Volkman B.F. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4988-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this paper, we are extending our previous studies ofProchlorothrix PSI reduction by wild-type (WT) Pc to analyze the reactivity of Pc mutants at Tyr-12 and Pro-14. The laser-flash absorption spectroscopy analyses herein reported indicate that the replacement of Pro-14 by leucine, which is the “standard” residue in all other Pcs, makes the copper protein react much more efficiently with PSI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe two variant residues at the hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix Pc, namely Tyr-12 and Pro-14 (Fig.1), were chosen to be mutated to investigate their role in the reactivity of the copper protein toward PSI. By studying the properties of this natural variant of Pc, the minimum structural requirements for complex formation and efficient electron transfer to PSI could be investigated. Tyrosine at position 12 was thus replaced with two different aromatic residues, phenylalanine and tryptophan, as well as with glycine, the latter being a conserved residue at this position in virtually all known sequences of Pc. Additionally, proline at position 14 was replaced with leucine, which is also a conserved residue in all other Pcs. A double mutant with reversion of both tyrosine and proline to the standard residues glycine and leucine, respectively, was likewise constructed.Description of the Mutant PlastocyaninsMost of the mutations do not significantly alter the midpoint redox potential value of the copper protein, with the exception of the P14L mutant and the Y12G/P14L double mutant, whose redox potentials are ∼15 mV lower (TableI). Thus, only those mutations affecting position 14 yield measurable changes in the environment of the copper center, and such changes in redox potential slightly increase the driving force for electron transfer to PSI. Nonetheless, such modifications do not significantly alter the electronic absorption spectra, as all mutant Pcs yield an absorption peak at 602 nm identical to the WT (13Babu C.R. Arudchandran A.

https://openalex.org/W1993084990,"Alkylisocyanide adducts of microsomal P450 exist in two interconvertible forms, each giving the Soret maximum around 430 or 455 nm. This is demonstrated with a rabbit liver P450 2B4. Resonance Raman spectra of the 430- and 455-nm forms were examined for typical P450s of the two types as well as for P450 2B4 because the 430-nm form of P450 2B4 is liable to change into P420. P450cam and P450nor were selected as a model of the 430- and 455-nm forms, respectively. For the n-butyl isocyanide (CNBu) adduct, the Fe(II)-CNBu stretching band was observed for the first time at 480/467 cm(-1) for P450cam and at 471/459 cm(-1) for P450nor with their (12)CNBu/(13)CNBu derivatives. For P450cam, but not P450nor, other (13)C isotope-sensitive bands were observed at 412/402, 844/835, and 940/926 cm(-1). The C-N stretching mode was identified by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy at 2116/2080 cm(-1) for P450cam and at 2148/2108 cm(-1) for P450nor for the (12)C/(13)C derivatives. These findings suggest that the binding geometry of isocyanide differs between the two forms-bent and linear structures for P450cam-CNBu and P450nor-CNBu, respectively. In contrast, in the ferric state, the Raman (13)C isotopic frequency shifts, and the IR C-N stretching frequencies (2213/2170 and 2215/2172 cm(-1)) were similar between P450cam and P450nor, suggesting similar bent structures for both."
