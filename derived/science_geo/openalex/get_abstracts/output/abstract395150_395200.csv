Synaptically effective gliotransmission requires basal levels of endogenous TNFα GPCR-evoked Ca2+ rises in astrocytic processes are unchanged in TNFα null mice -TNFα specifically controls the glutamate release step of gliotransmission Limiting glutamate uptake “rescues” defective gliotransmission in TNFα null mice There are several indications that glial cells participate in the physiological control of synaptic transmission and plasticity via the release of synaptically effective mediators, a process called gliotransmission (reviewed in Perea et al., 2009Perea G.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4967-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We identified a positive astrocytic control at perforant path (PP)-granule cell (GC) synapses in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Firing of PP afferents triggers intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) elevations in nearby astrocytes of the dentate molecular layer (ML). Astrocytes respond robustly to trains of evoked action potentials, but are also activated by sparse endogenous PP firing activity occurring in the slices in the absence of external stimulation. Intriguingly, part of the synaptically evoked astrocytic [Ca2+]i elevations are mediated by purinergic P2Y1 receptors (P2Y1R), which in the ML are expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in astrocytes, notably in the processes surrounding excitatory synapses (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). As a consequence of P2Y1R-dependent [Ca2+]i elevation, glutamate is released from astrocytes via a mechanism which is sensitive to blockers of neuronal exocytosis (Domercq et al., 2006Domercq M. Brambilla L. Pilati E. Marchaland J. Volterra A. Bezzi P. P2Y1 receptor-evoked glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes: control by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and prostaglandins.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30684-30696Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and induces potentiation of excitatory transmission at PP-GC synapses. This glial glutamatergic control operates under physiological conditions, as its blockade reduces basal EPSC activity in GCs evoked by endogenous PP firing (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) and is mediated by a presynaptic mechanism involving stimulation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Indeed, both functional and ultrastructural evidence indicates that such receptors are located presynaptically, in the extrasynaptic portion of excitatory nerve terminals making synapses onto GCs (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat.

Presynaptic NMDA receptors: newly appreciated roles in cortical synaptic function and plasticity.Neuroscientist. 2008; 14: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. Interestingly, we found that presynaptic NR2B subunits generally face perisynaptic astrocytic processes containing groups of small vesicular organelles (synaptic-like microvesicles, SLMV; Bezzi et al., 2004Bezzi P. Gundersen V. Galbete J.L. Seifert G. Steinhäuser C. Pilati E. Volterra A. Astrocytes contain a vesicular compartment that is competent for regulated exocytosis of glutamate.Nat.

Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In immunogold experiments, astrocytic SLMV were shown to contain glutamate and express proteins for uptake and release of the amino acid, including vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) and the v-SNARE protein, VAMP3/cellubrevin (Bezzi et al., 2004Bezzi P. Gundersen V. Galbete J.L. Seifert G. Steinhäuser C. Pilati E. Volterra A. Astrocytes contain a vesicular compartment that is competent for regulated exocytosis of glutamate.Nat.

In spite of this ultrastructural information, the modalities and the regulation of astrocytic glutamate release in situ remain largely undefined.

Defining the role of astrocytes in neuromodulation.Neuron. 2007; 54: 497-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this context, we reported that the cytokine TNFα exerts a potent control on P2Y1R-evoked Ca2+-dependent glutamate exocytosis in cultured astrocytes (Domercq et al., 2006Domercq M. Brambilla L. Pilati E. Marchaland J. Volterra A. Bezzi P. P2Y1 receptor-evoked glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes: control by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and prostaglandins.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30684-30696Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Measures of glutamate release with a specific assay (Bezzi et al., 1998Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D.

Sanchez-Prieto J. Calcium-dependent and -independent release of glutamate from synaptosomes monitored by continuous fluorometry.J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) detected a dramatic reduction of the P2Y1R-evoked release in astrocyte cultures lacking TNFα signaling. The mechanism by which TNFα achieves this effect and the relevance of the TNFα-dependent control to the astrocyte-dependent synaptic potentiation in situ are unknown. TNFα is mostly regarded as a “proinflammatory” cytokine, produced by and acting in the brain in response to infection, injury, or disease (Gosselin and Rivest, 2007Gosselin D. Rivest S.

Astrocytes in the epileptic brain.Neuron. 2008; 58: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, TNFα is expressed also in the normal brain, albeit at much lower levels than during inflammatory reactions, and participates in homeostatic brain functions (Boulanger, 2009Boulanger L.M. Immune proteins in brain development and synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2009; 64: 93-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, Vitkovic et al., 2000Vitkovic L. Bockaert J. Jacque C. “Inflammatory” cytokines: Neuromodulators in normal brain?.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In particular, constitutive TNFα has recently been implicated in control of the stability of neuronal networks in response to prolonged changes in activity via the phenomenon of synaptic scaling (Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, Turrigiano, 2008Turrigiano G.G. The self-tuning neuron: Synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses.Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) and plays a specific role in ocular dominance plasticity upon monocular visual deprivation (Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The cytokine, released from astrocytes, was reported to strengthen excitatory synaptic transmission by promoting surface insertion of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits (Bains and Oliet, 2007Bains J.S. Oliet S.H. Glia: They make your memories stick!.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Beattie et al., 2002Beattie E.C. Stellwagen D.

Differential regulation of AMPA receptor and GABA receptor trafficking by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In the present study, we find that TNFα is also an obligatory factor for the induction of synaptically effective gliotransmission at GC synapses in the dentate gyrus, specifically controlling glutamate release from astrocytes. Notably, constitutive levels of the cytokine promote functional docking and rapid coordinated secretion of glutamatergic vesicles in cultured astrocytes. Indeed, TNFα most likely determines the kinetics of P2Y1R-dependent glutamate release in situ and the local extracellular concentration of the amino acid, a critical factor in the activation of pre-NMDAR and, ultimately, in the potentiation of GC synapses. To investigate the role of TNFα in astrocyte-dependent synaptic modulation in hippocampal dentate gyrus, we planned studies on Tnf−/− mice (Pasparakis et al., 1996Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Episkopou V. Kollias G. Immune and inflammatory responses in TNF alpha-deficient mice: A critical requirement for TNF alpha in the formation of primary B cell follicles, follicular dendritic cell networks and germinal centers, and in the maturation of the humoral immune response.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Our previous work in rats established that purinergic P2Y1R, strongly expressed in astrocytic processes around GC synapses, respond to stimulation with the agonist 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-diphosphate (2MeSADP, 10 μM) by inducing a highly reproducible increase in mEPSC frequency in GCs (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to utilize this stimulus paradigm and recorded mEPSCs from hippocampal dentate GCs in acute mouse hemibrain horizontal slices from P18–P23 mice. Recordings were performed 50–90 μm deep in the slices, where astrocytes and the patched GCs retained their integral tridimensional structures, as confirmed by two-photon imaging of cells fluorescently labeled with specific markers (Figure 1A ). Initially, we used slices from wild-type (WT) mice and applied 2MeSADP either by bath perfusion or locally, within the volume of the recorded GC, via pressure ejection from a micropipette. In both cases the P2Y1R agonist increased mEPSC frequency in GCs (bath application: +37% ± 11%; p < 0.05; n = 14 cells; local application: +32% ± 10%, p < 0.05; n = 7 cells), with no effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the currents (Figure 1B and see Figure S1 available online). The effect of the drug on mEPSC frequency was abolished in the presence of N6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate (MRS2179 10 μM; n = 7 cells), a P2Y1R blocker, confirming the specific involvement of this purinergic receptor subtype. MRS2179 per se had no effect on basal mEPSC frequency (Figure 1C). In order to verify the obligatory role of astrocyte [Ca2+]i elevation in the 2MeSADP synaptic effect, we repeated P2Y1R stimulations upon intracellular dialysis of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid (BAPTA, 10 mM) selectively into the astrocytes (Figure 1D). This treatment prevents [Ca2+]i rise in several gap-junction-connected astrocytes surrounding the synapses on the dendritic arbor of the patched GC (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In this situation, 2MeSADP never induced an increase in mEPSC frequency (n = 8 cells; Figure 1E). Finally, the 2MeSADP-evoked effect was found to depend on NMDAR activation. Thus, the increase in mEPSC frequency was abolished in the presence of ifenprodil (3 μM), a selective NR2B-containing NMDAR antagonist that per se had no effect on basal mEPSC frequency (n = 10 cells; Figure 1F). In conclusion, these experiments show that (1) P2Y1R activation induces, in mice, a gliotransmission cascade and synaptic effect on GCs similar to those previously observed in rats (Jourdain et al., 2007Jourdain P. Bergersen L.H. Bhaukaurally K. Bezzi P. Santello M. Domercq M. Matute C. Tonello F. Gundersen V. Volterra A. Glutamate exocytosis from astrocytes controls synaptic strength.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); (2) this astrocytic modulatory pathway is not endogenously activated by TTX-independent spontaneous synaptic release events at GC synapses, as indicated by the fact that neither MRS2179, nor BAPTA, nor ifenprodil affected basal mEPSC frequency. Next, we addressed the role of constitutive TNFα in astrocyte-evoked synaptic modulation, by testing the effect of 2MeSADP stimulation in slices from Tnf−/− mice. In basal conditions, frequency and amplitude of the mEPSC events in GCs were comparable to those observed in WT mice (Figure S2; Kaneko et al., 2008Kaneko M. Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Stryker M.P. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mediates one component of competitive, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Neuron. 2008; 58: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). However, application of 2MeSADP failed to produce the expected increase in mEPSC frequency (+5% ± 13%; n = 8 cells; Figure 2A ), suggesting that the presence of TNFα is necessary for astrocytic P2Y1R-evoked synaptic modulation. To confirm that the defect observed in Tnf−/− mice is specifically due to the absence of the cytokine, we preincubated Tnf−/− slices with low picomolar concentrations of recombinant TNFα (60–150 pM). In this condition, while basal mEPSC frequency did not change (Tnf−/−: 1.62 ± 0.26 Hz, n = 29 cells; Tnf−/− + TNFα: 1.64 ± 0.19 Hz; n = 13 cells), 2MeSADP application induced a selective increase in the number of mEPSC events, similar to its effect in WT slices (Figure 2B; +51% ± 22%; p < 0.05; n = 13 cells). Interestingly, in initial experiments we used prolonged TNFα preincubations (1–4 hr), but we then found that 15 min in the presence of the cytokine were sufficient to reconstitute the 2MeSADP effect. Preincubation of Tnf−/− slices with TNFα produced a second type of effect, on the amplitude of the mEPSC events, which was slightly but significantly increased in basal condition (Tnf−/−: 6.07 ± 0.26 pA, n = 29 cells; Tnf−/− + TNFα: 7.87 ± 0.52 pA; p < 0.05; n = 13 cells), but not further modified by 2MeSADP application. This P2Y1R-independent effect is strongly reminiscent of the effect ascribed to the control of AMPAR trafficking by TNFα in WT mice (Stellwagen et al., 2005Stellwagen D. Beattie E.C. Seo J.Y. Malenka R.C. Differential regulation of AMPA receptor and GABA receptor trafficking by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006Stellwagen D. Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). In a final set of experiments, we tested whether constitutive levels of endogenous TNFα control P2Y1R-dependent synaptic modulation in WT slices. To this end, we preincubated the slices with a scavenger for the cytokine, the soluble form of TNF receptor (sTNFR, 15 μg/ml). This manipulation, while not changing basal mEPSC activity (frequency: 1.70 ± 0.21 Hz; amplitude 6.49 ± 0.41 pA; n = 9 cells), fully prevented the stimulatory effect of 2MeSADP on mEPSC frequency (+6% ± 10%; n = 9 cells; Figure 2C). Overall, these data demonstrate that constitutive levels of TNFα are necessary for effective P2Y1R-dependent gliotransmission at PP-GC synapses and call for an understanding of the underlying mechanism. Several steps of the P2Y1R-dependent stimulus-secretion coupling in astrocytes could be the target of a tonic control by TNFα. At first we investigated GPCR-dependent signal-transduction leading to astrocyte [Ca2+]i elevation. Importantly, we have recently observed that the [Ca2+]i elevations responsible for the physiological P2Y1R-dependent control of presynaptic excitatory function occur locally in astrocytic processes apposed to PP-GC synapses (Chuquet et al., 2010Chuquet J. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Liaudet N. Bouvier D. Di Castro A. Volterra A. Fast and local calcium transients in astrocyte processes encode synaptic activity in the adult hippocampus.FENS Abstr. 2010; 5: 044.4Google Scholar). We therefore specifically studied P2Y1R-evoked Ca2+ signaling in astrocytic processes with two-photon microscopy and compared local Ca2+ responses to agonist stimulation in WT and Tnf−/− slices. Experiments were performed on individual passive dentate ML astrocytes (see also Figure 1D for electrophysiological profile) dialyzed with a solution containing a Ca2+ indicator (Fluo-4 pentapotassium, 200 μM) and a Ca2+-insensitive morphological dye (Texas Red dextran 3000, TxR, 150 μM; Figure 3A ). Local Ca2+ activity in individual astrocytic processes, expressed as ΔG/R, was analyzed upon extracting the process of interest from the rest of the TxR image and subdividing it in many contiguous subregions (SRs) of similar area (9.2 ± 0.83 μm2; Figure 3A) by use of a custom-made program (see details in Experimental Procedures). Appropriate conditions for focal P2Y1R stimulation were set by controlling duration (5 ms), pressure (4 psi) and distance of delivery (3–8 μm) of 2MeSADP (10 μM) puffs from a pipette positioned in the vicinity of the monitored astrocytic process. In WT slices, this protocol of focal 2MeSADP application produced fast [Ca2+]i elevations (Figures 3B and 3C), seen immediately after the stimulus (average time to peak: 0.82 ± 0.15 s, n = 10; Figure 3E), that were spatially restrained to a few micrometers (on average 8.6 ± 0.9 μm2; range 5–16 μm2; n = 10) in the astrocytic process, normally corresponding to an individual SR. In a few cases, the signal also invaded contiguous SRs (range 27–55 μm2; WT: n = 3). The specificity of these localized Ca2+ events was confirmed by the fact that (1) identical puffs of buffer solution did not evoke any [Ca2+]i elevation (n = 3); (2) 2MeSADP-induced events were abolished in the presence of the P2Y1R antagonist MRS2179 and restored upon its washout (Figure 3D). The characteristics of 2MeSADP-evoked events, including their fast kinetics (Figure 3E), are consistent with those of the P2Y1R-dependent events evoked in astrocyte processes by endogenous synaptic activity (Chuquet et al., 2010Chuquet J. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Liaudet N. Bouvier D. Di Castro A. Volterra A. Fast and local calcium transients in astrocyte processes encode synaptic activity in the adult hippocampus.FENS Abstr. 2010; 5: 044.4Google Scholar). Importantly, when we repeated the experiments in Tnf−/− astrocytes, we could not find any significant difference in the Ca2+ responses to 2MeSADP puffs with respect to WT astrocytes in any of the parameters analyzed, including percentage of responding processes, delay of the responses, their amplitude, and kinetics (Figure 3E; WT: n = 10, Tnf−/−: n = 9). These results show that TNFα does not control P2Y1R-dependent [Ca2+]i elevations in astrocytic processes. Hence, lack of synaptic efficacy in Tnf−/− slices cannot be directly ascribed to a defect in the P2Y1R-dependent Ca2+ signaling underlying stimulus-secretion coupling in astrocytes. We therefore went on to investigate whether TNFα acts downstream to P2Y1R-evoked [Ca2+]i elevations, in the Ca2+ dependent process leading to glutamate release from astrocytes. We initially turned to studies in cell cultures, where P2Y1R activation has been established to trigger glutamate release via vesicular exocytosis (Bowser and Khakh, 2007Bowser D.N. Khakh B.S.

https://openalex.org/W2132739539,"Adolescence is often described as a period of heightened reactivity to emotions paired with reduced regulatory capacities, a combination suggested to contribute to risk-taking and susceptibility to peer influence during puberty. However, no longitudinal research has definitively linked these behavioral changes to underlying neural development. Here, 38 neurotypical participants underwent two fMRI sessions across the transition from late childhood (10 years) to early adolescence (13 years). Responses to affective facial displays exhibited a combination of general and emotion-specific changes in ventral striatum (VS), ventromedial PFC, amygdala, and temporal pole. Furthermore, VS activity increases correlated with decreases in susceptibility to peer influence and risky behavior. VS and amygdala responses were also significantly more negatively coupled in early adolescence than in late childhood while processing sad and happy versus neutral faces. Together, these results suggest that VS responses to viewing emotions may play a regulatory role that is critical to adolescent interpersonal functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2091408025,"Background The recent completion of the swine genome sequencing project and development of a high density porcine SNP array has made genome-wide association (GWA) studies feasible in pigs. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Illumina's PorcineSNP60 BeadChip, we performed a pilot GWA study in 820 commercial female pigs phenotyped for backfat, loin muscle area, body conformation in addition to feet and leg (FL) structural soundness traits. A total of 51,385 SNPs were jointly fitted using Bayesian techniques as random effects in a mixture model that assumed a known large proportion (99.5%) of SNPs had zero effect. SNP annotations were implemented through the Sus scrofa Build 9 available from pig Ensembl. We discovered a number of candidate chromosomal regions, and some of them corresponded to QTL regions previously reported. We not only have identified some well-known candidate genes for the traits of interest, such as MC4R (for backfat) and IGF2 (for loin muscle area), but also obtained novel promising genes, including CHCHD3 (for backfat), BMP2 (for loin muscle area, body size and several FL structure traits), and some HOXA family genes (for overall leg action). The candidate regions responsible for body conformation and FL structure soundness did not overlap greatly which implied that these traits were controlled by different genes. Functional clustering analyses classified the genes into categories related to bone and cartilage development, muscle growth and development or the insulin pathway suggesting the traits are regulated by common pathways or gene networks that exert roles at different spatial and temporal stages. Conclusions/Significance This study is one of the earliest GWA reports on important quantitative traits in pigs, and the findings will contribute to the further biological function analysis of the identified candidate genes and potential utilization of them in marker assisted selection."
https://openalex.org/W2061360146,"Could it be possible that, in the not-so-distant future, we will be able to reshape the human body so as to have extra limbs? A third arm helping us out with the weekly shopping in the local grocery store, or an extra artificial limb assisting a paralysed person? Here we report a perceptual illusion in which a rubber right hand, placed beside the real hand in full view of the participant, is perceived as a supernumerary limb belonging to the participant's own body. This effect was supported by questionnaire data in conjunction with physiological evidence obtained from skin conductance responses when physically threatening either the rubber hand or the real one. In four well-controlled experiments, we demonstrate the minimal required conditions for the elicitation of this “supernumerary hand illusion”. In the fifth, and final experiment, we show that the illusion reported here is qualitatively different from the traditional rubber hand illusion as it is characterised by less disownership of the real hand and a stronger feeling of having two right hands. These results suggest that the artificial hand ‘borrows’ some of the multisensory processes that represent the real hand, leading to duplication of touch and ownership of two right arms. This work represents a major advance because it challenges the traditional view of the gross morphology of the human body as a fundamental constraint on what we can come to experience as our physical self, by showing that the body representation can easily be updated to incorporate an additional limb."
https://openalex.org/W2105823026,"It is necessary to understand mechanisms by which differentiating agents influence tumor-initiating cancer stem cells. Toward this end, we investigated the cellular and molecular responses of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GBM-SCs) to all-trans retinoic acid (RA). GBM-SCs were grown as non-adherent neurospheres in growth factor supplemented serum-free medium. RA treatment rapidly induced morphology changes, induced growth arrest at G1/G0 to S transition, decreased cyclin D1 expression and increased p27 expression. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis indicated that RA induced the expression of lineage-specific differentiation markers Tuj1 and GFAP and reduced the expression of neural stem cell markers such as CD133, Msi-1, nestin and Sox-2. RA treatment dramatically decreased neurosphere-forming capacity, inhibited the ability of neurospheres to form colonies in soft agar and inhibited their capacity to propagate subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts. Expression microarray analysis identified ∼350 genes that were altered within 48 h of RA treatment. Affected pathways included retinoid signaling and metabolism, cell-cycle regulation, lineage determination, cell adhesion, cell-matrix interaction and cytoskeleton remodeling. Notch signaling was the most prominent of these RA-responsive pathways. Notch pathway downregulation was confirmed based on the downregulation of HES and HEY family members. Constitutive activation of Notch signaling with the Notch intracellular domain rescued GBM neurospheres from the RA-induced differentiation and stem cell depletion. Our findings identify mechanisms by which RA targets GBM-derived stem-like tumor-initiating cells and novel targets applicable to differentiation therapies for glioblastoma."

Whereas neuroprotective effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been described, the effects of DHA on the physiology of EC neurons remain unexplored in animal models of AD. Here, we show that DHA consumption improved object recognition (↑12%), preventing deficits observed in old 3xTg-AD mice (↓12%). Moreover, 3xTg-AD mice displayed seizure-like akinetic episodes, not detected in NonTg littermates and partly prevented by DHA (↓50%). Patch-clamp recording revealed that 3xTg-AD EC neurons displayed (i) loss of cell capacitance (CC), suggesting reduced membrane surface area; (ii) increase of firing rate versus injected current (F-I) curve associated with modified action potentials, and (iii) overactivation of glutamatergic synapses, without changes in synaptophysin levels. DHA consumption increased CC (↑12%) and decreased F-I slopes (↓21%), thereby preventing the opposite alterations observed in 3xTg-AD mice. Our results indicate that cognitive performance and basic physiology of EC neurons depend on DHA intake in a mouse model of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2032386899,"Mice with thyroid-specific expression of oncogenic BRAF (Tg-Braf) develop papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) that are locally invasive and have well-defined foci of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). To investigate the PTC–PDTC progression, we performed a microarray analysis using RNA from paired samples of PDTC and PTC collected from the same animals by laser capture microdissection. Analysis of eight paired samples revealed a profound deregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and intracellular junctions, with changes consistent with an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, as vimentin expression was increased and E-cadherin lost in PDTC compared with adjacent PTC. Moreover, PDTC stained positively for phospho-Smad2, suggesting a role for transforming growth factor (TGF)β in mediating this process. Accordingly, TGFβ-induced EMT in primary cultures of thyroid cells from Tg-Braf mice, whereas wild-type thyroid cells retained their epithelial features. TGFβ-induced Smad2 phosphorylation, transcriptional activity and induction of EMT required mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation in Tg-Braf thyrocytes. Hence, tumor initiation by oncogenic BRAF renders thyroid cells susceptible to TGFβ-induced EMT, through a MAPK-dependent process."
https://openalex.org/W2030070767,"Claudin-2 is a unique member of the claudin family of transmembrane proteins, as its expression is restricted to the leaky epithelium in vivo and correlates with epithelial leakiness in vitro. However, recent evidence suggests potential functions of claudin-2 that are relevant to neoplastic transformation and growth. In accordance, here we report, on the basis of analysis of mRNA and protein expression using a total of 309 patient samples that claudin-2 expression is significantly increased in colorectal cancer and correlates with cancer progression. We also report similar increases in claudin-2 expression in inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the increased claudin-2 expression in colorectal cancer is causally associated with tumor growth as forced claudin-2 expression in colon cancer cells that do not express claudin-2 resulted in significant increases in cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor growth in vivo. We further show that the colonic microenvironment regulates claudin-2 expression in a manner dependent on signaling through the EGF receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of colon tumorigenesis. In addition, claudin-2 expression is specifically decreased in the colon of waved-2 mice, naturally deficient in EGFR activation. Furthermore, genetic silencing of claudin-2 expression in Caco-2, a colon cancer cell line, prevents the EGF-induced increase in cell proliferation. Taken together, these results uncover a novel role for claudin-2 in promoting colon cancer, potentially via EGFR transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1981408865,"Background Human hearing develops progressively during the last trimester of gestation. Near-term fetuses can discriminate acoustic features, such as frequencies and spectra, and process complex auditory streams. Fetal and neonatal studies show that they can remember frequently recurring sounds. However, existing data can only show retention intervals up to several days after birth. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that auditory memories can last at least six weeks. Experimental fetuses were given precisely controlled exposure to a descending piano melody twice daily during the 35th, 36th, and 37th weeks of gestation. Six weeks later we assessed the cardiac responses of 25 exposed infants and 25 naive control infants, while in quiet sleep, to the descending melody and to an ascending control piano melody. The melodies had precisely inverse contours, but similar spectra, identical duration, tempo and rhythm, thus, almost identical amplitude envelopes. All infants displayed a significant heart rate change. In exposed infants, the descending melody evoked a cardiac deceleration that was twice larger than the decelerations elicited by the ascending melody and by both melodies in control infants. Conclusions/Significance Thus, 3-weeks of prenatal exposure to a specific melodic contour affects infants ‘auditory processing’ or perception, i.e., impacts the autonomic nervous system at least six weeks later, when infants are 1-month old. Our results extend the retention interval over which a prenatally acquired memory of a specific sound stream can be observed from 3–4 days to six weeks. The long-term memory for the descending melody is interpreted in terms of enduring neurophysiological tuning and its significance for the developmental psychobiology of attention and perception, including early speech perception, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2158575987,"In the testicular cancer cell line, NT2, we previously demonstrated that differentially methylated regions were located in introns or intergenic regions, and postulated these might regulate non-coding RNAs. Three microRNAs and three small nucleolar RNAs were differentially methylated; one, miR-199a, was associated with the progression and prognosis of gastric and ovarian cancers. In this report we document, by epigenomic profiling of testicular tissue, that miR-199a is transcribed as antisense of dynamin 3 (chromosome 1q24.3), and hypermethylation of this region is correlated with miR-199a-5p/3p repression and tumor malignancy. Re-expression of miR-199a in testicular cancer cells led to suppression of cell growth, cancer migration, invasion and metastasis. The miR-199a-5p, one of two mature miRNA species derived from miR-199a, is associated with tumor malignancy. We further identified the embryonal carcinoma antigen podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PODXL), an anti-adhesive protein expressed in aggressive tumors, as a target of miR-199a-5p. We demonstrated PODXL is overexpressed in malignant testicular tumor, and cellular depletion of PODXL resulted in suppression of cancer invasion. The inverse relationship between PODXL and miR-199a-5p expression suggests PODXL is a downstream effector mediating the action of miR199a-5p. This report identifies DNA methylation, miR-199a dysregulation and PODXL as critical factors in tumor malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1992677117,"Breastfeeding effects on cognition are attributed to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), but controversy persists. Genetic variation in fatty acid desaturase (FADS) and elongase (ELOVL) enzymes has been overlooked when studying the effects of LC-PUFAs supply on cognition. We aimed to: 1) to determine whether maternal genetic variants in the FADS cluster and ELOVL genes contribute to differences in LC-PUFA levels in colostrum; 2) to analyze whether these maternal variants are related to child cognition; and 3) to assess whether children's variants modify breastfeeding effects on cognition.Data come from two population-based birth cohorts (n = 400 mother-child pairs from INMA-Sabadell; and n = 340 children from INMA-Menorca). LC-PUFAs were measured in 270 colostrum samples from INMA-Sabadell. Tag SNPs were genotyped both in mothers and children (13 in the FADS cluster, 6 in ELOVL2, and 7 in ELOVL5). Child cognition was assessed at 14 mo and 4 y using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, respectively.Children of mothers carrying genetic variants associated with lower FADS1 activity (regulating AA and EPA synthesis), higher FADS2 activity (regulating DHA synthesis), and with higher EPA/AA and DHA/AA ratios in colostrum showed a significant advantage in cognition at 14 mo (3.5 to 5.3 points). Not being breastfed conferred an 8- to 9-point disadvantage in cognition among children GG homozygote for rs174468 (low FADS1 activity) but not among those with the A allele. Moreover, not being breastfed resulted in a disadvantage in cognition (5 to 8 points) among children CC homozygote for rs2397142 (low ELOVL5 activity), but not among those carrying the G allele.Genetically determined maternal supplies of LC-PUFAs during pregnancy and lactation appear to be crucial for child cognition. Breastfeeding effects on cognition are modified by child genetic variation in fatty acid desaturase and elongase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2090307950,"The molecular mechanisms underlying constitutive nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in solid tumors has not been elucidated. We show that Annexin-1 (ANXA1) is involved in this process, and suppression of ANXA1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells impedes migration and metastasis capabilities in vitro and in vivo. ANXA1 expression correlates with NF-κB activity, suggesting that ANXA1 may be required for the constitutive activity of IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB in highly metatstatic breast cancer. Gel-filtration analysis demonstrated that ANXA1 co-elutes with the members of the IKK complex and NF-κB signaling pathway, and immunoprecipitation confirmed that ANXA1 can bind to and interact with IKKγ or NEMO, but not IKKα or IKKβ. Importantly, silencing of ANXA1 prevents the interaction of NEMO and RIP1, which indicates that ANXA1 is required for the recruitment of RIP1 to the IKK complex, which may be important for the activation of NF-κB. Downstream targets of NF-κB include uPA and CXCR4, which can be modulated by ANXA1 silencing. CXCR4-mediated migration of breast cancer cell lines in response to CXCL12 was significantly modulated by ANXA1, indicating its importance in the tissue-specific migration of breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that in ANXA1 overexpressed cells, NF-κB was recruited to CXCR4 promoter without external stimulation, indicating that ANXA1 is critical for the constitutive activation of NF-κB in breast cancer to promote metastasis. Finally, we show that ANXA1 overexpression enhances metastasis and reduces survival in an intracardiac metastasis model, while ANXA1-deficient mice crossed with MMTV-PyMT mice display significantly less metastasis than their heterozygous littermates, indicating that ANXA1 is an important gene in breast cancer metastasis. Our data reveal that ANXA1 can constitutively activate NF-κB in breast cancer cells through the interaction with the IKK complex, and suggests that modulating ANXA1 levels has therapeutic potential to suppress breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2025310614,"The present study examines the secular trends in prevalence of overweight and obesity among urban Asian Indian adolescents in New Delhi (North India). The data were derived from cross-sectional sampling of children, 3493 in year 2006 and 4908 in year 2009, aged 14-17 years studying in privately-funded and government-funded schools. Age, gender and Asian Indian-specific cut offs of body mass index (BMI) were used to define overweight and obesity. The prevalence of obesity increased significantly from 9.8% in 2006 to 11.7% in 2009 (p<0.01), whereas underweight decreased from 11.3% to 3.9% (p<0.001). There was a significantly higher risk of being overweight (OR 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.42) and obese (OR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.24-1.66) in year 2009 than 2006, after adjusting for age, gender and type of school. Males and privately-funded school children had significantly higher increase in prevalence and risk of being overweight and obese over the three years. In conclusion, this study showed an increasing trend in prevalence of overweight and obesity in urban Asian Indian adolescents. More specifically, the study showed the association of this increasing trend of overweight and obesity prevalence with male gender and high socio-economic status, calling for an urgent need for immediate and targeted preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W2002388424,"What brain mechanisms underlie learning of new knowledge from single events? We studied encoding in long-term memory of a unique type of one-shot experience, induced perceptual insight. While undergoing an fMRI brain scan, participants viewed degraded images of real-world pictures where the underlying objects were hard to recognize (“camouflage”), followed by brief exposures to the original images (“solution”), which led to induced insight (“Aha!”). A week later, the participants’ memory was tested; a solution image was classified as “remembered” if detailed perceptual knowledge was elicited from the camouflage image alone. During encoding, subsequently remembered images were associated with higher activity in midlevel visual cortex and medial frontal cortex, but most pronouncedly, in the amygdala, whose activity could be used to predict which solutions will remain in long-term memory. Our findings extend the known roles of amygdala in memory to include promotion of long-term memory of the sudden reorganization of internal representations."

This fMRI study investigated stimulus-driven spatial attention using a virtual-environment video. We explored the influence of bottom-up signals by computing saliency maps of the environment and by introducing attention-grabbing events in the video. We parameterized the efficacy of these signals for the orienting of spatial attention by measuring eye movements and used these parameters to analyze the imaging data. The efficacy of bottom-up signals modulated ongoing activity in dorsal fronto-parietal regions and transient activation of the ventral attention system. Our results demonstrate that the combination of computational, behavioral, and imaging techniques enables studying cognitive functions in ecologically valid contexts. We highlight the central role of the efficacy of stimulus-driven signals in both dorsal and ventral attention systems, with a dissociation of the efficacy of background salience versus distinctive events in the two systems."
https://openalex.org/W2002814901,"Despite decades of research, the mechanism by which the fertilizing spermatozoon penetrates the mammalian vitelline membrane, the zona pellucida (ZP) remains one of the unexplained fundamental events of human/mammalian development. Evidence has been accumulating in support of the 26S proteasome as a candidate for echinoderm, ascidian and mammalian egg coat lysin. Monitoring ZP protein degradation by sperm during fertilization is nearly impossible because those few spermatozoa that penetrate the ZP leave behind a virtually untraceable residue of degraded proteins. We have overcome this hurdle by designing an experimentally consistent in vitro system in which live boar spermatozoa are co-incubated with ZP-proteins (ZPP) solubilized from porcine oocytes. Using this assay, mimicking sperm-egg interactions, we demonstrate that the sperm-borne proteasomes can degrade the sperm receptor protein ZPC. Upon coincubation with motile spermatozoa, the solubilized ZPP, which appear to be ubiquitinated, adhered to sperm acrosomal caps and induced acrosomal exocytosis/formation of the acrosomal shroud. The degradation of the sperm receptor protein ZPC was assessed by Western blotting band-densitometry and proteomics. A nearly identical pattern of sperm receptor degradation, evident already within the first 5 min of coincubation, was observed when the spermatozoa were replaced with the isolated, enzymatically active, sperm-derived proteasomes. ZPC degradation was blocked by proteasomal inhibitors and accelerated by ubiquitin-aldehyde(UBAL), a modified ubiquitin protein that stimulates proteasomal proteolysis. Such a degradation pattern of ZPC is consistent with in vitro fertilization studies, in which proteasomal inhibitors completely blocked fertilization, and UBAL increased fertilization and polyspermy rates. Preincubation of intact zona-enclosed ova with isolated active sperm proteasomes caused digestion, abrasions and loosening of the exposed zonae, and significantly reduced the fertilization/polyspermy rates after IVF, accompanied by en-mass detachment of zona bound sperm. Thus, the sperm borne 26S proteasome is a candidate zona lysin in mammals. This new paradigm has implications for contraception and assisted reproductive technologies in humans, as well as animals."
https://openalex.org/W2006377760,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a multifunctional protein known for modulating mitogenic and metabolic actions of IGFs as well as exerting a variety of biological actions not involving IGFs. Here, we show that IGFBP-3 blocks specific physiological consequences of asthma in an IGF-independent manner in vitro and in vivo. IGFBP-3 treatment effectively reduced all physiological manifestations of asthma examined in vivo (airway hyper-responsiveness, cellular and pathological changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue, and expression of numerous proinflammatory molecules). These unique IGFBP-3 effects were further confirmed in IGFBP-3-transgenic mice, thus strengthening the notion of IGFBP-3 actions within the respiratory system. Using human epithelial cells, we demonstrated the following: 1) IGFBP-3 blocks TNF-α-induced expression of proinflammatory molecules; 2) IGFBP-3 attenuates the TNF-α-induced migratory response of eosinophils; and 3) IGFBP-3 negatively regulates TNF-α-induced expression of the key NF-κB regulatory molecules IκBα and p65-NF-κB at the post-translational level. We identified that IGFBP-3 degrades IκBα and p65-NF-κB proteins through IGFBP-3 receptor (IGFBP-3R)-mediated activation of caspases thereby inhibiting TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB signaling cascades. This unique IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R action was further confirmed by demonstrating complete inhibition of IGFBP-3 action in the presence of caspase inhibitors as well as IGFBP-3R siRNAs. Non-IGF-binding IGFBP-3 mutants further proved the IGF-independent action of IGFBP-3. Our findings indicate that IGFBP-3 inhibits airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness via an IGF-independent mechanism that involves activation of IGFBP-3R signaling and cross-talk with NF-κB signaling. The IGFBP-3/IGFBP-3R system therefore plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma and can serve as a newly identified potential therapeutic target for this debilitating disease."

Such defects need to be treated with separate pharmacological compounds termed potentiators and correctors, respectively. Here, we report the characterization of aminoarylthiazoles (AATs) as compounds having dual activity. Cells expressing mutant CFTR were studied with functional assays (fluorescence-based halide transport and short circuit current measurements) to assess the effect of acute and chronic treatment with compounds. We found that AATs are effective on F508del, the most frequent cystic fibrosis mutation, which is associated with both a gating and a trafficking defect. AATs are also effective on mutations like G1349D and G551D, which cause only a gating defect. Evaluation of a panel of AAT analogs identified EN277I as the most effective compound.

Cells expressing mutant CFTR were studied with functional assays (fluorescence-based halide transport and short circuit current measurements) to assess the effect of acute and chronic treatment with compounds. We found that AATs are effective on F508del, the most frequent cystic fibrosis mutation, which is associated with both a gating and a trafficking defect. AATs are also effective on mutations like G1349D and G551D, which cause only a gating defect. Evaluation of a panel of AAT analogs identified EN277I as the most effective compound. Incubation of cells expressing mutant CFTR with EN277I caused a strong stimulation of channel activity as demonstrated by single channel recordings. Compounds with dual activity such as AATs may be useful for the development of effective drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) 2The abbreviations used are: CFcystic fibrosisCFTRCF transmembrane conductance regulatorAATaminoarylthiazoleFRTFischer rat thyroidHS-YFPhalide-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteinQRquenching rateCPT-cAMP8-chlorophenylthio-cAMPCHXcycloheximide. is one of the most frequent inherited diseases affecting 1 in ∼2,500 Caucasian individuals (1Bobadilla J.L. Macek Jr., M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which codes for a plasma membrane protein expressed at the apical surface of epithelial cells in the airways, intestine, pancreas, and other organs. CFTR functions as a chloride channel, activated through cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the regulatory domain by protein kinase A (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Until now, more than 1500 mutations have been described. They have been grouped into five classes according to the mechanisms through which they cause CFTR loss of function (3Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 4McAuley D.F. Elborn J.S. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2000; 1: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In particular, class II mutations cause a mistrafficking of CFTR that remains trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and is subsequently degraded. Conversely, class III mutations (like G551D and G1349D) do not impair protein trafficking but severely decrease CFTR channel opening in response to cAMP elevation. The deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del), the most frequent CF mutation (∼70%), causes both a trafficking (5Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

In fact, when the F508del-CFTR protein is induced to traffic to the plasma membrane by incubation at low temperature or by overexpression, it shows a maximal open channel probability (Po) that is nearly 3-fold lower than that of the wild-type CFTR (8Dalemans W.

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of class II and class III mutants as a target for pharmacotherapy. Indeed, mutant CFTR defects can be corrected in vitro using specific small molecules. In particular, the gating defect displayed by F508del and class III mutants can be ameliorated by small molecules called “potentiators” that have been found by screening libraries of chemical compounds (10Pedemonte N.

Potentiators do not activate mutant CFTR by themselves but enhance channel activity above the level elicited by cAMP stimulation alone. In other words, maximal stimulation of mutant CFTR with a cAMP agonist evokes only a fraction (20–40% for F508del, less than 5–10% for G551D and G1349D) of the total activity obtained by also adding a potentiator (10Pedemonte N.

Physiol. 2007; 129: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mechanistic insight into the action of potentiators have been provided by several groups. For example, Cai and Sheppard (15Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CFTR potentiator phloxine B enhances the ATP dependence of CFTR channel gating by increasing ATP affinity and Po, whereas by studying the ATPase activity of purified F508del-CFTR, Wellhauser et al. (20Wellhauser L. Kim Chiaw P. Pasyk S. Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that VRT-532 decreases ATP turnover, providing an explanation for how this agent enhances burst duration. Importantly, Ai et al. (16Ai T. Bompadre S.G. Wang X. Hu S. Li M. Hwang T.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) used the ATP-driven NBD dimerization model of CFTR channel gating to explain how CFTR potentiators work. Typically, potentiators work with a fast mechanism of action. Maximal effect is reached within minutes of compound application. High throughput screenings have also revealed the existence of small molecules, named correctors, that appear to correct the defective processing caused by F508del (21Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K.

Thomas D.Y. Hanrahan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, cell incubation with correctors rescues, at least partially, the mutant protein from the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing its targeting to the plasma membrane. However, the rescued F508del protein still shows a gating defect, thus requiring a potentiator to reach maximal activity. In contrast to potentiators, correctors act with a slow mechanism requiring several hours to obtain maximal effect. It is evident that the pharmacotherapy of the basic defect for CF patients will need to be tailored according to patient genotype. Indeed, a corrector will be useful for all patients carrying the F508del mutation. Such patients may also require co-treatment with a potentiator. Conversely, individuals with class III mutation need only treatment with a potentiator. Considering the efforts and financial resources needed to develop each single drug, it would be highly desirable to identify molecules having a dual activity, i.e. acting at the same time as a potentiator and as a corrector. In a previous study (21Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), we found that corr-2b, belonging to the chemical class of aminoarylthiazoles (AATs), acts as a corrector of F508del mistrafficking. However, this compound has also the interesting ability to improve F508del activity after long term incubation, a mechanism that seems different from that of classical CFTR potentiators. Here we describe the effects of chronic treatment with corr-2b and other AATs on F508del-CFTR and report, for the first time, that these compounds also act on class III mutants. Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells were stably transfected with F508del, G551D, or G1349D-CFTR (12Pedemonte N. Boido D. Moran O. Giampieri M. Mazzei M. Ravazzolo R. Galietta L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A549 were stably transfected with F508del-CFTR (24Pedemonte N. Tomati V. Sondo E. Galietta L.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2010; 298: C866-C874Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The CF bronchial epithelial cell line CFBE41o-, with stable expression of F508del-CFTR, was obtained by Dr. J. P. Clancy (25Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Wakefield J. Parker W. Li Y. Varga K. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. J. Physiol. 2005; 569: 601-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The three cell types were also transfected with the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP) YFP-H148Q/I152L (26Galietta L.J. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The culture media were: Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium for FRT cells, DMEM/Ham's F12 (1:1) for A549 cells, and minimum essential medium for CFBE41o-. All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured as described elsewhere (11Pedemonte N. Diena T. Caci E. Nieddu E. Mazzei M. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1736-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). For fluorescence assays of CFTR activity, FRT, A549, and CFBE41o- cells were plated (50,000 cells/well) on clear-bottomed 96-well black microplates (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA). For short circuit current experiments, 500,000 FRT or primary bronchial epithelial cells were seeded into Snapwell permeable supports (Corning Life Sciences). The pyridine (EN275 analogs) and aniline (EN277 analogs) derivatives were dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature, and NaH (60% dispersion) was added. When the bubbling stopped, 2-Cl-4(4Br-phenyl)thiazole was added, and the reaction was heated to reflux. The reaction was monitored by TLC, using an n-hexane/ethyl acetate/acetic acid 8/3/0.1 mixture. After 2–24 h (according to the derivative), tetrahydrofuran was removed in vacuo, and the resulting solution was suspended in acidic water. The mixture was then extracted with CH2Cl2, dried with MgSO4, and filtrated. The organic phase was evaporated, and the precipitate was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and lyophilized. The analysis of the final product was performed by HPLC-electrospray ionization-MS using an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD ion trap instrument. The molecular structure was checked and confirmed by tandem mass analysis. Products were then purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Shimadzu LC-9A preparative HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex C18 Luna column. The solvent program was a gradient starting with 40% (for EN275 analogs) or 50% (for EN277 analogs) solvent A (0.1% TFA in water) for 5 min, linearly increasing to 90% solvent B (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) in 30 min and up to 100% B in 5 min. The purity of the final products was further checked by electrospray ionization-MS. All of the compounds were synthesized according to the chemistry described by Bilodeau et al. (27Bilodeau M.T. Balitza A.E. Koester T.J. Manley P.J. Rodman L.D. Buser-Doepner C. Coll K.E. Fernandes C. Gibbs J.B. Heimbrook D.C. Huckle W.R. Kohl N. Lynch J.J. Mao X. McFall R.C. McLoughlin D. Miller-Stein C.M. Rickert K.W. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Shipman J.M. Subramanian R. Thomas K.A. Wong B.K. Yu S. Hartman G.D. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 6363-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with substantial modifications. Measurements of CFTR activity were carried out on FRT, A549, and CFBE41o cells expressing mutant CFTR and the HS-YFP 48 h after plating on microplates. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were incubated with test compounds at 37 °C for 20–24 h. At the time of assay, the cells were washed with PBS (containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) and stimulated for 30 min with forskolin (20 μm) in the absence or presence of genistein (50 μm). Then the cells were transferred to a microplate reader (FluoStar Galaxy; BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) for CFTR activity determination. The plate reader was equipped with high quality excitation (HQ500/20X: 500 ± 10 nm) and emission (HQ535/30M: 535 ± 15 nm) filters for YFP (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Each assay consisted of a continuous 14-s fluorescence reading with 2 s before and 12 s after injection of an iodide-containing solution (PBS with Cl− replaced by I−; final I− concentration in the well, 100 mm). The data were normalized to the initial background-subtracted fluorescence. To determine fluorescence quenching rate (QR) associated with I− influx, the final 11 s of the data for each well were fitted with an exponential function to extrapolate initial slope (dF/dt). Experiments on FRT and bronchial epithelial cells were performed 7–10 days after seeding, when the transepithelial resistance was >1,000 Ω·cm2, by mounting the Snapwell inserts in a self-contained Ussing chamber system (vertical diffusion chamber; Corning Life Sciences). Transepithelial currents of FRT cells were measured using a transepithelial Cl− gradient. Accordingly, the basolateral solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.3), and 10 mm glucose. For the apical side, this solution was modified by replacing half of the NaCl with sodium gluconate and increasing CaCl2 to 2 mm to compensate for calcium buffering caused by gluconate. During experiments, solutions in both chambers were continuously bubbled with air. For bronchial epithelial cells, the apical and basolateral side contained the same solution (126 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm KH2PO4, 2.1 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose) bubbled with 5% CO2 in air. The hemichambers were connected to DVC-1000 voltage clamps (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) via Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 m KCl agar bridges. Transepithelial currents were digitized using PowerLab 4/25 data acquisition systems and stored on a personal computer. All of the measurements were done at 37 °C. FRT cells expressing F508del-CFTR were plated at high density on six-well plates. After 24 h, when cells reached 100% confluency, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with PBS (750 μl) containing Me2SO, genistein (50 μm), or EN277I (50 μm). After 30 s, 10 min, and 30 min, the PBS was removed, and the cells were briefly washed with 10% methanol in PBS (to remove completely not internalized compound) and then lysed in methanol (750 μl). Concentration of compounds in lysates was measured by HPLC. Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and 100 μl of supernatant were loaded on a 4.6 × 250 mm C18 reversed phase Luna column packed with 3.5-mm particle size stationary phase (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The analysis was performed in isocratic mode with a water/acetonitrile 45/55 mobile phase added with formic acid 0.1% v/v. The flow rate was set to 0.8 ml/min. The 250-nm absorbance peaks corresponding to genistein and EN277I were identified on the basis of elution times. The peak areas were used to calculate concentrations in the original lysate. Intracellular concentration of compounds was determined considering a cell volume calculated from the surface and average thickness of the confluent cell monolayer (thickness measured with a confocal microscope). The cells grown on 100-mm-diameter dishes were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Igepal) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After preclearing of lysates with pansorbin (Calbiochem), CFTR was immunoprecipitated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 2 mm Mg-ATP, using a mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR C-terminal antibody (24-1; R & D System) and pansorbin. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were immunodetected by a mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody (M3A7; Millipore) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and visualized by chemiluminescence with the LiteAblot Turbo kit (Euroclone). Direct recording of the chemiluminescence was performed using the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system and quantification using the Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Single channel analysis was done on FRT cells stably expressing CFTR with G1349D mutation in cell-attached and inside-out configurations. Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled on a vertical two-step puller to a final resistance of 4–6 MΩ measured in the working solution. The pipette solution contained 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.3). The bath solution in cell attached experiments was 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm mannitol, and 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4). The bath solution in inside-out patch experiments was instead 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm ATP (pH 7.3). The experiments were done at room temperature (22–24 °C). To activate CFTR in cell-attached patches, the bath was supplemented with 500 μm CPT-cAMP. To activate CFTR in inside-out configurations, the bath solution was supplemented with 125 nm catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (recombinant; Promega). The cell membrane was voltage-clamped at −60 mV using an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List Medical). The data were low pass-filtered at 400 Hz and digitized at 1000 Hz using an Instrutech ITC-16 AD/DA interface and the PULSE software (Heka). The experiments were analyzed using IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The amplitude of single-channel currents was estimated from the fit of Gaussian distributions of the current amplitude histograms. The apparent number of channels present on a membrane patch was assumed to be equal to the maximal number of simultaneously open channels (28Horn R. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Open channel probability (Po), mean burst duration, and interburst interval were calculated as described previously (29Taddei A. Folli C. Zegarra-Moran O. Fanen P. Verkman A.S. Galietta L.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 558: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), by ignoring closures shorter than 20 ms, to discard the brief closures within a burst. Analysis was done on traces lasting 250–1500 s (mode ∼750 s). To analyze mean burst duration and interburst interval on patches containing more than one channel, we utilized an algorithm (30Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. 1982; 331: 599-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) previously used for K+ channels (31Hosoya Y. Yamada M. Ito H. Kurachi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and for CFTR (32Wang F. Zeltwanger S. Yang I.C. Nairn A.C. Hwang T.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mean burst duration in multichannels was obtained from the following equation, MBD=Σjtjn(Eq. 1) where tj is the time that j channels open at the same time, and n is the number of open to close transitions. The interburst interval was obtained from the following equation. Po=MBDMBD+lBl(Eq. 2) The data for all of the experiments are presented as representative traces or as the means ± S.E. The statistical analyses were done using the Student's t test for unpaired data. The differences between two groups of data were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Fig. 1A shows results obtained by measuring transepithelial Cl− currents in FRT cells expressing the F508del-CFTR mutant. The cells were kept under control conditions or exposed to different treatments including correctors or incubation at low temperature (27 °C). Untreated cells (Fig. 1A, trace i) had small responses to the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin (an adenylate cyclase activator, 20 μm) and to the subsequent addition of the potentiator genistein (50 μm). At the end of the experiment, the addition of CFTRinh-172 (10 μm), a selective CFTR inhibitor (33Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), caused a full block of the transepithelial Cl− currents elicited by forskolin plus genistein. The size of the current blocked by CFTRinh-172 (corresponding to the total CFTR-mediated current evoked by stimulation with forskolin plus genistein, named ITOT) may be considered a parameter reflecting the total amount of CFTR that is available for activation in the plasma membrane. Treatment with correctors (Fig. 1A, traces ii and iv) or with low temperature (Fig. 1A, trace v) increased ITOT by 2–4-fold. Instead, corr-2b (Fig. 1A, trace iii) displayed a peculiar behavior. Compared with the other types of treatment, this compound enhanced the fraction of the total current that is activated by forskolin alone (IFSK/ITOT, expressed as a percentage). Although for the other treatments IFSK/ITOT was ∼30–40% (not different from untreated cells), for corr-2b this parameter was ∼80% (Fig. 1A). This behavior was evident also when CFTR activity was evaluated using the HS-YFP assay (Fig. 1, B and C). In this assay, the rate of fluorescence quenching (QR) caused by I− influx reflects the extent of CFTR activity in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). All of the rescue maneuvers, i.e. low temperature and correctors, caused an increase in the total CFTR activity elicited by forskolin plus genistein (QRTOT; see Fig. 1C, top panel). However, corr-2b was the only compound having the ability to enhance the fraction of halide transport that is stimulated by forskolin alone (QRFSK/QRTOT, expressed as a percentage; see Fig. 1C, bottom panel). To verify whether corr-2b modulates the cAMP signaling, for example by up-regulating adenylate cyclase or down-regulating phosphodiesterases, we repeated the experiments using 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) instead of forskolin. CPT-cAMP is a membrane-permeable cAMP analog that is not hydrolyzable by phosphodiesterases. Therefore, it acts directly on the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, bypassing the steps controlling cAMP levels. Representative short circuit current traces are shown in Fig. 1D. The AAT corr-2b was able to enhance the relative response to CPT-cAMP, to an extent similar to that observed using forskolin. To explore the structure-activity relationship of AATs as dual acting compounds, we synthesized two small panels of analogs, based on the scaffold of corr-2b and corr-2a (the progenitor of the class, described in Ref. 21Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The structures are displayed in Table 1. The new compounds were tested on FRT cells expressing F508del-CFTR using the HS-YFP assay (Fig. 2). Many corr-2a analogs were able to rescue the mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane, causing an increase in total activity, defined as QRTOT (Fig. 2A, left panel). However, none of them was able to enhance the relative response to forskolin, i.e. QRFSK/QRTOT (Fig. 2A, right panel). The results obtained from the panel of corr-2b analogs were more interesting. Indeed, some compounds enhanced total F508del-CFTR activity (Fig. 2B, left panel) and, at the same time, improved the QRFSK/QRTOT, similarly to corr-2b (Fig. 2B, right panel). Particularly interesting was compound EN277I, which was comparable with corr-2b as a corrector but was better as an enhancer of forskolin response (Fig. 2B). In particular, EN277I acted at lower concentrations (25 μm versus 50 μm). Other compounds, such as EN277C, were effective mainly on the forskolin response. In contrast, a classical corrector, corr-4a, was effective only on total activity. Such results indicate that the “dual activity” is not a general feature of the AAT chemical scaffold but is instead linked to particular substituents.TABLE 1Analogs of corr-2a and corr-2bThe table shows, for each analog, the chemical group that substitutes the group indicated as R in the parent structure.

We find that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β inhibition independently induce the localization of epithelial tight junction components to the plasma membrane. The Ca2+-independent deposition of junctional proteins induced by AMPK activation and GSK-3β inhibition is independent of E-cadherin. Furthermore, the nectin-afadin system is required for the deposition of tight junction components induced by AMPK activation, but it is not required for that induced by GSK-3β inhibition. Phosphorylation studies demonstrate that afadin is a substrate for AMPK.

https://openalex.org/W2057891581,"The EDD (E3 identified by differential display) gene, first identified as a progestin-induced gene in T-47D breast cancer cells, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a HECT domain. It was reported that EDD is involved in the G(2)/M progression through ubiquitination of phospho-katanin p60. Previous study has also shown that EDD can act as a transcription cofactor independently of its E3 ligase activity. In this study, we uncover a new role for EDD during cell cycle progression in an E3 ligase-independent manner. We demonstrate that EDD can physically interact with p53 and that this interaction blocks the phosphorylation of p53 by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Silencing of EDD induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(15) and activates p53 target genes in fibroblasts and some transformed cells without activation of DNA damage response. The G(1)/S arrest induced by EDD depletion depends on p53. On the other hand, overexpression of EDD inhibits p53-Ser(15) phosphorylation and suppresses the induction of p53 target genes during DNA damage, and this effect does not require its E3 ligase activity. Thus, through binding to p53, EDD actively inhibits p53 phosphorylation by ATM and plays a role in ensuring smooth G(1)/S progression."
https://openalex.org/W2143295418,"Klotho is a multifunctional protein involved in numerous biological functions, ranging from mineral ion metabolism to signaling activities. Recent studies have identified klotho as a target gene for peroxi-some proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and an adipo-genesis-promoting factor. In a similar line of observation, eliminating klotho function from mice resulted in the generation of lean mice with almost no detectable fat tissue. In contrast to the klotho-knockout mice (11.7±0.3 g at 9 wk), leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice are severely obese (49.3±0.6 g at 9 wk), due to excessive fat accumulation. To study the in vivo role of klotho in obesity, we have generated and characterized ob/ob mice lacking klotho activity [ob/ob-klotho double-knockout (DKO) mice]. The ob/ob mice started to get bigger from 3 wk onward and gained almost 2 times more weight than their wild-type (WT) counterparts (WT vs. ob/ob: 34.8±1.3 vs. 65.5±1.2 g at 21 wk). The generated ob/ob-klotho DKO mice were not only viable throughout their adulthood but also showed markedly reduced fat tissue accumulation compared to their ob/ob littermates. The ob/ob-klotho DKO mice had significantly (P<0.01) less retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and epididymal fat accumulation, compared to their ob/ob counterparts. Similarly, the fatty liver that was consistently observed in the ob/ob mice was eliminated in the ob/ob-klotho DKO mice. Such structural improvement in the liver was also evident from markedly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in ob/ob-klotho DKO mice, compared to their ob/ob counterparts (ob/ob vs. ob/ob-klotho DKO: 266 ± 36 vs. 65 ±2 mg/dl). Finally, to study whether the absence of klotho can induce resistance to high-fat-diet-induced obesity, we provided a high-fat (60%) diet to klotho-knockout mice and compared them with normal-fat (20%) diet-fed klotho-knockout mice. No significant difference in body weight was detected in klotho-knockout mice fed either the normal-fat diet or high-fat diet, while WT mice fed the high-fat diet gradually gained body weight, compared to the normal-fat-diet-fed counterparts. The results of our dietary and genetic manipulation studies provide in vivo evidence for a role of klotho in obesity and offer a novel target to manipulate obesity and associated complications.—Ohnishi, M., Kato, S., Akiyoshi, J., Atfi, A., Razzaque, M.

In the CaV1.2 channel α1-subunit (α1C), CaBP1 interacts with cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains and blunts Ca2+-dependent inactivation. To clarify the role of the α1C N-terminal domain in CaBP1 regulation, we compared the effects of CaBP1 on two alternatively spliced variants of α1C containing a long or short N-terminal domain. In both isoforms, CaBP1 inhibited Ca2+-dependent inactivation but also caused a depolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation and enhanced voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI). In binding assays, CaBP1 interacted with the distal third of the N-terminal domain in a Ca2+-independent manner. This segment is distinct from the previously identified calmodulin-binding site in the N terminus. However, deletion of a segment in the proximal N-terminal domain of both α1C isoforms, which spared the CaBP1-binding site, inhibited the effect of CaBP1 on VDI. This result suggests a modular organization of the α1C N-terminal domain, with separate determinants for CaBP1 binding and transduction of the effect on VDI.

A “long N-terminal” alternatively spliced α1C isoform possesses a 20-amino acid (aa) initial segment (N-terminal inhibitory (NTI) module), which controls the channel's maximal Po (30Shistik E.

A second module in the central part of the N-terminal domain is a CaM-binding site, the N-terminal spatial Ca2+-transforming element (NSCaTE), which regulates CDI in CaV1.3 (33Dick I.E. Tadross M.R. Liang H. Tay L.H. Yang W. Yue D.T. Nature. 2008; 451: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but its role in CaV1.2 is less clear (34Benmocha A. Almagor L. Oz S. Hirsch J.A. Dascal N. Channels. 2009; 3: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The exact location of the CaBP1-binding site within the N terminus of α1C has not been determined, and whether CaBP1 influences parameters of CaV1.2 function other than CDI is unknown. Here, we report that CaBP1 expression in Xenopus oocytes regulates activation gating and accelerates VDI of CaV1.2. Although CaBP1 binds to a site in the distal N-terminal domain that is distinct from the CaM-binding site, CaBP1 regulation of VDI requires an intact proximal domain in the N terminus of α1C. Deletion of the entire N-terminal domain inhibits but does not fully abolish effects of CaBP1 on VDI, which indicates the presence of additional relevant molecular determinants. These results suggest a new modulatory role for the α1C N terminus, in which CaBP1 binding and transduction of the modulation of VDI are encoded by distinct N-terminal domains. Maintenance of female frogs (Xenopus laevis), preparation of oocytes, and in vitro RNA synthesis were carried out as described previously (30Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol.

Electrophysiological studies of HEK293T cells involved transient transfection of HEK293T cells with CaV1.2 with or without CaBP1. In some experiments, we utilized T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen) stably transfected with GFP-tagged CaBP1 under tetracycline-inducible expression. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were grown to 65–80% confluency and transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA coding for the rabbit LNTα1C or rat rbcIIα1C variant or their truncated forms, 1 μg of β2a, 1 μg of α2δ, and 0.05 μg of enhanced GFP with or without 0.05–0.1 μg of CaBP1, all in the pcDNA3 vector. For stably transfected T-REx-293 cells, cells were transfected only with CaV1.2 subunit cDNAs and 0.05 μg of mCherry plasmid to mark transfected cells. Tetracycline (1 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 6–8 h before recording to induce CaBP1 expression. Patch-clamp recordings of all cells were made at least 24 h after transfection. There were no significant differences between channel properties or regulation by CaBP1 in the transiently transfected and stably transfected cells, so the data from both systems were combined for analysis. In Xenopus oocytes, the procedures were essentially as described (35Kanevsky N. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, whole cell currents were recorded with the GeneClamp 500 amplifier Molecular Devices using a two-electrode voltage clamp. 25–30 nl of 50 mm BAPTA (Ca2+ chelator) was routinely injected into the oocytes 0.5–3 h before the measurement of currents. This procedure usually blocked the endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents; cells with residual Cl− currents (distinguished by long-lasting inward tails at −80 mV) were excluded from analysis. The extracellular solutions contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2 or Ca(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid. In each oocyte, the net current was obtained by subtraction of the residual currents recorded with the same protocols after applying 200 μm CdCl2 to the same solution (supplemental Fig. S1A) (35Kanevsky N. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Stimulation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). All experiments were performed at 20–22 °C. Currents were measured by 400-ms, 1000-ms, or 10-s pulses from a resting potential of −80 mV to different potentials, with 60-s intervals for the 10-s pulses and with 10-s intervals for shorter pulses. A current-voltage (I-V) curve was fitted to the Boltzmann equation in the form I = Gmax(Vm − Vrev)/(1 + exp(−(Vm− Va)/Ka)), where Ka is the slope factor, Va is the half-maximal activation voltage, Gmax is the maximal macroscopic conductance, and Vrev is the reversal potential of the current. The parameters obtained for Gmax and Vrev were then used to calculate fractional conductance at each Vm using the equation G/Gmax = I/(Gmax(Vm − Vrev)). The waveform of decay of the Ba2+ current (IBa) was fitted, using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, to a two-exponential equation in the form f(t) = Afaste−t/τfast + Aslowe−t/τslow + C, where A is the contribution of each kinetic component (τfast or τslow) of the decay of IBa, and C is the non-inactivating component (supplemental Fig. S1B and Table S2). In transfected HEK293T cells, Ba2+ currents were recorded in whole cell patch-clamp configuration at room temperature. Extracellular recording solutions contained 150 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm BaCl2. Intracellular recording solutions contained 130 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 60 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MgATP, and 5 mm EGTA. The pH of the extracellular and intracellular recording solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Reagents used for electrophysiological recordings were obtained from Sigma. Currents were recorded with an EPC 9 patch-clamp amplifier driven by PULSE software (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Leak and capacitive transients were subtracted using a P4 protocol. To measure VDI, IBa was evoked by 1-s depolarizations to +10 mV from −80 mV. r400, r1000, and r2000 are defined as the residual current (Ires) left after 400, 1000, and 2000 ms, respectively, divided by the maximal current, rx = Ires/Ipeak. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP (Molecular Devices) or routines written in IGOR Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Averaged data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical differences between two groups were determined by Student's t test, and multiple group comparisons were done by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's or Bonferroni tests. Graphs and statistical analysis were done with SigmaPlot (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Procedures were essentially as described (29Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, [35S]Met/Cys-labeled CaBP1 or CaM was translated on the template of an in vitro synthesized RNA using a rabbit reticulocyte translation kit (Promega). DNAs of α1C segments designed to create GST fusion proteins were cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector. GST-fused proteins were produced in Escherichia coli (strain BL21-RIL) transfected with the cDNAs (see Fig. 3A) and grown in standard medium at 37 or 18 °C after induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The GST fusion proteins were extracted from E. coli using an Amersham Biosciences kit. The protein concentration was estimated using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Purified GST fusion proteins (5–10 μg) or purified GST (∼10 μg) was incubated with 5 μl of the lysate containing the 35S-labeled proteins in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 with 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA. The final reaction volume was 300 μl. GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed. Following washing, GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 120 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained to detect proportional protein concentration with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). The labeled products were identified by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CaBP1 inhibition of CDI in CaV1.2 has been described for a SNTα1C isoform from rat brain, rbcII (6Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Zhou H. Yu K. McCoy K.L. Lee A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29612-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, a LNTα1C isoform is also expressed in the brain (37Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The LNTα1C isoform includes a 46-aa initial segment encoded by exon 1a (38Blumenstein Y. Kanevsky N. Sahar G. Barzilai R. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3419-3423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which contains the NTI module (aa 1–20) (see Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S4 for sequence) that regulates the channel's Po (35Kanevsky N. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The SNTα1C isoform (39Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stühmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) has an initial N-terminal segment encoded by the alternative exon 1 (42Dai B. Saada N. Echetebu C. Dettbarn C. Palade P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43Pang L. Koren G. Wang Z. Nattel S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This 16-aa segment is partly homologous to aa 6–20 of the long N terminus (see Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S4) but does not retain functionality of the NTI module in terms of modulation of Po of CaV1.2 (35Kanevsky N. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of the rbcIIα1C N terminus in CaBP1 regulation of CDI (28Zhou H. Yu K. McCoy K.L. Lee A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29612-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined whether CaBP1 might differentially regulate the LNTα1C and SNTα1C isoforms. We employed two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings in Xenopus oocytes injected with RNAs encoding LNTα1C or SNTα1C together with the auxiliary α2δ-1 and CaV β2b-subunits. CDI and VDI were studied with Ca2+ and Ba2+ as the permeant ions, respectively. Ba2+ (IBa) or Ca2+ (ICa) currents were isolated by subtracting Cd2+-insensitive currents from the total current (supplemental Fig. S1A) (35Kanevsky N. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ba2+ currents via CaV channels are widely considered as inactivating essentially by the VDI mechanism, and their decay provides a reliable measure of VDI kinetics (e.g. Ref. 25Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). ICa demonstrated typical strong CDI, which was substantially slowed by coexpression of CaBP1 in both SNTα1C and LNTα1C isoforms (ICa) (Fig. 1A). Thus, Xenopus oocytes recapitulate the effect of CaBP1 on CDI described in HEK293T cells (6Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Findeisen F. Minor Jr., D.L. Structure. 2010; 18: 1617-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, a novel observation was the acceleration of VDI seen with Ba2+ as the permeant ion (IBa) (Fig. 1A). The extent of inactivation was measured as r400 (24Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), i.e. the residual current remaining at the end of a 400-ms test pulse normalized to the peak current amplitude. For both α1C isoforms, CaBP1 significantly accelerated VDI (decreased r400) at all positive voltages (Fig. 1, B and C). Given the relatively slow time course of CaV1.2 VDI, we next used 10-s depolarizing pulses to characterize the effects of CaBP1 on the kinetics of VDI (Fig. 2). For LNTα1C and SNTα1C alone, IBa showed faster decay kinetics at more positive membrane voltages, a hallmark of VDI (Fig. 2, A–C, and supplemental Fig. S3). The decay of IBa was best fitted with a double-exponential function (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1, B and C), giving time constants of τfast ∼ 0.6 s and τslow ∼ 3 s at +10 mV (Fig. 2C, Table 1, and supplemental Fig. S1B and Table S1), supporting the involvement of at least two processes in VDI of CaV1.2 (21Morad M. Soldatov N. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CaBP1 accelerated IBa decay kinetics at all voltages in both LNTα1C and SNTα1C isoforms (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S3A). Acceleration of VDI by CaBP1 was dose-dependent and maximal with 5–10 ng of CaBP1 RNA/oocyte in both LNTα1C and SNTα1C isoforms (supplemental Fig. S2A). The kinetic analysis of current decay showed that, at less depolarized voltages, CaBP1 decreased both τfast and τslow. At more depolarized voltages, CaBP1 significantly increased the fast inactivating fraction (Afast) with a concomitant decrease in the slowly inactivating fraction (Aslow) (Fig. 2C). Together, these changes account for the acceleration of VDI by CaBP1 at all voltages.TABLE 1Parameters of VDI (r400 and r2000) at +10 and +20 mV in the different channel constructsRNA constructs injectedr400 ± S.E.Δr400 (effect of CaBP1)nr2000 ± S.E.Δr2000 (effect of CaBP1)nAt 10 mVLNTα1C0.77 ± 0.020.20ap < 0.001.390.49 ± 0.050.22bp < 0.01.10+CaBP10.57 ± 0.03290.27 ± 0.0413SNTα1C0.77 ± 0.030.23ap < 0.001.160.38 ± 0.050.19bp < 0.01.7+CaBP10.55 ± 0.05140.19 ± 0.047Δ46-LNTα1C0.73 ± 0.050.01 (NS)100.40 ± 0.040.01 (NS)10+CaBP10.72 ± 0.04140.39 ± 0.0414Δ139-LNTα1C0.62 ± 0.040.12cp < 0.05.60.23 ± 0.050.07 (NS)6+CaBP10.50 ± 0.03110.16 ± 0.0311At 20 mVLNTα1C0.73 ± 0.040.23ap < 0.001.390.41 ± 0.050.21bp < 0.01.10+CaBP10.50 ± 0.04290.20 ± 0.0413SNTα1C0.73 ± 0.020.22ap < 0.001.160.36 ± 0.030.19ap < 0.001.7+CaBP10.50 ± 0.03140.17 ± 0.037Δ46-LNTα1C0.66 ± 0.050.03 (NS)100.33 ± 0.040.03 (NS)10+CaBP10.63 ± 0.03140.30 ± 0.0314Δ139-LNTα1C0.58 ± 0.030.13bp < 0.01.60.18 ± 0.040.05 (NS)6+CaBP10.45 ± 0.02110.13 ± 0.0311a p < 0.001.b p < 0.01.c p < 0.05.

We tested if CaBP1 and CaM share similar molecular determinants for binding in the α1C N-terminal domain in GST pulldown assays. GST fusion proteins that cover the complete long N terminus of α1C, as shown schematically in Fig. 3A, were used to pull down in vitro synthesized radiolabeled CaBP1. CaBP1 bound to aa 95–154 and to a shorter segment (aa 95–140) but not to segments located N-terminally to aa 94 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, CaBP1 did not bind to the segment at aa 60–100, which has been shown to strongly bind CaM in the same assay (supplemental Fig. S4B) (34Benmocha A. Almagor L. Oz S. Hirsch J.A. Dascal N.

https://openalex.org/W2051908555,"Cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLD) in mammary epithelial cells undergo secretion by a unique membrane envelopment process to produce milk lipids. Adipophilin (ADPH/Plin2), a member of the perilipin/PAT family of lipid droplet-associated proteins, is hypothesized to mediate CLD secretion through interactions with apical plasma membrane elements. We found that the secretion of CLD coated by truncated ADPH lacking the C-terminal region encoding a putative four-helix bundle structure was impaired relative to that of CLD coated by full-length ADPH. We used homology modeling and analyses of the solution and membrane binding properties of purified recombinant ADPH C terminus to understand how this region possibly mediates CLD secretion. Homology modeling supports the concept that the ADPH C terminus forms a four-helix bundle motif and suggests that this structure can form stable membrane bilayer interactions. Circular dichroism and protease mapping studies confirmed that the ADPH C terminus is an independently folding α-helical structure that is relatively resistant to urea denaturation. Liposome binding studies showed that the purified C terminus binds to phospholipid membranes through electrostatic dependent interactions, and cell culture studies documented that it localizes to the plasma membrane. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that the ADPH C terminus forms a stable membrane binding helical structure that is important for CLD secretion. We speculate that interactions between the four-helix bundle of ADPH and membrane phospholipids may be an initial step in milk lipid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2145467073,"DAXX is a scaffold protein with diverse roles that often depend upon binding SUMO via its N- and/or C-terminal SUMO-interacting motifs (SIM-N and SIM-C). Using NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the <i>in vitro</i> binding properties of peptide models of SIM-N and SIM-C to SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. In each case, binding was mediated by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and weakened with increasing ionic strength. Neither isolated SIM showed any significant paralog specificity, and the measured μm range <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> values of SIM-N toward both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 were ∼4-fold lower than those of SIM-C. Furthermore, SIM-N bound SUMO-1 predominantly in a parallel orientation, whereas SIM-C interconverted between parallel and antiparallel binding modes on an ms to μs time scale. The differences in affinities and binding modes are attributed to the differences in charged residues that flank the otherwise identical hydrophobic core sequences of the two SIMs. In addition, within its native context, SIM-N bound intramolecularly to the adjacent N-terminal helical bundle domain of DAXX, thus reducing its apparent affinity for SUMO. This behavior suggests a possible autoregulatory mechanism for DAXX. The interaction of a C-terminal fragment of DAXX with an N-terminal fragment of the sumoylated Ets1 transcription factor was mediated by SIM-C. Importantly, this interaction did not involve any direct contacts between DAXX and Ets1, but rather was derived from the non-covalent binding of SIM-C to SUMO-1, which in turn was covalently linked to the unstructured N-terminal segment of Ets1. These results provide insights into the binding mechanisms and hence biological roles of the DAXX SUMO-interacting motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2126488115,"Loss of properly regulated cell death and cell survival pathways can contribute to the development of cancer and cancer metastasis. Cell survival signals are modulated by many different receptors, including integrins. Bit-1 is an effector of anoikis (cell death due to loss of attachment) in suspended cells. The anoikis function of Bit-1 can be counteracted by integrin-mediated cell attachment. Here, we explored integrin regulation of Bit-1 in adherent cells. We show that knockdown of endogenous Bit-1 in adherent cells decreased cell survival and re-expression of Bit-1 abrogated this effect. Furthermore, reduction of Bit-1 promoted both staurosporine and serum-deprivation induced apoptosis. Indeed knockdown of Bit-1 in these cells led to increased apoptosis as determined by caspase-3 activation and positive TUNEL staining. Bit-1 expression protected cells from apoptosis by increasing phospho-IκB levels and subsequently bcl-2 gene transcription. Protection from apoptosis under serum-free conditions correlated with bcl-2 transcription and Bcl-2 protein expression. Finally, Bit-1-mediated regulation of bcl-2 was dependent on focal adhesion kinase, PI3K, and AKT. Thus, we have elucidated an integrin-controlled pathway in which Bit-1 is, in part, responsible for the survival effects of cell-ECM interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2030183602,"In previous work we described a novel culture technique using a cholera toxin and PMA-free medium (Mel-mix) for obtaining pure melanocyte cultures from human adult epidermis. In Mel-mix medium the cultured melanocytes are bipolar, unpigmented and highly proliferative. Further characterization of the cultured melanocytes revealed the disappearance of c-Kit and TRP-1 and induction of nestin expression, indicating that melanocytes dedifferentiated in this in vitro culture. Cholera toxin and PMA were able to induce c-Kit and TRP-1 protein expressions in the cells, reversing dedifferentiation. TRP-1 mRNA expression was induced in dedifferentiated melanocytes by UV-B irradiated keratinocyte supernatants, however direct UV-B irradiation of the cells resulted in further decrease of TRP-1 mRNA expression. These dedifferentiated, easily accessible cultured melanocytes provide a good model for studying melanocyte differentiation and possibly transdifferentiation. Because melanocytes in Mel-mix medium can be cultured with human serum as the only supplement, this culture system is also suitable for autologous cell transplantation."

Therefore, we explored the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in mouse eggs using pharmacological inhibition and activation as well as a functionally dominant-negative catalytic PP2A subunit (dn-PP2Ac-L199P) coupled with live cell imaging.

https://openalex.org/W2066511915,"Calcium (Ca(2+)) influx through the plasma membrane store-operated Ca(2+) channel ORAI1 is controlled by Ca(2+) sensors of the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) family. STIM1 responds to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) store depletion by redistributing and activating ORAI1 from regions of the ER juxtaposed to the plasma membrane. Unlike STIM1, STIM2 can regulate ORAI1 in a store-dependent and store-independent manner, but the mechanism by which this is achieved is unknown. Here we find that STIM2 is translated from a highly conserved methionine residue and is directed to the ER by an incredibly long 101-amino acid signal peptide. We find that although the majority of the total STIM2 population resides on the ER membrane, a second population escapes ER targeting to accumulate as a full-length preprotein in the cytosol, signal peptide intact. Unlike STIM2, preSTIM2 localizes to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where it interacts with ORAI1 to regulate basal Ca(2+) concentration and Ca(2+)-dependent gene transcription in a store-independent manner. Furthermore, a third protein comprising a fragment of the STIM2 signal peptide is released from the ER membrane into the cytosol where it regulates gene transcription in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. This study establishes a new model for STIM2-mediated regulation of ORAI1 in which two distinct proteins, STIM2 and preSTIM2, control store-dependent and store-independent modes of ORAI1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1992774417,"Although surgery and radiotherapy have been the standard treatment modalities for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the integration of cisplatin (CDDP)-based therapy has led to improvements in local and regional control of disease for patients. However, many trials show that only 10-20% of patients benefit from this treatment intensification, which can result in profound treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the marginal survival improvement suggests that CDDP resistance is an innate characteristic of HNSCC. To elucidate the biological mechanisms underpinning CDDP resistance in HNSCC, we utilized an experimental model of CDDP resistance in this disease. We first observed significant enhancements in local tumor growth and metastasis, as well as adverse survival, in CDDP-resistant (CR) tumors compared with sensitive tumors. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this phenotype, we undertook a systems biology-based approach utilizing high-throughput PCR arrays, and we identified a significant suppression of KiSS1 mRNA and protein expression in the CR cells, but no significant regions of genomic loss with array comparative genomic hybridization. Genetic suppression of KiSS1 in CDDP-sensitive cell lines rendered them CR, an observation that was mechanistically linked to alterations in glutathione S-transferase-π expression and function. We next confirmed that, in human HNSCC tumors, loss of KiSS1 expression was associated with metastatic human HNSCC tumors compared with non-metastatic tumors. Genetic reconstitution of KiSS1 in CR cells abrogated cellular migration and induced CDDP sensitivity. To confirm these findings in a murine model, either CR or KiSS1-transfected CR cells were studied in an orthotopic model of HNSCC, or survival studies revealed significant improvement in survival of the mice bearing CR-KiSS1 tumors. Mechanistically, alterations in apoptotic pathways and CDDP metabolism contributed to KiSS1-associated chemotherapy sensitization. These studies provided further direct evidence for the role of KiSS1 loss in biologically aggressive HNSCC and suggest potential targets for therapy in CR cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2005893149,"Many ion channels have been shown to be regulated by the membrane signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).

The inhibition is observed as a reduction in the currents elicited by the partial agonist cGMP. These two effects were separable and arose from PIP2 binding to two different regions.

Mutating key positively charged amino acids in the C-terminal region adjacent to the membrane selectively disrupted PIP2-induced inhibition, suggesting a direct interaction between PIP2 in the membrane and amino acids in the C-terminal region that stabilizes the closed state relative to the open state in HCN channels. HCN channels are integral membrane proteins that are activated by membrane hyperpolarization and modulated by the direct binding of intracellular cyclic nucleotides. These channels underlie the If current in cardiac cells, where they tune pacemaker activity, and the Ih current in neuronal cells, where they act to oppose deviations away from the resting membrane potential, thereby stabilizing cellular excitability (1Biel M.

Like other members of this family, HCN channels are tetramers of similar or identical subunits that surround a central ion-conducting pore through the membrane. Each subunit is composed of a cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal region and a core region formed by the six transmembrane helices S1–S6. A single transmembrane pore is formed by the S5-S6 segments contributed by each of the four subunits, whereas the four voltage-sensing domains are formed by the S1–S4 segments from individual subunits (1Biel M.

The cytoplasmic C-terminal region contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) 2The abbreviations used are: CNBDcyclic nucleotide-binding domainPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatediC8dioctanoylPIPphosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphateCNGcyclic nucleotide-gated. and a C-linker domain that connects the CNBD to the pore. In most mammalian HCN channels, binding of cAMP to the CNBD results in a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, causing these channels to open more easily at resting membrane potentials (14Viscomi C.

Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, in the HCN channel from sea urchin (SpIH), binding of cAMP does not shift the voltage dependence but causes a large increase in the current due to the removal of autoinhibition (4Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The atomic structures of the C-terminal region of both HCN2 and SpIH bound to cAMP have been resolved by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1) (15Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N.

The C-linker regions of each subunit form a gating ring predicted to be adjacent to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (Fig. 1A). Attached to each C-linker is the CNBD (Fig. 1B). The CNBD of HCN channels shares substantial sequence and structural similarity with the CNBD of other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and catabolite gene activator protein (15Zagotta W.N.

Interestingly, despite the functional differences between SpIH and HCN2, their structures are very similar (root mean square deviation of the Cα atoms of 0.86 Å) (15Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B.

Recently, acidic phospholipids were shown to regulate HCN channel activation. Direct application of either exogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) or its soluble form, dioctanoyl (diC8)-PIP2, to excised inside-out patches containing HCN channels causes a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation (19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Zolles G. Klöcker N. Wenzel D. Weisser-Thomas J. Fleischmann B.K. Roeper J. Fakler B. Neuron. 2006; 52: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PIP2-induced shift occurs in all mammalian HCN channels tested thus far (HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4). In addition, PIP2 also shifts the activation voltage of HCN2ΔCNBD channels, in which the CNBD was deleted, suggesting that the mechanism for the voltage-dependent shift by PIP2 is distinct from the mechanism for the voltage-dependent shift by cAMP (19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, in addition to shifting the voltage dependence of activation, PIP2 also inhibits SpIH channels. Our results suggest that PIP2 binds to two separate regions: 1) the transmembrane core region, which produces potentiation, and 2) the C-linker domain, which produces inhibition. Two basic residues in the C-linker domain near the membrane were found to be involved in the inhibition of the channel by PIP2. These results suggest a model in which membrane-incorporated PIP2 binds to the C-linker and stabilizes the closed state of the HCN channel. SpIH cDNA (a gift from U. B. Kaupp) was subcloned into the pGEMHE high expression vector (a gift from E. Liman), where it was flanked by the Xenopus β-globin gene 5′- and 3′-UTRs. All cDNAs were linearized by digestion with SphI and then transcribed in vitro using the Ambion T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE into mRNAs. The mRNA was injected into surgically isolated stage IV Xenopus oocytes as described previously (21Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All mutations were generated using oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis and confirmed with fluorescence-based DNA sequencing. Electrophysiology experiments were conducted on full-length and truncated SpIH or SpIH mutant channels exogenously expressed in plasma membranes of Xenopus oocytes. SpIH currents were recorded from excised inside-out macropatches using conventional patch-clamp recording techniques (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). Both pipette and bath solutions contained 130 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). To modulate SpIH and mutant channels, saturating concentrations of cyclic nucleotides (1 mm cGMP or cAMP) were applied in the absence or presence of 10–30 μm PIP2 using a rapid solution changer (RSC-100, Bio-Logic). Ionic currents were amplified and low pass-filtered at 2 kHz using an Axopatch 200A system (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The currents were digitized at 10 kHz using an ITC-16 DA/AD converter (Instrutech Corp.) interfaced to a computer running PULSE software (HEKA Electronics, Inc.) and stored in files for offline analysis using IGOR software (WaveMetrics) or Excel software (Microsoft). diC8-PIP2 and diC8-phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PIP) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and stored at −20 °C until needed. On the day of the experiment, 1.5 mm stock solutions were made by adding water to the newly opened vial unless we were studying dose-response relationships. In that case, we added 1 mm cGMP in recording buffer instead of water. The solution was then kept on ice. Just prior to the application to the patch, the PIP2 was diluted with 1 mm cGMP to 10 or 30 μm generally in a volume of 2 ml. The solution was applied to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches within 3 min using a gravity-controlled perfusion system (RSC-100). Currents in response to voltages from −20 to −120 mV were continuously measured during the application of PIP2 for 10 min or until we lost the patch. To determine the voltage dependence and shifts in voltage dependence due to PIP2 modulation, we calculated the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship for wild-type and mutant channels in the absence and presence of cyclic nucleotides and cyclic nucleotides + PIP2. Peak tail current amplitudes were measured at −40 mV after being presented with an activating test pulse voltage given in the range of −20 to −130 mV. Currents were plotted against the test voltages (G-V plot), and the data were fit with the Boltzmann equation: G = base + Gmax,cNMP/(1 + e(−zδ(V − V1/2)F/RT)), where base is the non-voltage-dependent leak conductance, V is the test pulse voltage, V1/2 is the activation midpoint voltage, and zδ is the equivalent charge movement. We corrected for leak conductance by subtracting the non-voltage-dependent conductance (base) determined from the Boltzmann fit. The currents were normalized to the Gmax,cAMP determined at saturating voltages, −120 mV or greater. All fitting was performed with IGOR software. To calculate the energetic effects on SpIH channel opening caused by PIP2 modulation (ΔΔG), we assumed that our mutations outside the cyclic nucleotide-binding site did not change the cyclic nucleotide specificity of the channel. Therefore, the ratio of the opening equilibrium constants for cAMP and cGMP will be constant for all wild-type and mutant channels. Using the published values for wild-type SpIH channel open probability in cAMP (Po,cAMP = 0.91) and cGMP (Po,cGMP = 0.54) (16Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N. Structure. 2007; 15: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we calculated the opening equilibrium constants (LcAMP and LcGMP) for wild-type SpIH channels: LcGMP = Po,cGMP/(1 − Po,cGMP) and LcAMP = Po,cAMP/(1 − Po,cAMP)). Using these L values, we calculated the maximum conductance (Gmax) from GcAMP and GcGMP measured in each experiment using the following equation: Gmax = ((LcGMP/LcAMP) − 1)/(((LcGMP/LcAMP)/GcGMP) − (1/GcAMP)). With Gmax, we determined the energetics of channel opening using ΔG = −RT ln((G/Gmax)/(1 − (G/Gmax))), where G represents the conductance determined for cAMP, cGMP, or cGMP + PIP2 at saturating negative voltages; R is the ideal gas constant; and T is the absolute temperature. We also calculated the difference in opening free energy change resulting from PIP2 binding using the following equation: ΔΔG = ΔGcGMP,PIP2 − ΔGcGMP. Data for PIP2 and PIP dose-response relationships were taken from current measurements at saturating negative test voltages to −120 mV and normalized to Imax,No PIP. Current amplitudes were plotted against applied PIP2 or PIP concentration, and data were fit with the Hill equation: I = (Ibase/(Imax,No PIP2 −Ibase))/(1 + (K1/2/[PIP2])h), where [PIP2] is the phospholipid concentration, K1/2 is the agonist concentration eliciting half-maximal response, and h is the Hill coefficient. Data parameters were expressed as means ± S.E. and tabulated for comparison. One-way analysis of variance was performed using the Microsoft Excel statistical function with a significance level of 0.05. A post hoc Student's t test was used to determine which of the mutants was statistically different at p < 0.05. HCN channels open their transmembrane pore in response to both membrane hyperpolarization and the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides to a specialized C-terminal domain (1Biel M. Wahl-Schott C. Michalakis S. Zong X. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 847-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 2Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). SpIH is an HCN channel from sea urchin that exhibits properties somewhat different from those of mammalian HCN channels (4Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the absence of cyclic nucleotides, SpIH currents recorded from inside-out macropatches of Xenopus oocytes were very small and rapidly inactivated in response to membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 2A, black traces). After intracellular cAMP was applied, there was a large increase in current associated with a removal of autoinhibition (Fig. 2A, red trace) (23Shin K.S. Maertens C. Proenza C. Rothberg B.S. Yellen G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Unlike for mammalian HCN channels, cAMP causes little or no shift in the voltage dependence of SpIH (4Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, truncated SpIH channels lacking a C-terminal region (SpIHΔC) produced large non-inactivating currents that were insensitive to cAMP (Fig. 2B) (13Vemana S. Pandey S. Larsson H.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The response of SpIHΔC channels to membrane hyperpolarization was similar to that of wild-type SpIH channels bound to cAMP. These and similar results in mammalian HCN channels led to the conclusion that, in HCN channels, the C-terminal domain acts as an autoinhibitory domain and that the binding of cyclic nucleotides releases this inhibition, facilitating channel opening (24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). SpIH channels also differ from other HCN channels in agonist specificity (4Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, application of 1 mm cAMP to SpIH channels caused a dramatic increase in the current over control currents in the absence of cyclic nucleotide (Fig. 3, A and B, dashed red versus dashed black traces). Unlike for other HCN channels, however, cGMP behaved as a partial agonist of SpIH channels (Fig. 3, A and B, dashed green versus dashed red traces). At hyperpolarized voltages, saturating concentrations of cGMP activated only about half the amount of current activated by cAMP (16Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N. Structure. 2007; 15: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The difference in the amount of current elicited by saturating cGMP and cAMP reflects a difference in efficacy between the two ligands to stabilize the open state of the channel relative to the closed state and not a difference in single-channel conductance (16Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N. Structure. 2007; 15: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results indicate that, in SpIH channels, cGMP only partially stabilizes channel opening, whereas cAMP produces a greater stabilization. Therefore, the partial activation by cGMP can be used as a sensitive reporter of the energetics of agonist activation of SpIH channels. Earlier studies have shown that PIP2 acts as an allosteric modulator of mammalian HCN channels. Depletion of endogenous PIP2 from the membrane causes a negative shift in voltage dependence upon patch excision (19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Zolles G. Klöcker N. Wenzel D. Weisser-Thomas J. Fleischmann B.K. Roeper J. Fakler B. Neuron. 2006; 52: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, when exogenous PIP2 or the soluble form, diC8-PIP2, is applied to HCN channels in inside-out patches, a positive shift in voltage dependence of activation occurs (19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We used the voltage dependence and cyclic nucleotide dependence of gating in SpIH channels to study the molecular mechanism of phosphoinositide modulation using soluble diC8-PIP2 (hereafter referred to as PIP2). We found that, as in mammalian HCN channels, PIP2 modulated SpIH channels (Fig. 3A, solid traces). After an initial 20-min waiting period for the depletion of endogenous PIP2, we applied 10 μm PIP2 to SpIH channels in inside-out patches, which caused a positive shift in the voltage dependence of activation in the presence of either cAMP or cGMP (Fig. 3B, solid traces). PIP2 shifted the midpoint of the activation (ΔV1/2) ∼10 mV toward depolarizing voltages for both cAMP and cGMP (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, however, in SpIH, PIP2 also produced a significant inhibition of the currents measured at hyperpolarized voltages and saturating cGMP concentrations (Fig. 3A). In the absence of PIP2, the maximum conductance of cGMP-modulated channels was about half the conductance of cAMP-modulated channels (GcGMP/Gmax,cAMP = 0.57 ± 0.04, n = 5) (Fig. 3B, dotted green curve). Assuming a simple closed-open equilibrium, this fractional activation by cGMP corresponds to a free energy change (ΔG) for opening in cGMP of −0.11 ± 0.09 kcal/mol (n = 5) (see “Experimental Procedures”). After 10 min in the presence of 10 μm PIP2, the cGMP-induced current at hyperpolarized voltages was inhibited by ∼50% (GcGMP,PIP2/Gmax,cAMP = 0.28 ± 0.03, n = 5 (Fig. 3B, solid green curve); or ΔG = 0.61 ± 0.08 kcal/mol (Fig. 3D)). This suggests that PIP2 caused a change in the free energy of opening in the presence of cyclic nucleotides (ΔΔG) of ∼0.72 ± 0.02 kcal/mol (n = 5). As expected for a change in free energy, currents measured in the more efficacious agonist cAMP exhibited a much smaller decrease in 10 μm PIP2 (GcAMP,PIP2/Gmax,cAMP = 0.93 ± 0.02, n = 5) (Fig. 3D). The inhibition seen at large negative voltages at saturating cyclic nucleotide concentrations suggests that PIP2 is stabilizing the closed state of channels relative to the open state. We observed that PIP2 produced two effects on SpIH channels: potentiation of the voltage-dependent gating and inhibition of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent gating. To identify regions involved in PIP2 regulation, we applied PIP2 to SpIHΔC channels. As shown previously, currents measured from channels lacking a C-terminal region were large and similar in time course to currents measured in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4A). We found that 30 μm PIP2 produced a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence that changed the half-maximal activating voltage (ΔV1/2) by 4.8 ± 0.9 mV (n = 3) (Fig. 4, B, C, and G). This voltage shift for SpIHΔC was similar although somewhat smaller than what we observed in wild-type SpIH channels bound by cAMP or cGMP. In contrast to wild-type channels, however, PIP2 did not inhibit SpIHΔC. On the contrary, SpIHΔC exhibited a small reversible potentiation in the maximum conductance (GPIP2/Gmax,No PIP2 = 1.13 ± 0.06, n = 3) (Fig. 4, C and H), unlike cAMP-modulated wild-type SpIH channels (Fig. 3). Similarly, SpIH channels lacking both N- and C-terminal regions (SpIHΔNC) also showed a depolarizing shift in voltage dependence (ΔV1/2 = 7.8 ± 0.98 mV, n = 4) and a small reversible increase in maximum conductance (GPIP2/Gmax,No PIP2 = 1.09 ± 0.24, n = 4) (Fig. 4, E–H). These results show that the potentiating effects of PIP2 on voltage-dependent gating can be physically separated from the inhibitory effects of PIP2 on ligand gating. The reversible increase in maximum conductance observed in the deletion mutants is a further indication that the potentiating effect induced by PIP2 is distinct from the inhibitory effect, which accounts for the lack of an increase in conductance in wild-type SpIH in the presence of cAMP. From these results, we conclude that PIP2 interacts with two distinct sites on the channel: one site in the transmembrane region (amino acids 161–470) that shifts the voltage dependence and a second site in the intracellular C-terminal region (deleted amino acids 471–767) that inhibits the cyclic nucleotide regulation. The acyl chains of PIP2 are expected to intercalate into the hydrophobic regions of the plasma membrane, whereas the negatively charged headgroup extends into the cytoplasm. Given this physical arrangement of these molecules, the negative charges on PIP2 most likely interact with positively charged residues in the region of the HCN channel protein adjacent to the membrane. The atomic structure of the C-terminal region of SpIH was resolved by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1) (16Flynn G.E. Black K.D. Islas L.D. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N. Structure. 2007; 15: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region contains a C-linker domain followed by a CNBD. The C-linker domain begins immediately after the pore-lining S6 transmembrane helix and contains six α-helices (A′–F′). It is the site of virtually all of the intersubunit interactions in the C-terminal region, primarily interactions between the A′ and B′ helices of one subunit and the C′ and D′ helices of a neighboring subunit. The A′ helix is predicted to lie adjacent to and nearly parallel to the plasma membrane. The amino acid sequence of the A′ helix contains four positively charged residues, Arg-475, Arg-478, Lys-480, and Lys-482 (Fig. 5A). With the exception of Lys-480, all of these residues are on the same surface of the A′ helix, and they all point toward the membrane (Fig. 5B). Lys-480 points away from the plasma membrane and interacts with the C′ helix of the neighboring subunit through a salt bridge with Glu-522. Arg-475, Arg-478, and Lys-482 are positioned to interact with PIP2 in the inner leaflet of the membrane. We hypothesized that the positively charged amino acids of the A′ helix are involved in electrostatic interactions with PIP2 in the plasma membrane and that these interactions are responsible for the PIP2-induced inhibition of SpIH. To test our hypothesis, we mutated each of the three residues individually and quantified the inhibitory effects elicited by PIP2. In each case, a positively charged amino acid was replaced with cysteine. To ensure that our mutant channels were free of endogenous PIP2, we waited 20 min after patch excision for the depletion of endogenous PIP2 before applying exogenous PIP2. We started by characterizing each mutant channel over a range of test voltages, −20 to −120 mV, in the absence of cyclic nucleotides, in 1 mm cGMP, and in 1 mm cAMP (Fig. 6). Two of the mutant channels, R475C and R478C, exhibited increases in the fractional activation by cGMP (GcGMP/Gmax,cAMP) at hyperpolarized voltages relative to wild-type SpIH (Fig. 6, A–D). In addition, R475C exhibited an increase in fractional activation in the absence of cyclic nucleotide, suggesting that the CNBD does not autoinhibit R475C mutant channels as efficiently as wild-type channels. The voltage dependence of activation for all three mutants was very close to that for wild-type SpIH. Next, we evaluated the functional effects of PIP2 on each of the three mutant channels. All three mutant channels exhibited depolarizing shifts in voltage in response to 10 μm PIP2 (Fig. 6, B, D, and F). Although R475C exhibited PIP2-induced reduction in cGMP-activated current, both R478C and K482C exhibited significantly less inhibition by PIP2. The amount of PIP2 inhibition observed depended on the free energy of opening, and for the R475C mutant, the opening in cGMP is more favorable than for the wild type (cGMP is almost a full agonist), so the inhibition appeared less (Fig. 7). Our thermodynamic analysis took this into account (see calculation of ΔG under “Experimental Procedures”). The ΔΔG for PIP2-induced inhibition of K478C was significantly different from that in the wild type (one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Student's t test, p < 0.01). These results suggest that Arg-478 and Lys-482 can interact with PIP2 in the membrane and stabilize the closed state relative to the open state. Finally, we determined the apparent affinity of PIP2 and diC8-PIP for producing inhibition in both wild-type SpIH and the K478C mutant. Currents were recorded in the presence of 1 mm cGMP and varying concentrations of PIP2 for wild-type SpIH or K478C (Fig. 8, A and B). The amplitudes of currents elicited by −120-mV test pulses were measured and plotted relative to the PIP2 concentration (Fig. 8C). We averaged the dose-response data from three patches and fit these data with the Hill equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fit to the dose-response data for SpIH yielded a maximum inhibition by PIP2 of IPIP2/IcGMP,No PIP2 = 55%, K1/2 = 3.6 μm, and Hill coefficient = 1 (Fig. 8C, closed circles). The maximum inhibition of wild-type SpIH by PIP was IPIP/IcGMP,No PIP = 49%, K1/2 = 13.6 μm, and Hill coefficient = 1 (Fig. 8D, open circles). In contrast, the dose-response relationships of R478C for both PIP2 and PIP were nearly flat with respect to the concentration of phosphoinositides (Fig. 8, C and D, squares). These results show that both PIP2 and PIP inhibit SpIH similarly but with different apparent affinities and that the inhibitory effects are disrupted by the R478C mutation. In this work, we found that PIP2 had two different and separable effects on SpIH channels. First, as reported previously for mammalian HCN channels (19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Zolles G. Klöcker N. Wenzel D. Weisser-Thomas J. Fleischmann B.K. Roeper J. Fakler B.

Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), PIP2 potentiated SpIH by causing a depolarizing shift in voltage-dependent activation. Second, PIP2 also inhibited SpIH, causing a decrease in saturating cGMP-activated currents at maximum hyperpolarizing voltages. For SpIH channels, the inhibition was appreciable only with cGMP and not with cAMP because cGMP is a partial agonist and does not maximally open SpIH channels even at saturating concentrations. As a result of these two different actions of PIP2, there is a characteristic crossover of the G-V relationships, with PIP2 causing potentiation at depolarized voltages and inhibition at hyperpolarized voltages. The PIP2-induced potentiation was localized to the transmembrane region of the channel containing the pore and voltage-sensing domains because PIP2 produced shifts in the voltage dependence of SpIHΔC and SpIHΔNC. A depolarizing shift in voltage dependence could result from a mechanism in which PIP2 stabilized either 1) the open state of the pore (relative to the closed state) or 2) the activated (down) state of the voltage sensor (relative to the resting state). These mechanisms can be distinguished based on the effects of PIP2 on the C-terminal deletion mutants at large hyperpolarizing voltages, where presumably all of the voltage sensors are activated. A stabilization of the open state of the pore might be expected to increase the current even after all the voltage sensors are activated (assuming that the open probability is not already near one). As shown in Fig. 4G, PIP2 caused a small but significant increase in the cGMP-activated current at hyperpolarized voltages in the deletion mutants, suggesting that the potentiating effect of PIP2 cannot simply be just on the movement of the voltage sensor. However, if all of the potentiating and inhibitory effects of PIP2 were acting on the pore in wild-type channels, we would not observe the crossover of the G-V curves, which is characteristic of the effects of PIP2 on wild-type SpIH channels. For these reasons, we favor the idea that PIP2-induced potentiation of voltage-dependent activation arises in part from a stabilization of the activated state of the voltage sensor. Such stabilization could result from a generalized effect of PIP2 on the potential felt by the voltage sensor (such as a surface charge effect). Alternatively, it could result from a specific electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged PIP2 and positively charged residues in the activated (down) state of the voltage sensor. The PIP2-induced inhibition was localized to the C-terminal region of the channel containing the C-linker and CNBD. Previously, it was proposed that the apo-state of the C-terminal region in HCN channels produces an autoinhibition on channel opening and that the binding of cyclic nucleotide relieves this autoinhibition (24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Consistent with this mechanism, we and others have shown that deletion of the C-terminal region in SpIH channels removes the autoinhibition seen in wild-type SpIH in the absence of cyclic nucleotide (Fig. 2) (13Vemana S. Pandey S. Larsson H.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism for PIP2-induced inhibition might be to stabilize the autoinhibitory state of the C-terminal region. The partial agonist cGMP is therefore less able to promote opening in the presence of PIP2, causing a reduction in current at strong hyperpolarized voltages. However, the full agonist cAMP contributes a greater energy to channel opening and can overcome the inhibition by PIP2. A mechanism for autoinhibition has been proposed to involve the C-linker domain (2Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 24Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 14728-14738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The C-linker domain has extensive intersubunit interactions, primarily involving interactions between the A′ and B′ helices of one subunit and the C′ and D′ helices of a neighboring subunit. These helices form a gating ring at the intracellular entrance to the pore that may restrict movement of the S6 region and channel opening. We have shown that mutating Arg-478 and Lys-482, positively charged residues on the A′ helix adjacent to the membrane, disrupts PIP2-induced inhibition of SpIH. Interestingly, Arg-478 is not conserved among HCN channels, possibly explaining why no consistent inhibition was seen for mammalian HCN2 (see supplemental Fig. S2 in Ref. 19Pian P. Bucchi A. Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, an electrostatic interaction between Arg-478 and Lys-482 with PIP2 in the inner leaflet of the membrane may help stabilize the gating ring, producing autoinhibition. PIP2 has been shown to regulate many other plasma membrane ion channels and transporters. The list includes inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels, KCNQ channels, transient receptor potential channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, epithelial sodium channels, two-P domain potassium channels (K2p), and ion transporters such as the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (28Suh B.C. Hille B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 29Suh B.C. Hille B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In general, these proteins are activated by PIP2 or require PIP2 to function (27Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PIP2 does not activate cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. Instead, CNG channels, particularly heteromeric channels formed from CNGA1 and CNGB1 subunits, are inhibited by PIP2 (30Womack K.B. Gordon S.E. He F. Wensel T.G. Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2792-2799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CNG channels are members of the same cyclic nucleotide-regulated family of channels as HCN channels and contain a C-linker and CNBD structurally similar to the HCN C-terminal region (2Craven K.B. Zagotta W.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 375-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Craven K.B. Olivier N.B. Zagotta W.N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2004; 124: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The A′ helix of the CNGB subunit contains a positively charged residue at a site equivalent to Arg-478, and the A′ helix of the CNGA subunit contains a number of positively charged residues at other sites (Fig. 5A). As in SpIH, PIP2 has a dual effect on HERG channels, another member of the cyclic nucleotide-regulated family of channels. Application of PIP2 to HERG channels shifts the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials while it also decreases the rate of inactivation (31Bian J.S. McDonald T.V. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether the molecular mechanism for PIP2 regulation is similar between HCN, CNG, and HERG channels.

It has been recently revealed that p53 induction, along with cell cycle arrest, is related with abnormal ribosome biogenesis, but the exact mechanism still remains unknown. In this study, we have found that aberrant ribosome biogenesis activates two parallel cellular pathways, c-Myc and ASK1/p38, which result in p53 induction and G1 arrest. The c-Myc stabilizes p53 by rpL11-mediated HDM2 inhibition, and ASK1/p38 activates p53 by phosphorylation on serine 15 and 33. Our studies demonstrate the relationship between these two pathways and p53 induction. The changes caused by impaired ribosomal stress, such as p53 induction and G1 arrest, were completely disappeared by inhibition of either pathway. These findings suggest a monitoring mechanism of c-Myc and ASK1/p38 against abnormal ribosome biogenesis through controlling the stability and activity of p53 protein."

Here, we provide evidence that both modulated Notch and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling affect the generation of neurons in the olfactory epithelium and reduce the number of migratory neurons, so called epithelioid cells. We show that this reduction of epithelial and migratory neurons is followed by a subsequent failure or complete absence of olfactory nerve formation. These data provide new insights into the early generation of neurons in the olfactory epithelium and the initial formation of the olfactory nerve tract. Our results present a novel mechanism in which BMP signals negatively affect Notch activity in a dominant manner in the olfactory epithelium, thereby regulating neurogenesis and explain why a balance of BMP and Notch activity is critical for the generation of neurons and proper development of the olfactory nerve."

IntroductionThe myriad forms of cyclic and linear tetrapyrroles, including heme, chlorophyll, siroheme, cobalamine (B12), and the phycobilins, are essential for energy production/utilization in virtually all life forms. Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathways are complex and phylogenetically variable, suggesting the potential for species-selective control (1Holliday G.L. Thornton J.M. Marquet A. Smith A.G. Rébeillé F. Mendel R. Schubert H.L. Lawrence A.D. Warren M.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 972-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The universal portion of this pathway consists of only three reactions, the first of which involves biosynthesis of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen from two molecules of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 3The abbreviations used are: ALA5-aminolevulinic acidPBGSporphobilinogen synthase(s)TgPBGST. gondii PBGSPDBProtein Data Bank. (Fig. 1), catalyzed by porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS; EC 4.2.1.24; also known as 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase or ALAD). The photoreactive and toxic nature of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis intermediates mandates close regulation of this pathway, and various mechanisms are used for control. We recently have described an unusual mechanism of allosteric regulation involving transition between a high activity PBGS octamer and a low activity hexamer (2Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nature Structural Biology. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Kokona B. Rigotti D.J. Wasson A.S. Lawrence S.H.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3245-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In plants, an allosteric magnesium ion favors octamer formation by binding at a subunit interface not present in the hexamer (2Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nature Structural Biology. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The term “morpheeins” has been used to describe oligomers that can disassemble, change shape in the dissociated state, and reassemble to a structurally and functionally distinct oligomer (5Jaffe E.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 490-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Fig. 2 illustrates the quaternary structure dynamics of plant and mammalian PBGS, using the human structure by way of example. “Hugging” and “detached” dimers (pathway A) are observed as the asymmetric crystallographic units for wild type and mutant forms of human PBGS (PDB codes 1E51 and 1PV8, respectively (2Breinig S. Kervinen J. Stith L. Wasson A.S. Fairman R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Jaffe E.K. Nature Structural Biology. 2003; 10: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Mills-Davies N.L. Structure of Human Erythrocyte 5-Aminolaevulinic Acid Dehydratase, the Second Enzyme in the Biosynthesis Pathway of Haem. University of Southampton, Southampton, UK2000Google Scholar)). The structure of the physiologically relevant dimer, and the pathway of hexamer-octamer conversion, remains unclear, however, as biochemical and biophysical tools demonstrate that interconversion between octameric and hexameric oligomers involves a conformationally flexible dimer (4Selwood T. Tang L. Lawrence S.H. Anokhina Y. Jaffe E.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3245-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Tang L. Stith L. Jaffe E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15786-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of wild-type human PBGS establishes that the hexamer is a pH-dependent component of the quaternary structure equilibrium and suggests that oligomer dissociation proceeds via the pro-octamer and pro-hexamer dimers (Fig. 2, pathway B), rather than the crystallographically defined hugging and detached dimers (4Selwood T. Tang L. Lawrence S.H. Anokhina Y. Jaffe E.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3245-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sequence differences between the PBGS enzymes of different species may be manifested as differences in protein structure and quaternary dynamics, making it essential to understand the structural changes associated with this equilibrium if we are to develop species-selective small molecules (8Van Voorhis W.C. Hol W.G. Myler P.J. Stewart L.J. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000530Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that are able to modulate PBGS activity by altering oligomeric equilibria.FIGURE 2The quaternary structure dynamic of some PBGS. Human PBGS crystal structures (PDB codes 1E51 and 1PV8) are used to illustrate the alternate assemblies the protein can adopt. The alternate dissociation pathways denote possible mechanisms for PBGS oligomer dissociation to dimers. The hugging and detached dimers (pathway A) are the asymmetric crystallographic units of the crystal structures. Based on the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of surfaces exposed upon dissociation, the pro-octamer and pro-hexamer dimers (pathway B) of human PBGS have been proposed to be the physiologically relevant dimers (4Selwood T. Tang L. Lawrence S.H. Anokhina Y. Jaffe E.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3245-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

In addition, the TgPBGS octamer is not destabilized by magnesium chelation (13Shanmugam D. Wu B. Ramirez U. Jaffe E.K. Roos D.S. J. Biol.

Distinctions are seen in 1) the asymmetric crystallographic unit, 2) the structures of both the N and C termini, and 3) the active site ligands. The TgPBGS structure explains how the C-terminal extension characteristic of apicomplexan PBGS enzymes stabilizes the octameric structure through intersubunit domain swapping interactions and argues that the biologically relevant PBGS dimer is different from the dimer observed as the crystallographic asymmetric unit in other structures.RESULTSThe TgPBGS structure, mechanism, and metal ions are described in context with the PBGS family of enzymes, which is highly homologous throughout much of the protein, but significantly variant in the N and C termini (Fig. 3).TgPBGS Crystal Structure SolutionThe TgPBGS crystal belongs to the primitive orthorhombic space group P21212 and diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The crystal had unit-cell parameters a = 177.11, b = 187.17, and c = 95.86. The data set was 98.6% complete, with an Rmerge of 11.5%. The I/σ (I) ratio in the last resolution bin was 2.3. Statistics of data collection parameters are summarized in Table 1. TgPBGS crystal structure determination follows that of yeast, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chlorobium vibrioforme, human, and mouse PBGS proteins, which are all homo-oligomeric enzymes, with a common subunit structure minimally consisting of an αβ-barrel domain and an N-terminal arm domain (22Erskine P.T.

Biol. 1997; 4: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In all known PBGS proteins, the N-terminal arm is essential for oligomer assembly. In the case of TgPBGS, the oligomer is an octamer whose subunits are denoted A through H, which together establish the asymmetric crystallographic unit (Fig. 4a). In addition, TgPBGS contains fully formed porphobilinogen in all eight active sites.TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsPDB code3OBKSpace groupP21212Space group number18Unit-cell parametersa (Å)177.11b (Å)187.17c (Å)95.86α90°β90°γ90°Resolution limits (Å) (last shell)49.93-2.5Rwork overall0.177Rfree overall0.232Mean Biso23.2r.m.s.d. in bondlengths (Å)0.014r.m.s.d. in angles1.497°Rmerge (IOBS) (%) (last shell)11.5 (53.8)I/σ(I) overall (last shell)11.8 (2.3)Completeness overall (%)98.6 (90.3)Model detailsTotal non-hydrogen atoms22,298Protein atoms21,476Ligand atoms (PBG)136Ethylene glycol76Metal atoms8Chlorine atoms16Water O atoms586Ramachandran outliers8/2800 (0.3%)Ramachandran favored2717/2800 (97.0%) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4The TgPBGS structure. a, two orthogonal orientations of the TgPBGS octamer showing each subunit in a different color, with the subunits labeled A–H.

The N-terminal arm of the magenta subunit lies against the internal face of the αβ-barrel domain of the cyan subunit, constituting the pro-octamer dimer (see Fig. 2). The C-terminal tails of the pro-octamer dimer form an intersubunit β-sheet (tail swap), emphasized in c. c, using the same orientation as in part b, and pale colors for the rest of subunits A and C, the tail swap is highlighted (circled in black). d, details of the C-terminal tail portion of the pro-octamer dimer illustrate additional intersubunit interactions between the C-terminal β-strand of the magenta subunit and both the N-terminal arm and αβ-barrel region of the cyan subunit. Reciprocal interactions are not shown. e, the eight subunits of the TgPBGS crystallographic asymmetric unit are overlaid using wireframe representation and colored by thermal factors (red is hot or mobile, and blue is cold or fixed). Porphobilinogen at the active site is shown in spheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)N-terminal Arm of TgPBGSAs seen in other PBGS structures, the N-terminal arm of one subunit of the TgPBGS oligomer wraps around the side of the αβ-barrel of another subunit and nestles into the base of the αβ-barrel of a third subunit (Fig. 4b). Structural superposition of PBGS from different species (TgPBGS, PDB code 3OBK; yeast PBGS, PDB code 1OHL; P. aeruginosa PBGS, PDB code 2WOQ; and C. vibrioform PBGS, PDB code 2C1H) (Fig. 5) reveals excellent superposition in the region of the αβ-barrel domain and the first helix-turn-helix of the N-terminal arm but significant variation in the most N-terminal region of the protein (residues 5–24 of TgPBGS). Structural conservation through the αβ-barrel domain and the adjacent helix-turn-helix portion of the N-terminal arm (TgPBGS residues 25–342) is consistent with the sequence conservation (Fig. 3). However, the conformation of the N-terminal 24 amino acids of TgPBGS is different from that seen in any previous PBGS crystal structure, most specifically yeast PBGS, for which there is also significant structural information N-terminal to the conserved domains (Fig. 5). Interpretation of the significance of the N-terminal arm positioning in TgPBGS is confounded by a lack of information on the low complexity region of sequence, which is present in the gene, and presumably also present in the physiologically relevant mature protein, but not present in the expression construct used for this work. The likely trajectory for this missing portion of the protein is outside the octamer (see N termini in Fig. 4a). Like most other PBGS crystal structures, the most N-terminal residues of TgPBGS (residues 1–4 of each subunit) are disordered. Because of the importance of the intersubunit location of the N-terminal arm, phylogenetic sequence differences therein dictate differences in the strength of the interactions between subunits and factors into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the quaternary structure equilibrium shown in Fig. 2.FIGURE 5A comparison of the structure of PBGS from various species. Two images are provided to illustrate the considerable variation observed in the conformation of PBGS N and C termini. Structures are overlaid for a single subunit from TgPBGS (PDB code 3OBK, green), yeast PBGS (PDB code 1OHL, yellow), C. vibrioforme PBGS (PDB code 2CLH, cyan), and P. aeruginosa PBGS (PDB code 2WOQ, magenta). Where visible, the N and C termini of TgPBGS are labeled; cylindrical arrows are provided adjacent to one helix to facilitate orientation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)C-terminal Extension (Tail) of TgPBGSOne unique aspect of the TgPBGS crystal structure is a C-terminal extension of ∼13 amino acids, which is present in only a small number of known PBGS sequences but interestingly in all known apicomplexan PBGS sequences. The sequence of this C-terminal extension is conserved poorly across the phylum but conserved highly within individual subclasses, i.e. the different Plasmodium species (Haemosporidia) all have the same extension sequence, which differs completely from the conserved sequence in coccidian parasites including Toxoplasma (supplemental Fig. 1). TgPBGS provides the first structure for the C-terminal extension. From the perspective of a TgPBGS monomer, as the N-terminal region is called the arm, we denote the C-terminal extension as the tail. Fig. 4c illustrates how the C-terminal tail also sits at an interface of TgPBGS subunits. In most PBGS crystal structures, the few C-terminal structured amino acids are α-helical, followed by a small number of unstructured residues. In TgPBGS, the first few amino acids of the C-terminal tail show a continuation of this common α-helix, followed by a loop which ends as a β-strand (amino acids 353–356). This β-strand structure is involved in the formation of an intersubunit anti-parallel β-sheet with the neighboring subunit such that the subunit pair forms the pro-octamer dimer (Fig. 4c and Fig. 2). This interaction is denoted as the tail-swap and is consistent with our previously published findings that the C-terminal tail is essential for octamer formation (13Shanmugam D. Wu B. Ramirez U. Jaffe E.K. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22122-22131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite significant intersubunit interactions seen in many other PBGS octamers, the tail swap seen in TgPBGS is the first example of an intersubunit β-sheet. Nearly all other intersubunit interactions occur in helical or coiled regions and all involve amino acid side chains. Because β-sheet formation involves only backbone hydrogen bonds, lack of sequence conservation in this region does not preclude similar β-sheet formation in other PBGS that have a C-terminal tail.TgPBGS OctamerAlthough all PBGS proteins are believed to be capable of forming an octamer, TgPBGS is the first crystal structure to contain a full octamer in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic asymmetric units of octameric yeast PBGS (PDB codes 1AW5, 1H7N, 1H7R, 1QNV, 1EB3, 1HO7, 1OHL, 1W31, 1GJP, 1H7P, 1QML, and 1YLV) are all monomers; those of E. coli PBGS (PDB codes 1B4E, 1I8J, 1L6S, and 1L6Y) are monomers or dimers; those of P. aeruginosa PBGS (PDB codes 1B4K, 1GZG, 2WOQ, 2C13, 2C14, 2C15, 2C16, 2C18, and 2C19) are dimers except for one, which is a monomer; that of human (PDB code 1E51) is a dimer; those of C. vibrioform PBGS (PDB codes 1W1Z and 2C1H) are dimers; and those of mouse PBGS (PDB codes 2Z0I and 2Z1B) are dimers or tetramers (23Berman H. Henrick K. Nakamura H. Markley J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D301-D303Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). With eight individual subunits in the TgPBGS crystallographic asymmetric unit, we are provided the opportunity to compare the subunits of the entire oligomer and to potentially witness variations in side chains or backbone conformations that reflect motions available to the protein. In fact, superposition of the eight subunits of TgPBGS shows that the backbone atoms are essentially superimposable (intersubunit Cα root mean square deviations are in the range of 0.152–0.170 Å), and there is some minor variation in the side chains (intersubunit root mean square deviations for all atoms are in the range of 0.182–0.197 Å) (Fig. 4e). Unlike some PBGS structures, which show significant variation in thermal factors between the subunits of a dimeric asymmetric crystallographic unit, the thermal factors of TgPBGS are consistent between all subunits (Fig. 4e).The assembly of the TgPBGS octamer can be described in terms of the N-terminal arm-hugging interaction and the C-terminal tail-swapping interaction (Fig. 4, b and c). Subunit A swaps tails with C; C hugs D; D swaps tails with H; H hugs G; G swaps tails with F; F hugs E; E swaps tails with B; and B hugs A, thus forming the complete octamer with these two types of subunit interactions, as illustrated by the paper model (supplemental Fig. 2). Although these interactions are sufficient to describe TgPBGS assembly, each tail-swapping interaction of TgPBGS is accompanied by an interaction where the N-terminal arm of one subunit nestles into the base of the αβ-barrel of the partner subunit. For those PBGS that do not have the tail-swap interaction, this arm-to-base of barrel interaction is necessary for assembly of either the octamer or the hexamer (Fig. 2). Experimentally eradicating this interaction in human PBGS by the mutation W19A resulted in a dimeric protein that could make neither octamer nor hexamer (24Tang L. Breinig S. Stith L. Mischel A. Tannir J. Kokona B. Fairman R. Jaffe E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6682-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Comparison of the human pro-octamer dimer (Fig. 2, which is derived from adjacent asymmetric units of PDB code 1E51) and the TgPBGS pro-octamer dimer (Fig. 4c) shows that the C-terminal tail-swapping of TgPBGS provides significant additional stability to the pro-octamer dimer. The C-terminal tail also provides stabilization for the pro-octamer dimer by interacting with the N-terminal arm (at amino acids 41, 43, and 44) as well as the αβ-barrel (at amino acids 315 and 319) of the partner subunit (Fig. 4d). The C-terminal tail does not provide intersubunit interactions outside that of the pro-octamer dimer. Pro-octamer dimer stabilizing interactions facilitated by the C-terminal tail prevent the conformational change required for formation of the pro-hexamer dimer and hence prevent hexamer assembly (Fig. 2). If the pro-octamer dimer is physiologically relevant, the inability to traverse from pro-octamer to pro-hexamer conformations explains why TgPBGS does not sample the hexameric assembly. If the hugging dimer is relevant physiologically, we cannot make a structural argument for why TgPBGS does not sample the hexameric assembly. Thus, we conclude that the pro-octamer dimer, rather than the hugging dimer is the physiologically relevant dimer of TgPBGS, which is seen as a low percentage of the oligomeric equilibrium in the purified protein (13Shanmugam D. Wu B. Ramirez U. Jaffe E.K. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22122-22131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutant form of TgPBGS lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids, and hence the entire β-strand structure, fails to form octamers and remains as dimers that are unstable and prone to precipitation. These dimers most likely exist as the physiologically irrelevant hugging dimer.TgPBGS Structure as It Relates to PBGS-catalyzed ReactionLike most αβ-barrel enzymes, the PBGS active site is in a pocket near the center of the αβ-barrel where eight loops connect the β-strands to the α-helices (25Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Garland Science, London1999: 53-54Google Scholar). Characteristically, there is an active site lid that gates entry and exit of substrates and products. In the human PBGS structure (PDB code 1E51) and the P. aeruginosa PBGS structure (PDB code 1B4K), the active site lid region is ordered in subunit A and disordered in subunit B of the dimeric asymmetric crystallographic units. By homology with these and other PBGS crystal structures that contain disordered lids, the active site lid of TgPBGS is roughly between residues 222–240 (Fig. 3). PBGS catalysis occurs in a stepwise fashion (26Jaffe E.K. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Heinemann I.U. Schulz C. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. Wang Y.G. Kobayashi Y. Awa Y. Wachi M. Jahn D. Jahn M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When the lid is open, P-side ALA (Fig. 1) binds first and forms a Schiff base intermediate to Lys-267, the water formed diffuses away and then A-side ALA binds. There is substantial evidence that the PBGS-catalyzed reaction also may involve Schiff base formation between A-side ALA and Lys-213 (e.g. Refs. 28Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R.

https://openalex.org/W1995476940,"When goal-directed movements are inaccurate, two responses are generated by the brain: a fast motor correction toward the target and an adaptive motor recalibration developing progressively across subsequent trials. For the saccadic system, there is a clear dissociation between the fast motor correction (corrective saccade production) and the adaptive motor recalibration (primary saccade modification). Error signals used to trigger corrective saccades and to induce adaptation are based on post-saccadic visual feedback. The goal of this study was to determine if similar or different error signals are involved in saccadic adaptation and in corrective saccade generation. Saccadic accuracy was experimentally altered by systematically displacing the visual target during motor execution. Post-saccadic error signals were studied by manipulating visual information in two ways. First, the duration of the displaced target after primary saccade termination was set at 15, 50, 100 or 800 ms in different adaptation sessions. Second, in some sessions, the displaced target was followed by a visual mask that interfered with visual processing. Because they rely on different mechanisms, the adaptation of reactive saccades and the adaptation of voluntary saccades were both evaluated. We found that saccadic adaptation and corrective saccade production were both affected by the manipulations of post-saccadic visual information, but in different ways. This first finding suggests that different types of error signal processing are involved in the induction of these two motor corrections. Interestingly, voluntary saccades required a longer duration of post-saccadic target presentation to reach the same amount of adaptation as reactive saccades. Finally, the visual mask interfered with the production of corrective saccades only during the voluntary saccades adaptation task. These last observations suggest that post-saccadic perception depends on the previously performed action and that the differences between saccade categories of motor correction and adaptation occur at an early level of visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W2049383874,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), an intracellular calcium channel, has three isoforms with >65% sequence homology, yet the isoforms differ in their function and regulation by post-translational modifications. We showed previously that InsP3R-1 is functionally modified by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) (Rengifo, J., Gibson, C. J., Winkler, E., Collin, T., and Ehrlich, B. E.

IntroductionIntracellular calcium signaling is vital to a myriad of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, fertilization, secretion, neuronal development and plasticity, light transduction, and muscle contraction (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) 6The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; OGT, O-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; OGA, O-β-N-acetylglucos-aminidase; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; RyR, ryanodine receptor; PC2, polycystin-2. is an intracellular calcium channel. It is associated primarily with the endoplasmic reticulum, but it is also found in the nuclear envelope and Golgi apparatus (3Vermassen E. Parys J.B. Mauger J.P. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The InsP3R is activated when bound with InsP3 produced by stimulation of G protein- or tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors (4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) following activation by their agonists, compounds that range from hormones and growth factors to neurotransmitters and odorants (2Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Three mammalian isoforms of the InsP3R have been identified, InsP3R-1, InsP3R-2, InsP3R-3, with a sequence homology of >65% (5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Expression of the isoforms is cell-specific and regulated in response to extracellular stimulation during development and various disease states (6Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They differ in many functional aspects such as InsP3 affinity, calcium dependence, and regulation by endogenous compounds, accessory proteins, and post-translational modifications (7Bezprozvanny I. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These functional differences and their diverse cell and tissue expression patterns contribute to specialized calcium signals in each cell.O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a post-translational modification discovered >25 years ago (8Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation is characterized by O-linked attachment of a single β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety to serine or threonine residues of proteins. Unlike N-linked glycosylation, this monosaccharide modification is reversible and occurs in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. To date, >1000 proteins have been found to be O-GlcNAcylated (9Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The O-GlcNAc proteome includes proteins involved in metabolism, cell structure, stress response, cell cycle, and transcription/translation and nuclear pore proteins involved in cell signaling (10Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re13PubMed Google Scholar).Over 600 enzymes are known to regulate O-phosphorylation (11Forrest A.R. Ravasi T. Taylor D. Huber T. Hume D.A. Grimmond S. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but only two unique, highly conserved enzymes are directly involved in adding and removing O-GlcNAc from the protein backbone: O-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) adds the sugar, and O-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) removes it. Loss-of-function mutations of the OGT gene are lethal in embryonic stem cells, and intact OGT alleles are required for completion of embryogenesis (12Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation is a major factor in nutrient and stress responses (13Butkinaree C. Park K. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Hanover J.A. Krause M.W. Love D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Altered function of these enzymes has been linked to diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate for O-GlcNAcylation, is one of the end products of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). UDP-GlcNAc is the second most abundant high energy compound within the cell after ATP (10Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re13PubMed Google Scholar, 15McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, 2–5% of total glucose is metabolized through the HBP (10Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re13PubMed Google Scholar), but this rate can be increased by an augmented supply of glucose or glucosamine (16Robinson K.A. Weinstein M.L. Lindenmayer G.E. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. Hirano H. Kawakami H. Med. Mol. Morphol. 2005; 38: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence indicate that O-GlcNAcylation can act in a manner reciprocal to O-phosphorylation (18Yang X. Ongusaha P.P. Miles P.D. Havstad J.C. Zhang F. So W.V. Kudlow J.E. Michell R.H. Olefsky J.M. Field S.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Because O-phosphorylation of the InsP3R is isoform-specific (19Vanderheyden V. Devogelaere B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Bultynck G. Parys J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether O-GlcNAcylation is also isoform-dependent. Reciprocity between these two forms of protein modification on the InsP3R would expand the functional range of regulation of intracellular calcium signaling.We showed previously that InsP3R-1 is modified by O-GlcNAcylation (20Rengifo J. Gibson C.J. Winkler E. Collin T. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13813-13821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that this biochemical modification has a functional effect at the single channel level and in the whole cell. We also found that O-GlcNAcylation inhibits the ability of InsP3R-1 to diffuse through the endoplasmic reticulum (21Gibson C.J. Ehrlich B.E. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The goal of these experiments was to determine whether InsP3R-2 and InsP3R-3 are modified by O-GlcNAc and, if so, the functional effect of the modification. We found that InsP3R-2 is not modified by O-GlcNAc and that there is no effect of hyperglycemic treatment on calcium signaling. In contrast, InsP3R-3 is functionally modified by O-GlcNAc. Surprisingly, the functional effect on InsP3R-3 is opposite that found for InsP3R-1.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have shown that modification of the InsP3R by O-linked addition of N-acetylglucosamine is isoform-specific. We showed previously that the single channel activity of InsP3R-1 is functionally altered by this new type of post-translational modification (20Rengifo J. Gibson C.J. Winkler E. Collin T. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13813-13821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that O-GlcNAcylation of InsP3R-1 decreases the receptor's mobility in the membrane (21Gibson C.J. Ehrlich B.E. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that InsP3R-3 but not InsP3R-2 is O-GlcNAcylated and that modification of InsP3R-3 induces functional changes that are opposite those found for InsP3R-1. Functional data of the InsP3R obtained with planar lipid bilayer experiments and whole cell calcium imaging complemented each other. In bilayer experiments, we showed that O-GlcNAc modification is intrinsic to the receptor; in whole cell calcium imaging, we observed the same functional effect on the InsP3R under more physiological conditions. Although it is possible that other components of the calcium signaling pathway are O-GlcNAc-modified as well (35Dias W.B. Cheung W.D. Wang Z. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21327-21337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the change in the calcium signal, the changes in the single channel properties appear to be sufficient to account for the changes in intact cells. With these results, it becomes evident that O-GlcNAcylation is an important form of modification of the InsP3R that links calcium signaling with glucose and energy metabolism.O-GlcNAcylation of the InsP3R Is Subtype-specificIn addition to the InsP3R, there are other types of intracellular calcium channels, the RyR and polycystin-2 (PC2). We found that the RyR is modified by O-GlcNAc but there was no functional effect (20Rengifo J. Gibson C.J. Winkler E. Collin T. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13813-13821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found PC2 to be modified by O-GlcNAc (supplemental Fig. S2), but no changes in function related to modification of PC2 were observed. Although PC2 is present in AR4-2J cells (supplemental Fig. S2), there was no change in calcium signaling due to sugar treatment (Fig. 5), and sugar treatment of cells had no effect on the mobility of PC2 but did alter InsP3R-1 mobility (21Gibson C.J. Ehrlich B.E. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results suggest that functional consequences of O-GlcNAc modification are specific for the InsP3R family of intracellular calcium channels.For InsP3R-1, the addition of O-GlcNAc decreases the open probability of its single channel currents and decreases agonist-stimulated calcium transients in intact cells (20Rengifo J. Gibson C.J. Winkler E. Collin T. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13813-13821Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc modification of InsP3R-3 was detected, and the functional response was opposite that of O-GlcNAc modification of InsP3R-1 (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, InsP3R-2 from AR4-2J cells was not modified by O-GlcNAcylation, and there were no functional changes after sugar treatment (Fig. 5), even though AR4-2J cells contain both OGA and OGT, the enzymes necessary for O-GlcNAcylation (supplemental Fig. S3B). At similar levels of OGT and OGA, InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-3 could be detected as O-GlcNAcylated proteins (supplemental Fig. S4). It is possible that the lack of O-GlcNAc modification of InsP3R-2 is specific for a splice variant of InsP3R-2 found in the cell line AR4-2J. Support for this suggestion includes the observation that the shortening rate in cardiomyocytes, a tissue that expresses predominantly InsP3R-2 (36Perez P.J. Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23961-23969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is altered after expression of the enzymes for O-GlcNAcylation (22Clark R.J. McDonough P.M.

Also, several splice variants of InsP3R-2 were identified in a number of tissues, including the submandibular gland, thymus, and liver (37Iwai M. Tateishi Y. Hattori M. Mizutani A. Nakamura T.

Ubiquitination was shown to occur on all InsP3R subtypes at approximately the same site and with a similar functional consequence (40Sliter D.A. Kubota K. Kirkpatrick D.S. Alzayady K.J. Gygi S.P.

De Smedt H. Bultynck G. Parys J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is now clear that O-GlcNAc modification is an additional and complementary subtype-specific regulation of the InsP3R.Functional Consequences of O-GlcNAcylationInsP3R-1 and InsP3R-3 were each biochemically modified by O-GlcNAcylation, and channel function was altered in response to elevation of extracellular sugar as demonstrated by single channel activity (Fig. 3) or InsP3-induced calcium release in intact cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, InsP3R-2 was not modified and had no functional changes when sugar levels were modified. Even more interesting, the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on InsP3R-1 was opposite that for InsP3R-3 (compare FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). This finding is reminiscent of the reciprocal response of InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-3 to PKA phosphorylation. When a protein is O-phosphorylated, a negative charge is added to the protein, potentially changing its electrostatic character. This change in electrostatics could result in a conformational change in the protein that would affect intradomain and protein-protein interactions (42Wagner 2nd, L.E. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3577-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast O-GlcNAcylation is the addition of a neutral moiety and is therefore more likely to alter the accessibility of a regulatory site. For example, when many proteins are O-GlcNAcylated, it is not possible to subsequently phosphorylate the protein (43Slawson C. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that the InsP3 dependence of channel opening is altered by O-GlcNAcylation and that these changes could define the threshold at which a cell responds to an InsP3-generating stimulus. This is similar to the effect of adding ATP, which enhances the channel activity but does not open the channel itself (33Hagar R.E. Ehrlich B.E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 44Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or phosphorylation by PKA, which increases the sensitivity of InsP3R-1 to InsP3 without shifting its bell-shaped calcium dependence (46Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Wagner 2nd, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46242-46252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Turnover of InsP3 and nucleotides like ATP is very fast (49Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), whereas O-GlcNAc modification occurs on a slower time scale (50Yu Z. Quamme G.A. McNeill J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2334-H2342PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, O-GlcNAcylation could provide a dynamic, albeit more long-lasting, way to modulate the InsP3R.O-GlcNAcylation of the InsP3R, Nutrient Sensing, and DiabetesSeveral recent reviews have focused on the role of O-GlcNAcylation as a nutrient-sensing mechanism (13Butkinaree C. Park K. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Hanover J.A. Krause M.W. Love D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc as the substrate for OGT through the HBP and subsequent O-GlcNAc cycling through OGT and OGA were termed the hexosamine signaling pathway (14Hanover J.A. Krause M.W. Love D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The enzymes of the hexosamine signaling pathway are highly regulated (supplemental Fig. S3, A, C, and D). GFAT is the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP (51Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1-E8Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and it can be inhibited by high levels of UDP-GlcNAc (52Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3135-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose has to be metabolized to glucosamine 6-phosphate by GFAT to enter the HBP, whereas phosphorylated glucosamine can enter the HBP directly, bypassing this enzymatic step. In our experiments, O-GlcNAcylation and its functional effects as seen through calcium imaging were more pronounced in cells incubated in medium containing glucosamine than in those incubated in glucose-containing medium. This observation is consistent with previous studies of the regulation of the HBP pathway (53Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Daniels M.C. Kansal P. Smith T.M. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. McClain D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Blocking GFAT inhibited the effects of glucose incubation, whereas glucosamine was active because it was able to bypass this enzyme (55Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We also found that expression of GFAT and OGT was down-regulated in cells incubated in glucose or glucosamine (supplemental Fig. S3D). This down-regulation may reflect a mechanism to protect the cell from glucose overload or glucose toxicity, where high concentrations of glucose induce tissue damage as a consequence of the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (15McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).InsP3R-3 is the most abundant subtype in tissues involved in secretion, including bile duct cells (>80%) (56Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pancreatic islets, and β-cell lines (57Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent observation that InsP3R-2/3 double knock-out mice are deficient in saliva and gastric juice secretion (58Futatsugi A. Nakamura T. Yamada M.K. Ebisui E. Nakamura K. Uchida K. Kitaguchi T. Takahashi-Iwanaga H. Noda T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Science. 2005; 309: 2232-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) supports this conclusion. As a sensor of extracellular glucose concentration through the hexosamine signaling pathway, O-GlcNAcylation of the receptor could lower the threshold for initiation of InsP3-induced calcium release and therefore enhance InsP3R-3 activity. This could be an important mechanism for adjusting the secretion of gastric juices to match the supply of nutrients.The InsP3R is involved in insulin secretion (59Yamazaki H. Zawalich K.C. Zawalich W.S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2010; 56: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and pancreatic β-cells express much more OGT than any other known cell type (24Hanover J.A. Lai Z. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that our findings could be relevant for regulation of insulin signaling. Pancreatic β-cells respond to high glucose, the primary stimulus for insulin secretion, by an alteration in the InsP3R pathway. This may occur, at least in part, through InsP3R O-GlcNAcylation. Incubation of rat pancreatic islet cells for short periods in high glucose enhanced transcription and protein expression of InsP3R-3 (60Lee B. Bradford P.G. Laychock S.G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chronic elevation of glucose instead caused a down-regulation of InsP3R-3 mRNA and protein levels accompanied by an up-regulation of InsP3R-2 (61Lee B. Jonas J.C. Weir G.C. Laychock S.G. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression level of InsP3R-3 was decreased in pancreatic acini of diabetic rats compared with normal acini (62Ryu G.R. Sung C.H. Kim M.J. Sung J.H. Lee K.H. Park D.W. Sim S.S. Min D.S. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo A.Y. Pancreas. 2004; 29: e106-e112Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, a response of the β-cell to high glucose would involve two possible regulatory mechanisms depending upon the InsP3R: a change in channel activity through direct post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc and a change in protein expression through the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on the activity of transcription factors and transcription (63Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 64Yang X. Su K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of InsP3R-3 adds an important piece to the puzzle of how to fine-tune β-cell insulin secretion in response to a variety of nutrient stimuli.In addition to its role in nutrient sensing, O-GlcNAc is a global player in a multitude of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including growth, metabolism, cellular stress, circadian rhythms, and immune reactions (14Hanover J.A. Krause M.W. Love D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The InsP3R itself plays a physiological role in many of these processes (6Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), often in an isoform-specific manner. At the same time, glucose has an impact on the specificity of InsP3R isoform expression (60Lee B. Bradford P.G. Laychock S.G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 61Lee B. Jonas J.C. Weir G.C. Laychock S.G.

Physiol. 1999; 276: F54-F61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and on the mobility of InsP3R-1 (21Gibson C.J. Ehrlich B.E. Cell Calcium. 2008; 43: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), all processes that influence subcellular levels of the InsP3R and spatial calcium signaling. We have shown here that glucose also has an isoform-specific functional impact on InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-3 through O-GlcNAc modification. The subtype-specific modulation of the InsP3R by O-GlcNAcylation can be seen as an additional mechanism for fine-tuning InsP3-mediated calcium release and for providing an intersection of the hexosamine signaling pathway and intracellular calcium signaling. IntroductionIntracellular calcium signaling is vital to a myriad of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, fertilization, secretion, neuronal development and plasticity, light transduction, and muscle contraction (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 2Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) 6The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; OGT, O-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; OGA, O-β-N-acetylglucos-aminidase; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; PUGNAc, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; RyR, ryanodine receptor; PC2, polycystin-2. is an intracellular calcium channel. It is associated primarily with the endoplasmic reticulum, but it is also found in the nuclear envelope and Golgi apparatus (3Vermassen E. Parys J.B. Mauger J.P. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The InsP3R is activated when bound with InsP3 produced by stimulation of G protein- or tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors (4Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) following activation by their agonists, compounds that range from hormones and growth factors to neurotransmitters and odorants (2Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Three mammalian isoforms of the InsP3R have been identified, InsP3R-1, InsP3R-2, InsP3R-3, with a sequence homology of >65% (5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Expression of the isoforms is cell-specific and regulated in response to extracellular stimulation during development and various disease states (6Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They differ in many functional aspects such as InsP3 affinity, calcium dependence, a"
https://openalex.org/W2071252519,"Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium that causes whooping cough, secretes an adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) that must be post-translationally palmitoylated in the bacterium cytosol to be active. The toxin targets phagocytes expressing the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor. It delivers a catalytic adenylate cyclase domain into the target cell cytosol producing a rapid increase of intracellular cAMP concentration that suppresses bactericidal functions of the phagocyte. ACT also induces calcium fluxes into target cells. Biochemical, biophysical and cell biology approaches have been applied here to show evidence that ACT and integrin molecules, along with other raft components, are rapidly internalized by the macrophages in a toxin-induced calcium rise-dependent process. The toxin-triggered internalisation events occur through two different routes of entry, chlorpromazine-sensitive receptor-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent internalisation, maybe acting in parallel. ACT locates into raft-like domains, and is internalised, also in cells devoid of receptor. Altogether our results suggest that adenylate cyclase toxin, and maybe other homologous pathogenic toxins from the RTX (Repeats in Toxin) family to which ACT belongs, may be endowed with an intrinsic capacity to, directly and efficiently, insert into raft-like domains, promoting there its multiple activities. One direct consequence of the integrin removal from the cell surface of the macrophages is the hampering of their adhesion ability, a fundamental property in the immune response of the leukocytes that could be instrumental in the pathogenesis of Bordetella pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W2085661643,"HapR has been recognized as a quorum-sensing master regulator in Vibrio cholerae. Because it controls a plethora of disparate cellular events, the absence of a functional HapR affects the physiology of V. cholerae to a great extent. In the current study, we pursued an understanding of an observation of a natural protease-deficient non-O1, non-O139 variant V. cholerae strain V2. Intriguingly, a nonfunctional HapR (henceforth designated as HapR(V2)) harboring a substitution of glycine to aspartate at position 39 of the N-terminal hinge region has been identified. An in vitro gel shift assay clearly suggested the inability of HapR(V2) to interact with various cognate promoters. Reinstatement of glycine at position 39 restores DNA binding ability of HapR(V2) (HapR(V2G)), thereby rescuing the protease-negative phenotype of this strain. The elution profile of HapR(V2) and HapR(V2G) proteins in size-exclusion chromatography and their circular dichroism spectra did not reflect any significant differences to explain the functional discrepancies between the two proteins. To gain insight into the structure-function relationship of these two proteins, we acquired small/wide angle x-ray scattering data from samples of the native and G39D mutant. Although Guinier analysis and indirect Fourier transformation of scattering indicated only a slight difference in the shape parameters, structure reconstruction using dummy amino acids concluded that although HapR adopts a ""Y"" shape similar to its crystal structure, the G39D mutation in hinge drastically altered the DNA binding domains by bringing them in close proximity. This altered spatial orientation of the helix-turn-helix domains in this natural variant provides the first structural evidence on the functional role of the hinge region in quorum sensing-related DNA-binding regulatory proteins of Vibrio spp."
https://openalex.org/W2048875670,"Previous studies have shown that in tasks requiring participants to report the direction of apparent motion, task-irrelevant mono-beeps can “capture” visual motion perception when the beeps occur temporally close to the visual stimuli. However, the contributions of the relative timing of multimodal events and the event structure, modulating uni- and/or crossmodal perceptual grouping, remain unclear. To examine this question and extend the investigation to the tactile modality, the current experiments presented tactile two-tap apparent-motion streams, with an SOA of 400 ms between successive, left-/right-hand middle-finger taps, accompanied by task-irrelevant, non-spatial auditory stimuli. The streams were shown for 90 seconds, and participants' task was to continuously report the perceived (left- or rightward) direction of tactile motion. In Experiment 1, each tactile stimulus was paired with an auditory beep, though odd-numbered taps were paired with an asynchronous beep, with audiotactile SOAs ranging from −75 ms to 75 ms. Perceived direction of tactile motion varied systematically with audiotactile SOA, indicative of a temporal-capture effect. In Experiment 2, two audiotactile SOAs—one short (75 ms), one long (325 ms)—were compared. The long-SOA condition preserved the crossmodal event structure (so the temporal-capture dynamics should have been similar to that in Experiment 1), but both beeps now occurred temporally close to the taps on one side (even-numbered taps). The two SOAs were found to produce opposite modulations of apparent motion, indicative of an influence of crossmodal grouping. In Experiment 3, only odd-numbered, but not even-numbered, taps were paired with auditory beeps. This abolished the temporal-capture effect and, instead, a dominant percept of apparent motion from the audiotactile side to the tactile-only side was observed independently of the SOA variation. These findings suggest that asymmetric crossmodal grouping leads to an attentional modulation of apparent motion, which inhibits crossmodal temporal-capture effects."

In this study, we report that a different type of β-catenin degradation is causally involved in epidermal cell death. We observed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused β-catenin degradation in the epidermal cells through a caspase-dependent mechanism, which results in disruption of cell adhesion. Disruption of cell adhesion increased ROS and activated caspases. Upregulation of the intact β-catenin blocked ROS accumulation and caspase activation. These results indicate that a feed-forward loop consisting of ROS, caspases activation and β-catenin degradation induces epidermal cell death."
