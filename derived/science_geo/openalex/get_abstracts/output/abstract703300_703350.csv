https://openalex.org/W4307412745,"Microbiota-derived metabolites that elicit DNA damage can contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the full spectrum of genotoxic chemicals produced by indigenous gut microbes remains to be defined. We established a pipeline to systematically evaluate the genotoxicity of an extensive collection of gut commensals from inflammatory bowel disease patients. We identified isolates from divergent phylogenies whose metabolites caused DNA damage and discovered a distinctive family of genotoxins—termed the indolimines—produced by the CRC-associated species Morganella morganii. A non–indolimine-producing M. morganii mutant lacked genotoxicity and failed to exacerbate colon tumorigenesis in mice. These studies reveal the existence of a previously unexplored universe of genotoxic small molecules from the microbiome that may affect host biology in homeostasis and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4307412748,"We detected surface waves from two meteorite impacts on Mars. By measuring group velocity dispersion along the impact-lander path, we obtained a direct constraint on crustal structure away from the InSight lander. The crust north of the equatorial dichotomy had a shear wave velocity of approximately 3.2 kilometers per second in the 5- to 30-kilometer depth range, with little depth variation. This implies a higher crustal density than inferred beneath the lander, suggesting either compositional differences or reduced porosity in the volcanic areas traversed by the surface waves. The lower velocities and the crustal layering observed beneath the landing site down to a 10-kilometer depth are not a global feature. Structural variations revealed by surface waves hold implications for models of the formation and thickness of the martian crust."

These are the two largest fresh impact craters discovered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter since operations started 16 years ago. The impacts created two of the largest seismic events (magnitudes greater than 4) recorded by InSight during its 3-year mission. The combination of orbital imagery and seismic ground motion enables the investigation of subsurface and atmospheric energy partitioning of the impact process on a planet with a thin atmosphere and the first direct test of martian deep-interior seismic models with known event distances. The impact at 35°N excavated blocks of water ice, which is the lowest latitude at which ice has been directly observed on Mars."

SPD supplementation overcame the impaired immunotherapy against tumors in aged mice by increasing mitochondrial function and activating CD8+ T cells. Treatment of naïve CD8+ T cells with SPD acutely enhanced fatty acid oxidation. SPD conjugated to beads bound to the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP). In the MTP complex, synthesized and purified from Escherichia coli, SPD bound to the α and β subunits of MTP with strong affinity and allosterically enhanced their enzymatic activities. T cell-specific deletion of the MTP α subunit abolished enhancement of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade immunotherapy by SPD, indicating that MTP is required for SPD-dependent T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W4307410169,"General conditions for organic reactions are important but rare, and efforts to identify them usually consider only narrow regions of chemical space. Discovering more general reaction conditions requires considering vast regions of chemical space derived from a large matrix of substrates crossed with a high-dimensional matrix of reaction conditions, rendering exhaustive experimentation impractical. Here, we report a simple closed-loop workflow that leverages data-guided matrix down-selection, uncertainty-minimizing machine learning, and robotic experimentation to discover general reaction conditions. Application to the challenging and consequential problem of heteroaryl Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling identified conditions that double the average yield relative to a widely used benchmark that was previously developed using traditional approaches. This study provides a practical road map for solving multidimensional chemical optimization problems with large search spaces."
https://openalex.org/W4307410168,"Covalently bonded ceramics exhibit preeminent properties-including hardness, strength, chemical inertness, and resistance against heat and corrosion-yet their wider application is challenging because of their room-temperature brittleness. In contrast to the atoms in metals that can slide along slip planes to accommodate strains, the atoms in covalently bonded ceramics require bond breaking because of the strong and directional characteristics of covalent bonds. This eventually leads to catastrophic failure on loading. We present an approach for designing deformable covalently bonded silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics that feature a dual-phase structure with coherent interfaces. Successive bond switching is realized at the coherent interfaces, which facilitates a stress-induced phase transformation and, eventually, generates plastic deformability."
https://openalex.org/W4307410158,"The Cenozoic diversification of placental mammals is the archetypal adaptive radiation. Yet, discrepancies between molecular divergence estimates and the fossil record fuel ongoing debate around the timing, tempo, and drivers of this radiation. Analysis of a three-dimensional skull dataset for living and extinct placental mammals demonstrates that evolutionary rates peak early and attenuate quickly. This long-term decline in tempo is punctuated by bursts of innovation that decreased in amplitude over the past 66 million years. Social, precocial, aquatic, and herbivorous species evolve fastest, especially whales, elephants, sirenians, and extinct ungulates. Slow rates in rodents and bats indicate dissociation of taxonomic and morphological diversification. Frustratingly, highly similar ancestral shape estimates for placental mammal superorders suggest that their earliest representatives may continue to elude unequivocal identification."
https://openalex.org/W4307412666,"Endogenous retroviruses are abundant components of mammalian genomes descended from ancient germline infections. In several mammals, the envelope proteins encoded by these elements protect against exogenous viruses, but this activity has not been documented with endogenously expressed envelopes in humans. We report that the human genome harbors a large pool of envelope-derived sequences with the potential to restrict retroviral infection. To test this, we characterized an envelope-derived protein, Suppressyn. We found that Suppressyn is expressed in human preimplantation embryos and developing placenta using its ancestral retroviral promoter. Cell culture assays showed that Suppressyn, and its hominoid orthologs, could restrict infection by extant mammalian type D retroviruses. Our data support a generalizable model of retroviral envelope co-option for host immunity and genome defense."
https://openalex.org/W4307412744,"The stereoselective synthesis of complex targets requires the precise orchestration of chemical transformations that simultaneously establish the connectivity and spatial orientation of desired bonds. In this work, we describe a complementary paradigm for the synthesis of chiral molecules and their isomers, which tunes the three-dimensional structure of a molecule at a late stage. Key to the success of this strategy is the development of a mild and highly general photocatalytic method composed of decatungstate polyanion and disulfide cocatalysts, which enable the interconversion of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers that were previously configurationally fixed. We showcase the versatility of this method-and the implementation of stereoediting logic-by the rapid construction of chiral scaffolds that would be challenging to access using existing tools and by the late-stage stereoediting of complex targets."
https://openalex.org/W4307412638,"To synthesize a chirally inverted ribosome with the goal of building mirror-image biology systems requires the preparation of kilobase-long mirror-image ribosomal RNAs that make up the structural and catalytic core and about two-thirds of the molecular mass of the mirror-image ribosome. Here, we chemically synthesized a 100-kilodalton mirror-image T7 RNA polymerase, which enabled efficient and faithful transcription of the full-length mirror-image 5 S , 16 S , and 23 S ribosomal RNAs from enzymatically assembled long mirror-image genes. We further exploited the versatile mirror-image T7 transcription system for practical applications such as biostable mirror-image riboswitch sensor, long-term storage of unprotected kilobase-long l -RNA in water, and l -ribozyme–catalyzed l -RNA polymerization to serve as a model system for basic RNA research."
https://openalex.org/W4307410316,"Profound knowledge about landscape preferences is of high importance to support decision-making, in particular, in the context of emerging socio-economic developments to foster a sustainable spatial development and the maintenance of attractive landscapes. Eye-tracking experiments are increasingly used to examine how respondents observe landscapes, but such studies are very time-consuming and costly. For the first time, this study explored the potential of using eye-tracking simulation software in a mountain landscape by (1) identifying the type of information that can be obtained through eye-tracking simulation and (2) examining how this information contributes to the explanation of landscape preferences. Based on 78 panoramic landscape photographs, representing major landscape types of the Central European Alps, this study collected 19 indicators describing the characteristics of the hotspots that were identified by the Visual Attention Software by 3M (3M-VAS). Indicators included quantitative and spatial information (e.g., number of hotspots, probabilities of initially viewing the hotspots) as well variables indicating natural and artificial features within the hotspots (e.g., clouds, lighting conditions, natural and anthropogenic features). In addition, we estimated 18 variables describing the photo content and calculated 12 landscape metrics to quantify spatial patterns. Our results indicate that on average 3.3 hotspots were identified per photograph, mostly containing single trees and tree trunks, buildings and horizon transitions. Using backward stepwise linear regression models, the hotspot indicators increased the model explanatory power by 24%. Thus, our findings indicate that the analysis of eye-tracking hotspots can support the identification of important elements and areas of a landscape, but it is limited in explaining preferences across different landscape types. Future research should therefore focus on specific landscape characteristics such as complexity, structure or visual appearance of specific elements to increase the depth of information obtained from eye-tracking simulation software."
https://openalex.org/W4307441138,"Objectives Healthcare utilization decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to reduced transmission of infections and healthcare avoidance. Though various investigations have described these changing patterns in children, most have analyzed specific care settings. We compared healthcare utilization, prescriptions, and diagnosis patterns in children across the care continuum during the first year of the pandemic with preceding years. Study design Using national claims data, we compared enrollees under 18 years during the pre-pandemic (January 2016 –mid-March 2020) and pandemic (mid-March 2020 through March 2021) periods. The pandemic was further divided into early (mid-March through mid-June 2020) and middle (mid-June 2020 through March 2021) periods. Utilization was compared using interrupted time series. Results The mean number of pediatric enrollees/month was 2,519,755 in the pre-pandemic and 2,428,912 in the pandemic period. Utilization decreased across all settings in the early pandemic, with the greatest decrease (76.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.6–80.5%) seen for urgent care visits. Only well visits returned to pre-pandemic rates during the mid-pandemic. Hospitalizations decreased by 43% (95% CI 37.4–48.1) during the early pandemic and were still 26.6% (17.7–34.6) lower mid-pandemic. However, hospitalizations in non-psychiatric facilities for various mental health disorders increased substantially mid-pandemic. Conclusion Healthcare utilization in children dropped substantially during the first year of the pandemic, with a shift away from infectious diseases and a spike in mental health hospitalizations. These findings are important to characterize as we monitor the health of children, can be used to inform healthcare strategies during subsequent COVID-19 surges and/or future pandemics, and may help identify training gaps for pediatric trainees. Subsequent investigations should examine how changes in healthcare utilization impacted the incidence and outcomes of specific diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4307441275,"Background and objective Annona muricata L. peel has been recognized for many ethnobotanical uses, including diabetes management. However, limited detailed scientific information about its mechanism of antidiabetic activity exists. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-diabetic properties of an aqueous extract of A . muricata peel (AEAMP) and its mechanism of action on alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Methods In vitro antidiabetic assays, such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase were analyzed on AEAMP. Alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg b.w) was used to induce diabetes in the rats. 150 mg/kg b.w positive control group doses of 6.67, 13.53, and 27.06 mg/kg were administered to 3 groups for twenty-one days. The positive control group was administered 30 mg/kg of metformin. The negative and normal control groups were administered distilled water. The fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant markers, carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, and liver glycogen were analyzed as well as PI3K/AKT and apoptotic markers PCNA and Bcl2 by RT-PCR. Results AEAMP inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes more effectively than acarbose. AEAMP reduced FBG levels, HOMA-IR, G6P, F-1,6-BP, MDA, TG, TC, AI, CRI, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB in diabetic rats. Furthermore, in diabetic rats, AEAMP improved serum insulin levels, HOMA-β, hexokinase, CAT, GST, and HDL-c. Liver PI3K, liver PCNA and pancreas PCNA were not significantly different in untreated diabetic rats when compared to normal rats suggesting alloxan induction of diabetes did not downregulate the mRNA expression of these genes. AEAMP significantly up-regulated expression of AKT and Bcl2 in the liver and pancreatic tissue. It is interesting that luteolin and resorcinol were among the constituents of AEAMP. Conclusions AEAMP can improve β-cell dysfunction by upregulating liver AKT and pancreatic PI3K and AKT genes, inhibiting carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes and preventing apoptosis by upregulating liver and pancreatic Bcl2. However, the potential limitation of this study is the unavailability of equipment and techniques for collecting more data for the study."
https://openalex.org/W4307410114,"With validation studies conducted all over the world, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) has become a robust and widely used instrument for assessing the appraisal of stress. The present study was aimed at validation and testing for psychometric properties of the PSS-10 on the Bangladeshi population. Three hundred and fifteen adult (aged 18-64 years) from eight divisional districts of Bangladesh participated in this study. A good fit of the two-factor structure of the scale was indicated by multiple indices (χ2/df, root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, and standardized root mean square residual) on confirmatory factor analysis. The full scale demonstrated internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity. The two factors also demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties. The psychometric properties of the Bengali PSS-10 demonstrated in this study suggest the PSS-10 as a valid and reliable instrument for use in Bangladesh and among Bengali-speaking populations."
https://openalex.org/W4307441202,"Depressive disorders are the leading contributor to medical disability, yet only 22% of depressed patients receive adequate treatment in a given year. Response to treatment varies widely among individuals with depression, and poor response to one treatment does not signal poor response to others. In fact, half of patients who do not recover from a first-line psychotherapy will recover from a second option. Attempts to personalize psychotherapy to patient characteristics have produced better outcomes than usual care, but research on personalized psychotherapy is still in its infancy. The present study explores a new method for personalizing psychotherapy for depression through simulation modeling. In this study, we developed a system dynamics simulation model of depression based on one of the major mechanisms of depression in the literature and investigated the trend of depressive symptoms under different conditions and treatments. Our simulation outputs show the importance of individualized services with appropriate timing, and reveal a new method for personalizing psychotherapy to heterogeneous individuals. Future research is needed to expand the model to include additional mechanisms of depression."
https://openalex.org/W4307441206,"The magnitude of the cost of chronic pain has been a matter of concern in many countries worldwide. The high prevalence, the cost it implies for the health system, productivity, and absenteeism need to be addressed urgently. Studies have begun describing this problem in Chile, but there is still a debt in highlighting its importance and urgency on contributing to chronic pain financial coverage. This study objective is to estimate the expected cost of chronic pain and its related musculoskeletal diseases in the Chilean adult population. We conducted a mathematical decision model exercise, Markov Model, to estimate costs and consequences. Patients were classified into severe, moderate, and mild pain groups, restricted to five diseases: knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, lower back pain, shoulder pain, and fibromyalgia. Data analysis considered a set of transition probabilities to estimate the total cost, sick leave payment, and productivity losses. Results show that the total annual cost for chronic pain in Chile is USD 943,413,490, corresponding an 80% to the five diseases studied. The highest costs are related to therapeutic management, followed by productivity losses and sick leave days. Low back pain and fibromyalgia are both the costlier chronic pain-related musculoskeletal diseases. We can conclude that the magnitude of the cost in our country’s approach to chronic pain is related to increased productivity losses and sick leave payments. Incorporating actions to ensure access and financial coverage and new care strategies that reorganize care delivery to more integrated and comprehensive care could potentially impact costs in both patients and the health system. Finally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will probably deepen even more this problem."

To better understand the threat of domestic dogs to wildlife and people and add to the growing literature on free-roaming dog ecology, a study was conducted to estimate the dog population in Tulúm, México. A modified mark-recapture technique and program MARK were used to obtain dog population estimates along six different transects dividing the city. Population estimates ranged from 19.75 dogs in one transect to 101.841 dogs in another, with 150 total dogs identified throughout the study and an estimated minimum population density of 48.57 dogs/km2. Fecal samples were also opportunistically collected for parasite identification through fecal flotation analysis using the McMaster technique. Out of 25 samples collected, 19 tested positive for gastrointestinal parasites with the most common species found being Ancylostoma caninum, followed by Toxocara canis, Dipylidium caninum, and Cystoisospora spp. Parasite loads ranged from 50 to 10,700 ova per gram of feces. The large population of free-roaming dogs and the prevalence of three zoonotic parasites highlight the importance of understanding free-roaming dog ecology and educating the public on the health risks free-roaming dogs pose. Los perros callejeros (Canis lupus familiaris) representan un gran riesgo para la conservación de animales y la salud pública mundialmente. Para comprender mejor la amenaza que significan los perros domésticos para la fauna silvestre y los humanos y aportar a la creciente bibliografía sobre la ecología de los perros callejeros, se realizó una investigación para estimar la población de los perros en Tulúm, México. Se utilizó una técnica modificada de marcado y recaptura junto con el programa MARK para estimar la población canina en seis transectos de la ciudad. Los estimados varían desde 19.75 perros en un transecto hasta 101,841 en otro, con un total de 150 perros identificados en el transcurso de la investigación y una densidad mínima estimada de 48,57 perros/km2. Además, se hizo una recolección oportunista de muestras de heces para la identificación de parásitos por medio del análisis de flotacíon fecal, con el método McMaster. De las 25 muestras recolectadas, 19 resultaron positivas para parásitos gastrointestinales, de las cuales las especies más comunes fueron Ancylostomoa caninum, seguida por Toxocara canis, Dipylidium caninum, y Cystoisospora spp. Las cargas parasitarias variaron desde 50 hasta 10.700 óvulos por gramo de heces. La alta población de perros callejeros y la prevalencia de tres enfermedades zoonóticas resaltan la importancia de entender la ecología de los perros callejeros y educar al público sobre los riesgos que significan los perros callejeros para la salud."

Using a sample of Chinese city commercial banks, we find that increasing of ownership stake of the largest private shareholders leads banks to lend more to their industries. Interestingly, the largest state-owned shareholders do not have this effect. More importantly, we confirmed the channel of the information advantage by analyzing the bank’s industry NPL ratio and the listed company’s maximum loan amount in the bank. Of course, the effect of the largest private shareholders is achieved by intervening in board decisions. In addition, the ownership structure can influence this effect."

There is paucity of information on the role of religious leaders in the multi-sectoral fight against HIV/AIDS. We examined the role of religious leaders in the use of HIV prevention strategies among young people.A cross sectional study was conducted between March and April 2021 among 422 randomly selected young people in Lira district, Uganda. An interviewer administered a questionnaire to the young people in order to collect quantitative data. A total 20 key informants were purposively sampled and interviews were conducted with religious leaders using a key informant's interview guide. Data was collected on social demographics, HIV prevention messages, and awareness about HIV prevention strategies. Data was analyzed using Stata version 15 using proportions, means, percentages, frequencies, and logistic regression analysis at a 95% level of significance. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic content analysis and the major themes were generated from the participants' responses.About 57.1% (241/422) of the respondents were females. The prevalence of use of HIV prevention strategies among young people was 69.4%. Factors significantly associated with the use of HIV prevention included completing the primary level (aOR 4.95, p< 0.05), completing at least A level (aOR 8.85, p < <0.05), Awareness of HIV prevention strategies advocated for by religious leaders (aOR 0.02, p<0.001), religious leaders provided targeted HIV prevention messages (aOR 2.53, p<0.01), Advocacy for abstinence outside marriage and fidelity in marriage (aOR 35.6, p<0.01), Religious leaders preaching about HIV prevention (aOR 4.88, p<0.001). Qualitative data indicated that a section of religious leaders recommended abstinence/faithfulness. Condom use was the most discouraged HIV prevention strategy. However, most religious leaders agree with the fact that they have a role to play in HIV prevention, which includes sensitization, teaching and organizing sermons about HIV prevention.The use of HIV prevention strategies advocated for by religious leaders among young people was nearly 70%. This finding indicates that religious leaders have a role to play in HIV/AIDS prevention among young people in the Lira district. This calls for the involvement of religious leaders in HIV prevention programs tailored to prevent new infections of HIV among young people."
https://openalex.org/W4307441278,"Community-based Health Insurance (CBHI) is a voluntary prepayment mechanism that guarantees the provision of basic healthcare services without financial barriers to underserved segments of the population in developing countries. The Government of Ethiopia launched the CBHI program to protect the community from high out-of-pocket health expenditure and improve health service utilization a decade ago. However, to improve the quality of healthcare services delivery in health facilities and cover the changing costs of healthcare, the government should revise the contribution of the CBHI scheme. Therefore, we determined the willingness to pay for a CBHI scheme and associated factors among rural households of Lemu and Bilbilo district, South Central Ethiopia.We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study design to assess willingness to pay for the CBHI scheme and its associated factors among households in Lemu and Bilbilo districts, South Central Ethiopia. We used a double bounded contingent valuation method to elicit households' willingness to pay for the CBHI scheme. Data were coded, cleaned, entered into Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 25, and exported to STATA 16 for analysis. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the presence of statistically significant associations between the willingness to pay for the CBHI scheme and independent variables at a p-value <0.05 and Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) values with 95% CI. Finally, we checked the fitness of the model using Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness-of-fit test.Of the 476 study participants, 82.9% (95% CI: 79.2%, 86.01%) were willing to pay for the CBHI scheme and only 62% of them can afford the average amount of 358.32ETB ($7.68) per household per annum. Primary education (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.74-5.80), secondary and above education (AOR = 4.13; 95% CI: 1.86-9.18), large family size (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.26-5.97), monthly income of 500-1000ETB (AOR = 3.75; 95% CI: 1.97-7.13) and distance to public health facilities (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.04-4.39 were significantly associated with willingness to pay for the CBHI scheme.In this study, around 83% of respondents were willing to pay for the CBHI and meet the government expectation for 2020. The study also revealed that educational status, family size, monthly income, and distance from the health facilities were significant factors associated with WTP for the CBHI scheme. In addition, we found that a large number of the respondents couldn't afford the average amount of money that the participants were willing to pay for the CBHI scheme. So, the government should consider the economic status of the communities while revising the CBHI scheme premium not to miss those who cannot afford the contribution."

We examined sulfur-containing metabolites as determinants of fibrin clot lysis time (CLT) and maximum absorbance (Abs max ) in relation to outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Effects of B-vitamin/folate therapy on CLT and Abs max were studied. Plasma samples were collected from 1,952 CAD patients randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to ( i ) folic acid, vitamins B 12 , B 6 ; ( ii ) folic acid, vitamin B 12 ; ( iii ) vitamin B 6 ; ( iv ) placebo for 3.8 years in the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial. Clot lysis time (CLT) and maximum absorbance (Abs max ) were determined using a validated turbidimetric assay. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and mortality were assessed during a 7-year follow-up. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multiple regression. Survival free of events was studied using Kaplan Mayer plots. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Baseline urinary homocysteine (uHcy)-thiolactone and plasma cysteine (Cys) were significantly associated with CLT while plasma total Hcy was significantly associated with Abs max , independently of fibrinogen, triglycerides, vitamin E, glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, age, sex plasma creatinine, CRP, HDL-C, ApoA1, and previous diseases. B-vitamins/folate did not affect CLT and Abs max . Kaplan-Meier analysis showed associations of increased baseline CLT and Abs max with worse outcomes. In Cox regression analysis, baseline CLT and Abs max (&gt;cutoff) predicted AMI (CLT: HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.28; P = 0.013. Abs max : HR 3.22, CI 1.19–8.69; P = 0.021) and mortality (CLT: HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.40–4.63; P = 0.002. Abs max : 2.39, 95% CI 1.17–4.92; P = 0.017). After adjustments for other prognostic biomarkers these associations remained significant. Cys and uHcy-thiolactone, but not tHcy, were significant predictors of AMI in Cox regression models that included CLT. Conclusions uHcy-thiolactone and plasma Cys are novel determinants of CLT, an important predictor of adverse CAD outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W4307441517,"Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown cause characterized by a relapsing-remitting behavior. Growing evidence supports the idea that the epithelial barrier plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD as well as in its evolution over time, thus representing a potential target for novel therapeutic options. In the last decade, the introduction of 3D epithelial cultures from ex vivo -expanded intestinal adult stem cells (ASCs) has impacted our ability to study the function of the epithelium in several gastrointestinal disorders, including IBD. Here, we describe in detail a reproducible protocol to generate Matrigel-embedded epithelial organoids from ASCs of non-IBD and IBD donors using small colonic biopsies, including steps for its optimization. A slightly modified version of this protocol is also provided in case surgical samples are used. With this method, epithelial organoids can be expanded over several passages, thereby generating a large quantity of viable cells that can be used in multiple downstream analyses including genetic, transcriptional, proteomic and/or functional studies. In addition, 3D cultures generated using our protocol are suitable for the establishment of 2D cultures, which can model relevant cell-to-cell interactions that occur in IBD mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W4307410119,"Intertidal organisms must tolerate daily fluctuations in environmental parameters, and repeated exposure to co-occurring conditions may result in tolerance to multiple stressors correlating. The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus experiences diurnal variation in dissolved oxygen levels and pH as the opposing processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration lead to coordinated highs during the day and lows at night. While environmental parameters with overlapping spatial gradients frequently result in correlated traits, less attention has been given to exploring temporally correlated stressors. We investigated whether hypoxia tolerance correlates with low pH tolerance by separately testing the hypoxia and low pH stress tolerance separately of 6 genetically differentiated populations of T. californicus. We independently checked for similarities in tolerance for each of the two stressors by latitude, sex, size, and time since collection as predictors. We found that although hypoxia tolerance correlated with latitude, low pH tolerance did not, and no predictor was significant for both stressors. We concluded that temporally coordinated exposure to low pH and low oxygen did not result in populations developing equivalent tolerance for both. Although climate change alters several environmental variables simultaneously, organisms' abilities to tolerate these changes may not be similarly coupled."
https://openalex.org/W4307410157,"How do people grasp the abstract concept of time? It has been argued that abstract concepts, such as future and past, are grounded in sensorimotor experience. When responses to words that refer to the past or the future are either spatially compatible or incompatible with a left-to-right timeline, a space-time congruency effect is observed. In the present study, we investigated whether reading expertise determines the strength of the space-time congruency effect, which would suggest that learning to read and write drives the effect. Using a temporal categorization task, we compared two types of space-time congruency effects, one where spatial incongruency was generated by the location of the stimuli on the screen and one where it was generated by the location of the responses on the keyboard. While the first type of incongruency was visuo-spatial only, the second involved the motor system. Results showed stronger space-time congruency effects for the second type of incongruency (i.e., when the motor system was involved) than for the first type (visuo-spatial). Crucially, reading expertise, as measured by a standardized reading test, predicted the size of the space-time congruency effects. Altogether, these results reinforce the claim that the spatial representation of time is partially mediated by the motor system and partially grounded in spatially-directed movement, such as reading or writing."

Patient-tailored and risk-adapted decision making is critical in AL amyloidosis management. There is limited real-world evidence data from Argentina and Latin America regarding the treatment approaches for AL amyloidosis. This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe the treatment patterns and outcomes in adult patients (&gt;18 years) diagnosed with AL amyloidosis at the Hospital Italiano in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using a 10-yearfollow-up data (June 1, 2010 to May 31, 2019) from the institutional registry of amyloidosis (IRA). The study population had a mean age of 63 years and 54.4% weremale. Heart and kidney were the most frequently affected organs. Of the 90 eligible patients included in the study, 70underwent treatment. Bortezomib-based regimen was the preferred first-line treatment (75.7% patients). Overall,54.4% of the patients presented a deep response (complete or very good partial response). Median overall survival (OS) was 5years, the 1-year OS and progression free survival rates were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68–87) and 80% (95%CI 68–87)), respectively. This study provides vital real-world evidence for the long-term treatment patterns and survival in a large cohort of AL amyloidosis patients in Argentina."

Latinx with SCD (Lx-SCD) were statistically significantly younger than non-Latinx (NLx-SCD) counterparts. Within both groups, females predominated, with 70% being insured by Medicaid. Mean Emergency Department encounters were statistically significantly lower among Lx-SCD adults.Lx-SCD differ in age, genotype, and Emergency Department utilization, when compared to NLx-SCD counterparts in California. Latinx are now the largest racial and/or ethnic group in the US, and their presence in SCD population is expected to grow. Therefore, their specific demographic, genotypic, and health care utilization characteristics merit attention to inform policies and programs that will improve their health."
https://openalex.org/W4307410313,"The quality of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) markedly varies among surgeons and may have a considerable impact on treatment outcomes. The importance of a surgical checklist for TURBT has been suggested in order to standardize the procedure and improve surgical and oncological outcomes. In the present study, we verified the usefulness of a checklist for managing patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).This retrospective study included 201 NMIBC patients diagnosed with Ta, T1, or Tis between October 2011 and February 2021. After September 2016, TURBT was performed with a checklist. We analyzed the intravesical recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate and the presence or absence of the detrusor muscle in resected specimens before and after the introduction of the checklist. Survival rates were compared using the Log-rank test. A multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to verify risk factors for intravesical recurrence.Ninety-nine patients who underwent TURBT with the checklist (checklist group) were compared with 102 patients who underwent TURBT without the checklist (non-checklist group). When the analysis was narrowed down to 9 critical items, we observed a mean number of 9 documented items per operative report (98.0% completion) after implementation of the checklist. Two-year intravesical RFS rates in the checklist and non-checklist groups were 76.7 and 69.5%, respectively (p = 0.1059). The Cox proportional multivariate analysis showed that the rate of intravesical recurrence was slightly lower in the checklist group (hazard ratio 0.7376, 95% CI 0.4064-1.3388, P = 0.3170).The introduction of a checklist is recommended for the standardization of TURBT and increasing the quality of operative reporting, and it may also improve oncological outcomes."

Non-medical professionals were 1.28 to 5.25 times more likely to approve assisted suicide than physicians (p<0.001). 70.7% of respondents indicated that each professional should have the choice of whether to assist in suicide.This multiprofessional survey sheds light on hospital staff perceptions of assisted suicide happening within hospital walls, which may inform the development of rules considering their wishes but also their reluctances. Further research using a mixed-methods approach could help reach an in-depth understanding of staff's attitudes and considerations towards assisted suicide practices."

We designed the present study to study the effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19 in prevention of breakthrough infections and severe symptomatic cases among health care workers in a real-life scenario in Mumbai, India. Furthermore, we also wanted to study the factors associated with this effectiveness.This is cohort analysis of secondary data of 2762 individuals working in a tertiary health care setting in Mumbai, India (16 January 2021 to 16 October 2021). Vaccination records of all groups of health care staff (including the date of vaccination, type of vaccine taken, and date of positivity for COVID-19) were maintained at the hospital. The staff were tested for COVID-19 at least once a week and when symptomatic. The observation time for everyone was divided into unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (14 days after the first dose); and fully vaccinated (14 days after the second dose). If the individual was found to be positive, the day of positivity was considered the 'day of the event' for that individual. We combined unvaccinated/partially vaccinated into one group and completely vaccinated in the other group. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) was assessed as (1-HR)*100.The mean age (SD) of the study participants was 32.3 (8.3) years; majority of these individuals had taken Covishield TM (99.0%) and only 0.9% (n = 27) had taken Covaxin ®. The incidence rate in the overall population was 0.067/100 person-days (PD). The incidence rate was significantly higher in the unvaccinated/partially vaccinated group compared with the fully vaccinated group (0.0989 / 100 PD vs 0.0403/100 PD; p < 0.001). The adjusted HR (aHR) in the fully vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated/partially vaccinated group in the complete cohort was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.39). Thus, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) for full vaccination was 70% (95% CI: 61%, 77%). It remained the same in the Covishield TM only cohort. The VE in completely vaccinated and with a history of previous infection was 88% (95% CI: 80%, 93%). Only 11 health care workers required hospitalization over the entire observation period; the incidence rate in our cohort was 0.0016 / 100 PD. None of the HCWs reported any severe adverse events after vaccination.In this real-world scenario, we did find that complete vaccination reduced the rate of infection, particularly severe infection in health care personnel even during the severe delta wave in the country. Even among those infected, the hospitalisation rates were very low, and none died. We did not record any major side effects of vaccination in these personnel. Previous infection with COVID-19 and complete vaccination had a significantly higher effectiveness in prevention of infection."
https://openalex.org/W4307441280,"Introduction The teaching and learning experience of allied health and healthcare science students has altered because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Limited research has explored the experience on the future healthcare workforce using participatory research design. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of a global pandemic on the clinical and academic experiences of healthcare student using a co-production approach with student peer researchers. Methods A participatory research approach adopting online focus groups facilitated by students trained as peer researchers was adopted. First, second and final year students from occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, healthcare science, diagnostic radiography and imaging, radiotherapy and oncology, and speech and language therapy were recruited to six focus groups. Data generated through focus groups were analysed thematically using the DEPICT model to support a partnership approach. Results Twenty-three participants took part in six focus groups. The themes identified were: rapid changes to learning; living alongside Covid-19 and psychological impact. Students preferred blended learning approaches when available, as reduced peer interaction, studying and sleeping in the same space, and technology fatigue decreased motivation. Conclusion Due to rapid changes in learning and the stress, anxiety and isolation created by the pandemic, managing study, personal life and placement resulted in a gap in confidence in clinical skills development for students. Students took their professional identity seriously, engaged in behaviours to reduce transmission of Covid-19 and employed a range of coping strategies to protect wellbeing. A challenge with the move to online delivery was the absence of informal peer learning and students indicated that moving forward they would value a hybrid approach to delivery. Higher Education should capitalise on innovative learning experiences developed during the pandemic however it is important to research the impact this has on student skill acquisition and learning experience."
https://openalex.org/W4307441290,"Prion diseases are a group of rare, transmissible, and invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. The cause of these diseases is misfolding of the prion protein into pathological isoforms called prions. Of all human prion diseases, 10-15% of cases are genetic and the E200K mutation, which causes familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), is the most prevalent. For both sporadic and genetic disease, it remains uncertain as to how initial protein misfolding is triggered. Prior studies have linked protein misfolding with oxidative stress insults, deregulated interactions with cellular cofactors, and viral infections. Our previous work developed a cerebral organoid (CO) model using human induced pluripotent stem cells containing the E200K mutation. COs are three-dimensional human neural tissues that permit the study of host genetics and environmental factors that contribute to disease onset. Isogenically matched COs with and without the E200K mutation were used to investigate the propensity of E200K PrP to misfold following cellular insults associated with oxidative stress. Since viral infections have also been associated with oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases, we additionally investigated the influence of Herpes Simplex Type-1 virus (HSV1), a neurotropic virus that establishes life-long latent infection in its host, on E200K PrP misfolding. While COs proved to be highly infectable with HSV1, neither acute nor latent infection, or direct oxidative stress insult, resulted in evidence of E200K prion misfolding. We conclude that misfolding into seeding-active PrP species is not readily induced by oxidative stress or HSV1 in our organoid system."
https://openalex.org/W4307441376,"Transitioning from traditional in-person classroom formats to online instructional delivery methods and online student assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant challenge to effective teaching, learning, and evaluation. Although there is a growing literature assessing the relative efficacy of different online teaching techniques, previous literature has not analyzed, from the student perspective, what methods are preferred for evaluating performance in experiential learning courses. How students perceive assessment methods is critical because it can affect their learning experience and academic achievements. To better understand student preferences for assessment methods, the best-worst scaling approach was used in two online surveys of 218 undergraduate students enrolled in experiential learning-based programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of student responses indicates students' highest levels of support for assessments that emphasize the development of critical thinking skills and professional skills, such as case studies. Most students would prefer assessments that are driving (develop different skills such as creative thinking) and realistic (develop skills transferable to the real world), while only a few (< 1%) prefer assessments that are fast (involve little time), frequent, safe (has preventive measures to eliminate cheating), or strategic (high probability of getting good grades)."
https://openalex.org/W4307441380,"Anthropogenic noise is a recent addition to the list of human-made threats to the environment, with potential and established negative impacts on a wide range of animals. Despite their economic and ecological significance, few studies have considered the impact of anthropogenic noise on crustaceans, though past studies have shown that it can cause significant effects to crustacean physiology, anatomy, and behaviour. Mating behaviour in crustaceans could potentially be severely affected by anthropogenic noise, given that noise has been demonstrated to impact some crustacean’s ability to detect and respond to chemical, visual, and acoustic cues, all of which are vital in courtship rituals. To explore if noise has an impact on crustacean mating, we tested the responses of male green shore crabs ( Carcinus maenas ) from the southwest UK coast by exposing them to ship noise recordings while simultaneously presenting them with a dummy-female soaked in the female-sex pheromone uridine diphosphate (UDP) in an experimental tank setup (recording treatment: n = 15, control treatment: n = 15). We found a significant, negative effect of noise on the occurrence of mating behaviour compared to no noise conditions, though no significant effect of noise on the time it took for a crab to respond to the pheromone. Such effects suggest reproductive impairment due to anthropogenic noise, which could potentially contribute to decreased crustacean populations and subsequent ecological and economic repercussions. Given the findings of our preliminary study, more research should be undertaken that includes larger sample sizes, double blind setups, and controlled laboratory trials in order to more fully extrapolate the potential impact of noise on mating in the natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W4307441535,"Background Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. The significance of Lck inhibition in lung fibrosis has not yet been fully elucidated, even though lung fibrosis is commonly preceded by inflammation caused by infiltration of T-cells expressing Lck. In this study, we examined the effect of Lck inhibition in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis. We also evaluated the effect of Lck inhibition on the expression of TGF-β1, an inhibitory cytokine regulating the immune function, in regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Methods Lung fibrosis was induced in mice by intratracheal administration of bleomycin. A-770041, a Lck-specific inhibitor, was administrated daily by gavage. Tregs were isolated from the lung using a CD4 + CD25 + Regulatory T-cell Isolation Kit. The expression of Tgfb on Tregs was examined by flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The concentration of TGF-β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and cell culture supernatant from Tregs was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results A-770041 inhibited the phosphorylation of Lck in murine lymphocytes to the same degree as nintedanib. A-770041 attenuated lung fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice and reduced the concentration of TGF-β in BALF. A flow-cytometry analysis showed that A-770041 reduced the number of Tregs producing TGF-β1 in the lung. In isolated Tregs, Lck inhibition by A-770041 decreased the Tgfb mRNA level as well as the concentration of TGF-β in the supernatant. Conclusions These results suggest that Lck inhibition attenuated lung fibrosis by suppressing TGF-β production in Tregs and support the role of Tregs in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4307410118,"The study of gaze perception has largely focused on a single cue (the eyes) in two-dimensional settings. While this literature suggests that 2D gaze perception is shaped by atypical development, as in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), gaze perception is in reality contextually-sensitive, perceived as an emergent feature conveyed by the rotation of the pupils and head. We examined gaze perception in this integrative context, across development, among children and adolescents developing typically or with ASD with both 2D and 3D stimuli. We found that both groups utilized head and pupil rotations to judge gaze on a 2D face. But when evaluating the gaze of a physically-present, 3D robot, the same ASD observers used eye cues less than their typically-developing peers. This demonstrates that emergent gaze perception is a slowly developing process that is surprisingly intact, albeit weakened in ASD, and illustrates how new technology can bridge visual and clinical science."

Although aging causes changes in coronary arteries, the age-related imaging features on CAG and their prognostic relevance have not been fully characterized. We hypothesized that a deep neural network (DNN) model could be trained to estimate vascular age only using CAG and that this age prediction from CAG could show significant associations with clinical outcomes of ACS. A DNN was trained to estimate vascular age using ten separate frames from each of 5,923 CAG videos from 572 patients. It was then tested on 1,437 CAG videos from 144 patients. Subsequently, 298 ACS patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were analysed to assess whether predicted age by DNN was associated with clinical outcomes. Age predicted as a continuous variable showed mean absolute error of 4 years with R squared of 0.72 ( r = 0.856). Among the ACS patients stratified by predicted age from CAG images before PCI, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were more frequently observed in the older vascular age group than in the younger vascular age group (p = 0.017). Furthermore, after controlling for actual age, gender, peak creatine kinase, and history of heart failure, the older vascular age group independently suffered from more MACE (hazard ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.29, p = 0.032). The vascular age estimated based on CAG imaging by DNN showed high predictive value. The age predicted from CAG images by DNN could have significant associations with clinical outcomes in patients with ACS."
https://openalex.org/W4307410322,"Solutions with high pH values are sometimes thought to contain net negative charge because of an excess of OH- groups, while solutions with low pH values are thought opposite. To follow up on these speculations, we used a simple electrochemical cell to study three types of solution: electrolyzed waters with differing pH values; acids and bases with different pH values; and various salt solutions. When electrolyzed waters of various pH values were tested against water of pH 7, we found that acidic waters were indeed positively charged, while basic waters were negatively charged. We found much the same when standard acids and bases were compared to reference solutions: acidic solutions were positively charged while basic solutions were negatively charged. Various salts, including NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4, and K2SO4, were also tested against DI water (containing trace amounts of NaCl to lend conductivity). Surprisingly, all salts were found to be negatively charged, more so as their concentrations increased. This collection of results supports the hypothesis that at least some aqueous solutions may contain net charge."
https://openalex.org/W4307410440,"Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) are important for not just sure enough control of malaria, but its elimination as well. If these systems are working, they can extensively provide accurate data on reported malaria cases instead of presenting modelled approximations of malaria burden. Queries are raised on both the quality and use of generated malaria data. Some issues of concern include inaccurate reporting of malaria cases as well as treatment plans, wrongly categorizing malaria cases in registers used to collate data and misplacing data or registers for reporting. This study analyses data quality concerning health staff's proficiency, timeliness, availability and data accuracy in the Sissala East Municipal Health Directorate (MHD).A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 15 facilities and 50 health staff members who offered clinical related care for malaria cases in the Sissala East MHD from 24th August 2020 to 17th September 2020. Fifteen health facilities were randomly selected from the 56 health facilities in the municipality that were implementing the malarial control programme, and they were included in the study.On the question of when did staff receive any training on malaria-related health information management in the past six months prior to the survey, as minimal as 13 out of 50(26%) claimed to have been trained, whereas the majority 37 out of 50 (74%) had no training. In terms of proficiency in malaria indicators (MI), the majority (68% - 82%) of the respondents could not demonstrate the correct calculations of the indicators. Nevertheless, the MHD recorded monthly average timeliness of the 5th day [range: 4.7-5.7] within the reporting year. However, the MHD had a worse average performance of 5.4th and 5.7th days in July and September respectively. Furthermore, results indicated that 14 out of 15(93.3%) facilities exceeded the target to accomplish report availability (> = 90%) and data completeness (> = 90%). However, the verification factor (VF) of the overall malaria indicator showed that the MHD neither over-reported nor under-reported actual cases, with the corresponding level of data quality as Good (+/-5%).The Majority of staff had not received any training on malaria-related RHIS. Some staff members did not know the correct definitions of some of MI used in the malaria programme, while the majority of them could not demonstrate the correct calculations of MI. Timeliness of reporting was below the target, nevertheless, copies of data that were submitted were available and completed. There should be training, supervision and monitoring to enhance staff proficiency and improve the quality of MI."

Parent Training, as an evidence-based intervention, seems effective in reducing externalizing/disruptive behaviors, possibly leading to a better prognosis. This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an online parent training model as a complementary treatment for ADHD and ODD. Methods Patients and their families will be screened upon their entry into the Research Center of Impulsivity and Attention (NITIDA) at UFMG—Brazil. Ninety families whose children are male, between 6–12 years old, and have significant externalizing symptoms and whose primary caregiver have complete high school education will be invited to participate. Families will be randomized (1:1) into 03 groups: 1) standard care; 2) standard care + face-to-face parent training; 3) standard care + online parent training. Interventions are analogous, differing only in delivery format. In the face-to-face format, the intervention will be conducted by a specialized therapist and the online format will be carried out through a platform. There will be six sessions/modules, arranged on a weekly basis. Measures of externalizing symptoms, parental and children quality of life, parental stress and parenting style will be collected at baseline and after the intervention.

https://openalex.org/W4307410557,"Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) are highly vulnerable to compassion fatigue (CF), which not only leads to decreased mental and physical health, but also to deterioration in the safety of care delivered. Our study aims to measure compassion satisfaction (CS), CF levels and their predictors among Tunisian HCWs. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among HCWs caring for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients, staff at two university hospitals in Sousse, Tunisia during the 4 th wave of coronavirus through a self-administrated Questionnaire, using the French version of the Professional Quality of Life scale ProQol, version 5. Results A total of 274 professionals were recruited with a mean age of 32.87±8.35 years. HCWs tend to have an overall moderate levels of compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress and burnout with mean scores 35.09±7.08, 29.72±7.62, 28.54±5.44 respectively. Self-reported resilience (β = 0.14, p = 10 −3 ), work engagement (β = 0.39, p = 10 −3 ) and burnout (β = -0.32, p = 10 −3 ) were the predictors of compassion satisfaction in the linear regression analysis (adjusted r 2 = 0.45). Similarly, limited work experience, compassion satisfaction and secondary traumatic sub-scores were the determinants of burnout (β = -0.1, p = 0.04; β = -0.54, p = 10 −3 ; β = 0.35, p = 10 −3 respectively); (adjusted r 2 = 0.48). Regarding STS, female professionals (β = 0.20, p = 10 −3 ), being married (β = 0.19, p = 10 −3 ), the fear of transmitting the infection (β = 0.11, p = 0.03) and burnout (β = 0.39, p = 10 −3 ) were the predictors for the occurrence of secondary traumatic stress (adjusted r 2 = 0.48). Conclusion More resilience promoting interventions and more coping skills programs must be implemented to fulfill HCWs’ psychological well-being needs."
https://openalex.org/W4307410608,"Background The effect of antibiotics on the human microbiome is now well established, but their indirect effect on the related immune response is less clear. The possible association of Herpes zoster, which involves a reactivation of a previous varicella zoster virus infection, with prior antibiotic exposure might indicate a potential link with the immune response. Methods A case-control study was carried out using a clinical database, the UK’s Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A total of 163,754 patients with varicella zoster virus infection and 331,559 age/sex matched controls were identified and their antibiotic exposure over the previous 10 years, and longer when data permitted, was identified. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify the association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent infection in terms of volume and timing. Results The study found an association of antibiotic prescription and subsequent risk of varicella zoster virus infection (adjusted odds ratio of 1.50; 95%CIs: 1.42–1.58). The strongest association was with a first antibiotic over 10 years ago (aOR: 1.92; 95%CIs: 1.88–1.96) which was particularly pronounced in the younger age group of 18 to 50 (aOR 2.77; 95%CIs: 1.95–3.92). Conclusions By finding an association between prior antibiotics and Herpes zoster this study has shown that antibiotics may be involved in the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. That effect, moreover, may be relatively long term. This indirect effect of antibiotics on viruses, possibly mediated through their effect on the microbiome and immune system, merits further study."

This study examined the resistance in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss towards infection with the eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. We used genetically selected rainbow trout, carrying SNPs associated with resistance towards the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, and exposed the fish to eye fluke cercariae. We showed that fish partly resistant to I. multifiliis were more susceptible to eye fluke invasion. The expression of immune relevant genes (encoding innate and adaptive factors) was also affected as these genotypes responded less strongly to a secondary fluke infection. The complexity of genome architecture in disease resistance towards multiple pathogens is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4307410769,"Introduction The increasing incidence of acute appendicitis in sub-Saharan Africa emphasizes the need for accurate and reliable diagnostic tools. However, the variability in the diagnostic performance of computed tomography for suspected acute appendicitis coupled with comparatively higher negative appendectomy rates in this setting highlight a possible concern regarding the diagnostic accuracy. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a computed tomography scan for suspected acute appendicitis at the emergency department in Tanzania. Methods A retrospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted from July to October 2020. All patients above 14 years of age who presented at the emergency department with right iliac fossa abdominal pain of fewer than ten days and underwent computed tomography for suspected acute appendicitis were evaluated, and the Alvarado score was computed. Histological diagnosis and clinical follow-up of 14 days were considered the reference standard. Ethical clearance was sought from the Aga Khan University Ethical review committee. Results 176 patients were included in this study. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 100% (95% CI 91.8–100), 96.9% (95% CI 92.2–99.1), and 96.9% (95% CI 93.1–98.3), respectively. The mean Alvarado score in those without acute appendicitis was 4 (95% CI 3.7–4.3) compared to a mean score of 6.6 (95% CI 6.0–7.2) amongst those with acute appendicitis. The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of computed tomography was 98.4%, and that of the Alvarado score was 84.1%. Conclusions The diagnostic performance of computed tomography in this study is similar to that established elsewhere. However, the Alvarado score is not routinely used for the initial screening of suspected acute appendicitis patients. A threshold of Alvarado score of 4 as a guide to conduct computed tomography for suspected acute appendicitis would have decreased computed tomography use by 50%, and missed 4 cases. Implementation studies that address Alvarado score use should be conducted."

It possesses tremendous genetic architecture to survive desiccation stress by undergoing anhydrobiosis to increase its lifespan-an attribute exploited in the formulation technology. The comparative transcriptome of unstressed and anhydrobiotic H. indica revealed several previously concealed metabolic events crucial for adapting towards the moisture stress. During the induction of anhydrobiosis in the infective juveniles (IJ), 1584 transcripts were upregulated and 340 downregulated. As a strategy towards anhydrobiotic survival, the IJ showed activation of several genes critical to antioxidant defense, detoxification pathways, signal transduction, unfolded protein response and molecular chaperones and ubiquitin-proteasome system. Differential expression of several genes involved in gluconeogenesis - β-oxidation of fatty acids, glyoxylate pathway; glyceroneogenesis; fatty acid biosynthesis; amino-acid metabolism - shikimate pathway, sachharopine pathway, kyneurine pathway, lysine biosynthesis; one-carbon metabolism-polyamine pathway, transsulfuration pathway, folate cycle, methionine cycle, nucleotide biosynthesis; mevalonate pathway; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also observed. We report the role of shikimate pathway, sachharopine pathway and glyceroneogenesis in anhydrobiotes, and seven classes of repeat proteins, specifically in H. indica for the first time.

https://openalex.org/W4307441071,"Cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are associated with a systemic inflammatory reaction that occasionally induces a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated host response to the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In severe inflammation, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and histones are released by inflammatory cells and damaged tissue and act as DAMPs. We sought to characterize the changes in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) levels during CPB. Primary outcomes were renal failure, ventilation time (&gt;18 hr), length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) (&gt;48hr), hospital LOS (&gt;15 days), and death. We looked for associations with blood tests and comparison to standard scores. In a prospective cohort study, we enrolled 71 patients undergoing non-emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. Blood was drawn at baseline, 20 and 40 minutes on CPB, after cross-clamp removal, and 30 minutes after chest closure. cfDNA was measured by our fast fluorescent method. Baseline cfDNA levels [796 (656–1063) ng/ml] increased during surgery, peaked after cross-clamp removal [2403 (1981–3357) ng/ml] and returned to baseline at recovery. The difference in cfDNA from 20 to 40 minutes on CPB (ΔcfDNA 40–20) inversely correlated with peripheral vascular disease (PVD), longer ventilation time, and longer ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of ΔcfDNA 40–20 for long ICU-LOS (&gt;48hr) was with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.738 ( p = 0.022). ROC AUC of ΔcfDNA 40–20 to long Hospital LOS (&gt;15 days) was 0.787 ( p = 0.006). Correction for time on CPB in a multivariate logistic regression model improved ROC-AUC to 0.854 ( p = 0.003) and suggests that ΔcfDNA 40–20 is an independent risk factor. To conclude, of measured parameters, including STS and Euroscore, the predictive power of ΔcfDNA 40–20 was the highest. Thus, measurement of ΔcfDNA 40–20 may enable early monitoring of patients at higher risk. Further studies on the mechanism behind the negative association of ΔcfDNA 40–20 with PVD and outcomes are warranted."

Renal biopsy is the gold standard for determining histological diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy options. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence findings of renal biopsy results in Nepalese children under 18 years old.In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the available data from children who had undergone kidney biopsy between 2016 and the end of 2020 were evaluated. Demographic data, indications of biopsy, histopathologic findings, and direct immunofluorescence findings were collected and presented.The mean age of the patients was 12.14 ± 4.07 years. Male/female ratio was 1:1. The majority of biopsy cases were aged between 11-15 years of age. The most common indication for biopsy in children was nephrotic syndrome (68.25%). Lupus nephritis with 28 cases (22.22%) had the highest frequency in overall renal biopsies. Minimal change disease (MCD) with 22 cases (17.46%) followed by Ig A nephropathy with 16 cases (12.69%) were the most frequent primary glomerulonephritis. Lupus nephritis showed full house positivity, and MCD showed full house negativity in all Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) parameters, whereas immunoglobulin A nephropathy showed 100% positivity in Ig A in DIF.Nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for renal biopsy. The most common primary glomerulonephritis was MCD, while secondary glomerulonephritis was lupus nephritis. Clinical data, light microscopy, and direct DIF played an integral role in the overall final diagnosis."
