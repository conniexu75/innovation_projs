https://openalex.org/W1666193446,"Observations of declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of the explosion are as expected if material ejected by the supernova collided with a companion star, supporting the single degenerate channel model of supernova progenitors. Type Ia supernovae1 are destructive explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs2,3. Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances4,5,6, the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious3. One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion3,7,8. Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star9, and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel."
https://openalex.org/W2131268180,"Although many preferential choices in everyday life require remembering relevant information, the interplay of neural systems mediating decisions and memory has rarely been studied. We addressed this question by combining a task, in which choice options had to be retrieved from memory, with cognitive modeling and fMRI. We found that memory-guided decisions are captured by established process models of choice (sequential sampling models) but constrained by forgetting. People are biased toward remembered options and reject them only if they are very unattractive. Using a Bayesian modeling approach, we determined the posterior probability that options were remembered given the observed choices. This probability correlated with hippocampal activation during encoding. During decision making, the bias toward remembered options was linked to increased connectivity between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Our results provide insights into the dependency of decisions on memory constraints and show that memory-related activation can be inferred from decisions."

https://openalex.org/W1608258137,"Apela (APJ early endogenous ligand, also known as elabela or toddler) is a recently discovered peptide hormone. Based on genetic studies in zebrafish, apela was found to be important for endoderm differentiation and heart development during embryogenesis. Although common phenotypes of apela and APJ-null zebrafish during embryonic development suggested that apela interacts with the APJ receptor, kinetics of apela binding to APJ and intracellular signaling pathways for apela remain unknown. The role of apela in adults is also uncertain. Using a chimeric apela ligand, we showed direct binding of apela to APJ with high affinity (Kd = 0.51 nm) and the ability of apelin, the known peptide ligand for APJ, to compete for apela binding. Apela, similar to apelin, acts through the inhibitory G protein pathway by inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and by inducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In adult rats, apela is expressed exclusively in the kidney, unlike the wide tissue distribution of apelin. In vivo studies demonstrated the ability of apela to regulate fluid homeostasis by increasing diuresis and water intake. Dose-response studies further indicated that apela induces 2- and 5-fold higher maximal responses than apelin in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and diuresis/water intake, respectively. After designing an apela antagonist, we further demonstrated the role of endogenous ligand(s) in regulating APJ-mediated fluid homeostasis. Our results identified apela as a potent peptide hormone capable of regulating fluid homeostasis in adult kidney through coupling to the APJ-mediated Gi signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2110513111,"Using genetic fate-mapping with Cux2-Cre and Cux2-CreERT2 mice we demonstrated that the neocortical ventricular zone (VZ) contains radial glial cells (RGCs) with restricted fate potentials (Franco et al., 2012). Using the same mouse lines, Guo et al. (2013) concluded that the neocortical VZ does not contain lineage-restricted RGCs. We now show that the recombination pattern in Cux2-Cre/CreERT2 mice depends on genetic background and breeding strategies. We provide evidence that Guo et al. likely reached different conclusions because they worked with transgenic sublines with drifted transgene expression patterns. In Cux2-Cre and Cux2-CreERT2 mice that recapitulate the endogenous Cux2 expression pattern, the vast majority of fate-mapped neurons express Satb2 but not Ctip2, confirming that a restricted subset of all neocortical projection neurons belongs to the Cux2 lineage.

https://openalex.org/W1494234216,"Thirty-two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies were studied in order to detect and measure potential in vivo effects of neonicotinoid pesticides used in cornfields (Zea mays spp) on honeybee health. Honeybee colonies were randomly split on four different agricultural cornfield areas located near Quebec City, Canada. Two locations contained cornfields treated with a seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid insecticide while the two others were organic cornfields used as control treatments. Hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of two years. Honeybee viruses (brood queen cell virus BQCV, deformed wing virus DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV) and the brain specific expression of a biomarker of host physiological stress, the Acetylcholinesterase gene AChE, were investigated using RT-qPCR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to detect pesticide residues in adult bees, honey, pollen, and corn flowers collected from the studied hives in each location. In addition, general hive conditions were assessed by monitoring colony weight and brood development. Neonicotinoids were only identified in corn flowers at low concentrations. However, honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid treated cornfields expressed significantly higher pathogen infection than those located in untreated cornfields. AChE levels showed elevated levels among honeybees that collected corn pollen from treated fields. Positive correlations were recorded between pathogens and the treated locations. Our data suggests that neonicotinoids indirectly weaken honeybee health by inducing physiological stress and increasing pathogen loads."
https://openalex.org/W1564843469,"Mesoscopic superpositions of distinguishable coherent states provide an analogue of the 'Schrödinger's cat' thought experiment. For mechanical oscillators these have primarily been realized using coherent wavepackets, for which the distinguishability arises as a result of the spatial separation of the superposed states. Here we demonstrate superpositions composed of squeezed wavepackets, which we generate by applying an internal-state-dependent force to a single trapped ion initialized in a squeezed vacuum state with nine decibel reduction in the quadrature variance. This allows us to characterize the initial squeezed wavepacket by monitoring the onset of spin-motion entanglement, and to verify the evolution of the number states of the oscillator as a function of the duration of the force. In both cases we observe clear differences between displacements aligned with the squeezed and anti-squeezed axes. We observe coherent revivals when inverting the state-dependent force after separating the wavepackets by more than 19 times the ground-state root mean squared extent, which corresponds to 56 times the root mean squared extent of the squeezed wavepacket along the displacement direction. Aside from their fundamental nature, these states may be useful for quantum metrology or quantum information processing with continuous variables."

Specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission. The cervical microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. Interleukin (IL)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively.Four bacterial community state types [CST I (Lactobacillus crispatus dominated), CST III (Lactobacillus iners dominated), CST IV-A (non-Lactobacillus bacteria dominated), and CST IV-B (Gardnerella vaginalis and Sneathia sanguinegens dominated)] were observed in the cervical microbiota of women with PPROM. Cervical fluid IL-6 concentrations differed between CSTs (CST I = 145 pg/mL, CST III = 166 pg/mL, CST IV-A = 420 pg/mL, and CST IV-B = 322 pg/mL; p = 0.004). There were also differences in the rates of MIAC, of both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and of IAI among CSTs. No difference in the rate of histological chorioamnionitis was found among CSTs.The cervical microbiota in PPROM women in this study was characterized by four CSTs. The presence of non-Lactobacillus CSTs was associated with a strong cervical inflammatory response and higher rates of MIAC, both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and IAI representing a PPROM subtype with pronounced inflammation. CST I represents the dominant type of PPROM with a low rate of MIAC, IAI, and the combination of MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis."

These experiments demonstrated that at both the clonal and population levels Fezf2(+) RGCs are multipotent and that at the population level Cux2(+) RGCs are multipotent. Here, we extend our work on the lineages of Fezf2(+) and Cux2(+) RGCs. Clonal analysis of E10.5 neocortical progenitors suggests that most, if not all, Cux2(+) and Fezf2(+) RGCs generate diverse projection neuron subtypes located throughout layers 2-6. These results support our previous conclusion that both Fezf2(+) and Cux2(+) RGCs are multipotent neocortical progenitors. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Gil-Sanz et al.

https://openalex.org/W289010827,"This prospective cohort study describes carriage of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in household members from 49 farrowing pig farms in the Netherlands (2010-2011). Of 171 household members, 4% were persistent MRSA nasal carriers, and the MRSA prevalence on any given sampling moment was 10% (range 7-11%). Working in the stables (of which 98% was MRSA-positive, prevalence ratio (PR) = 2.11 per 10 hours), working with sows (PR=1.97), and living with an MRSA-positive pig farmer (PR=4.63) were significant determinants for MRSA carriage. Significant protective factors were carriage of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (PR=0.50), and wearing a facemask when working in the stables (37% decreased prevalence). All MRSA strains during the study period were known livestock-associated types. The bacteriophage φ3 was not found in household members. Transmission from pigs and the environment appeared to be important determinants; human-to-human transmission could not sufficiently be differentiated. Wearing a facemask when working in the stables and carriage of MSSA are potential interventional targets."
https://openalex.org/W1521706556,"Physiological responses to stress are controlled by expression of a large number of genes, many of which are regulated by microRNAs. Since most banana cultivars are salt-sensitive, improved understanding of genetic regulation of salt induced stress responses in banana can support future crop management and improvement in the face of increasing soil salinity related to irrigation and climate change. In this study we focused on determining miRNA and their targets that respond to NaCl exposure and used transcriptome sequencing of RNA and small RNA from control and NaCl-treated banana roots to assemble a cultivar-specific reference transcriptome and identify orthologous and Musa-specific miRNA responding to salinity. We observed that, banana roots responded to salinity stress with changes in expression for a large number of genes (9.5% of 31,390 expressed unigenes) and reduction in levels of many miRNA, including several novel miRNA and banana-specific miRNA-target pairs. Banana roots expressed a unique set of orthologous and Musa-specific miRNAs of which 59 respond to salt stress in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression patterns of miRNA compared with those of their predicted mRNA targets indicated that a majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs were down-regulated in response to increased salinity, allowing increased expression of targets involved in diverse biological processes including stress signaling, stress defence, transport, cellular homeostasis, metabolism and other stress-related functions. This study may contribute to the understanding of gene regulation and abiotic stress response of roots and the high-throughput sequencing data sets generated may serve as important resources related to salt tolerance traits for functional genomic studies and genetic improvement in banana."
https://openalex.org/W304932665,"The two-dimensional boundary layer flow and heat transfer to Sisko nanofluid over a non-linearly stretching sheet is scrutinized in the concerned study. Our nanofluid model incorporates the influences of the thermophoresis and Brownian motion. The convective boundary conditions are taken into account. Implementation of suitable transformations agreeing with the boundary conditions result in reduction of the governing equations of motion, energy and concentration into non-linear ordinary differential equations. These coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations are solved analytically by using the homotopy analysis method (HAM) and numerically by the shooting technique. The effects of the thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters on the temperature and concentration fields are analyzed and graphically presented. The secured results make it clear that the temperature distribution is an increasing function of the thermophoresis and Brownian motion parameters and concentration distribution increases with the thermophoresis parameter but decreases with the Brownian motion parameter. To see the validity of the present work, we made a comparison with the numerical results as well as previously published work with an outstanding compatibility."

https://openalex.org/W1634717229,"The prion protein (PrP) has been implicated both in prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, where its monomeric cellular isoform (PrP(C)) is recruited into pathogenic self-propagating polymers of misfolded protein, and in Alzheimer disease, where PrP(C) may act as a receptor for synaptotoxic oligomeric forms of amyloid-β (Aβ). There has been considerable interest in identification of compounds that bind to PrP(C), stabilizing its native fold and thereby acting as pharmacological chaperones to block prion propagation and pathogenesis. However, compounds binding PrP(C) could also inhibit the binding of toxic Aβ species and may have a role in treating Alzheimer disease, a highly prevalent dementia for which there are currently no disease-modifying treatments. However, the absence of a unitary, readily measurable, physiological function of PrP makes screening for ligands challenging, and the highly heterogeneous nature of Aβ oligomer preparations makes conventional competition binding assays difficult to interpret. We have therefore developed a high-throughput screen that utilizes site-specifically fluorescently labeled protein to identify compounds that bind to PrP and inhibit both Aβ binding and prion propagation. Following a screen of 1,200 approved drugs, we identified Chicago Sky Blue 6B as the first small molecule PrP ligand capable of inhibiting Aβ binding, demonstrating the feasibility of development of drugs to block this interaction. The interaction of Chicago Sky Blue 6B was characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry, and its ability to inhibit Aβ binding and reduce prion levels was established in cell-based assays."

TAZ regulates these biological functions by up-regulating downstream cellular genes through transactivation of transcription factors such as TEAD and TTF1. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TAZ-induced tumorigenesis, we have recently performed a gene expression profile analysis by overexpressing TAZ in mammary cells. In addition to the TAZ-up-regulated genes that were confirmed in our previous studies, we identified a large number of cellular genes that were down-regulated by TAZ. In this study, we have confirmed these down-regulated genes (including cytokines, chemokines, and p53 gene family members) as bona fide downstream transcriptional targets of TAZ. By using human breast and lung epithelial cells, we have further characterized ΔNp63, a p53 gene family member, and shown that TAZ suppresses ΔNp63 mRNA, protein expression, and promoter activity through interaction with the transcription factor TEAD. We also show that TEAD can inhibit ΔNp63 promoter activity and that TAZ can directly interact with ΔNp63 promoter-containing TEAD binding sites. Finally, we provide functional evidence that down-regulation of ΔNp63 by TAZ may play a role in regulating cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W1892591662,"Huntington disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by functional deficits and loss of striatal neurons, is linked to an expanded and unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT). This DNA sequence translates to a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product, leading to mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregation. The aggregation of mHTT is inhibited in vitro and in vivo by the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin. Recently, a novel complex comprised of a single type of TRiC subunit has been reported to inhibit mHTT aggregation. Specifically, the purified CCT5 homo-oligomer complex, when compared with TRiC, has a similar structure, ATP use, and substrate refolding activity, and, importantly, it also inhibits mHTT aggregation. Using an aggregation suppression assay and cryoelectron tomography coupled with a novel computational classification method, we uncover the interactions between the synthetic CCT5 complex (∼1 MDa) and aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing 46 glutamines (mHTTQ46-Ex1). We find that, in a similar fashion to TRiC, synthetic CCT5 complex caps mHTT fibrils at their tips and encapsulates mHTT oligomers, providing a structural description of the inhibition of mHTTQ46-Ex1 by CCT5 complex and a shared mechanism of mHTT inhibition between TRiC chaperonin and the CCT5 complex: cap and contain. Background: Huntington disease patients show an accumulation of oligomers and fibrillar species of mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Results: Cryoelectron tomography and subvolume averaging visualizes heterogeneous mHTT oligomeric species inside the chaperonin-like CCT5 cavity. Conclusion: The structural basis of mHTT aggregation inhibition by CCT5 is through capping of fibrils and encapsulation of oligomers. Significance: These structural mechanisms inspire the development of new strategies for inhibiting mHTT aggregation."

Integration and decentralization of HIV and TB treatment services are being implemented, but data on outcomes of this strategy are lacking in rural, resource-limited settings. We evaluated TB treatment outcomes in TB/HIV coinfected patients in an integrated and decentralized system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.We retrospectively studied a cohort of HIV/TB coinfected patients initiating treatment for drug-susceptible TB at a district hospital HIV clinic from January 2012-June 2013. Patients were eligible for down-referral to primary health clinics(PHCs) for TB treatment completion if they met specific clinical criteria. Records were reviewed for patients' demographic, baseline clinical and laboratory information, past HIV and TB history, and TB treatment outcomes.Of 657(88.7%) patients, 322(49.0%) were female, 558(84.9%) were new TB cases, and 572(87.1%) had pulmonary TB. After TB treatment initiation, 280(42.6%) were down-referred from the district level HIV clinic to PHCs for treatment completion; 377(57.4%) remained at the district hospital. Retained patients possessed characteristics indicative of more severe disease. In total, 540(82.2%) patients experienced treatment success, 69(10.5%) died, and 46(7.0%) defaulted. Down-referred patients experienced higher treatment success, and lower mortality, but were more likely to default, primarily at the time of transfer to PHC.Decentralization of TB treatment to the primary care level is feasible in rural South Africa. Treatment outcomes are favorable when patients are carefully chosen for down-referral. Higher mortality in retained patients reflects increased baseline disease severity while higher default among down-referred patients reflects failed linkage of care. Better linkage mechanisms are needed including improved identification of potential defaulters, increased patient education, active communication between hospitals and PHCs, and tracing of patients lost to follow up. Decentralized and integrated care is successful for carefully selected TB/HIV coinfected patients and should be expanded."

Distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer is a major challenge in disease management. Associations between SBP1 levels, tumor grade, and disease recurrence following prostatectomy were investigated by duplex immunofluorescence imaging using a tissue microarray containing tissue from 202 prostate cancer patients who experienced biochemical (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy and 202 matched control patients whose cancer did not recur. Samples were matched by age, ethnicity, pathological stage and Gleason grade, and images were quantified using the Vectra multispectral imaging system. Fluorescent labels were targeted for SBP1 and cytokeratins 8/18 to restrict scoring to tumor cells, and cell-by-cell quantification of SBP1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm was performed. Nuclear SBP1 levels and the nuclear to cytoplasm ratio were inversely associated with tumor grade using linear regression analysis. Following classification of samples into quartiles based on the SBP1 levels among controls, tumors in the lowest quartile were more than twice as likely to recur compared to those in any other quartile. Inducible ectopic SBP1 expression reduced the ability of HCT-116 human tumor cells to grow in soft agar, a measure of transformation, without affecting proliferation. Cells expressing SBP1 also demonstrated a robust induction in the phosphorylation of the p53 tumor suppressor at serine 15. These data indicate that loss of SBP1 may play an independent contributing role in prostate cancer progression and its levels might be useful in distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease."

We then ran a clinical trial pilot study in MELAS sibs to assess response of these parameters to single dose and a 6-week steady-state trial of oral L-Arginine.At baseline (no L-Arg), MELAS had lower serum Arg (p = 0.001). On 3(1)P-MRS muscle at rest, MELAS subjects had increased phosphocreatine (PCr) (p = 0.05), decreased ATP (p = 0.018), and decreased intracellular Mg(2+) (p = 0.0002) when compared to matched controls. With L-arginine therapy, the following trends were noted in MELAS siblings on cycle ergometry: (1) increase in mean % maximum work at anaerobic threshold (AT) (2) increase in % maximum heart rate at AT (3) small increase in VO(2peak). On (31)P-MRS the following mean trends were noted: (1) A blunted decrease in pH after exercise (less acidosis) (2) increase in Pi/PCr ratio (ADP) suggesting increased work capacity (3) a faster half time of PCr recovery (marker of mitochondrial activity) following 5 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (4) increase in torque.These results suggest an improvement in aerobic capacity and muscle metabolism in MELAS subjects in response to supplementation with L-Arg.

https://openalex.org/W1894200683,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK)1 is associated with several important pathologic conditions and plays a modulatory role in adaptive immune responses. However, the involvement and functional role of SGK1 in innate immune responses remain entirely unknown. In this study, we establish that SGK1 is a novel and potent negative regulator of TLR-induced inflammation. Pharmacologic inhibition of SGK1 or suppression by small interfering RNA enhances proinflammatory cytokine (TNF, IL-12, and IL-6) production in TLR-engaged monocytes, a result confirmed in Cre-loxP-mediated SGK1-deficient cells. SGK1 inhibition or gene deficiency results in increased phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and NF-κB p65 in LPS-stimulated cells. Enhanced NF-κB p65 DNA binding also occurs upon SGK1 inhibition. The subsequent enhancement of proinflammatory cytokines is dependent on the phosphorylation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), as confirmed by TAK1 gene silencing. In vivo relevance was established in a murine endotoxin model, in which we found that SGK1 inhibition aggravates the severity of multiple organ damage and enhances the inflammatory response by heightening both proinflammatory cytokine levels and neutrophil infiltration.

https://openalex.org/W1893171238,"Dihydropyrimidinase is a member of the cyclic amidohydrolase family, which also includes allantoinase, dihydroorotase, hydantoinase, and imidase. These metalloenzymes possess very similar active sites and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. However, whether the substrates and inhibitors of other cyclic amidohydrolases can inhibit dihydropyrimidinase remains unclear. This study investigated the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids and substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases. Allantoin, dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, orotic acid, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole could slightly inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, and the IC50 values of these compounds were within the millimolar range. The inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids, such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin, was also investigated. Some of these compounds are known as inhibitors of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. Although the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids on dihydropyrimidinase were substrate-dependent, dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC50 values of 48 and 40 μM for the substrates dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin, respectively. The results from the Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor. Results from fluorescence quenching analysis indicated that dihydromyricetin could form a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase with the K(d) value of 22.6 μM. A structural study using PatchDock showed that dihydromyricetin was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, which was consistent with the findings from kinetic and fluorescence studies. This study was the first to demonstrate that naturally occurring product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude). These flavonols, particularly myricetin, may serve as drug leads and dirty drugs (for multiple targets) for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases."
https://openalex.org/W1553065561,"The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR1 gene is a drug-exporting transporter located in the cellular membrane. P-gp induction is regarded as one of the main mechanisms underlying drug-induced resistance. Although there is great interest in the regulation of P-gp expression, little is known about its underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of heat shock protein 90β (Hsp90β) and subsequent stabilization of PXR is a key mechanism in the regulation of MDR1 expression. Furthermore, we show that CK2 is directly activated by rifampin. Upon exposure to rifampin, CK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of Hsp90β at the Ser-225/254 residues. Phosphorylated Hsp90β then interacts with PXR, causing a subsequent increase in its stability, leading to the induction of P-gp expression. In addition, inhibition of CK2 and Hsp90β enhances the down-regulation of PXR and P-gp expression. The results of this study may facilitate the development of new strategies to prevent multidrug resistance and provide a plausible mechanism for acquired drug resistance by CK2-mediated regulation of P-gp expression."
https://openalex.org/W1522965187,"SET7/9 is an enzyme that methylates histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) to maintain euchromatin architecture. Although SET7/9 is enriched in islets and contributes to the transactivation of β cell-specific genes, including Ins1 and Slc2a, SET7/9 has also been reported to bind the p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB in non-β cells and modify its transcriptional activity. Given that inflammation is a central component of β cell dysfunction in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of SET7/9 in proinflammatory cytokine signaling in β cells. To induce inflammation, βTC3 insulinoma cells were treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Cytokine treatment led to increased expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, which was attenuated by the diminution of SET7/9 using RNA interference. Consistent with previous reports, SET7/9 was co-immunoprecipitated with p65 and underwent cytosolic to nuclear translocation in response to cytokines. ChIP analysis demonstrated augmented H3K4 mono- and dimethylation of the proximal Nos2 promoter with cytokine exposure. SET7/9 was found to occupy this same region, whereas SET7/9 knockdown attenuated cytokine-induced histone methylation of the Nos2 gene. To test this relationship further, islets were isolated from SET7/9-deficient and wild-type mice and treated with IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Cytokine-induced Nos2 expression was reduced in the islets from SET7/9 knock-out mice. Together, our findings suggest that SET7/9 contributes to Nos2 transcription and proinflammatory cytokine signaling in the pancreatic β cell through activating histone modifications.

Glucose homeostasis is maintained in response to nutrient intake through finely tuned insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cells that is exquisitely coupled to the demands of insulin-sensitive organs, including muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Impairments in glucose homeostasis result in the development of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus of which there are two main forms. Although the etiologies of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) 3The abbreviations used are: T1DType 1 diabetesT2DType 2 diabetesH3K4histone 3 at lysine 4iNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthaseH3histone 3TBPTATA-binding proteinqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay. and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) are distinct, increasing evidence suggests a primary role for β cell dysfunction arising from inflammation in both disorders. T1D occurs as a result of loss of self-tolerance, activation of innate and adaptive immunity, and immune cell infiltration into islets, all eventually culminating in T cell-mediated destruction of the pancreatic β cell (1Roep B.O.

In contrast, T2D arises from impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity and progressive β cell dysfunction. Recently, T2D-associated metabolic dysfunction has been linked to macrophage infiltration of a variety of metabolic tissues, including the pancreatic islets (3Donath M.Y. Dalmas É. Sauter N.S.

The NOS2 gene is a key downstream target of NF-κB, leading to translation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and the catalysis of l-arginine to produce nitric oxide (NO).

Gene transcription is regulated epigenetically through alterations in patterns of DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications that either promote or restrict the accessibility of components of the transcriptional machinery to gene promoters (14Li B.

SET7/9 is a SET (Su(var)3–9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain-containing enzyme that exhibits methyltransferase activity and promotes open chromatin architecture and target gene expression through methylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) (16Nishioka K.

In addition to its activity as a histone methyltransferase, SET7/9 is also known to methylate lysine residues of non-histone proteins, including TAF10, pRB, p53, and the estrogen and androgen receptors, where SET7/9-mediated methylation has been shown to regulate target protein stability and/or activity (17Kouskouti A.

Previously, we have shown that SET7/9 is enriched in rodent and human islets and methylates H3K4 in a number of β cell-specific genes, including Ins1 and Slc2a2. Furthermore, mice with attenuated islet SET7/9 expression exhibited glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (22Deering T.G. Ogihara T. Trace A.P. Maier B. Mirmira R.G.

Chem. 2015; 290: 9812-9822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, several groups have also shown that SET7/9 contributes to inflammation through interactions with components of the NF-κB signaling cascade. In monocytes, SET7/9 forms a complex with NF-κB and is recruited specifically to the CCL2 and TNFA promoters where it methylates H3K4 (24Li Y. Reddy M.A. Miao F. Shanmugam N. Yee J.K. Hawkins D. Ren B. Natarajan R. Role of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, SET7/9, in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes. Relevance to diabetes and inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26771-26781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, SET7/9 has also been shown to methylate Lys-37 of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and up-regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity (25Ea C.K. Baltimore D. Regulation of NF-κB activity through lysine monomethylation of p65.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18972-18977Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, in human osteosarcoma cells, p65 is methylated at lysine residues 314 and 315, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation and subsequent down-regulation of NF-κB activity (26Yang X.D. Huang B. Li M. Lamb A. Kelleher N.L. Chen L.F. Negative regulation of NF-λB action by Set9-mediated lysine methylation of the RelA subunit.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of SET7/9 on NF-κB activity remain controversial. Moreover, at present, the role of SET7/9 in the pathogenesis of islet inflammation has not been explored. In this report, we investigate the role of SET7/9 in cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression and β cell apoptosis. Our results show that SET7/9 interacts with NF-κB and is recruited to and enhances cytokine-induced H3K4 methylation of the Nos2 promoter. Diminution of SET7/9 attenuates cytokine-induced iNOS expression as well as apoptosis in a murine insulinoma cell. Furthermore, we show that cytokine-induced Nos2 expression was reduced in islets isolated from SET7/9 knock-out mice compared with wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest a novel role for SET7/9 in the regulation of proinflammatory β cell gene expression. Monoclonal antibodies against SET7/9 were obtained from Epitomics (5131-1) and LifeSpan BioSciences (LS-C138726). Polyclonal antibodies against dimethyl-H3 Lys-4 (07-030), monomethyl-H3 Lys-4 (07-436), and iNOS (06-573) were obtained from Millipore.

Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (27Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. A common nuclear signal transduction pathway activated by growth factor and cytokine receptors.Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 μg of total protein, 20 μg of the cytosolic fraction, or 10 μg of the nuclear fraction were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and incubated with antibodies against SET7/9, iNOS, p65, cleaved caspase-3, p53, β-actin, or TBP. Bound primary antibodies were detected with peroxidase-coupled secondary mouse or rabbit antibodies and IRDye®-conjugated secondary mouse or rabbit antibody. Immunoblots were visualized using the Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences), LAS-3000 (Fuji Film) with ECL-PlusTM (Amersham Biosciences), or a SuperSignal West Pico system (Pierce). Approximately 1 × 106 βTC3 cells were treated with the cytokine mixture for 20 h, single cell-suspended using trypsin/EDTA, and washed twice with PBS. Apoptosis analysis was performed using an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit (Merck Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence-labeled cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur HGTM flow cytometer and BD CellQuest Pro software version 6.0 (BD Biosciences). βTC3 cells treated without cytokines were used as a negative control. βTC3 cells treated with 150 μm hydrogen peroxide were used for the gating of Annexin V to detect apoptotic cells. A/G Mag Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was preincubated with anti-SET7/9 antibody or mouse IgG, transferred into 500 μl of RIPA buffer containing 500 μg of total protein, incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Approximately 1 × 107 βTC3 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish for 24 h before transfection. Cells were next transfected with 10 μg of an expression plasmid for FLAG-SET7/9 (16Nishioka K. Chuikov S.

Total protein was obtained using RIPA buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to immunoblotting as described previously. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (28Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C.

Chromatin was next fragmented by sonication using a Q500 Sonicator (QSonica) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-monomethyl-H3 Lys-4 or anti-dimethyl-H3 Lys-4 antibodies or normal rabbit serum. DNA fragments extracted from immunoprecipitated protein and DNA complexes were subjected to quantitative PCR as described. Forward and reverse primers used for PCR are listed in Table 1. Setd7-deficient mice were established and provided by the laboratory of Dr. Danny Reinberg (New York University). Animal studies were performed under protocols approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. Islets were isolated following collagenase digestion of the pancreas as described previously (29Stull N.D. Breite A. McCarthy R. Tersey S.A. Mirmira R.G. Mouse islet of Langerhans isolation using a combination of purified collagenase and neutral protease.J. Vis.

Islets were treated with or without a mixture of cytokines for 4 h and then harvested for mRNA isolation. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's t tests were used for comparisons involving two conditions. Differences between groups were analyzed for significance using one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparisons and a Tukey-Kramer post-test. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. To investigate the role of SET7/9 in inflammatory signaling in the β cell, the gene encoding SET7/9 (Setd7) was first knocked down using RNA interference. Setd7 mRNA levels were reduced by ∼75%, whereas protein levels were reduced by 60% in βTC3 cells treated with an siRNA against Setd7 (si-Set7/9) compared with those treated with an siRNA for a nonspecific target (si-scramble) (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, βTC3 cells were treated with a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines that included 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 5 ng/ml IL-1β, and 100 ng/ml IFN-γ. Consistent with previous reports using rodent islets and rat insulinoma cell lines (30Eizirik D.L. Cagliero E. Björklund A. Welsh N.

Diminution of SET7/9 expression attenuated cytokine-induced Nos2 mRNA expression as well as elevations in iNOS protein levels (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, SET7/9 knockdown had no effect on the NF-κB target genes Tnfa and Sod2. To rule out potential off-target effects of si-Set7/9, we transfected different sequences of siRNA for Setd7 (si-Set7/9B), and results were similar (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we performed SET7/9 depletion in a second mouse β cell line, MIN6 cells, and confirmed that SET7/9 knockdown led to a preferential inhibition of cytokine-induced expression of Nos2 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2SET7/9 knockdown attenuates cytokine-induced Nos2 expression in mouse MIN6 cells.

Treatment with cytokines for 20 h increased apoptotic cells, whereas SET7/9 knockdown significantly attenuated cytokine-induced apoptosis (si-Set7/9, 15.37 ± 1.02% versus si-scramble, 26.87 ± 1.12%) (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, cytokine treatment increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, an effect that was partially reversed by knockdown of SET7/9 (Fig. 3C). Because p53 is a crucial regulator of apoptosis that has been shown to be stabilized by SET7/9-induced lysine methylation (19Chuikov S. Kurash J.K. Wilson J.R. Xiao B. Justin N. Ivanov G.S.

To evaluate whether SET7/9 regulates NF-κB protein stability in β cells, total protein from βTC3 cells was isolated before and after cytokine treatment, and immunoblotting for the p65 subunit of NF-κB was performed. SET7/9 knockdown had no effect on total p65 protein levels in βTC3 cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that SET7/9 does not regulate NF-κB protein stability in β cells. SET7/9 has also been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol in response to various stimuli (33Evans-Molina C. Robbins R.D. Kono T. Tersey S.A. Vestermark G.L. Nunemaker C.S. Garmey J.C.

Here we identified HRP-3 as a new endothelial ligand and characterized its in vitro and in vivo functional roles and molecular signaling. We combined open reading frame phage display with multi-round in vivo binding selection to enrich retinal endothelial ligands, which were systematically identified by next generation DNA sequencing. One of the identified endothelial ligands was HRP-3. HRP-3 expression in the retina and brain was characterized by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation assay showed that HRP-3 stimulated the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HRP-3 induced tube formation of HUVECs in culture. Wound healing assay indicated that HRP-3 promoted endothelial cell migration. HRP-3 was further confirmed for its in vitro angiogenic activity by spheroid sprouting assay. HRP-3 extrinsically activated the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ½ (ERK1/2) pathway in endothelial cells. The angiogenic activity of HRP-3 was independently verified by mouse cornea pocket assay. Furthermore, in vivo Matrigel plug assay corroborated HRP-3 activity to promote new blood vessel formation. These results demonstrated that HRP-3 is a novel angiogenic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1523002040,"EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance has become a major threat to the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Essentially, the resistance mechanism involves modifications of the intracellular signaling pathways. In our work, we separately investigated the EGFR and ErbB-3 heterodimerization, regarded as the origin of intracellular signaling pathways. On one hand, we combined the molecular interaction in EGFR heterodimerization with that between the EGFR tyrosine kinase and its inhibitor. For 168 clinical subjects, we characterized their corresponding EGFR mutations using molecular interactions, with three potential dimerization partners (ErbB-2, IGF-1R and c-Met) of EGFR and two of its small molecule inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). Based on molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis, we modeled these mutant-partner or mutant-inhibitor interactions using binding free energy and its components. As a consequence, the mutant-partner interactions are amplified for mutants L858R and L858R_T790M, compared to the wild type EGFR. Mutant delL747_P753insS represents the largest difference between the mutant-IGF-1R interaction and the mutant-inhibitor interaction, which explains the shorter progression-free survival of an inhibitor to this mutant type. Besides, feature sets including different energy components were constructed, and efficient regression trees were applied to map these features to the progression-free survival of an inhibitor. On the other hand, we comparably examined the interactions between ErbB-3 and its partners (EGFR mutants, IGF-1R, ErbB-2 and c-Met). Compared to others, c-Met shows a remarkably-strong binding with ErbB-3, implying its significant role in regulating ErbB-3 signaling. Moreover, EGFR mutants corresponding to poor clinical outcomes, such as L858R_T790M, possess lower binding affinities with ErbB-3 than c-Met does. This may promote the communication between ErbB-3 and c-Met in these cancer cells. The analysis verified the important contribution of IGF-1R or c-Met in the drug resistance mechanism developed in lung cancer treatments, which may bring many benefits to specialized therapy design and innovative drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1723875714,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism studies in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) have yielded variable results. These studies need to consider the genetic admixture of the studied population. Here we used our previously reported definition of genetic admixture of Mexicans using HLA class I and II DNA blocks to map genetic susceptibility to develop SSc and its complications.We included 159 patients from a cohort of Mexican Mestizo SSc patients. We performed clinical evaluation, obtained SSc-associated antibodies, and determined HLA class I and class II alleles using sequence-based, high-resolution techniques to evaluate the contribution of these genes to SSc susceptibility, their correlation with the clinical and autoantibody profile and the prevalence of Amerindian, Caucasian and African alleles, blocks and haplotypes in this population.Our study revealed that class I block HLA-C*12:03-B*18:01 was important to map susceptibility to diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc, HLA-C*07:01-B*08:01 block to map the susceptibility role of HLA-B*08:01 to develop SSc, and the C*07:02-B*39:05 and C*07:02-B*39:06 blocks to map the protective role of C*07:02 in SSc. We also confirmed previous associations of HLA-DRB1*11:04 and -DRB1*01 to susceptibility to develop SSc. Importantly, we mapped the protective role of DQB1*03:01 using three Amerindian blocks. We also found a significant association for the presence of anti-Topoisomerase I antibody with HLA-DQB1*04:02, present in an Amerindian block (DRB1*08:02-DQB1*04:02), and we found several alleles associated to internal organ damage. The admixture estimations revealed a lower proportion of the Amerindian genetic component among SSc patients.This is the first report of the diversity of HLA class I and II alleles and haplotypes Mexican patients with SSc. Our findings suggest that HLA class I and class II genes contribute to the protection and susceptibility to develop SSc and its different clinical presentations as well as different autoantibody profiles in Mexicans."

https://openalex.org/W1910063935,"Whereas the genetic background of horn growth in cattle has been studied extensively, little is known about the morphological changes in the developing fetal horn bud. In this study we histologically analyzed the development of horn buds of bovine fetuses between ~70 and ~268 days of pregnancy and compared them with biopsies taken from the frontal skin of the same fetuses. In addition we compared the samples from the wild type (horned) fetuses with samples taken from the horn bud region of age-matched genetically hornless (polled) fetuses. In summary, the horn bud with multiple layers of vacuolated keratinocytes is histologically visible early in fetal life already at around day 70 of gestation and can be easily differentiated from the much thinner epidermis of the frontal skin. However, at the gestation day (gd) 212 the epidermis above the horn bud shows a similar morphology to the epidermis of the frontal skin and the outstanding layers of vacuolated keratinocytes have disappeared. Immature hair follicles are seen in the frontal skin at gd 115 whereas hair follicles below the horn bud are not present until gd 155. Interestingly, thick nerve bundles appear in the dermis below the horn bud at gd 115. These nerve fibers grow in size over time and are prominent shortly before birth. Prominent nerve bundles are not present in the frontal skin of wild type or in polled fetuses at any time, indicating that the horn bud is a very sensitive area. The samples from the horn bud region from polled fetuses are histologically equivalent to samples taken from the frontal skin in horned species. This is the first study that presents unique histological data on bovine prenatal horn bud differentiation at different developmental stages which creates knowledge for a better understanding of recent molecular findings."
https://openalex.org/W1923596111,"Drawing on phonology research within the generative linguistics tradition, stochastic methods, and notions from complex systems, we develop a modelling paradigm linking phonological structure, expressed in terms of syllables, to speech movement data acquired with 3D electromagnetic articulography and X-ray microbeam methods. The essential variable in the models is syllable structure. When mapped to discrete coordination topologies, syllabic organization imposes systematic patterns of variability on the temporal dynamics of speech articulation. We simulated these dynamics under different syllabic parses and evaluated simulations against experimental data from Arabic and English, two languages claimed to parse similar strings of segments into different syllabic structures. Model simulations replicated several key experimental results, including the fallibility of past phonetic heuristics for syllable structure, and exposed the range of conditions under which such heuristics remain valid. More importantly, the modelling approach consistently diagnosed syllable structure proving resilient to multiple sources of variability in experimental data including measurement variability, speaker variability, and contextual variability. Prospects for extensions of our modelling paradigm to acoustic data are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W241236850,"Neonatal sepsis and meningitis (NSM) remains a leading cause worldwide of mortality and morbidity in newborn infants despite the availability of antibiotics over the last several decades. E. coli is the most common gram-negative pathogen causing NSM. Our previous studies show that α7 nicotinic receptor (α7 nAChR), an essential regulator of inflammation, plays a detrimental role in the host defense against NSM. Despite notable successes, there still exists an unmet need for new effective therapeutic approaches to treat this disease. Using the in vitro/in vivo models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and RNA-seq, we undertook a drug repositioning study to identify unknown antimicrobial activities for known drugs. We have demonstrated for the first time that memantine (MEM), a FDA-approved drug for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, could very efficiently block E. coli-caused bacteremia and meningitis in a mouse model of NSM in a manner dependent on α7 nAChR. MEM was able to synergistically enhance the antibacterial activity of ampicillin in HBMEC infected with E. coli K1 (E44) and in neonatal mice with E44-caused bacteremia and meningitis. Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-Seq data from mouse BMEC infected with E. coli K1 showed that several E44-increased inflammatory factors, including IL33, IL18rap, MMP10 and Irs1, were significantly reduced by MEM compared to the infected cells without drug treatment. MEM could also significantly up-regulate anti-inflammatory factors, including Tnfaip3, CISH, Ptgds and Zfp36. Most interestingly, these factors may positively and negatively contribute to regulation of NF-κB, which is a hallmark feature of bacterial meningitis. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that circulating BMEC (cBMEC) are the potential novel biomarkers for NSM. MEM could significantly reduce E44-increased blood level of cBMEC in mice. Taken together, our data suggest that memantine can efficiently block host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection through modulation of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways."

This lesion is particularly insidious because neither of its constituent nucleobases faithfully transmit genetic information from the original C:G base pair. Repair of A:oxoG is initiated by adenine DNA glycosylase, which catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of the aberrant A nucleobase from the DNA backbone. These enzymes, MutY in bacteria and MUTYH in humans, scrupulously avoid processing of C:oxoG because cleavage of the C residue in C:oxoG would actually promote mutagenic conversion to A:oxoG. Here we analyze the structural basis for rejection of C:oxoG by MutY, using a synthetic crystallography approach to capture the enzyme in the process of inspecting the C:oxoG anti-substrate, with which it ordinarily binds only fleetingly. We find that MutY uses two distinct strategies to avoid presentation of C to the enzyme active site.

Significance: This work explains how MutY avoids accelerating mutagenesis by processing of an inappropriate substrate. The genomic integrity of living organisms is threatened by a wide variety of chemical and biological agents that damage DNA. One of the most common and genotoxic forms of damage is 8-oxoguanine (oxoG), 3The abbreviations used are: oxoG8-oxoguanine8-oxo-dGTP8-oxo-deoxyguanosine triphosphate8-oxo-dGMP8-oxo-deoxyguanosine monophosphateASCanti-substrateFLRCfluorinated lesion recognition complexTCEPtris(carboxyethyl)phosphinehhuman. which arises through the attack of reactive oxygen species on guanine (see Fig. 1A) (1Lindahl T. Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA.Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). OxoG preferentially mispairs with adenine during replicative DNA polymerization, thereby giving rise to G:C to T:A transversion mutations (see Fig. 1B). Cellular resistance to the genotoxic effects of guanine oxidation is conferred by the evolutionarily conserved GO system, which consists of several proteins that intercept oxoG and its misreplication products at multiple stages of the mutagenesis process (2David S.S. O'Shea V.L. Kundu S. Base-excision repair of oxidative DNA damage.Nature. 2007; 447: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The orthologous 8-oxo-dGTPases MutT (eubacteria) and hMTH1 (humans) sanitize the nucleotide precursor pool by directly hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP; the paralogous DNA glycosylases MutM and hOGG1 (bacteria and humans, respectively) selectively cleave the oxoG nucleobase from oxoG:C base pairs (3Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Evidence that MutY and MutM combine to prevent mutations by an oxidatively damaged form of guanine in DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Insertion of specific bases during DNA synthesis past the oxidation-damaged base 8-oxodG.Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar), a lesion that is particularly insidious because neither nucleobase conveys faithful information with which to direct repair of the other. Although the oxoG moiety is constitutionally aberrant and therefore readily distinguishable from undamaged DNA, the A moiety is only contextually aberrant and otherwise comprises one of four nucleobases in DNA; the difference between faithful repair and wreaking havoc on the genome therefore depends critically on recognition of the base-pairing partner opposite A, being either oxoG (lesion) or T (undamaged). Repair of this lesion utilizes an oxoG:A-specific DNA glycosylase, bacterial MutY or human MUTYH, which leaves the oxoG unaffected and instead cleaves the contextually aberrant A, severing its glycosidic bond (see Fig. 1C) (3Michaels M.L.

MutY (and MUTYH) also contains a C-terminal domain that recognizes oxoG, thereby providing a means for discrimination of oxoG:A lesions versus undamaged T:A base pairs (17Noll D.M. Gogos A.

Equally important is avoidance of C excision from oxoG:C base pairs as this would accelerate transversion mutation by provoking repair-dependent formation of oxoG:A base pairs; indeed, MutY and mammalian MYH appear incapable of acting upon oxoG:C (19Lu A.L.

Purification and characterization of a mammalian homolog of Escherichia coli MutY mismatch repair protein from calf liver mitochondria.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structure of a lesion recognition complex having a catalytically incompetent but recognition-competent mutant MutY protein (D144N) bound to DNA bearing a central oxoG:A lesion has shed light on the mechanism of oxoG:A recognition (16Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for removal of adenine mispaired with 8-oxoguanine by MutY adenine DNA glycosylase.Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The substrate adenine is extruded from the DNA stack and inserted into an extrahelical active pocket, whereas the oxoG nucleobase is fully intrahelical, contacting primarily the N-terminal domain but also the C-terminal domain. In a related lesion recognition complex structure having a wild-type enzyme active site but an uncleavable “mutated” target nucleobase, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine, (FLRC, for fluorinated lesion recognition complex), the substrate adenine is plunged even more deeply into the active pocket, so as to reveal that adenine excision proceeds via general acid catalysis (21Lee S. Verdine G.L. Atomic substitution reveals the structural basis for substrate adenine recognition and removal by adenine DNA glycosylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18497-18502Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The FLRC is therefore considered the structure that most accurately represents MutY poised to catalyze base excision. Although the molecular basis underlying recognition and excision of the oxoG:A substrate is well established both structurally and biochemically, the means by which MutY discriminates against oxoG:C as an anti-substrate remains a mystery. Here we have addressed this issue by analyzing at atomic resolution two complexes in which MutY has been captured in the act of interrogating a target oxoG:C base pair. These structures and the accompanying biochemical analysis suggest that MutY possesses a gatekeeper at the active site entrance that diverts C residues. Point mutations (P164C, D144N) were introduced into the G. stearothermophilus MutY gene by QuikChange mutagenesis using a parent construct wherein the gene was cloned into the pET28 (Novagen) expression vector, resulting in an ORF with an N-terminal His tag and thrombin cleavage site. Protein was expressed and purified essentially as described before (16Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for removal of adenine mispaired with 8-oxoguanine by MutY adenine DNA glycosylase.Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). DNA oligomer 5′-AAGAC(oxoG)TGGAC-3′ (A, modified A with a disulfide tether for cross-linking; O6-Phenyl-dI-CE and oxoG phosphoramidite were purchased from Glen Research) was synthesized on an ABI 392 DNA synthesizer using standard reagents. To prepare the tether-containing DNA, the O6-Ph-dI-containing DNA was incubated with 1 ml of 1 m aqueous cystamine containing 0.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 18 h. 1 ml of NH4OH containing 0.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the resulting mixture and incubated at room temperature for 6 h to cleave off the DNA from the resin. The solution was desalted by NAP column chromatography (GE Healthcare), and concentrated by a SpeedVac. The residue was purified by urea PAGE, dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 buffer, and annealed with the complimentary strand (purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon). To test the cleavage activity of the cross-linked complex, we first cross-linked the oxoG-containing strand to the protein by mixing 40 μm protein and 27 μm DNA in buffer containing 15 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 4 h. The resulting mixture was purified by MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography, buffer-exchanged to 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, and then diluted to 4 μm. The 5′ end of the complimentary strand (containing either A or C at the position that base pairs with oxoG) was labeled with 32P and diluted to 200 nm with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8. 1 μl of the single-strand-cross-linked complex and 1 μl of the complimentary strand solution were added to 8 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, resulting in a 10-μl reaction. At each time point recorded, 2 μl was taken out from the reaction mixture, and 5 μl of 2 m NaOH was added to quench the reaction. The mixture was heated up to 90 °C for 15 min to facilitate strand scission. An equal amount of formamide was added into the quenched reaction, and the sample was stored at −20 °C until subjected to gel analysis. Each sample was heated up to 90 °C for 4 min before being electrophoresed by 15% urea gel for 2 h at 35 mA. The gel was developed for 2 h and imaged with a PhosphorImager. To test the cleavage activity of MutY in the uncross-linked condition, we prepared MutY in two forms: the catalytically active protein (bearing a P164C mutation for cross-linking and a wild-type active pocket) and the D144N MutY (also bearing a P164C mutation, as well as a D144N mutation in the active pocket). The 30-mer oligonucleotides (5′-TTTTTTTTTTGTCCAXGTCTTTTTTTTTTT-3′; X is A in the oxoG:A DNA and C in the oxoG:C DNA) was end-labeled with 32P and annealed to the unlabeled complementary strand (5′-AAGAC°GTGGAC-3′; °G is 8-oxoguanine). The duplex was then incubated with catalytically active MutY or D144N MutY at room temperature for various amounts of time. Reactions were quenched by NaOH before they were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The reaction conditions were similar to that used in the assay of the cross-linked complex. The protein-DNA complex was formed by incubating 40 μm protein and 27 μm DNA in buffer containing 15 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 100 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 24 h. The complex was purified by MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography and dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C overnight. The purified complex was concentrated to 175 μm and crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The anti-substrate complex (ASC) was crystallized in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaOAc, 29% (w/v) PEG 4000. The D144N ASC was crystallized in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1.75 m (NH4)2SO4. Crystals appeared after several days and were allowed to grow for a couple of weeks. The ASC crystal was transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaOAc, 29% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 10% glycerol; the D144N ASC crystal was transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1.75 m (NH4)2SO4, and 25% glycerol. To reduce the ASC crystal, we transferred the crystal from the original reservoir solution to a reducing drop that contained 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaOAc, 29% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 25 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The drop was equilibrated against a reservoir that had the same composition under room temperature for 20 h. The resulting crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaOAc, 29% (w/v) PEG 4000, 25 mm TCEP, and 10% glycerol and frozen into liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data were collected on beamline 24-ID at the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory and processed using XDS (22Kabsch W.

Resolution cut-off was chosen by examining several indicators of data quality, such as I/σ(I), completeness, and CC½ of the highest resolution shell. Crystal of the ASC belongs to the space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 38 Å, b = 85 Å, and c = 142 Å Crystal of the D144N ASC belongs to the space group P61, with unit cell dimensions of a = 105 Å, b = 105 Å, and c = 235 Å.

The coordinates of the protein from the structure of P164C/D144N G. stearothermophilus MutY bound to oxoG:A-containing DNA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1RRQ) were used as the initial search model. Election density for double-stranded DNA was clearly evident in the σA-weighted Fo − Fc map right after molecular replacement. The model was improved by rigid body fit and subsequent simulated annealing, TLS (Translation/Libration/Screw), and individual B-factor refinement using Phenix (23Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G.

Open table in a new tab Previous work has demonstrated that MutY does not readily crystallize with duplex DNA containing a target oxoG:A base pair, but that crystallization of this complex can be fostered through introduction of an intermolecular disulfide cross-link at a site several base pairs removed from the target base pair (Fig. 1, D and E) (16Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L.

Covalent trapping of protein-DNA complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Anticipating the necessity to provide similarly for stabilization of MutY on an oxoG:C target base pair from which it would ordinarily dissociate, we again employed disulfide cross-linking in the studies described below. The previously established cross-linking system was used here (16Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for removal of adenine mispaired with 8-oxoguanine by MutY adenine DNA glycosylase.Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar); the protein component is MutY wild type apart from having an engineered Cys residue at position 164, and the DNA component comprises two complementary 11-mer paired to leave a one-nucleotide overhang at each end and with a C2 thiol attached to nucleobase A4 in the major groove. The resulting cross-linked complex furnished, upon optimization, high-quality crystals that enabled structure determination of the ASC via molecular replacement and model building with refinement to 2.2 Å resolution (Table 1). The overall architecture of the ASC is very similar to that of the FLRC (heavy atom root mean square deviation = 0.323 Å; Fig. 2, A and B), with the protein completely encircling a DNA duplex sharply bent at the site of the target oxoG:C base pair. The N-terminal domain penetrates the duplex from the minor groove side opposite the fully intrahelical oxoG nucleobase, engaging the Watson-Crick edge of the oxoG in hydrogen-bonding interactions, whereas the C-terminal domain engages oxoG from the major groove side (Figs. 2B and 3H). Indeed, nearly identical in the ASC and FLRC structures are the protein component plus the entire oxoG-containing strand and even the flanking regions of the strand containing the nucleobase targeted for excision. Notwithstanding these similarities, pronounced structural divergence is apparent in the immediate vicinity of the target nucleobase, A (FLRC) or C (ASC) (compare Fig. 2, A and C versus B and D, respectively; see also Fig. 3, A–D). Although the target nucleobase is fully extrahelical in both the FLRC and the ASC structures, the actual location of the target nucleobase within the complex and the local conformation of the DNA backbone at that site bear marked divergence. In FLRC, the substrate mimetic 2′-β-fluoroadenosine is deeply inserted into the active pocket, which lies at the junction between the two structural mod"

The objective of the present analysis was to describe the food consumption patterns and to relate these with the prevalence of food insecurity in the context of a rural community. Methodology Three hundred and seven (307) randomly selected households in Kilosa district participated in the study. Data were collected during the rainy season (February–May) and post harvest season (September–October) in the year 2011. Food consumption pattern was determined using a 24-h dietary recall method. Food insecurity data were based on the 30 day recall experience to food insecurity in the household. Factor analysis method using Principal Components extraction function was used to derive the dietary patterns and correlation analysis was used to establish the existing relationship between household food insecurity and dietary patterns factor score. Results Four food consumption patterns namely (I) Meat and milk; (II) Pulses, legumes, nuts and cooking oils; (III) fish (and other sea foods), roots and tubers; (IV) Cereals, vegetables and fruits consumption patterns were identified during harvest season. Dietary patterns identified during the rainy season were as follows: (I) Fruits, cooking oils, fats, roots and tubers (II) Eggs, meat, milk and milk products (III) Fish, other sea foods, vegetables, roots and tubers and (IV) Pulses, legumes, nuts, cereals and vegetables. Household food insecurity was 80% and 69% during rainy and harvest–seasons, respectively (P = 0.01). Household food insecurity access scale score was negatively correlated with the factor scores on household dietary diversity. Conclusion Food consumption patterns and food insecurity varied by seasons with worst scenarios most prevalent during the rainy season. The risk for inadequate dietary diversity was higher among food insecure households compared to food secure households. Effort geared at alleviating household food insecurity could contribute to consumption of a wide range of food items at the household level."
https://openalex.org/W265917890,"The mouse is an established and popular animal model for studying reproductive biology. Epididymal mouse sperm, which lack exposure to secretions of male accessory glands and do not precisely represent ejaculated sperm for the study of sperm functions, have been almost exclusively used in studies. We compared ejaculated and epididymal sperm in an in vitro fertilization setting to examine whether ejaculated sperm enter cumulus-oocyte complexes more efficiently. In order to prepare sperm for fertilization, they were incubated under capacitating conditions. At the outset of incubation, ejaculated sperm stuck to the glass surfaces of slides and the incidences of sticking decreased with time; whereas, very few epididymal sperm stuck to glass at any time point, indicating differences in surface charge. At the end of the capacitating incubation, when sperm were added to cumulus-oocyte complexes, the form of flagellar movement differed dramatically; specifically, ejaculated sperm predominantly exhibited increased bending on one side of the flagellum (a process termed pro-hook hyperactivation), while epididymal sperm equally exhibited increased bending on one or the other side of the flagellum (pro-hook or anti-hook hyperactivation). This indicates that accessory sex gland secretions might have modified Ca2+ signaling activities in sperm, because the two forms of hyperactivation are reported to be triggered by different Ca2+ signaling patterns. Lastly, over time, more ejaculated than epididymal sperm entered the cumulus oocyte complexes. We concluded that modification of sperm by male accessory gland secretions affects the behavior of ejaculated sperm, possibly providing them with an advantage over epididymal sperm for reaching the eggs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1562229995,"This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with septic arthritis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and tried to identify the risk factors for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) arthritis.Between January 2008 and December 2011, patients with septic arthritis caused by S. aureus were identified from the computerized databases of a regional hospital and a medical center in southern Taiwan. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 93 patients with S. aureus arthritis were identified, and MRSA arthritis was found in 38 (40.9%) cases. The mean age of the patients was 58 years, and 86 (92.5%) episodes were classified as community-acquired infections. Diabetes mellitus (n = 41, 44.1%) was the most common underlying disease, followed by chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis. Patients with MRSA arthritis were more frequently elderly and found in the setting of healthcare-associated infection than patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) infections. No other significant differences in clinical manifestations and outcomes were noted between these two groups of patients. Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate was 5.4%, and diabetes mellitus was the only risk factor for mortality.MRSA is emerging in the setting of community-acquired septic arthritis. MRSA septic arthritis is more likely to develop in the elderly and in healthcare-associated infections than MSSA septic arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W334620383,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) has the potential to progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or to promote type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, NASH and T2DM do not always develop coordinately. Additionally, there are no definite noninvasive methods for NASH diagnosis currently. We established rat models of NAFL, NASH, and NAFL + T2DM to recapitulate different phenotypes associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression. Histologic features of rat livers were scored according to criteria established by the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network. Microarray was performed to assess gene expression changes in rat livers. We find that gene expression of s100a9 was higher in NAFL group compared with control, and was increased in NASH groups and decreased in NAFL + T2DM group compared with NAFL. In contrast, srebf1, tbx21, and gimap4 only showed limited discriminating abilities in different groups. There is a significant positive correlation between serum levels of S100A9 and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), the severity of hepatic steatosis, and lobular inflammation (r = 0.80, 0.64 and 0.86, P < 0.001). These findings suggest that S100A9 may be extremely useful in the diagnosis of NASH (AUROC: 0.947, CI: 0.845-1.049). Additionally, serum S100A9 levels displayed a strong correlation with ALT, AST and TBil (r = 0.81, 0.89 and 0.91, P < 0.001) but a weak correlation with FBG, HOMA-IR, TG, and TC (r = -0.41, -0.40, 0.47 and 0.49, P < 0.05).The results we provide here suggest that S100A9 may be useful as a biomarker for the hepatic and metabolic progression of NAFLD and the non-invasive diagnosis of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W4233554843,"Purpose To evaluate interobserver agreement for the detection of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) features of diabetic macular edema (DME). Method Cross-sectional study in which 2 retinal specialists evaluated SDOCT scans from eyes receiving treatment for DME. Scans from 50 eyes with DME of 39 patients were graded for features of DME including intra-retinal fluid (IRF), diffuse retinal oedema (DRE), hyper-reflective foci (HRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), macular fluid and vitreomacular traction (VMT). Features were graded as present or absent at zones involving the fovea, 1mm from the fovea and the whole scan of 49 line scans. Analysis was performed using cross-tabulations for percentage concordance and kappa values (κ). Results In the 2950 line scans analysed, there was an increase in percentage concordance for DRE and HRF when moving from a foveal line scan, 1mm zone and then to a whole scan analysis (88% vs 94% vs 96%) and (88% vs 94% vs 94%) respectively with κ ranging from substantial to almost perfect. Percentage concordance for SRF was 96% at all 3 regions analysed, whilst IRF was 96% at fovea and 98% at higher number of line-scans analysed. Concordance for MF was 100% at fovea and 98% at 1mm zone and whole scan with almost perfect and substantial κ respectively. κ agreement was substantial for VMT at all regions analysed. Conclusion We report a high level of interobserver agreement in the detection of SDOCT features of DME. This finding is important as detection of macular fluid is used to guide retreatment with anti-angiogenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W612869989,"Food-grade microemulsions containing oleic acid, ethanol, Tween 20, and water were formulated as a carrier system for tea seed oil (Camellia oleifera Abel.). The effect of ethanol on the phase behavior of the microemulsion system was clearly reflected in pseudo-ternary diagrams. The solubilization capacity and solubilization efficiency of tea seed oil dispersions were measured along the dilution line at a 70/30 surfactant/oil mass ratio with Tween 20 as the surfactant and oleic acid and ethanol (1:3, w/w) as the oil phase. The dispersed phase of the microemulsion (1.5% weight ratio of tea seed oil to the total amount of oil, surfactant, and tea seed oil) could be fully diluted with water without phase separation. Differential scanning calorimetry and viscosity measurements indicated that both the carrier and solubilized systems underwent a similar microstructure transition upon dilution. The dispersion phases gradually inverted from the water-in-oil phase (< 35% water) to the bicontinuous phase (40-45% water) and finally to the oil-in-water phase (> 45% water) along the dilution line."

Outcome variables analyzed included upper esophageal sphincter pressure (UESP), upper esophageal sphincter residual pressure (UESRP), lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), lower esophageal sphincter residual pressure (LESRP) and esophageal body peristalsis. We have a statistical analysis to illustrate how POEM impacts on the change of esophageal motility.The symptoms related to dysphagia were relieved in 95% of patients in recent term after POEM. While HRM showed a statistically significant reduction of URSRP, LESP and LESRP (P<0.01), however, peristalsis was not consistently affected. There were 11 patients who had undergone other prior endoscopic treatment (endoscopic dilation or botulinum toxin injection) and 55 patients had not. The statistical difference (P>0.05) did not occur for these two groups on LESP and LESRP reduction.POEM clearly relieved the symptoms related to dysphagia by lowering the pressure of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and lower esophageal sphincter (LES),and other endoscopic treatment before POEM did not affect the improvement of LES pressure. These results are concluded from our short-term follow-up study, while the long-term efficacy remains to be further illustrated.Chinese Clinical Trial Register ChiCTR-TRC-12002204)."
https://openalex.org/W1487649719,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of cancer immunotherapy using tumor antigens recognized by CD8+ T cells. However, the overall immune responses induced by these antigens are too weak and transient to induce tumor regression in the majority of patients who received immunization. A growing body of evidence suggests that CD4+ T helper (Th) cells play an important role in antitumor immunity. Therefore, the identification of MHC class II-restricted tumor antigens capable of stimulating CD4+ T cells may provide opportunities for developing effective cancer vaccines. To this end, we describe the identification of developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 1 (DRG-1) as a melanoma-associated antigen recognized by HLA-DR11-restricted CD4+ Th1 cells. Epitope mapping analysis showed that the DRG1248-268 epitope of DRG-1 was required for T cell recognition. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that DRG-1 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines but not in normal tissues. DRG-1 knockdown by lentiviral-based shRNA suppressed melanoma cell proliferation and soft agar colony formation. Taken together, these data suggest that DRG-1 plays an important role in melanoma cell growth and transformation, indicating that DRG1 may represent a novel target for CD4+ T cell-mediated immunotherapy in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W344586294,"Patients with inflammatory rheumatisms, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are more prone to develop skin cancers than the general population, with an additional increased incidence when receiving TNF blockers. There is therefore a need that physicians treating patients affected with inflammatory rheumatisms with TNF blockers recognize malignant skin lesions, requiring an urgent referral to the dermatologist and a potential withdrawal or modification of the immunomodulatory treatment. We aimed to demonstrate that an online training dedicated to skin tumors increase the abilities of rheumatologists to discriminate skin cancers from benign skin tumors. A nationwide randomized web-based survey involving 141 French rheumatologists was conducted. The baseline evaluation included short cases with skin lesion pictures and multiple choice questions assessing basic knowledge on skin cancers. For each case, rheumatologists had to indicate the nature of skin lesion (benign; premalignant/malignant), their level of confidence in this diagnosis (10-points Likert scale), and the precise dermatological diagnosis among 5 propositions. Different scores were established. After randomization, only one group had access to the online formation consisting in 4 e-learning modules on skin tumors, of 15 minutes each (online training group). After reevaluation, the trained and the non-trained group (control group) were compared. The primary end-point was the number of adequate diagnoses of the nature of the skin lesions. The mean number of adequate diagnosis for the benign versus premalignant/malignant nature of the lesions was higher in the online training group (13.4 vs. 11.2 points; p value <0.0001). While the other knowledge scores were also significantly higher, no statistical difference was observed on the level of self-confidence between the 2 groups. In conclusion, the online formation was effective to improve the rheumatologists’ ability to diagnose skin cancer."

A grid approximation of a free-form surface is adopted in CAD modeling in this paper. A free-form surface model is approximated by a set of flat patches. We describe here an efficient and flexible tool trajectory optimization scheme using T-Bézier curves calculated in a new way from trigonometrical bases. The distance between the spray gun and the free-form surface along the normal vector is varied. Automotive body parts, which are large free-form surfaces, are used to test the scheme. The experimental results show that the trajectory planning algorithm achieves satisfactory performance. This algorithm can also be extended to other applications."

https://openalex.org/W305685286,"Computed tomography (CT) has a revolutionized diagnostic radiology but involves large radiation doses that directly impact image quality. In this paper, we propose adaptive tensor-based principal component analysis (AT-PCA) algorithm for low-dose CT image denoising. Pixels in the image are presented by their nearby neighbors, and are modeled as a patch. Adaptive searching windows are calculated to find similar patches as training groups for further processing. Tensor-based PCA is used to obtain transformation matrices, and coefficients are sequentially shrunk by the linear minimum mean square error. Reconstructed patches are obtained, and a denoised image is finally achieved by aggregating all of these patches. The experimental results of the standard test image show that the best results are obtained with two denoising rounds according to six quantitative measures. For the experiment on the clinical images, the proposed AT-PCA method can suppress the noise, enhance the edge, and improve the image quality more effectively than NLM and KSVD denoising methods."
https://openalex.org/W1575346280,"Establishment of long-lived cellular reservoirs of HIV-1 represents a major therapeutic challenge to virus eradication. In this study, we utilized a human primary cell model of HIV-1 latency to evaluate the requirements for efficient virus reactivation from, and the selective elimination of, latently infected human T cells. Ectopic expression of BCL2 supported the replication and spread of R5-tropic HIV-1 in activated CD4+ T cells. After IL-2 withdrawal, the HIV-1-infected T cells survived as resting cells for several months. Unexpectedly, these resting T cells continue to produce detectable levels of infectious virus, albeit at a lower frequency than cells maintained in IL-2. In the presence of HIV-1 inhibitors, reactivation of the resting T cells with γc-cytokines and allogeneic dendritic cells completely extinguished HIV-1 infectivity. We also evaluated the ability of the bacterial LukED cytotoxin to target and kill CCR5-expressing cells. After γc-cytokine stimulation, LukED treatment eliminated both HIV-1-infected resting cells and the non-infected CCR5+ cells. Importantly, complete clearance of in vitro HIV-1 reservoirs by LukED required a lower threshold of cytokine signals relative to HIV-1 inhibitors. Thus, the primary T cell-based HIV-1 latency model could facilitate the development of novel agents and therapeutic strategies that could effectively eradicate HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1573631068,"In ultrasound-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, the target tissue (such as a tumor) often moves and/or deforms in response to an external force. This problem creates difficulties in treating patients and can lead to the destruction of normal tissue. In order to solve this problem, we present a novel method to model and predict the movement and deformation of the target tissue during ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy.Our method computationally predicts the position of the target tissue under external force. This prediction allows appropriate adjustments in the focal region during the application of HIFU so that the treatment head is kept aligned with the diseased tissue through the course of therapy. To accomplish this goal, we utilize the cow tissue as the experimental target tissue to collect spatial sequences of ultrasound images using the HIFU equipment. A Geodesic Localized Chan-Vese (GLCV) model is developed to segment the target tissue images. A 3D target tissue model is built based on the segmented results. A versatile particle framework is constructed based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the movement and deformation of the target tissue. Further, an iterative parameter estimation algorithm is utilized to determine the essential parameters of the versatile particle framework. Finally, the versatile particle framework with the determined parameters is used to estimate the movement and deformation of the target tissue.To validate our method, we compare the predicted contours with the ground truth contours. We found that the lowest, highest and average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values between predicted and ground truth contours were, respectively, 0.9615, 0.9770 and 0.9697.Our experimental result indicates that the proposed method can effectively predict the dynamic contours of the moving and deforming tissue during ultrasound-guided HIFU therapy."
https://openalex.org/W297390983,"Despite recent rules from amateur wrestling sport-governing bodies intended to discourage extreme weight loss measures, wrestling culture still includes varied methods to make weight, including holding a headstand position immediately before stepping on the scale. The procedure, according to the notion, will reduce reported mass anywhere between 250 and 500 g (weight between 2.45 and 4.89 N). The aim of this study was to compare any possible differences between the headstand procedure (HS) and a normal (CON) weight measure, using a metrological approach defined by the European Association of National Metrology Institutes. Seventeen adult men were weighed on a force plate before and after doing a headstand or standing normally for 30s. The order of treatment application was assigned randomly. Post-test weight was significantly larger than pre-test (mean ± s.d.) (640.7 ± 62.8 N and 640.3 ± 62.7 N, respectively, p < 0.0001) under both treatments. No treatment vs. time of test interaction was found. No significant difference was found between CON and HS weight (640.6 ± 62.8 N and 640.9 ± 62.9 N, respectively, p=0.3815). The metrological tests suggest that the statistical differences found are related to the force plate measuring errors in every pre-established time interval. The 45 g (0.44 N) difference found between pretest and post-test lies within the uncertainty range identified for the equipment (± 110 g or 1.08 N). In conclusion, a 30-second headstand has no significant effect on registered body weight. The small variations obtained were due to equipment-associated measuring errors. This experiment offers systematic empirical evidence to aid in the elimination of this unjustified practice among the wrestling community."
