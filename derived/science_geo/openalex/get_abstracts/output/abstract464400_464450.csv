Taking advantage of chemically converted graphene's intrinsic microcorrugated two-dimensional configuration and self-assembly behavior, we show that such materials can be readily formed by capillary compression of adaptive graphene gel films in the presence of a nonvolatile liquid electrolyte. This simple soft approach enables subnanometer scale integration of graphene sheets with electrolytes to form highly compact carbon electrodes with a continuous ion transport network. Electrochemical capacitors based on the resulting films can obtain volumetric energy densities approaching 60 watt-hours per liter."

Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). Using this functionality we developed a transcriptional activation-based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding of sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared it with the off-target activity of transcription activator-like (TALs) effectors. Our results reveal that specificity profiles are sgRNA dependent, and that sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and 18-mer TAL effectors can potentially tolerate 1-3 and 1-2 target mismatches, respectively. By engineering a requirement for cooperativity through offset nicking for genome editing or through multiple synergistic sgRNAs for robust transcriptional activation, we suggest methods to mitigate off-target phenomena. Our results expand the versatility of the sgRNA:Cas9 tool and highlight the critical need to engineer improved specificity."

A nanoscale thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution and of integration within living cells could provide a powerful new tool for many areas of biological and medical research. This paper describes a new probe for nanoscale thermometry that achieves just that. The device uses quantum manipulation of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond nanocrystals. These harbour single electron spins and have specific fluorescence properties that are sensitively dependent on the local temperature. The authors show that they can be accurately measured with a spatial resolution down to 200 nm. By introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, they demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level. Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology1. In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression2,3,4,5 and tumour metabolism6 to the cell-selective treatment of disease7,8 and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits1. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level2,3,4,5. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz−1/2) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2135695964,"An inducible program of inflammatory gene expression is central to antimicrobial defenses. This response is controlled by a collaboration involving signal-dependent activation of transcription factors, transcriptional co-regulators, and chromatin-modifying factors. We have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as a key regulator of this inflammatory response. Pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors induce the expression of numerous lncRNAs. One of these, lincRNA-Cox2, mediates both the activation and repression of distinct classes of immune genes. Transcriptional repression of target genes is dependent on interactions of lincRNA-Cox2 with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B and A2/B1. Collectively, these studies unveil a central role of lincRNA-Cox2 as a broad-acting regulatory component of the circuit that controls the inflammatory response."

Radar guns use the same effect to determine the speed of moving vehicles. Applied to a rotating object side-on, however, a linear Doppler effect would register no movement.

Sourcing the compound from the Euphorbia plants that produce it is relatively inefficient, so Jørgensen et al. (p. 878 , published online 1 August) devised a chemical synthesis starting from the comparatively simple and inexpensive monoterpene chiral (+)-3-carene. The synthetic sequence involves 14 steps—less than half as long as prior chemical routes to the target—and relies on a two-stage approach, inspired by the posited biosynthetic pathway, in which preliminary assembly of the fused ring framework precedes hydroxylation of the periphery."

https://openalex.org/W2021668929,"The entire hepatitis C virus life cycle can be recapitulated in an inbred mouse model, allowing preclinical assessment of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. In a 2009 Nature paper, Alexander Ploss and colleagues showed that transient expression of the human genes CD81 and occludin (OCLN) constituted a minimal set of cellular factors required for uptake of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into immune-competent mouse cells. Now they report that transgenic immune-deficient mice stably expressing CD81 and OCLN can sustain the complete HCV replication cycle with measurable viraemia. The availability of this genetically humanized mouse model opens the way to closer study of HCV infection in vivo and should provide a valuable platform for testing potential therapeutics. More than 130 million people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk of developing severe liver disease. Antiviral treatments are only partially effective against HCV infection, and a vaccine is not available. Development of more efficient therapies has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model. Building on the observation that CD81 and occludin (OCLN) comprise the minimal set of human factors required to render mouse cells permissive to HCV entry1, we previously showed that transient expression of these two human genes is sufficient to allow viral uptake into fully immunocompetent inbred mice2. Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice stably expressing human CD81 and OCLN also support HCV entry, but innate and adaptive immune responses restrict HCV infection in vivo. Blunting antiviral immunity in genetically humanized mice infected with HCV results in measurable viraemia over several weeks. In mice lacking the essential cellular co-factor cyclophilin A (CypA), HCV RNA replication is markedly diminished, providing genetic evidence that this process is faithfully recapitulated. Using a cell-based fluorescent reporter activated by the NS3-4A protease we visualize HCV infection in single hepatocytes in vivo. Persistently infected mice produce de novo infectious particles, which can be inhibited with directly acting antiviral drug treatment, thereby providing evidence for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in inbred mice. This genetically humanized mouse model opens new opportunities to dissect genetically HCV infection in vivo and provides an important preclinical platform for testing and prioritizing drug candidates and may also have utility for evaluating vaccine efficacy."

Collart et al. (p. 893 , published online 1 August) now elucidate a mechanism involved in the control of the MBT. DNA replication initiation factors are titrated out during early cell divisions, which controls the elongation of the cell cycle and the onset of zygotic transcription during the MBT."
https://openalex.org/W2070989278,"Prion infections cause lethal neurodegeneration. This process requires the cellular prion protein (PrP(C); ref. 1), which contains a globular domain hinged to a long amino-proximal flexible tail. Here we describe rapid neurotoxicity in mice and cerebellar organotypic cultured slices exposed to ligands targeting the α1 and α3 helices of the PrP(C) globular domain. Ligands included seven distinct monoclonal antibodies, monovalent Fab1 fragments and recombinant single-chain variable fragment miniantibodies. Similar to prion infections, the toxicity of globular domain ligands required neuronal PrP(C), was exacerbated by PrP(C) overexpression, was associated with calpain activation and was antagonized by calpain inhibitors. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by a burst of reactive oxygen species, and was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2 (also known as CYBB) protected mice from globular domain ligand toxicity. We also found that neurotoxicity was prevented by deletions of the octapeptide repeats within the flexible tail. These deletions did not appreciably compromise globular domain antibody binding, suggesting that the flexible tail is required to transmit toxic signals that originate from the globular domain and trigger oxidative stress and calpain activation. Supporting this view, various octapeptide ligands were not only innocuous to both cerebellar organotypic cultured slices and mice, but also prevented the toxicity of globular domain ligands while not interfering with their binding. We conclude that PrP(C) consists of two functionally distinct modules, with the globular domain and the flexible tail exerting regulatory and executive functions, respectively. Octapeptide ligands also prolonged the life of mice expressing the toxic PrP(C) mutant, PrP(Δ94-134), indicating that the flexible tail mediates toxicity in two distinct PrP(C)-related conditions. Flexible tail-mediated toxicity may conceivably play a role in further prion pathologies, such as familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans bearing supernumerary octapeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2113089439,"Malignant gliomas are locally aggressive, highly vascular tumors that have a dismal prognosis, and present therapies provide little improvement in the disease course and outcome. Many types of malignancies, including glioblastoma, originate from a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are able to initiate and maintain tumors. Although CSCs only represent a small fraction of cells within a tumor, their high tumor-initiating capacity and therapeutic resistance drives tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is imperative to identify pathways associated with CSCs to devise strategies to selectively target them. In this study, we describe a novel relationship between glioblastoma CSCs and the Notch pathway, which involves the constitutive activation of STAT3 and NF-κB signaling. Glioma CSCs were isolated and maintained in vitro using an adherent culture system, and the biological properties were compared with the traditional cultures of CSCs grown as multicellular spheres under nonadherent culture conditions. Interestingly, both adherent and spheroid glioma CSCs show constitutive activation of the STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway and up-regulation of STAT3- and NF-κB-dependent genes. Gene expression profiling also identified components of the Notch pathway as being deregulated in glioma CSCs, and the deregulated expression of these genes was sensitive to treatment with STAT3 and NF-κB inhibitors. This finding is particularly important because Notch signaling appears to play a key role in CSCs in a variety of cancers and controls cell fate determination, survival, proliferation, and the maintenance of stem cells. The constitutive activation of STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways that leads to the regulation of Notch pathway genes in glioma CSCs identifies novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of glioma."
https://openalex.org/W1987275335,"Radioresistance is a major cause of decreasing the efficiency of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To understand the radioresistance mechanisms in NSCLC, we focused on the radiation-induced Notch-1 signaling pathway involved in critical cell fate decisions by modulating cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the use of Notch-1-regulating flavonoid compounds as novel therapeutic drugs to regulate radiosensitivity in NSCLC cells, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H460, with different levels of radioresistance. Rhamnetin and cirsiliol were selected as candidate Notch-1-regulating radiosensitizers based on the results of assay screening for activity and pharmacological properties. Treatment with rhamnetin or cirsiliol reduced the proliferation of NSCLC cells through the suppression of radiation-induced Notch-1 expression. Indeed, rhamnetin and cirsiliol increased the expression of tumor-suppressive microRNA, miR-34a, in a p53-dependent manner, leading to inhibition of Notch-1 expression. Consequently, reduced Notch-1 expression promoted apoptosis through significant down-regulation of the nuclear factor-κB pathway, resulting in a radiosensitizing effect on NSCLC cells. Irradiation-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was also notably attenuated in the presence of rhamnetin and cirsiliol. Moreover, an in vivo xenograft mouse model confirmed the radiosensitizing and epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibition effects of rhamnetin and cirsiliol we observed in vitro. In these mice, tumor volume was significantly reduced by combinational treatment with irradiation and rhamnetin or cirsiliol compared with irradiation alone. Taken together, our findings provided evidence that rhamnetin and cirsiliol can act as promising radiosensitizers that enhance the radiotherapeutic efficacy by inhibiting radiation-induced Notch-1 signaling associated with radioresistance possibly via miR-34a-mediated pathways.Background: Notch-1 plays a critical role in cell fate decisions by modulating cellular processes under irradiation.Results: Irradiation-induced Notch-1 overexpression promoted survival and EMT in NSCLC, whereas rhamnetin and cirsiliol inhibited these effects via miR-34a-mediated Notch-1 down-regulation.Conclusion: Rhamnetin and cirsiliol suppress Notch-1-mediated radioresistance and EMT phenotypes in NSCLC.Significance: Rhamnetin and cirsiliol can act as novel radiosensitizers by inhibiting radiation-induced Notch-1 signaling.

Lung cancer is not only the leading cause of cancer death but is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide. This disease can be categorized into two morphological types as follows: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 2The abbreviations used are: NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor; IF, immunofluorescence; IHC, immunohistochemistry; IP, immunoprecipitation; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; miRNA, microRNA; Gy, gray. which represents the majority of lung cancer cases, and small cell lung cancer. Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with inoperable and advanced stage disease (1Baumann M. Krause M. Zips D. Petersen C. Dittmann K. Dörr W. Rodemann H.P. Molecular targeting in radiotherapy of lung cancer.Lung Cancer. 2004; 45: S187-S197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Radiotherapy plays a critical role in curative management of patients with inoperable cases of NSCLC (2Koh P.K. Faivre-Finn C. Blackhall F.H. De Ruysscher D.

Rev. 2012; 38: 626-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, therapeutic outcomes of radiotherapy are often not fully satisfactory, and radioresistance of cancer cells is considered to be a main factor that prevents successful treatment (3Bussink J. van der Kogel A.J.

Activation of the PI3-K/AKT pathway and implications for radioresistance mechanisms in head and neck cancer.Lancet Oncol. 2008; 9: 288-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although many efforts have been made to regulate radioresistance and develop potent radiosensitizers to establish better treatment strategies, there is currently no molecular targeted therapy that can be well combined with irradiation for treating lung cancer. Thus, the identification of molecular biomarker(s) responsible for emergence of radioresistance and modification of the radiation response by radiosensitizers would greatly advance the development of drugs that increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to irradiation (4Nishimura Y.

Because Notch-1 influences critical cell fate decisions, alterations in Notch-1 signaling are associated with tumorigenesis (7Westhoff B. Colaluca I.N. D'Ario G. Donzelli M. Tosoni D. Volorio S.

Notch-1 stimulates survival of lung adenocarcinoma cells during hypoxia by activating the IGF-1R pathway.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The expression of cyclin D1 (encoded by CCND1), a downstream target of Notch-1, is another indicator of poor prognosis for resectable NSCLC (14Keum J.S. Kong G. Yang S.C. Shin D.H. Park S.S. Lee J.H.

Accumulating data have demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in cancer development by regulating the expression of various oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (15Calin G.A. Croce C.M. MicroRNA signatures in human cancers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6605) Google Scholar). Various miRNAs are reported to affect tumor development at multiple stages and tumor radiosensitivity by regulating DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, radiation-induced signaling, and tumor microenvironment (16Zhao L.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells undergo phenotypic transition into mesenchymal cells (21Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). During cancer progression, tumor cells become more invasive after undergoing EMT and gain access to blood vessels through intravasation resulting in distant metastasis, the major cause of death from cancer (22Kalluri R. Weinberg R.A. The basics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1420-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (7276) Google Scholar).

Thus, we performed flavonoid screening and selected rhamnetin and cirsiliol as Notch-1-regulating candidates, which have been poorly studied in cancer. To better understand the pharmacological regulation of radioresistance, we initiated a project to identify potent and selective radiosensitizers for overcoming the radioresistance of NSCLC cells. Here, we report on the ability of two flavonoids (rhamnetin and cirsiliol) to induce radiosensitization and EMT inhibition through miR-34a-mediated Notch-1 suppression in NSCLC cells. The lead compounds may show therapeutic effects for treating radioresistant tumors as well as provide the basis for developing specific inhibitors. Rhamnetin and cirsiliol were obtained from Sigma and Lancaster (Heysham, UK), respectively. Cell culture media (RPMI 1640), FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and TRIzol® were acquired from Invitrogen. miR-34a mimics (sequences for hsa-miR-34a, 5′-UGG CAG UGU CUU AGC UGG UUG U-3′) and a negative control miRNA mimic were obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Control siRNA, Notch-1 siRNA, and p53 siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon. The NOTCH-1 cDNA expression vector pCMV6-Entry/Notch-1 was from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Two human NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H460, and two normal human lung cell lines, WI-26 VA4 and MRC-5, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were exposed to a single dose of γ-rays using a Gamma Cell 40 Exactor (Nordion International, Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 0.81 Gy/min. After 6 h, the cells were subjected to further analyses, including biochemical studies. Flasks containing the control cells were placed in the irradiation chamber but were not exposed to radiation. Cells were treated with rhamnetin and cirsiliol dissolved in DMSO for 4 h. Six-week-old male BALB/c athymic nude mice (Central Lab Animals Inc., Seoul, South Korea) were used for the in vivo experiments. The protocols used were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Pusan National University (Busan, South Korea) and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animals were housed individually or in groups of up to five in sterile cages. They were maintained in animal care facilities in a temperature-regulated room (23 ± 1 °C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were quarantined for 1 week prior to the study. They were fed water and a standard mouse chow diet ad libitum. For flow cytometry, cells were harvested after the experimental treatments. The cells were then incubated with the appropriate dilution of anti-Notch-1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with DyLight 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The cells were then washed again before analysis using a FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For IF, cells were grown on glass slides. Following the experimental treatments, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in cold acetone and then washed with cold PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, the cells were incubated overnight with anti-Notch-1 antibody at 4 °C. Next, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with DyLight 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Scientific). After washing and counterstaining with DAPI (Sigma), the glass slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For IHC, the mice were sacrificed after the experimental treatments. Sections 4-mm thick were cut, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin before being dewaxed and rehydrated. The sections were then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation with 0.25% pepsin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The sections were blocked in blocking solution (Dako) and then incubated overnight with anti-Notch-1 antibody (AbCAM, Cambridge, UK) at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the sections were incubated with polymer-HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). A 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate chromogen system (Dako) was used to detect antibody binding. The stained sections were examined with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.). Cells were seeded and cultured in a 24-well plate with or without different concentrations of rhamnetin or cirsiliol for 4 h. The media were removed; a 0.05% thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide solution (Sigma) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Next, the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide solution was replaced with DMSO, and the plates were incubated for 10 min. After incubation, the solution was transferred to a 96-well plate in duplicate, and the absorbance was measured. Cells were plated at a density of 300 cells in 6-well dishes. After 24 h, the cells were treated with the indicated drugs, exposed to a specific dose of radiation, and subsequently grown for 14 days. Next, the cells were fixed with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid and stained with 1% crystal violet. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were identified using densitometric software and scored as survivors (39Niyazi M. Niyazi I. Belka C. Counting colonies of clonogenic assays by using densitometric software.Radiat. Oncol. 2007; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Following the experimental treatments, total cellular RNA was isolated from cells (3 × 106 cells) using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). The RNA was separated in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes. The membranes were UV cross-linked, prehybridized for 30 min in ExpressHyb hybridization solution, and hybridized for 4 h at 65 °C with radiolabeled DNA probes specific for human NOTCH-1 cDNA (forward oligonucleotide, 5′-AGC TCT GGT TCC CTG AGG GCT T-3′, and reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-ATG CAG TCG GCG TCA ACC TCA C-3′). The NOTCH-1 probes were labeled with [α-32P]CTP using a random priming kit. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice (first in 1× SSC and then 0.1% SDS). The washed membranes were then subjected to autoradiography. Following the experimental treatment, Western blot analysis and IP studies were performed as described previously (40Kim W. Youn H. Seong K.M. Yang H.J. Yun Y.J. Kwon T. Kim Y.H. Lee J.Y. Jin Y.W. Youn B.

Res. 2011; 176: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis or IP, all the antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cell Signaling Technology. For transient transfection, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 6-well dishes and incubated for 4 h. The cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), the siRNA oligonucleotides targeting NOTCH-1 and p53 using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon), and the miR-34a mimics using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six sets of primers (Table 1) were designed based on the primary precursor molecular sequences from a human miRNA database (41Griffiths-Jones S. The microRNA registry.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers were first validated on human genomic DNA. Following the experimental treatments, total cellular RNA was isolated from 3 × 106 cells using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared using an ImProm-IITM reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was then carried out in a mixture with each gene-specific primer and U6 RNA. Each RT product was used as a template for quantitative PCR performed with a thermal cycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient, Hauppauge, NY).TABLE 1Primers for determining levels of expression of human miRNA molecules, pro-survival genes, and EMT-related genesmiRNA or gene nameForward primerReverse primerU6 (control)5′-CTC GCT TCG GCA GCA CA-3′5′-AAC GCT TCA CGA ATT TGC GT-3′miR-925′-TCT ACA CAG GTT GGG ATC GG-3′5′-CGG GAC AAG TGC AAT ACC ATA-3′miR-935′-AAG TGC TGT TCG TGC AGG T-3′5′-CTC GGG AAG TGC TAG CTC A-3′miR-106b5′-TAA AGT GCT GAC AGT GCA GAT AGT G-3′5′-CAA GTA CCC ACA GTG CGG T-3′miR-7-15′-TGG AAG ACT AGT GAT TTT GTT GT-3′5′-AGA CTG TGA TTT GTT GTC GAT T-3′miR-34a5′-TGG CAG TGT CTT AGC TGG TTG T-3′5′-GGC AGT ATA CTT GCT GAT TGC TT-3′miR-99a5′-TAA ACC CGT AGA TCC GAT CTT G-3′5′-CCA CAG ACA CGA GCT TGT G-3′cIAP15′-CAG CCT GAG CAG CTT GCA A-3′5′-CAA GCC ACC ATC ACA ACA AAA-3′cIAP25′-TCC GTC AAG TTC AAG CCA GTT-3′5′-TCT CCT GGG CTG TCT GAT GTG-3′Survivin5′-TGC CTG GCA GCC CTT TC-3′5′-CCT CCA AGA AGG GCC AGT TC-3′E-cadherin5′-GGA TTG CAA ATT CCT GCC ATT C-3′5′-AAC GTT GTC CCG GGT GTC A-3′Vimentin5′-GAC AAT GCG TCT CTG GCA CGT CTT-3′5′-TCC TCC GCC TCC TGC AGG TTC TT-3′Fibronectin5′-TGA CCT TTT CTG GCT CGT CT-3′5′-GTT CAG CAC AAA GGG CTC TC-3′ Open table in a new tab The levels of miR-34a, pro-survival genes, and EMT-related gene expression were measured using real time qRT-PCR as described previously (42Kim W.

https://openalex.org/W2024472857,"Evidence of crosstalk between the Robo/Slit and Wnt signalling pathways is provided, and R-spondin signalling is shown to enhance canonical Wnt signalling and increase the proliferation of intestinal stem cells. Jian-Guo Geng and colleagues have identified previously unrecognized crosstalk between the Robo–Slit and the Wnt signalling pathways. The authors studied how the Slit2 ligand and its receptor Robo1 influence intestinal crypt morphology and epithelial homeostasis. Reduction of Robo1 levels causes dramatic shortening of intestinal villi in the mouse intestine as well as a lower density of crypts, the niche occupied by intestinal stem cells. The authors provide evidence that Robo1 is a receptor for R-spondin 1, a secreted protein with known synergy for Wnt signalling. Combined with Slit2, R-spondin 1 signalling enhances canonical Wnt signalling and elevates the proliferation and lineage dynamics of intestinal stem cells. These findings indicate that Slit2 and R-spondin 1 cooperatively induce intestinal stem cells for intestinal homeostasis and repair, and significantly prolong overall survival following lethal doses of chemoradiotherapy. Cancer research has been rightly and successfully focused on prevention, early detection, and identification of specific molecular targets that distinguish the malignant cells from the neighbouring benign cells1. However, reducing lethal tissue injury caused by intensive chemoradiotherapy during treatment of late-stage metastatic cancers remains a key clinical challenge. Here we tested whether the induction of adult stem cells could repair chemoradiation-induced tissue injury and prolong overall survival in mice. We found that intestinal stem cells (ISCs)2 expressed Slit2 and its single-span transmembrane cell-surface receptor roundabout 1 (Robo1)3,4. Partial genetic deletion of Robo1 decreased ISC numbers and caused villus hypotrophy, whereas a Slit2 transgene increased ISC numbers and triggered villus hypertrophy. During lethal dosages of chemoradiation, administering a short pulse of R-spondin 1 (Rspo1; a Wnt agonist)5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 plus Slit2 reduced ISC loss, mitigated gut impairment and protected animals from death, without concomitantly decreasing tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy. Therefore Rspo1 and Slit2 may act as therapeutic adjuvants to enhance host tolerance to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for eradicating metastatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2033959035,"An absolute age of about ten billion years is determined for the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, which is about two billion years younger than the cluster NGC 6397 is thought to be, suggesting that metal-rich clusters like 47 Tucanae formed later than metal-poor clusters like NGC 6397. This paper applies a technique to the measurement of the ages of globular clusters based on modelling white dwarf cooling, a technique that limits uncertainties associated with metallicity (the abundance of elements heavier than helium). Brad Hansen et al. determine an absolute age of 9.9 ± 0.7 billion years for the metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae, which is about two billion years younger than inferred for the metal-poor cluster NGC 6397 from the same models. This supports the idea that there is a measurable age difference between metal-poor and metal-rich globular clusters in the Milky Way and that age differences between these clusters can indicate the sequence in which the components of the Galaxy formed. Globular clusters trace the formation history of the spheroidal components of our Galaxy and other galaxies1, which represent the bulk of star formation over the history of the Universe2. The clusters exhibit a range of metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium), with metal-poor clusters dominating the stellar halo of the Galaxy, and higher-metallicity clusters found within the inner Galaxy, associated with the stellar bulge, or the thick disk3,4. Age differences between these clusters can indicate the sequence in which the components of the Galaxy formed, and in particular which clusters were formed outside the Galaxy and were later engulfed along with their original host galaxies, and which were formed within it. Here we report an absolute age of 9.9 ± 0.7 billion years (at 95 per cent confidence) for the metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae, determined by modelling the properties of the cluster’s white-dwarf cooling sequence. This is about two billion years younger than has been inferred for the metal-poor cluster NGC 6397 from the same models, and provides quantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 Tucanae formed later than metal-poor halo clusters like NGC 6397."
https://openalex.org/W2037075518,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating lung disorder of unknown etiology. Although its pathogenesis is unclear, considerable evidence supports an important role of aberrantly activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), which produce a large variety of mediators, including several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which participate in fibroblast activation and lung remodeling. MMP-1 has been shown to be highly expressed in AECs from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs although its role is unknown. In this study, we explored the role of MMP-1 in several AECs functions. Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE12) transfected with human Mmp-1 showed significantly increased cell growth and proliferation at 36 and 48 h of culture (p < 0.01). Also, MMP-1 promoted MLE12 cell migration through collagen I, accelerated wound closing, and protected cells from staurosporine- and bleomycin-induced apoptosis compared with mock cells (p < 0.01). MLE12 cells expressing human MMP-1 showed a significant repression of oxygen consumption ratio compared with the cells with the empty vector.

Ηigher activation of this factor was detected in MMP-1-transfected cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Likewise, a significant decrease of both total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was observed in MMP-1-transfected cells. Paralleling these findings, attenuation of MMP-1 expression by shRNA in A549 (human) AECs markedly reduced proliferation and migration (p < 0.01) and increased the oxygen consumption ratio.

https://openalex.org/W2078633192,"Here, the authors identify a previously unknown regulatory strategy used by Escherichia coli to control end-product levels of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway: this involves feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme UMP kinase, with accumulation of UMP prevented by its degradation to uridine through UmpH, a phosphatase with a previously unknown function. The control of the concentrations and fluxes of the thousand or so metabolites in a living cell such as Escherichia coli occurs via regulation of enzyme concentrations, activities and substrate occupancies. De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis has been reported to be regulated at the first committed pathway step (catalysed by aspartate transcarbamoylase) and at the previous (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase) step. Here the authors identify a novel regulatory strategy — an overflow pathway from UMP to uracil — that E. coli cells use to avoid the accumulation of an excess of the end products of pyrimidine biosynthesis. The process is analogous to that seen in central carbon metabolism, where excessive sugar catabolism leads to buildup of pyruvate that can be excreted as lactate, ethanol or acetate. Cellular metabolism converts available nutrients into usable energy and biomass precursors. The process is regulated to facilitate efficient nutrient use and metabolic homeostasis. Feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway by its final product is a classical means of controlling biosynthesis1,2,3,4. In a canonical example, the first committed enzyme in the pyrimidine pathway in Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by cytidine triphosphate1,4,5. The physiological consequences of disrupting this regulation, however, have not been previously explored. Here we identify an alternative regulatory strategy that enables precise control of pyrimidine pathway end-product levels, even in the presence of dysregulated biosynthetic flux. The mechanism involves cooperative feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate kinase6. Such feedback leads to build-up of the pathway intermediate uridine monophosphate, which is in turn degraded by a conserved phosphatase, here termed UmpH, with previously unknown physiological function7,8. Such directed overflow metabolism allows homeostasis of uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate levels at the expense of uracil excretion and slower growth during energy limitation. Disruption of the directed overflow regulatory mechanism impairs growth in pyrimidine-rich environments. Thus, pyrimidine homeostasis involves dual regulatory strategies, with classical feedback inhibition enhancing metabolic efficiency and directed overflow metabolism ensuring end-product homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2132236820,"Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1)-mediated histone ubiquitylation plays an important role in aberrant gene silencing in human cancers and is a potential target for cancer therapy. Here we show that 2-pyridine-3-yl-methylene-indan-1,3-dione (PRT4165) is a potent inhibitor of PRC1-mediated H2A ubiquitylation in vivo and in vitro. The drug also inhibits the accumulation of all detectable ubiquitin at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the retention of several DNA damage response proteins in foci that form around DSBs, and the repair of the DSBs. In vitro E3 ubiquitin ligase activity assays revealed that PRT4165 inhibits both RNF2 and RING 1A, which are partially redundant paralogues that together account for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity found in PRC1 complexes, but not RNF8 nor RNF168. Because ubiquitylation is completely inhibited despite the efficient recruitment of RNF8 to DSBs, our results suggest that PRC1-mediated monoubiquitylation is required for subsequent RNF8- and/or RNF168-mediated polyubiquitylation. Our results demonstrate the unique feature of PRT4165 as a novel chromatin-remodeling compound and provide a new tool for the inhibition of ubiquitylation signaling at DNA double-strand breaks."

https://openalex.org/W2146511862,"In its role as a mobile receptor for peroxisomal matrix cargo containing a peroxisomal targeting signal called PTS1, the protein Pex5 shuttles between the cytosol and the peroxisome lumen. Pex5 binds PTS1 proteins in the cytosol via its C-terminal tetratricopeptide domains and delivers them to the peroxisome lumen, where the receptor·cargo complex dissociates. The cargo-free receptor is exported to the cytosol for another round of import. How cargo release and receptor recycling are regulated is poorly understood. We found that Pex5 functions as a dimer/oligomer and that its protein interactions with itself (homo-oligomeric) and with Pex8 (hetero-oligomeric) control the binding and release of cargo proteins. These interactions are controlled by a redox-sensitive amino acid, cysteine 10 of Pex5, which is essential for the formation of disulfide bond-linked Pex5 forms, for high affinity cargo binding, and for receptor recycling. Disulfide bond-linked Pex5 showed the highest affinity for PTS1 cargo. Upon reduction of the disulfide bond by dithiothreitol, Pex5 transitioned to a noncovalent dimer, concomitant with the partial release of PTS1 cargo. Additionally, dissipation of the redox balance between the cytosol and the peroxisome lumen caused an import defect. A hetero-oligomeric interaction between the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-110) of Pex5 and a conserved motif at the C terminus of Pex8 further facilitates cargo release, but only under reducing conditions. This interaction is also important for the release of PTS1 proteins. We suggest a redox-regulated model for Pex5 function during the peroxisomal matrix protein import cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2153634314,"The most common disease-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is the out-of-frame deletion of 3 nucleotides (CTT). This mutation leads to the loss of phenylalanine-508 (ΔF508) and a silent codon change (SCC) for isoleucine-507 (I507-ATC→ATT). ΔF508 CFTR is misfolded and degraded by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). We have demonstrated that the I507-ATC→ATT SCC alters ΔF508 CFTR mRNA structure and translation dynamics. By comparing the biochemical and functional properties of the I507-ATT and I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR, we establish that the I507-ATC→ATT SCC contributes to the cotranslational misfolding, ERAD, and to the functional defects associated with ΔF508 CFTR. We demonstrate that the I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR is less susceptible to the ER quality-control machinery during translation than the I507-ATT, although 27°C correction is necessary for sufficient cell-surface expression. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate sustained, thermally stable cAMP-activated Cl(-) transport through I507-ATC and unstable function of the I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR. Single-channel recordings reveal improved gating properties of the I507-ATC compared to I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR (NPo=0.45±0.037 vs. NPo=0.09±0.002; P<0.001). Our results signify the role of the I507-ATC→ATT SCC in the ΔF508 CFTR defects and support the importance of synonymous codon choices in determining the function of gene products."

The DC-helminth interaction induces an immature phenotype in DCs; as a result, these DCs display impaired responses to TLR stimulation and prime Th2-type responses. However, the DC receptors and intracellular pathways targeted by helminth molecules and their importance in the initiation of the Th2 response are poorly understood. In this report, we found that products excreted/secreted by Taenia crassiceps (TcES) triggered cRAF phosphorylation through MGL, MR, and TLR2. TcES interfered with the LPS-induced NFκB p65 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. In addition, TcES-induced cRAF signaling pathway was critical for down-regulation of the TLR-mediated DC maturation and secretion of IL-12 and TNF-α. Finally, we show for the first time that blocking cRAF in DCs abolishes their ability to induce Th2 polarization in vitro after TcES exposure. Our data demonstrate a new mechanism by which helminths target intracellular pathways to block DC maturation and efficiently program Th2 polarization.—Terrazas, C. A., Alcántara-Hernández, M., Bonifaz, L., Terrazas, L. I., Satoskar, A. R. Helminth-excreted/secreted products are recognized by multiple receptors on DCs to block the TLR response and bias Th2 polarization in a cRAF dependent pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2126631992,"In oxygenic photosynthesis, two photosystems work in tandem to harvest light energy and generate NADPH and ATP. Photosystem II (PSII), the protein-pigment complex that uses light energy to catalyze the splitting of water, is assembled from its component parts in a tightly regulated process that requires a number of assembly factors. The 2pac mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was isolated and found to have no detectable PSII activity, whereas other components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, including photosystem I, were still functional. PSII activity was fully restored by complementation with the RBD1 gene, which encodes a small iron-sulfur protein known as a rubredoxin. Phylogenetic evidence supports the hypothesis that this rubredoxin and its orthologs are unique to oxygenic phototrophs and distinct from rubredoxins in Archaea and bacteria (excluding cyanobacteria). Knockouts of the rubredoxin orthologs in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana were also found to be specifically affected in PSII accumulation. Taken together, our data suggest that this rubredoxin is necessary for normal PSII activity in a diverse set of organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis.Background: Photosystem II is an essential component of oxygenic photosynthesis.Results: Photosystem II is specifically decreased in rubredoxin mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Photosystem II (PSII) 3The abbreviations used are: PSII, photosystem II; PSI, photosystem I; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; HA, hydroxylamine; TAP, Tris acetate-phosphate. uses absorbed light energy to catalyze the splitting of water into molecular oxygen and protons and is the only enzyme complex known to be capable of this energetically unfavorable process. Working together with photosystem I (PSI), the cytochrome b6f complex and the ATP synthase, PSII drives oxygenic photosynthesis and is responsible for producing most, if not all, of the oxygen present in the Earth's atmosphere (1Hohmann-Marriott M.F.

The structural and functional homology between PSII and the pheophytin-quinone (type II) reaction center of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, along with many geological and biological lines of evidence, indicates that these two complexes share a common evolutionary origin and that this ancestral complex was almost certainly anoxygenic (15Dismukes G.C.

Rubredoxins are [1Fe-0S] proteins in which one iron atom is coordinated by four cysteine residues (17Lovenberg W. Sobel B.E.

The distribution of rubredoxins within the tree of life is distinct in that these proteins appear to be limited to divergent groups within the archaea and bacteria, whereas they are found in only one group of eukaryotes: plants and photosynthetic algae that contain a plastid derived ultimately from primary endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium. Interestingly, this eukaryotic “photosynthetic” rubredoxin is thylakoid membrane-associated and, together with the homologous protein found in cyanobacteria, appears to represent a class of rubredoxins unique to the oxygenic photoautotrophs that is distinct from all other known rubredoxins (25Wastl J.

Analysis of a mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.

Surprisingly, however, an antibody raised against the membrane-bound rubredoxin from the photosynthetic cryptophyte Guillardia theta was found to react with a homologous protein in PSII-enriched particles from spinach (28Wastl J.

Here we report the characterization of mutants lacking the thylakoid membrane-associated rubredoxin in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

We show that these mutants exhibit a PSII-specific defect and that the role of this rubredoxin in contributing to the assembly or stability of PSII is likely conserved in oxygenic photoautotrophs.

SiteFinding PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and isolated using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) before sequencing. Generation of gRBD1 complemented lines was achieved by transformation of the 2pac mutant with a 1.75 kb fragment of genomic DNA (for primers see supplemental Table S1) that includes the 510 bp coding sequence of the RBD1 gene cloned into the Gateway® vector pENTR-D (Invitrogen), as described (33Kindle K.L.

Cells were then collected by centrifugation (1,300 × g, 3 min), resuspended in 300 μl of high-salt (HS) medium (34Sueoka N. Mitotic replication of deoxyribonucleic acid in Chlamydomonas reinhardi.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1960; 46: 83-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and plated onto HS agar plates. The plates were maintained under 50 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 for 3 to 4 weeks before the autotrophic transformed colonies were picked.

Transformants were selected on BG-11 plates supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 5 μm DCMU, and 50 μm kanamycin. Segregation was analyzed by PCR amplification of both the flanking region and the coding sequence of rubA (for primers, see supplemental Table S1). Complementation of the ΔrubA mutant was achieved by transformation with a plasmid containing the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of the slr0168 coding sequence surrounding a construct consisting of the psbA2 promoter (38Eriksson J.

Primers used for genotyping are listed in supplemental Table S1. Minimum (Fo), maximum (Fm), and variable (Fv/Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence of Chlamydomonas, Synechocystis, and Arabidopsis lines were measured after 15 min of dark acclimation with a pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorescence imaging system (MAXI-IMAGING-PAM, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Fluoresence induction kinetics were monitored before and after addition of 10 μm DCMU on custom-built equipment as described (43Alric J. Lavergne J. Rappaport F.

For isolation of total protein from Chlamydomonas, cells were pelleted and washed in wash buffer (5 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm aminocaproic acid and 200 μm PMSF). After washing, cells were pelleted and resuspended in resuspension buffer (200 mm DTT, 200 mm Na2CO3, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm aminocaproic acid, and 200 μm PMSF) and solubilized by further addition of 5% SDS/30% sucrose solution to final concentration of 2% SDS/12% sucrose. Samples were mixed, boiled for 50 s, placed on ice and centrifuged. For isolation of total protein from Synechocystis, cells were harvested and incubated with lysozyme (0.05% w/v) at 37 °C for 45 min before sonicating to break open cells. Supernatant was isolated and solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 55 °C. Arabidopsis protein extraction was performed as described (46Martínez-García J.F. Monte E. Quail P.H. A simple, rapid and quantitative method for preparing Arabidopsis protein extracts for immunoblot analysis.Plant J. 1999; 20: 251-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μg (Chlamydomonas) or 0.5 μg (Synechocystis) of chlorophyll were loaded per “100%” lane while loading based on equal amounts of AtpB was performed for each “100%” Arabidopsis lane. Samples were run on 10–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by semi-dry transfer to a PVDF membrane. Specific polyclonal antibodies were used and signals were visualized by Supersignal West Femto Chemiluminescent substrate detection system (Thermo Scientific). Polyclonal antibodies against AtpB, D2, RbcL, and CP43 were obtained from Agrisera (Sweden). The antibodies against D1, PsaA/PsaD, cytochrome f, PsaC, and RubA were kind gifts from Profs. A. Melis, J.-D. Rochaix, R. Malkin, A. Haldrup, and D. Bryant, respectively. For the production of an antibody against the RBD1 and AtRBD1 proteins (excluding the transmembrane helix), portions of the RBD1 and AtRBD1 cDNA were subcloned (using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1) into the pET28 (a+) vector (Novagen). These constructs were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), and protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG. The His-tagged RBD1 and AtRBD1 proteins were purified under native conditions through a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits by ProSci Inc. Electrochromic band shift and redox changes of P700 were assessed by monitoring absorbance at 520 and 705 nm, respectively, with a JTS-10 spectrophotometer (BioLogic) as previously described (43Alric J.

Chlamydomonas and Synechocystis cells were dark-acclimated for 10 min in 20 mm Hepes, 20% Ficoll, pH 7.2. A 5 ns and 1 mJ cm−2 laser flash was used to activate light reactions for electrogenicity measurements. To achieve mildly reducing conditions, cells were thoroughly mixed and aerated before absorbance measurement for each wavelength probed. PSII was inhibited by addition of 1 mm HA and 10 μm DCMU. P700 measurements of Arabidopsis were performed on a one leaf-thick array of leaves after 10 min of dark acclimation.

Approximate likelihood-ratio test for branches: A fast, accurate, and powerful alternative.Syst Biol. 2006; 55: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar) was performed to calculate support for each branch. Support for the oxygenic photoautotroph branch was consistently over 0.85 and was not substantially changed by the removal of any one sequence. A collection of acetate-requiring Chlamydomonas insertional mutants (52Dent R.M. Haglund C.M. Chin B.L. Kobayashi M.C. Niyogi K.K. Functional genomics of eukaryotic photosynthesis using insertional mutagenesis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was grown in the dark and screened for mutants displaying a very low maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm). One such mutant, CAL028.03.28, was renamed second photosystem assembly component (2pac) and selected for further characterization. The 2pac mutant was unable to grow photoautotrophically on minimal medium and grew more slowly than the wild-type strain when grown mixotrophically (Fig. 1A). Analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence revealed an initial fluorescence (Fo) level that was equivalent to the maximum fluorescence (Fm), resulting in a lack of variable fluorescence (Fv) from PSII and an Fv/Fm value of 0 (Fig. 1A). Steady-state levels of proteins from the photosynthetic electron transport chain were assayed by immunoblot analysis, and a ∼90% decrease in the levels of the PSII reaction center proteins D1, D2, and CP43 in the 2pac mutant was observed (Fig. 1B). These immunoblot data, along with the growth and chlorophyll fluorescence results, indicate that the 2pac insertional mutant is unable to perform photosynthesis and that this is likely due to the absence of PSII activity. Tetrad analysis of a backcross of the 2pac mutant to the wild-type strain showed that the mutant phenotypes (acetate requirement and absence of variable fluorescence) segregated together in a 2:2 pattern, indicating that they are due to a single nuclear mutation (Fig. 2A). Both phenotypes were linked to the paromomycin resistance that was used as the selectable marker for insertional mutagenesis (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the 2pac mutation was tagged by the insertion of the antibiotic resistance gene.

Sequence flanking the insertion was recovered that corresponded to a region on chromosome 7 within a gene encoding a putative γ-glutamyl hydrolase (Cre07.g315050). Amplification of small (≤400 bp) segments of genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the insertion revealed an adjacent deletion of ∼12.5 kb affecting three additional genes: Cre07.g315100, Cre07.g315150/RBD1, and Cre07.g31520"

https://openalex.org/W1965437539,"myo-Inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPS) plays a crucial role in inositol homeostasis. Transcription of the coding gene INO1 is highly regulated. However, regulation of the enzyme is not well defined. We previously showed that MIPS is indirectly inhibited by valproate, suggesting that the enzyme is post-translationally regulated. Using (32)Pi labeling and phosphoamino acid analysis, we show that yeast MIPS is a phosphoprotein. Mass spectrometry analysis identified five phosphosites, three of which are conserved in the human MIPS. Analysis of phosphorylation-deficient and phosphomimetic site mutants indicated that the three conserved sites in yeast (Ser-184, Ser-296, and Ser-374) and humans (Ser-177, Ser-279, and Ser-357) affect MIPS activity. Both S296A and S296D yeast mutants and S177A and S177D human mutants exhibited decreased enzymatic activity, suggesting that a serine residue is critical at that location. The phosphomimetic mutations S184D (human S279D) and S374D (human S357D) but not the phosphodeficient mutations decreased activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of these two sites is inhibitory. The double mutation S184A/S374A caused an increase in MIPS activity, conferred a growth advantage, and partially rescued sensitivity to valproate. Our findings identify a novel mechanism of regulation of inositol synthesis by phosphorylation of MIPS."
https://openalex.org/W2060823097,"Alzheimer disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in senile plaques in the brains of affected patients. Many cellular mechanisms are thought to play important roles in the development and progression of AD. Several lines of evidence point to the dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis as underlying aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, direct roles in the regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis have been demonstrated for proteins encoded by familial AD-linked genes such as PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, as well as Aβ peptides. Whereas these studies support the hypothesis that disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis contributes to AD, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of familial AD-linked genes on Aβ production from their effects on Ca(2+) homeostasis. Here, we developed a system in which cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis could be directly manipulated to study the effects on amyloid precursor protein metabolism and Aβ production. We overexpressed stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1, the components of the store-operated Ca(2+) entry pathway, to generate cells with constitutive and store depletion-induced Ca(2+) entry. We found striking effects of Ca(2+) entry induced by overexpression of the constitutively active STIM1(D76A) mutant on amyloid precursor protein metabolism. Specifically, constitutive activation of Ca(2+) entry by expression of STIM1(D76A) significantly reduced Aβ secretion. Our results suggest that disruptions in Ca(2+) homeostasis may influence AD pathogenesis directly through the modulation of Aβ production."

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent, endogenous anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective substance that has been explored for use in the design of novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the current study, we evaluated the potential beneficial effects of ATB-346 [2-(6-methoxynapthalen- 2-yl)-propionic acid 4-thiocarbamoyl-phenyl ester], an H2S-releasing derivative of naproxen, in a murine model of spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI was induced in mice by spinal cord compression, produced through the application of vascular clips to the dura via a T5 to T8 laminectomy. ATB-346, naproxen (both at 30 μmol/kg), or vehicle was orally administered to the mice 1 and 6 h after SCI and once daily thereafter for 10 d. Motor function [Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) of locomotion] improved gradually in the mice treated with naproxen. However, those treated with ATB-346 exhibited a significantly more rapid and sustained recovery of motor function, achieving greater than double the increase in locomotion score of the naproxen group by the 10th day of treatment. ATB-346 also significantly reduced the severity of inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis of neural tissue, and nitrosative stress) that characterized the secondary effects of SCI. Again, the effects of ATB-346 were superior to those of naproxen for several parameters. These results showed marked beneficial effects of an H2S-releasing derivative of naproxen in an animal model of SCI, significantly enhancing recovery of motor function, possibly by reducing the secondary inflammation and tissue injury that characterizes this model. The combination of inhibition of cyclooxygenase and delivery of H2S may offer a promising alternative to existing therapies for traumatic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2153821730,"F-box proteins (FBPs) represent one of the largest and fastest evolving gene/protein families in the plant kingdom. The FBP superfamily can be divided in several subfamilies characterized by different C-terminal protein-protein interaction domains that recruit targets for proteasomal degradation. Hence, a clear picture of their phylogeny and molecular evolution is of special interest for the general understanding of evolutionary histories of multi-domain and/or large protein families in plants. In an effort to further understand the molecular evolution of F-box family proteins, we asked whether the largest subfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana, which carries a C-terminal F-box associated domain (FBA proteins) shares evolutionary patterns and signatures of selection with other FBPs. To address this question, we applied phylogenetic and molecular evolution analyses in combination with the evaluation of transcriptional profiles. Based on the 2219 FBA proteins we de novo identified in 34 completely sequenced plant genomes, we compared their evolutionary patterns to a previously analyzed large subfamily carrying C-terminal kelch repeats. We found that these two large FBP subfamilies generally tend to evolve by massive waves of duplication, followed by sequence conservation of the F-box domain and sequence diversification of the target recruiting domain. We conclude that the earlier in evolutionary time a major wave of expansion occurred, the more pronounced these selection signatures are. As a consequence, when performing cross species comparisons among FBP subfamilies, significant differences will be observed in the selective signatures of protein-protein interaction domains. Depending on the species, the investigated subfamilies comprise up to 45% of the complete superfamily, indicating that other subfamilies possibly follow similar modes of evolution."

Some of the PR3 synthesized by promyelocytes in the bone marrow escapes the targeting to granules and occurs on the plasma membrane of naive and primed neutrophils. This membrane-associated PR3 antigen may represent pro-PR3, mature PR3, or both forms. To discriminate between mature PR3 and its inactive zymogen, which have different conformations, we generated and identified a monoclonal antibody called MCPR3-7.

Autoantibody responses to PR3 have been identified as a central pathogenic feature in patients suffering from granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly called Wegener granulomatosis). PR3-directed autoantibodies are capable of activating cytokine-primed neutrophils in vitro by binding to surface-exposed PR3 and Fcγ receptors (10Kallenberg C.G. Pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, an update.Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2011; 41: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In its generalized form, a necrotizing vasculitic process affects and damages the endothelium of small vessels in the lungs and kidneys (11Hoffman G.S. Specks U. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1521-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although PR3 has been extensively studied for decades, its biological functions during immune defense responses are poorly understood. Likewise its interaction with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patients with GPA and their pathogenic role for this relapsing-remitting disease have not been clarified. A large genome-wide association study recently confirmed the genetic association between anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody formation and the PR3 locus on the one hand and the presence of the Z-variant of α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) on the other hand in GPA (12Lyons P.A. Rayner T.F. Trivedi S. Holle J.U. Watts R.A. Jayne D.R. Baslund B. Brenchley P. Bruchfeld A. Chaudhry A.N. Cohen Tervaert J.W. Deloukas P. Feighery C. Gross W.L. Guillevin L. Gunnarsson I. Harper L.

This finding suggests that PR3 activity and/or inactivation of PR3 by α1PI varies in the human population and contributes to the risk for GPA manifestations either at onset, during relapses, or during systemic progression. Inhibition of neutrophil elastase and PR3 by α1PI is highly dependent on the proper conformation of an exposed reactive center loop, which serves as a pseudosubstrate. Single point mutations, even at distant sites within α1PI like a lysine substitution of Glu342 in the Z-variant, can affect the conformation of the reactive center loop and can decrease the association rates with target proteases (13Ogushi F. Fells G.A. Hubbard R.C. Straus S.D. Crystal R.G. Z-type α1-antitrypsin is less competent than M1-type α1-antitrypsin as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase.J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Once hydrolyzed after the methionine in position 358, the new carboxyl terminus of α1PI forms an irreversible covalent acyl·enzyme complex that undergoes a sophisticated conformational rearrangement. These enzyme·serpin complexes are quickly removed from neutrophil membranes, the interstitial fluids, and the circulation by a specific receptor-mediated uptake into endolysosomes (14Gettins P.G. Serpin structure, mechanism, and function.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). The question as to how antibodies can interfere with the activity of PR3 and impair its clearance by the natural plasma inhibitor α1PI, however, has not been addressed and answered. Like other serine proteases of neutrophils, PR3 (15Campanelli D. Melchior M. Fu Y. Nakata M. Shuman H. Nathan C. Gabay J.E.

Following cleavage of the signal peptide and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, the proenzyme (pro-PR3) egresses from the endoplasmic reticulum and migrates to the Golgi complex. At this stage, it carries a short amino-terminal extension, the dipeptide Ala-Glu. This dipeptide prevents the molecule from assuming its active enzyme conformation prematurely during biosynthesis but is cleaved off by the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I (cathepsin C) just before storage in primary granules (17Rao N.V.

After the removal of the amino-terminal dipeptide, the free positively charged amino terminus of Ile16 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) forms an internal salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Asp194. This rearrangement stabilizes the oxyanion hole and renders the active site cleft fully accessible to substrates. During biosynthesis, some catalytically inactive pro-PR3 escapes granule targeting and is transported to the cellular surface for secretion. As pro-PR3 is a catalytically inactive precursor, it is not cleared by α1PI and may be more easily accessible for autoantibodies in GPA. Although the crystal structure of mature PR3 (without inhibitors bound to it) has been reported (21Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N.

The best studied zymogen-enzyme pair, bovine cationic trypsinogen and its mature counterpart, bovine cationic trypsin (22Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R.

Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), have identical structures for about 85% of the Cα chain, but four segments of the main chain are entirely different: the amino terminus (Ile16–Gly19), the so-called autolysis loop (Gly142–Ala152), the Val185–Gly193 loop, and the Val216–Leu223 loop (22Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. Crystal structure of bovine trypsinogen at 1.8 Å resolution. II. Crystallographic refinement, refined crystal structure and comparison with bovine trypsin.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The latter three loops form the activation domain in the active enzyme in which the free amino terminus is inserted into the so-called activation pocket of the zymogen. All four segments are highly flexible in the zymogen but ordered in the active enzyme. Allosteric regulation of the two segments around residues 190 and 220 essentially switches the molecule from a functionally incompetent zymogen into a catalytically competent state and creates the S1 binding site and oxyanion hole (22Fehlhammer H.

Production and applications of recombinant proteinase 3, Wegener's autoantigen: problems and perspectives.Clin. Nephrol. 2006; 66: 153-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational switch between the proenzyme state and the catalytically active state of the mature enzyme is the well established structural basis for allosteric regulation of trypsin-/chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity (24Pozzi N. Vogt A.D. Gohara D.W. Di Cera E. Conformational selection in trypsin-like proteases.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The goal of our studies was to identify a new class of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can discriminate between the catalytically competent state of the activation domain and the enzymatically inactive conformation of the zymogen. To develop such a monoclonal antibody with specificity close to the active site cleft and activity blocking properties, we immunized mice with a stable proform of PR3 carrying the tripeptide Ala-Glu-Pro at the mature amino terminus and selected hybridomas that showed preferential binding to the proform. We describe the binding specificity and activity blocking properties of the newly produced MCPR3-7 in comparison with the commercially available anti-PR3 mAb CLB-12.8. Besides the reduction of the PR3 activity, MCPR3-7 also interferes with the complexation of PR3 and α1PI and switches the active enzyme into an inactive, zymogen-like state by altering the autolysis and 190 loops. The antibody can be regarded as a starting point for the development of antibody-based allosteric inhibitors of PR3 that block activity and prevent the binding of neutrophil-activating, pathogenic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 EBNA was received from Yves Durocher, National Research Council Canada, Montreal, Canada. Human neutrophil PR3 purified from neutrophils of peripheral blood was obtained from DIARECT AG, Freiburg, Germany. The anti-PR3 mAb MCPR3-2, which was used as control in most experiments, binds pro-PR3 and mature PR3 equally well and has been described previously (25Sun J. Fass D.N. Hudson J.A.

The different recombinant PR3 variants used for the generation, selection, and characterization of mAbs with preferential binding to pro-PR3 are described schematically in Fig. 1A. The development of the cDNA construct coding for recombinant wild-type PR3 (pro-PR3ctp) and the cDNA construct of the active site mutant lacking the codons for the amino-terminal activation dipeptide (ΔPR3ctp-S195A) as well as their expression in HEK 293 cells have been described previously (18Specks U.

To obtain an immunogen that was not contaminated by traces of amino-terminally processed PR3 (mature PR3), we generated a pro-PR3 variant named proP-PR3ctp, which carries a three-residue-long propeptide ending with proline. This propeptide cannot be cleaved and removed by cathepsin C. The cDNA coding for the insertion of a proline residue between the natural activation dipeptide Ala-Glu and the Ile residue constituting the amino terminus of the mature enzyme was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) with the sense primer US127-5′-GCTGCGGAGCCAATCGTGGGC-3′, the antisense primer US128-5′-GCCCACGATTGGCTCCGCAGC-3′, and pro-PR3ctp as template.

The constructs as well as the expression of human pro-PR3 (pro(4DK)-PR3), gibbon pro-PR3, and the two human/gibbon chimeras were produced as described (28Korkmaz B. Kuhl A. Bayat B. Santoso S.

Furthermore, human pro-PR3 was expressed by transient transfection of HEK 293 EBNA cells as described elsewhere (29Perera N.C. Schilling O. Kittel H. Back W. Kremmer E. Jenne D.E.

The catalytically inactive PR3 variant ΔPR3-S195A (Fig. 1A) was also produced in the HEK 293 EBNA expression system. Purification of His-tagged proteins from cell supernatants was carried out as described previously (29Perera N.C. Schilling O. Kittel H. Back W. Kremmer E. Jenne D.E.

The PR3 variants, which were produced in their proform, were converted into an active state by enterokinase from calf intestine (Roche Applied Science). After dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, the proteins were cleaved at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:40 at room temperature overnight. For the generation of the mAb MCPR3-7, BALB/c mice were immunized with immunoaffinity-purified proP-PR3ctp following standard immunization protocols. Antibody titers of immunized mice were determined by ELISA. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with a FO myeloma cell line of BALB/c origin to generate hybridomas. Animal experimentation for this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Handling and care of animals were in accordance with institutional guidelines. For the identification and selection of hybridoma antibodies that bind to pro-PR3 but not to mature PR3, the following capture ELISA technique was applied. Immulon I strips were coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:1000 in 0.5 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6 overnight. After blocking with BSA/immunoradiometric assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, and 2% BSA, pH 7.4), 0.1 μg of the monoclonal hybridoma antibodies or control antibody (MCPR3-2) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min while shaking. Supernatants from [35S]methionine-labeled proP-PR3ctp- or ΔPR3ctp-S195A-expressing HEK 293 cells diluted 1:20 in immunoradiometric assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) were added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. After removal of unbound PR3 by washing, antibody-bound radioactivity was measured in counts/min for each well. The hybridomas generating the highest signal difference between pro-PR3 and mature PR3 were chosen for all subsequent experiments (MCPR3-7). ProP-PR3ctp- and ΔPR3ctp-S195A-expressing HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C overnight. Unless otherwise stated, all immunoprecipitation steps were performed at 4 °C. Staphylococcal protein A was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG and then with different concentrations of MCPR3-7 (1:100, 1:200, and 1:400 dilutions of a 1.3 mg/ml stock solution) in each case for 1 h. The cell culture supernatants of biosynthetically labeled cells were precleared by incubation with staphylococcal protein A for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The precleared culture supernatants were then incubated for 10 min with the staphylococcal protein A/rabbit anti-mouse IgG/MCPR3-7 mixture and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm NaF in PBS to which 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 75 μg/ml PMSF were freshly added prior to use). The precipitate was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C until analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The possible competition between the two mAbs MCPR3-2 and MCPR3-7 in binding to pro-PR3 was analyzed by bead-based flow cytometry using the carboxyl-terminally tagged PR3 variant PR3ctp-S195A-cmyc (pro-PR3) (30Silva F.

Cell culture supernatants were concentrated using an Amicon Centriplus C-10 with a cutoff of 10,000 Da. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the concentrate was applied to a HiTrap chelating high performance column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

https://openalex.org/W1995664515,"Binding of the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) results in platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation that initiates primary hemostasis. Both the elevated shear stress and the mutations associated with type 2B von Willebrand disease enhance the interaction between A1 and GPIbα. Through molecular dynamics simulations for wild-type vWF-A1 and its eight gain of function mutants (R543Q, I546V, ΔSS, etc.), we found that the gain of function mutations destabilize the N-terminal arm, increase a clock pendulum-like movement of the α2-helix, and turn a closed A1 conformation into a partially open one favoring binding to GPIbα. The residue Arg(578) at the α2-helix behaves as a pivot in the destabilization of the N-terminal arm and a consequent dynamic change of the α2-helix. These results suggest a localized dynamics-driven affinity regulation mechanism for vWF-GPIbα interaction. Allosteric drugs controlling this intrinsic protein dynamics may be effective in blocking the GPIb-vWF interaction."

Here we present a de novo-designed peptide, SP1-1 (RKKRLKLLKRLL-NH2), with antimicrobial activity against multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration: 6.25 μM). Elucidation of the mode of action of this peptide revealed a strong interaction with RsbW kinase (Kd: 6.01 ± 2.73 nM), a serine kinase negatively regulating the activity of the transcription factor σB (SigB). SP1-1 binding and functional modulation of RsbW were shown in vitro by a combination of biochemical, molecular, and biophysical methods, which were further genetically evidenced in vivo by analysis of S. aureus ΔsigB deletion mutants. Intracellular localization of the peptide was demonstrated using nanometer-scaled secondary ion mass spectrometry. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that transcription of numerous genes, involved in cell wall and amino acid metabolism, transport mechanisms, virulence, and pigmentation, is affected. Interestingly, several WalR binding motif containing genes are induced by SP1-1. In sum, the designed peptide SP1-1 seems to have multiple modes of action, including inhibition of a kinase, and therefore might contribute to the development of new antibacterial compounds, giving bacterial kinase inhibition a closer inspection.—Dangel, A, Ackermann, N., Abdel-Hadi, O., Maier, R., Önder, K., Francois, P., Müller, C.

Herein, an in-depth proteomic investigation of MCCs based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, protein extraction and digestion, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation labeling, fractionation, and analysis on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight and LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometers identified and quantified more than 700 proteins and revealed pathways activated in OC+BAP+ MCCs compared with those in OC–BAP– cells. Among proteins referable to angiogenesis, the thrombospondin-1 pathway was markedly up-regulated in MCCs vs. control cells. Up-regulation of the thrombospondin-1 pathway was confirmed by a genome-wide transcriptional analysis. Using in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays, we found that freshly isolated MCCs and cultured MCCs display an antiangiogenic function by means of both paracrine activity (conditioned medium) and altered spatial localization in cocultures with endothelial cells. Thrombospondin-1 inhibition by antibody-mediated neutralization or gene knockdown restored the angiogenic activity of OC+BAP+ MCCs toward normal values and abolished the antiangiogenic effects of MCC conditioned medium. These data indicate that circulating MCCs exert antiangiogenic activity by virtue of their overexpression of thrombospondin-1.

However, mechanisms of CD39 transcriptional and post-translational regulation are not well known. Here we show that CD39 levels are modulated by inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). RAW macrophages and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with the PDE3 inhibitors cilostazol and milrinone, then analyzed using qRT-PCR, immunoprecipitation/Western blot, immunofluorescent staining, radio-thin-layer chromatography, a malachite green assay, and ELISA. HUVECs expressed elevated CD39 protein (2-fold [P<0.05] for cilostazol and 2.5-fold [P<0.01] for milrinone), while macrophage CD39 mRNA and protein were both elevated after PDE3 inhibition. HUVEC ATPase activity increased by 25% with cilostazol and milrinone treatment (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), as did ADPase activity (47% and 61%, P<0.001). There was also a dose-dependent elevation of soluble CD39 after treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, with maximal elevation of 60% more CD39 present compared to controls (1 mM, P<0.001). Protein harvested after 8-Br-cAMP treatment showed that ubiquitination of CD39 was decreased by 43% compared to controls. A DMSO or PBS vehicle control was included for each experiment based on solubility of cilostazol, milrinone, and 8-Br-cAMP.

New adipocytes are required for storage of energy in the white adipose tissue. This process of adipogenesis is widely studied in differentiating 3T3L1 preadipocytes in vitro. We have identified a key signaling kinase, protein kinase C delta (PKCδ), whose alternative splice variant expression is modulated during adipogenesis. We demonstrate that PKCδII splice variant promotes survival in differentiating 3T3L1 cells through the Bcl2 pathway. Here we demonstrate that resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, increases apoptosis and inhibits adipogenesis along with disruption of PKCδ alternative splicing during 3T3L1 differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2104232995,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can interact with regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. However, the effects of such interactions on signal transduction and their physiological relevance have been largely undetermined. Ligand-bound GPCRs initiate by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Signaling is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP through intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunit, a reaction catalyzed by RGS proteins. Using yeast as a tool to study GPCR signaling in isolation, we define an interaction between the cognate GPCR (Mam2) and RGS (Rgs1), mapping the interaction domains. This reaction tethers Rgs1 at the plasma membrane and is essential for physiological signaling response. In vivo quantitative data inform the development of a kinetic model of the GTPase cycle, which extends previous attempts by including GPCR-RGS interactions. In vivo and in silico data confirm that GPCR-RGS interactions can impose an additional layer of regulation through mediating RGS subcellular localization to compartmentalize RGS activity within a cell, thus highlighting their importance as potential targets to modulate GPCR signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2130212004,"The neuroprotective effect of baicalein is generally attributed to inhibition of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) and suppression of oxidative stress, but recent studies showed that baicalein also activates hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) through inhibition of prolyl hydrolase 2 (PHD2) and activation of the phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Yet, the significance and regulation of prosurvival cytokines erythropoietin (Epo) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), two transcriptional targets of HIF1α, in baicalein-mediated neuroprotection in neurons and astrocytes remains unknown. Here we investigated the causal relationship between the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and Epo/VEGF expression in baicalein-mediated neuroprotection in primary rat cortical neurons and astrocytes. Our results show that baicalein induced Epo and VEGF expression in a HIF1α- and PI3K/Akt-dependent manner in neurons. Baicalein also protected neurons against excitotoxicity in a PI3K- and Epo/VEGF-dependent manner without affecting neuronal excitability. In contrast, at least a 10-fold higher concentration of baicalein was needed to induce Epo/VEGF production and PI3K/Akt activity in astrocytes for protection of neurons. Moreover, only baicalein-induced astrocytic VEGF, but not Epo expression requires HIF1α, while PI3K/Akt signaling had little role in baicalein-induced astrocytic Epo/VEGF expression. These results suggest distinct mechanisms of baicalein-mediated Epo/VEGF production in neurons and astrocytes for neuroprotection, and provide new insights into the mechanisms and potential of baicalein in treating brain injury in vivo."

Activation of transcription plays a vital role in the regulation of gene expression, allowing organisms to control the timing and location of gene products. Typically, activators bind to specific sites on the DNA and interact with components within the transcriptional machinery. These interactions then promote transcription from promoter sequences that would not normally be recognized by RNA polymerase in the absence of the regulator, allowing diversity in the selection of transcription start sites (for review, see Refs. 1Decker K.B.

T4 middle promoters contain the −10 element, but they lack the −35 recognition sequence. Instead they have another element, the MotA box, that is located in the −30 region of the promoter and is recognized by the MotA protein (for review, see Ref. 3Hinton D.M. Transcriptional control in the prereplicative phase of T4 development.Virol. J. 2010; 7: 289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ability of MotA to activate middle promoter transcription requires the T4 co-activator AsiA. AsiA binds tightly to σ70 Region 4 and structurally remodels this portion of σ (7Lambert L.J. Wei Y. Schirf V. Demeler B. Werner M.H. T4 AsiA blocks DNA recognition by remodeling σ70 Region 4.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2952-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consequently, σ70 Region 4 no longer binds to the −35 element or to its protein partner within the β subunit of core polymerase, the β-flap. This disruption helps MotA in two ways. First, it prevents the σ70 Region 4/−35 DNA contact (8Stevens A.

Inhibition of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase by bacteriophage T4 AsiA.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), allowing MotA unfettered access to the MotA box, which overlaps the −35 region of the DNA. Second, it allows MotA to interact with H5, the C-terminal residues of σ70 that are normally fully secured within the β-flap (12Bonocora R.P. Caignan G. Woodrell C. Werner M.H. Hinton D.M. A basic/hydrophobic cleft of the T4 activator MotA interacts with the C terminus of E. coli σ70 to activate middle gene transcription.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because MotA targets the very same residues within H5 that are engaged by the β-flap (13Bonocora R.P. Decker P.K. Glass S. Knipling L. Hinton D.M. The bacteriophage T4 activator MotA and the β-flap tip of RNA polymerase target the same Set of σ70 C-terminal residues.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 39290-39296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), AsiA-induced rearrangement of σ70 Region 4 is required to reveal this target for MotA binding. Other evidence suggests that AsiA also interacts with the β-flap (14Yuan A.H. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. The bacteriophage T4 AsiA protein contacts the β-flap domain of RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6597-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hijacking of σ70 Region 4 by AsiA and MotA engagement of H5 is called σ appropriation. MotA is a 2-domain protein consisting of a N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–96), and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 105–211) connected by a highly basic linker (15Finnin M.S. Hoffman D.W.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) are known. MotANTD is composed of five α-helices, with helices 1, 3, 4, and 5 packing around the central helix 2 (Fig. 1A). The basic, hydrophobic cleft formed from this arrangement interacts with σ70 H5 (12Bonocora R.P. Caignan G. Woodrell C. Werner M.H. Hinton D.M.

The activation domain of the MotA transcription factor from bacteriophage T4.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1992-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MotACTD consists of a saddle-shaped, double-wing motif generated by three α-helices interspersed with six β-strands (17Li N. Sickmier E.A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. White S.W. The MotA transcription factor from bacteriophage T4 contains a novel DNA binding domain. The “double wing” motif.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). MotACTD alone will bind MotA box DNA (20Pande S. Makela A. Dove S.L. Nickels B.E. Hochschild A. Hinton D.M.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3957-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The double-wing motif is unique among DNA-binding proteins, and its mode of interaction with DNA is, therefore, difficult to predict. The clearly defined domain structures have suggested that MotA is a bifunctional protein with different domains involved in protein-protein versus protein-DNA interactions. However, exactly how MotA engages the DNA has not been determined. Given the lack of a MotA/DNA structure, we reasoned that we could use the chemical cleaving reagent iron bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (FeBABE) to generate a map of the positions of various MotA residues relative to the DNA within the σ-appropriated transcription complex. FeBABE is a biochemical tool that can be covalently attached to the free sulfhydryl group of a cysteine residue in a protein (21Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A.

Induction of the Fenton reaction by the addition of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide then generates hydroxyl radicals that cleave polypeptide or nucleic acid bonds proximal to the chelate. The resulting DNA cleavage patterns allow one to biochemically map the position of the protein relative to the DNA. This technique has proven useful for several applications, including orienting the domains of σ70 relative to an E. coli promoter (22Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A.

Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 2573-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because we wanted to generate a fine resolution map, we conjugated single surface-exposed residues throughout MotA to obtain extensive cleavage data. We then used the generated cut sites together with ICM Molsoft and three-dimensional physical models of MotANTD, MotACTD, and DNA structures to guide the position of MotA as we evaluated the shape complementarity between protein and DNA. Our results have allowed us to position the full-length MotA on the DNA within the transcription complex and demonstrate the utility of this approach to map a protein-DNA complex that has been recalcitrant to traditional structure analyses. In addition, we have used surface plasmon resonance to show that MotA alone is in a very dynamic equilibrium with the MotA element, dissociating from the DNA rapidly. Our results are consistent with a model in which MotA “samples” the DNA and is able to activate only when both its protein and DNA partners are available. pDKT90 (31March-Amegadzie R. Hinton D.M.

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses were obtained from Operon. The top strand of each double-strand oligomer also contained the sequence 5′biotin-ATACATTATG to allow attachment of the DNA to the neutravidin present on the SPR chip. pNW143, a araC/kanr/pACYC-based plasmid, contains WT motA cloned between the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter and the rrnB transcription terminator (12Bonocora R.P. Caignan G. Woodrell C. Werner M.H. Hinton D.M. A basic/hydrophobic cleft of the T4 activator MotA interacts with the C terminus of E. coli σ70 to activate middle gene transcription.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pMotA(cys−) is identical to pNW143 except that the single cysteine residue in MotA (Cys-182) has been mutated to an alanine. The cys− motA gene was generated by a modification of BsaI site-directed mutagenesis (32Stemmer W.P. Morris S.K. Enzymatic inverse PCR. A restriction site-independent, single-fragment method for high efficiency, site-directed mutagenesis.Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 214-220PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR was performed using pNW143, Pfu polymerase, and two pairs of oligomers; set 1 contained an oligomer with an XbaI site that is upstream of motA and the mutagenic oligomer with the BsaI cleavage site at the location of the Cys-182 codon; set 2 contained the mutagenic oligomer with the BsaI site and an oligomer with a SphI site that is downstream of motA (sequences of primers are available upon request). The resulting PCR products were digested with BsaI and XbaI or with BsaI and SphI and then ligated with pNW143 that had been previously digested with XbaI and SphI. Plasmids encoding motAC182A with the desired cysteine substitutions at specific locations were either derived from pMotAcys− again using BsaI site-directed mutagenesis or were obtained from Bioinnovatise (the plasmids encoding the E93C, E112C, T100C, E132C, K96C, and E105C substitutions), again in the pMotAcys− background. DNA sequence analyses, performed either by the Facility for Biotechnology Resources of the FDA or Macrogen, confirmed the sequence of the constructs throughout the cloned regions. E. coli core polymerase was obtained from Epicenter Technologies, and AsiA-His6-tagged was purified as described (33Pal D. Vuthoori M. Pande S. Wheeler D. Hinton D.M.

After harvesting by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF) and broken by sonication. Cell fractions were obtained after centrifugation at 8750 × g. The MotA proteins were first isolated by batch or column phosphocellulose chromatography as described (31March-Amegadzie R. Hinton D.M.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18034-18044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that in some cases of batch chromatography the column was first washed extensively with sonication buffer containing a salt concentration (0.3 m NaCl) that did not elute the protein, and then the protein was eluted with small volumes of sonication buffer containing the eluting salt concentration (0.4 m NaCl). In this procedure, the last elution fraction was highly purified and essentially free of a contaminating nuclease (see below) and, thus, was used without further purification. In the other cases, protein fractions eluting from the phosphocellulose column were dialyzed versus AKTA binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), loaded onto a HiTrap SP HP cation exchange column (1 ml, GE Healthcare), and eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in AKTA binding buffer (40 ml total). When necessary, the MotA proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (3000 molecular weight cutoff) before being buffer-exchanged into MotA GC buffer (200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 50% glycerol). Protein concentrations were determined by comparison to known amounts of WT MotA after SDS-PAGE and gel staining with Colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen). Because of a DNA nuclease that co-purifies with MotA (31March-Amegadzie R. Hinton D.M. The bacteriophage T4 middle promoter PuvsX. Analysis of regions important for binding of the T4 transcriptional activator MotA and for activation of transcription.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), fractions were tested for nuclease contamination by incubation with either double-strand plasmid or with 32P-labeled DNA before determining which fractions to pool. In addition, MotA proteins D43C and N187C were further purified by single-strand DNA cellulose chromatography using a 0.5-ml column equilibrated in sonication buffer. The column was washed with 2-ml steps of sonication buffer containing 100, 200, and 500 mm NaCl in sonication buffer. This further purification of the MotA D43C and N187C proteins, which eluted in the 500 mm NaCl steps, reduced but did not eliminate the DNase. Some of the other MotA mutants also contained low levels of nuclease, which yielded cutting outside of the PuvsX promoter region (Fig. 3, A and B). This cutting was not dependent on sodium ascorbate/H2O2 that is needed to generate hydroxyl radicals from the conjugate FeBABE. Single round transcription assays in which the proteins were incubated with the DNA for only 20 s at 37 °C before the addition of rifampicin (Fig. 2A) were performed as described (12Bonocora R.P. Caignan G. Woodrell C. Werner M.H. Hinton D.M. A basic/hydrophobic cleft of the T4 activator MotA interacts with the C terminus of E. coli σ70 to activate middle gene transcription.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A similar protocol was used for the assays in which the proteins were incubated for 8 min at 37 °C, except that no NTPs were present during the preincubation; NTPs plus 500 ng heparin were then added to start transcription (Fig. 2B). Gels were imaged by autoradiography followed by scanning with a Powerlook 2100XL densitometer. Quantification was performed using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. MotA protein (2 nmol), which had been dialyzed into either sonication buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol or GC buffer without DTT, was incubated with FeBABE (Dojindo Laboratories) (10 nmol in 0.5 μl of DMSO) for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 40–50 μl. The protein was then dialyzed into GC buffer, which also served to remove excess FeBABE. Conjugation efficiencies, as determined by mass spectrometry (NIDDK Advanced Mass Spectrometry Facility), were: D43C, 79%; E93C, 95%; K96C, 85%; T100C, 95%, E105C, 93%; E112C, 60%; E132C, 54%; S136C, 27%; E143C, 27%; N157C, 40%; H170C, 11%; N187C, 44%. As expected, FeBABE treatment of MotA, which lacks a cysteine residue, resulted in no conjugation. In addition, conjugation of the natural cysteine of WT MotA (Cys-182) was low (8%), and conjugated WT MotA did not result in any specific FeBABE cleavages. Consequently, we could not use Cys-182 in this analysis. Stable transcription complexes were formed by incubating PuvsX DNA (0.2 pmol, 5′-32P end-labeled as indicated on either the template or non-template strand) for 10 min at 37 °C with MotA (3.6 pmol) and AsiA-associated RNAP (24 pmol of AsiA and 1.7-pmol core with a ratio of σ70 from 1:1 to 1:2) in a 10-μl solution containing 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 35 mm NaCl, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 14% glycerol (v/v), 4 mm magnesium acetate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm DTT, 0.02 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0005% Triton X-100. (AsiA and σ70 were preincubated together first at 37 °C for 10 min to ensure formation of the AsiA/σ70 complex, and then this complex was incubated with core at 37 ° C for 10 min to form the AsiA-associated RNAP.) Unstable complexes were challenged by the addition of 0.5 μl of 1 μg/μl heparin for 1 min at 37 °C. FeBABE cleavage was performed essentially as described (23Colland F. Fujita N. Kotlarz D. Bown J.A.

TIA-1 consists of three RNA recognition motifs (RRM1–3) along with a C-terminal glutamine-rich prion-related domain (Fig. 1A).

Moreover, the C-terminal motif Trp-Gly-(Arg/Lys) is also conserved, and the β-sheet is slightly distorted (Fig. 1, B and C). Due to their common features, TIA-1/TIAR/Pub1p RRM3 domains are considered to be a new type of RRM family called TRRM (TIA-1 C-terminal domain-like RRM) (19.Aroca A. Díaz-Quintana A. Díaz-Moreno I.

The contribution of RRM3 to RNA recognition is still unclear, although its contribution to binding poly(U) sequences (16.Bauer W.J. Heath J. Jenkins J.L. Kielkopf C.L.

Given the pleiotropic role of human TIA-1 in the control of critical cellular events, understanding how RNA recognition occurs and the associated biophysical features has great relevance. This work suggests that the auxiliary role, in RNA recognition, of isolated RRM3 or RRM3 in the RRM23 context is modulated by slight environmental changes in terms of pH, as small changes in protonation/deprotonation of conserved RRM3 histidine residues induce drastic effects on TIA-1 binding to RNA. The RRM2 domain (residues 80–173), RRM3 domain (residues 190–288), and RRM23 construct (residues 80–288) were obtained by PCR from a plasmid containing full-length TIA-1 (kindly provided by Dr. P. Anderson, Harvard Medical School) and cloned into the pETM-11 vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (19.Aroca A. Díaz-Quintana A. Díaz-Moreno I.

His-tagged TIA-1 constructs were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare). The His tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site were left in the constructs because no differences in secondary structure with or without the His tag were observed (19.Aroca A.

Samples were concentrated up to 1 mm in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.0). Protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry with predicted extinction coefficients. RNA oligonucleotides (5′-AUUUA-3′ and 5′-AUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUU-3′) were chemically synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). NMR samples of TIA-1 RRM3 were prepared in 90% H2O and 10% D2O solutions of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.0) at concentrations of 0.05–1 mm. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on 800-MHz Varian INOVA and 500-MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometers. The Bruker spectrometer was equipped with CryoProbe technology. The spectra recorded in the Varian spectrometer were processed with NMRPipe software (21.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A.

The spectra recorded in the Bruker spectrometer were processed using TopSpin 3.0 and analyzed with SPARKY 3 (23.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3.

The coverage of the backbone assignment was 98%. The assigned chemical shifts were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank with accession number 18829 and were used to generate the three-dimensional protein structure at the CS23D2.0 web server (24.Wishart D.S.

RNA binding of TIA-1 RRM3 was monitored by acquiring 15N HSQC spectra during titrations of the 5′-AUUUA-3′ RNA oligonucleotide into a 25 μm sample of the 15N-labeled RRM3 domain in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mm KCl at both pH 5.5 and 7.5. The pH value of the sample was verified after each titration step. Weighted average values of 15N and 1H chemical shift perturbations (Δδavg) of each resonance were calculated as Δδavg = (((ΔδH)2 + (ΔδN/5)2)/2)1/2, where ΔδH and ΔδN are chemical shift increments of 1H and 15N, respectively. The threshold value, used to consider significant chemical shift perturbations from the titration data, was defined as the average of Δδavg values plus 2 S.D. (2Sn−1). The pH effect on RNA structure was controlled by registering one-dimensional NMR spectra on the 700-MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer at pH 5.5 and 7.5. Samples contained 50 μm 24-mer AU-rich oligonucleotide (5′-AUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUU-3′) and were resuspended in the buffer described above using either 90% H2O and 10% D2O or 100% D2O as solvent. Comparison of the spectra at different pH values (data not shown) revealed no significant changes in line width or chemical shift perturbations. Titration curves were obtained by plotting the change in chemical shift as a function of pH for all of the detectable backbone amide protons (δ 1H) and nitrogens (δ 15N) of TIA-1 RRM3. Data from 12 of 18 affected residues were fitted to a sigmoidal curve model describing a single protonation event with an associated pKa value: δ = (Ka δH + [H+] δL)/(Ka + [H+]) where δH and δL are the chemical shift values at high and low pH, respectively. Fits were obtained using Origin 8.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) by nonlinear least squares fitting on the proposed model. The pKa value was the average of two independent pH titrations with estimated errors of ±10%. The threshold value, used to identify significant perturbations when data from the titrations were analyzed together, was defined as the averaged chemical shift perturbations (Δδavg) for the system plus 2 S.D. (2Sn−1). The reported pKa values of TIA-1 RRM2 histidines were calculated as described for RRM3. 15N HSQC spectra were assigned according to the work of Kuwasako et al. (17.Kuwasako K. Takahashi M. Tochio N. Abe C. Tsuda K. Inoue M. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kobayashi N. Kigawa T. Taguchi S. Tanaka A. Hayashizaki Y. Güntert P. Muto Y. Yokoyama S.

All CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control system. RRM3, RRM23, and the RNA oligonucleotide samples were prepared in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mm KCl at both pH 5.5 and 7.5. Each spectrum was an average of 20 scans. The secondary structure analysis of RRM3 was performed by recording far-UV CD spectra (190–250 nm) of 3 μm samples at 25 °C. RNA binding was monitoring in the UV range of 240–330 nm by the addition of increasing amounts of the TIA-1 RRM23 construct to a 3 μm sample of the 24-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUU-3′). A temperature of 10 °C was chosen to optimize the signal change upon protein binding. The integral of the CD signal between 255 and 265 nm was plotted against the ratio [RRM23]/[24-mer AU-rich RNA] and fitted to a 1:1 binding site model as reported previously (25.Scheiba R.M. Aroca A. Díaz-Moreno I. HuR thermal stability is dependent on domain binding upon phosphorylation.Eur. Biophys. J. 2012; 41: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Emission spectra were recorded at 290–500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 282 nm on a PerkinElmer LS-5 fluorometer equipped with a water thermostat cell holder at 25 °C. 10 μm RRM3 samples were prepared in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer and 50 mm KCl at pH 5.5 and 7.5. The slit wavelength was 5 nm for both excitation and emission, and the path length of the cell was 1 cm. The background signal from the buffer was subtracted. pH NMR titration of TIA-1 RRM3 over a pH range of 5–8 showed remarkable chemical shift differences in superimposed 15N HSQC spectra at high and low pH values (Fig. 2). A set of signals corresponding to 18 residues changed upon increasing pH. Other residues underwent negligible chemical shift changes because they were insensitive to pH effects. A single resonance was observed for each amide over the tested pH range, suggesting that the protonation and deprotonation of side chains are fast on the NMR time scale. Different sigmoidal curves were obtained for perturbed residues with titration data (Fig. 3), but most of them could be fitted (see “Experimental Procedures”) to single pKa values for both 1H and 15N dimensions. As shown in Table 1, pKa values were in the range of 6.3–6.9.FIGURE 3Representative pKa curves indicating the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of backbone amides of TIA-1 RRM3.

The largest values for backbone amides were observed for His-266 (numbering according to the full-length TIA-1 protein) (Fig. 4A). 18 perturbed amides showed significant perturbations (Δδavg > 0.05 ppm) distributed mainly along four regions of RRM3. Two sequential stretches at the N terminus involved Asp-192 and Glu-193 on one side and the Val-210–Thr-215 stretch except for Leu-214 on the other side. The C-terminal residue stretch included Ser-250, His-253, Val-256, and Thr-262–Lys-269. Residues that overcame the threshold of 0.05 ppm in Δδavg were mapped onto the TIA-1 RRM3 backbone (Fig. 4, B and C). As was expected, the strongest effects were found for the three solvent-exposed histidines (His-248, His-253, and His-266). In fact, the His-248 chemical shift perturbation could not be determined due to signal broadening beyond the detection limit at pH 7.5, which is clear evidence of a pH-dependent change. Other residues surrounding the three histidines were also perturbed, as in the case of Thr-211, which is in close proximity to His-266. To check that the structure of RRM3 remained unaltered upon pH changes, far-UV CD spectra and fluorescence emission measurements of the single tryptophan of this domain (Trp-272) were obtained (Fig. 5). No substantial changes appear in the CD spectra, indicating that the secondary structure of RRM3 is not affected by pH. In addition, the fluorescence maximum appears at ∼330 nm at both pH values, which corresponds to a partially buried Trp-272 residue. The absence of red-shifted fluorescence (∼350 nm) shows no substantial conformational changes or protein unfolding. To assess the effect of pH on RNA recognition by the TIA-1 RRM3 domain, its interaction with a short 5-mer AU-rich RNA oligonucleotide (5′-AUUUA-3′) was studied. Because the pKa values for histidine protonation events are ∼7 (Table 1), NMR experiments were carried out at low (5.5) and high (7.5) pH values. Averaged chemical shift perturbations inferred from the titration of 15N-labeled RRM3 with 5′-AUUUA-3′ revealed not only that RRM3 bound RNA using the canonical platform, which comprises aromatic residues localized mainly at three of four strands from the β-sheet, but also that it occurred at both pH values. Due to the small calculated Δδavg, suggesting a moderate affinity of RRM3 for the tested oligonucleotide, the dissociation constant could not be obtained. However, striking differences are obvious from data comparison at the tested pH values (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 (A and B, upper) shows details of the superimposed 15N HSQC spectra during titrations for the same residue revealing chemical shift perturbations that suggest stronger binding at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5. These differences were observed for all perturbed residues. Fig. 6 (middle and lower) also shows the mapping of significantly shifted RRM3 residues (Δδavg ≥ 0.025 ppm) upon RNA binding over the backbone and surface representations, respectively. Upon pH 5.5 titration (Fig. 6A), residues undergoing the largest shifts were located at Tyr-206–Gly-208 and Lys-238–Tyr-240, along with Val-243, as part of the central β-strands (β1 and β3). In addition, the Lys-269–Lys-274 stretch from β4 was also involved in RNA recognition. Note that the resonance of Phe-242 overlapped with that corresponding to Gln-221, so the Δδavg values could not be accurately calculated, although significant line broadening was observed. Moreover, the easily assigned Nϵ of the indole ring from Trp-272 experienced large chemical shift perturbations, even though its amide signal could not be identified. The titration at pH 7.5 (Fig. 6B) showed almost the same perturbed residues of the RRM3 domain but with significant differences: Tyr-206 and Phe-242 amide resonances were neither shifted nor broadened. Indeed, the perturbation level of highly affected residues at pH 5.5 (Δδavg > 0.050) (Fig. 6A) was lower at pH 7.5 (0.025 ≤ Δδavg ≤ 0.050) (Fig. 6B), with the exception of Tyr-271, as a result of weaker binding affinity between TIA-1 and AU-rich RNA at the latter pH value. An in-depth analysis of the TIA-1 RRM3/RNA binding event (Fig. 6) revealed that aromatic residues from the β1- and β3-strands (Tyr-206, Tyr-240, and Phe-242) constituted the usual RNA-docking platform in most RRMs. In addition, Tyr-271 and Trp-272 (at least its indole amide) from the end of β4, along with the motif formed by Gly-273 and Lys-274 at the C-terminal region, were also involved in RNA interaction. Indeed, the C-terminal stretch Gly-273–Lys-274, which is well conserved among TIA-1 analogs, has been previously described to be involved in RNA recognition by the Pub1p C-terminal domain (Fig. 1C) (20.Santiveri C.M. Mirassou Y. Rico-Lastres P. Martínez-Lumbreras S. Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Pub1p C-terminal RRM domain interacts with Tif4631p through a conserved region neighbouring the Pab1p binding site.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e24481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, it also takes part in forming hydrogen bonds with RNA in the RRM-like polypyrimidine tract-binding protein family, even though the C-terminal stretch differs from that mentioned above (26.Oberstrass F.C. Auweter S.D. Erat M. Hargous Y. Henning A. Wenter P. Reymond L. Amir-Ahmady B. Pitsch S. Black D.L. Allain F.H.-T.

Allain F.H.-T. RNA recognition motifs: boring? Not quite.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Trp-272 is part of a pocket in which His-248 from α3 and Gln-197 from α1 are in close proximity (Fig. 4C). Hence, the His-248/Trp-272 interaction may pack the extra N-terminal α1-helix on the RRM3 domain (19.Aroca A. Díaz-Quintana A. Díaz-Moreno I. A structural insight into the C-terminal RNA recognition motifs of T-cell intracellular antigen-1 protein.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 2958-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20.Santiveri C.M. Mirassou Y. Rico-Lastres P. Martínez-Lumbreras S. Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Pub1p C-terminal RRM domain interacts with Tif4631p through a conserved region neighbouring the Pab1p binding site.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e24481Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Within this interaction network, protonation/deprotonation events of His-248 could hinder the anchorage of Trp-272 by disrupting cation-π contacts, thus affecting the RNA recognition platform of TIA-1 RRM3, as suggested by the intrinsic tryptophan residue fluorescence (Fig. 5). In fact, the chemical shift perturbation experienced by the Trp-272 Nϵ nucleus of the indole ring is substantially larger at acidic pH (Fig. 6). As a consequence of protonation/deprotonation of TIA-1 RRM3 histidine residues, electrostatic potential surfaces change at both pH values (Fig. 7), especially those protein regions surrounding histidines. Electrostatic potential changes around the His-248 environment can explain differences in the RNA binding affinity of TIA-1 RRM3 due to pH variations. Thus, the disruption of the RNA recognition platform can explain the lower binding of TIA-1 RRM3 at pH 7.5. The assays performed by NMR (Fig. 6) with the RRM3 domain to evaluate its interaction with RNA showed chemical shift perturbations that were too small to be used for quantitative assessment of binding affinities. To overcome this issue, an additional binding experiment was performed to quantify the pH-dependent effect and to evaluate whether the overall TIA-1 binding to RNA is significantly affected. A construct that comprises the RRM2 and RRM3 domains (RRM23) was used, which is actually the responsible unit in TIA-1/RNA recognition (15.Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. Individual RNA recognition motifs of TIA-1 and TIAR have different RNA binding specificities.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As the RRM2 domain contains two histidines (His-94 and His-96) (17.Kuwasako K. Takahashi M. Tochio N. Abe C. Tsuda K. Inoue M. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kobayashi N. Kigawa T. Taguchi S. Tanaka A. Hayashizaki Y. Güntert P. Muto Y. Yokoyama S. Solution structure of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of murine T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and its RNA recognition mode.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6437-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the pKa values of their –NH groups were first checked by NMR pH titrations (His-94 pKa ∼ 5.3 and His-96 pKa ∼ 5.4) (Fig. 8). This is in agreement with the pKa prediction of the imidazole group for the RNA-binding His-96 residue in the context of RRM23 (His-96 pKa ≈ 5.1) using the PROPKA3 server (28.Olsson M.H.M. Søndergard C.R. Rostkowski M. Jensen J.H. PROPKA3: consistent treatment of internal and surface residues in empirical pKa predictions.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2011; 7: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Similar pKa values (<5.3) were measured for –NH resonances of those RRM2 residues surrounding both His-94 and His-96. These results indicate that only the three histidines from RRM3 in RRM23 experience the protonation/deprotonation events at the two pH values (5.5 and 7.5) used in the RNA binding studies. We next assessed the affinity of TIA-1 RRM23 for the 24-mer AU-rich RNA by CD (Fig. 9). The protein bound to RNA more strongly at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5 (KD ≈ 4.4 and 58.5 nm, respectively). This demonstrates that RRM23 binding to RNA is pH-dependent and that this effect is caused mainly by the RRM3 domain because the deprotonation of RRM2 in the context of RRM23 was negligible at both pH values used in the RNA binding studies. As previous studies have described, the three domains of the TIA-1 protein contribute to RNA binding, with the RRM2 and RRM3 modules as the main recognition platforms (16.Bauer W.J. Heath J. Jenkins J.L. Kielkopf C.L. Three RNA recognition motifs participate in RNA recognition and structural organization by the pro-apoptotic factor TIA-1.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as in other RNA-binding proteins, such as the central domain units of KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) (29.Díaz-Moreno I. Hollingworth D. Kelly G. Martin S. García-Mayoral M. Briata P. Gherzi R. Ramos A. Orientation of the central domains of KSRP and its implications for the interaction with the RNA targets.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5193-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the N terminus of HuR (human antigen R) RRM modules (25.Scheiba R.M. Aroca A. Díaz-Moreno I. HuR thermal stability is dependent on domain binding upon phosphorylation.Eur. Biophys. J. 2012; 41: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whereas TIA-1 RRM2 dominates the interaction, RRM3 enhances it, playing an auxiliary role. The pH influence on exposed histidine residues of RRM3 (at positions 248, 253, and 266) in protonation/deprotonation events around pH 7 is clear. Notably, the histidine residues are highly conserved among TIA-1 homologs, and in the particular case of His-248, it has remained unchanged even in species such as Arabidopsis thaliana and S. cerevisiae during evolution (Fig. 1C). These observations are well correlated with RNA binding, which decreases at pH 7.5, leading to shortening of the RNA platform by His-248 deprotonation. It is tempting to speculate that the canonical folding of RRM3 modulates the RNA binding capability of TIA-1 according to small pH changes (around the physiological value). Even though the extra RRM3 α-helix (α1) fails in binding directly to RNA oligonucleotides, its relative orientation regarding α3 and β4 could facilitate stable RNA binding (30.Netter C. Weber G. Benecke H. Wahl M.C. Functional stabilization of an RNA recognition motif by a noncanonical N-terminal expansion.RNA. 2009; 15: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A similar effect has been recently reported for the transcription factor EGR1 (early growth response protein 1) in its binding to DNA (31.Mikles D.C. Bhat V. Schuchardt B.J. Deegan B.J. Seldeen K.L. McDonald C.B. Farooq A. pH modulates the binding of early growth response protein 1 transcription factor to DNA.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 3669-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). His-382 is well conserved and modulates protein/DNA binding, acting as a pH-dependent molecular switch. Another well studied example of molecular switches with regard to environmental pH is the hemagglutinin fusion peptide of the influenza virus (32.Doms R.W. Helenius A. White J. Membrane fusion activity of the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The low pH-induced conformational change.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2973-2981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Lorieau J.L. Louis J.M. Schwieters C.D. Bax A. pH-triggered, activated-state conformations of the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide revealed by NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 19994-19999Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is responsible for viral penetration into host cells by membrane fusion. Altogether, this pH-dependent mechanism may interfere with the overall RNA binding of TIA-1 given the auxiliary role of the RRM3 domain and the different binding affinities of RRM23 for RNA depending on the pH. Given that the pH between the cytoplasm and nucleus ranges from ∼7.2 to 7.7 (34.Seksek O. Bolard J. Nuclear pH gradient in mammalian cells revealed by laser microspectrofluorimetry.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 257-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the evaluation of the pH effect on multidomain DNA/RNA-binding proteins that act in both compartments is highly relevant. This is the case for the KH domain-containing protein vigilin, whose biological functions are poorly understood (35.Kruse C. Grünweller A. Notbohm H. Kügler S. Purschke W.G. Müller P.K. Evidence for a novel cytoplasmic tRNA-protein complex containing the KH-multidomain protein vigilin.Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36.Kruse C. Willkomm D.K.

Overall, our findings suggest that these little changes around the physiological pH in such cell compartments could control the RRM3 domain packing and, eventually, the RNA recognition by TIA-1.

In situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that cdk10 is expressed throughout development with a relative enrichment in the brain in the late stages. Similar to its mammalian ortholog, cdk10 can interact with the transcription factor ETS2 and exhibit kinase activity by phosphorylating histone H1. Morpholino-based loss of cdk10 expression caused apoptosis in sox2-positive cells and decreased the expression of subsequent neuronal markers. Acetylated tubulin staining revealed a significant reduction in the number of Rohon-Beard sensory neurons in cdk10 morphants.

A family of cdc2-related kinases, including PISSLRE (CDK10), PCTAIRE, KKIALRE (CDK-like-1; CDKL1), KKIAMRE (CDK-like-2; CDKL2), and NKIATRE (CDK-like-3; CDKL3), was recently identified based on their biochemical and genetic structures. Their names refer to their sequence, which corresponds to the cdc2 PSTAIRE motif (5.Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. A family of human cdc2-related protein kinases.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). No known cyclins are associated with cdc2-related kinases. Northern blot analyses revealed that human CDK10 is broadly expressed in normal and tumor tissues (6.Bullrich F. MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Druck T. Veronese M.L. Allen S.L. Chiorazzi N. Koff A. Heubner K. Croce C.M. Giordano A.

In vitro kinase assays also showed that CDK10 can phosphorylate histone H1 and myelin basic protein (6.Bullrich F. MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Druck T. Veronese M.L. Allen S.L. Chiorazzi N. Koff A. Heubner K. Croce C.M. Giordano A.

ETS2 is a CDK10-interacting protein identified by yeast two-hybridization screening (7.Kasten M. Giordano A. Cdk10, a Cdc2-related kinase, associates with the Ets2 transcription factor and modulates its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1832-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CDK10 is associated with the N-terminal domain of ETS2, which harbors the transactivation domain and the highly conserved point domain of ETS2. However, CDK10 is not associated with ETS1 (7.Kasten M. Giordano A. Cdk10, a Cdc2-related kinase, associates with the Ets2 transcription factor and modulates its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1832-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When CDK10 binds to ETS2, CDK10 can inhibit the transactivation activity of ETS2 (7.Kasten M. Giordano A. Cdk10, a Cdc2-related kinase, associates with the Ets2 transcription factor and modulates its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1832-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that CDK10 is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. In human U2OS cells, the abrogation of the CDK10 signal may be achieved by using a kinase-dead form of CDK10 or antisense RNA-arrested cell cycle progression at the G2/M checkpoint (8.Li S. MacLachlan T.K. De Luca A. Claudio P.P. Condorelli G. Giordano A.

CDK10 was significantly down-regulated in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of retinoblastoma cells (9.Li A. Zhu X. Brown B. Craft C.M.

Biochem. 2009; 108: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated the down-regulation of CDK10 in seminomas. CDK10 was shown to be up-regulated in follicular lymphomas compared with normal germinal center B-cells (11.Husson H. Carideo E.G. Neuberg D. Schultze J. Munoz O. Marks P.W. Donovan J.W.

CDK10 was also reportedly involved in endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer (12.Iorns E. Turner N.C. Elliott R. Syed N. Garrone O. Gasco M. Tutt A.N. Crook T. Lord C.J. Ashworth A.

Using siRNA screening, Iorns et al. (12.Iorns E. Turner N.C. Elliott R. Syed N. Garrone O. Gasco M. Tutt A.N. Crook T. Lord C.J. Ashworth A.

Zebrafish is a widely used animal model in the study of genetic and developmental biology (13.Chen E. Ekker S.C. Zebrafish as a genomics research model.Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2004; 5: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To date, the role of CDKs in zebrafish development remains poorly understood. Zebrafish cyclin H/cdk7 is ubiquitously expressed throughout all examined stages and tissues (14.Liu Q.Y. Wu Z.L. Lv W.J. Yan Y.C. Li Y.P.

Previous reports revealed that zebrafish cdk5 is ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in the brain and the eyes (15.Kanungo J. Li B.S. Zheng Y. Pant H.C. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 influences Rohon-Beard neuron survival in zebrafish.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Knockdown of zebrafish cdk5 by using siRNA decreases the number of primary sensory Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons in the trigeminal ganglia and promotes apoptosis in the brain (15.Kanungo J. Li B.S.

Meanwhile, morpholino-based knockdown of cdk5 increases the number of supernumerary motor neurons (17.Kanungo J. Zheng Y.L. Amin N.D. Kaur S. Ramchandran R. Pant H.C.

Recently, cdkl1 was reported to fulfill a function in zebrafish development. Interruption of cdkl1 expression decreases neurogenin-1 (ngn1) levels in the brain and sonic hedgehog expression in the floor plate region (18.Hsu L.S. Liang C.J. Tseng C.Y. Yeh C.W. Tsai J.N.

In the present study, we used zebrafish as an animal model to investigate the developmental role of cdk10. All of the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma or Mallinckrodt Baker. Antibodies against human CDK10, human ETS2, and GFP and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-β-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-sox2 antibody (ab97959) was purchased from Abcam. The zebrafish AB strain and transgenic Tg (huC:gfp) fish were kind gifts from the Taiwan Zebrafish Core Facility (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) and Dr. Chang-Jen Huang (Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), respectively. All of the fish were raised and maintained under standard conditions at 28.5 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle (19.Westerfield M. Doerry E. Kirkpatrick A.E. Driever W. Douglas S.A. An on-line database for zebrafish development and genetics research.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The developmental stages of the embryos were determined according to methods described previously (20.Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8706) Google Scholar). All of the animal handling protocols were approved by the Chung Shan Medical University Animal Care Committee. Images of the fluorescent signals were captured using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Total RNA was isolated from different tissues and stages in adult zebrafish using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full coding region of cdk10 was amplified by RT-PCR using zebrafish cDNA as a template and the following primer set: forward, 5′-ATGGAGAGCACAGCAGACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCATACTTTGCTCCTCTTGG-3′. The PCR was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 60 s; 72 °C, 60 s for 30 cycles. The amplified products were then ligated into a pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega) and transformed into competent cells. The pEGFP-cdk10 and pCS2-cdk10 were constructed by enzyme digestion and ligated into pEGFP-C1 and pCS2, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green fluorescent label (Thermo Scientific). Primers for zebrafish raf1a (forward, 5′-AAGACATCAGCTCCTGCACA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGACGATCACTCTTTGAGGG-3′) were used. Gene expression levels were normalized to elongation factor 1α (ef1α) (forward, 5′-TGCCTTCGTCCCAATTTCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TACCCTCCTTGCGCTCAATC-3′) and assessed using comparative CT (40 cycles) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The expression level was normalized to ef1α and calculated using the ΔΔCT method. A TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, the embryos (24 or 48 HPF) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, dehydrated by washing three times in methanol, and stored at −20 °C for at least 30 min. After rehydration, the embryos were transferred to tubes containing 100 μl of equilibration buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Next, the embryos were incubated with 100 μl of labeling solution at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with 2× SSC buffer and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the TUNEL signals were examined using an upright fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AXioskop2). Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into Neuro-2a or HEK 293 cells using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cell lysates were collected. Five hundred micrograms of total cell lysates derived from HEK 293 cells overexpressing GFP alone or the GFP-cdk10 fusion protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-GFP antibody, and a kinase assay was performed as described previously (18.Hsu L.S.

After washing three times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), the precipitates were incubated with H1 histone in kinase buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP, pH 7.0, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 10 min. After separation by electrophoresis with a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the phosphorylation status was determined by autoradiography of the dried gel. The following MOs were designed and synthesized by Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, OR): cdk10 MO (5′-GGTCTGTGTCTGCTGTGCTCTCCAT-3′), which targets the start codon (from +1 to +25); 5-mismatch (5-mis) MO (5′-GGTGTCTGTCTCCTGTCCTGTCCAT-3′) where the underlines indicate the mismatched sites; and control MO (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′), which corresponded to the human β-globin gene and was used as a negative control. MOs were dissolved in 1× Danieau solution and injected into the embryos at the one- to four-cell stage. The pCS2-cdk10 plasmid was linearized by NotI, and the mRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For the rescue experiments, morpholinos were co-injected with 11 pg of mRNA into one- to four-cell embryos. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (22.Thisse C. Thisse B. High-resolution in situ hybridization to whole-mount zebrafish embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes were generated from a pGEM-T-Easy plasmid containing the full coding sequence and partial 3′-untranslated regions of cdk10. The plasmid was linearized using NotI. The RNA was transcribed in vitro by the SP6 RNA polymerase to generate antisense probes using the DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Zebrafish embryos injected with the control MO, cdk10 MO, 5-mismatch MO, or cdk10 MO plus cdk10 mRNA were collected at 24 HPF. The total protein was extracted as described above. Thirty micrograms of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, washed with PBS buffer, and incubated with anti-human CDK10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. Next, the membranes were incubated with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and the signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore). HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP-cdk10 or pEGFP vector, and the cell lysates were collected as described above. Four hundred micrograms of proteins was subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-human ETS2 and anti-GFP antibodies. The signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore). Briefly, embryos at the indicated stages were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, and stored in methanol at −20 °C. After rehydration with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), the embryos were blocked with blocking solution (5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 1% DMSO in PBST) for 1 h and then incubated with monoclonal anti-acetylated α-tubulin at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed with PBST and incubated with goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibodies (1:500) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight in the dark. After washed with washing buffer (2% BSA and 1% DMSO in PBST), the images were captured by a scanning laser confocal microscope (Zeiss 510 META). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc.). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed Basic Local Alignment Search Tool program analysis using the human CDK10 protein sequence to study the function of cdk10 in zebrafish. A gene (NCBI Reference Sequence accession number NM_001017622) that encodes the full-length zebrafish cdk10 was identified. Zebrafish cdk10 contains 1298 base pairs; encodes a polypeptide of 360 amino acid residues; and displays 78, 77, 77, and 76% identity to human, mouse, rat, and Xenopus orthologs, respectively. The kinase domain extended from residues 48 to 300, and the conserved PISSLRE motif was localized at amino acids 81–87 (Fig. 1A). On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis, zebrafish cdk10 was closer to Xenopus cdk10 (Fig. 1B). A previous report showed that human CDK10 interacts with the transcription factor ETS2 (7.Kasten M. Giordano A. Cdk10, a Cdc2-related kinase, associates with the Ets2 transcription factor and modulates its transactivation activity.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1832-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to investigate whether cdk10 interacts with human ETS2. A strong ETS2 signal was detected in the complexes immunoprecipitated with GFP-cdk10 but not in those immunoprecipitated solely with GFP (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that cdk10 interacts with ETS2 and are similar to the results obtained with human and murine CDK10. We performed an in vitro kinase assay to confirm whether cdk10 exhibits kinase activity. The GFP-cdk10 fusion protein was overexpressed in the HEK 293 cell line and purified with an anti-GFP antibody. Histone H1 was phosphorylated by cdk10 in the presence of an isotope-labeled ATP (Fig. 2B). Similar to its mammalian ortholog, cdk10 was shown to interact with ETS2 and exhibit kinase activity during the phosphorylation of histone H1. We conducted RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the developmental expression patterns of cdk10. RT-PCR analysis showed that cdk10 was expressed in all examined zebrafish stages. Furthermore, cdk10 was predominantly expressed in the adult brain, intestine, liver, ovary, and testis. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that cdk10 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed from the two-cell to sphere stages. At 24 and 36 HPF, cdk10 expression was relatively enriched in the eye and brain regions. At 48 HPF, cdk10 was predominantly expressed in the eye, tectum, hindbrain-midbrain boundary, and telencephalon (Fig. 3, A and B). Antisense MOs that overlap with the translation start codon were designed to block the translation of the cdk10 gene and thereby explain the function of cdk10 during zebrafish development. To confirm whether cdk10 MO affects endogenous cdk10 expression, protein extracts from embryos receiving control MO, cdk10 MO, and 5-mis MO were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-human CDK10 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, 1 ng of cdk10 MO reduced the amount of cdk10 protein expression by 44%. However, no clear changes in cdk10 expression were observed in embryos that received control MO or 5-mis MO. These results indicated that cdk10 MO specifically blocks the translation of the endogenous cdk10 gene. A previous report found that the microinjection of specific MOs induces off-target effects by increasing p53 activity, resulting in cell death (23.Robu M.E. Larson J.D. Nasevicius A. Beiraghi S. Brenner C. Farber S.A. Ekker S.C. p53 activation by knockdown technologies.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e78Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). These off-target effects were avoided in this study by using specific MOs that were co-injected with 2-fold amounts of p53 MO in all MO experiments. To determine whether p53 MO contributes to the phenotype of cdk10 morphants, we injected the embryos with p53 MO alone. Indeed, no distinct phenotype was observed between the p53 morphants and the control embryos (data not shown). At 24 HPF, embryos receiving 1 ng of cdk10 MO exhibited significant developmental abnormalities such as small brain, undersized eye, and somite curvature. These embryos also lacked the isthmus region. The percentages of normal, moderate, and severe phenotypes (characterized by smaller brain size, undersized eyes, and curved somites) are presented in Fig. 4C. Developmental defects observed in cdk10 morphants as well as endogenous cdk10 protein level could be rescued by co-injection of cdk10 mRNA, demonstrating the specificity of this morpholino (Fig. 4, A and B). Dark cell masses observed in cdk10-depleted embryos indicated that these morphants underwent cell death. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a TUNEL assay to examine the embryos for apoptosis. Compared with the control MO-injected embryos, depletion of cdk10 sharply increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the dorsal neuronal regions at the three-somite stage (in the brain at 24 HPF as well as the forebrain and the midbrain regions at 48 HPF). Co-injection with cdk10 mRNA significantly reduced apoptosis (Fig. 5, A–C). These findings show the significance of cdk10 during development in zebrafish.FIGURE 5Knockdown of cdk10-induced apoptosis. A TUNEL assay was used to detect cell apoptosis in zebrafish embryos that received the indicated MO in the tail bud stage (A), at 24 HPF (B), or at 48 HPF (C). Control MO (Ctrl)-injected embryos displayed very few TUNEL-positive cells. The cdk10 MO-injected embryos that were primarily concentrated in the forebrain, midbrain, neural plate, and retina regions showed a high level of apoptosis. Apoptosis was prevented by co-injection of cdk10 mRNA. All images are shown in the lateral view with the anterior at the left (n = 10 embryos each). Scale bars, 100 μm. A, anterior; V, ventral; D, dorsal; P, posterior.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the expression of sox2 (a known neural stem cell marker) and ngn1 (a marker of differentiating neurons at the three-somite stage) to evaluate the effect of cdk10 on neural development. Depletion of cdk10 resulted in expansion and reduction of sox2 expression compared with wild-type control embryos (Fig. 6A). Loss of cdk10 reduced ngn1 expression in dorsal neuron precursor cells (Fig. 6B). At 24 HPF, morphant embryos showed a significant disruption of ngn1 expression in the forebrain and the cranial ganglia (Fig. 6C). Significant reductions in zath3 (a late proneural gene) and nes (a marker for stem cells) were observed in cdk10 morphants (Fig. 6D). In addition, wnt1 (alar plate midbrain region) expression was significantly reduced in the dorsal midline neurons of cdk10-depleted morphants at 24 HPF (Fig. 6E). We subsequently determined whether forebrain patterning events were disrupted in cdk10 mutants. The expression of emx1 (a marker involved in telencephalic patterning) was markedly reduced in cdk10 morphants (Fig. 6F). The expression of islet2 (a dorsal root ganglion marker) was significantly reduced in RB neurons, whereas motor neurons were not affected in cdk10 morphants (Fig. 6G). These findings suggest the significance of cdk10 in the formation of forebrain and midbrain as well as RB neurons. To determine the role of cdk10 during neurodevelopment, we conducted acetylated α-tubulin (AcTub) staining to determine whether disruption of cdk10 affects neuronal differentiation. At 24 HPF, AcTub staining revealed the presence of anterior commissure, postoptic commissure, supraoptic tract, nucleus of the tract of anterior commissure, dorsal-ventral diencephalic tract, epiphyseal cluster, and tract of the posterior commissure in the forebrain and the midbrain in the embryos injected with"

Binding of these cells to opsonized tumor targets elicits cytokine production, phagocytosis, and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. Here we show for the first time that activation of monocyte FcγR results in the secretion of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1/sFlt-1), which serves to antagonize VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and tumor growth. Consistent with this, using a murine solid tumor model of antibody therapy, we show that sFlt-1 is involved in restricting tumor growth. Analyzing the mechanism of induction of sFlt-1, we found that the Erk and PI3K pathways were required for transcription, and NF-κB was required for translation. Upon closer examination of the role of NF-κB, we found that a microRNA, miR181a, negatively regulates FcγR-mediated sFlt-1 production and that NF-κB serves to antagonize this microRNA.
