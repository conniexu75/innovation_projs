https://openalex.org/W1975746068,"Polygonum cascadense, a small, apparently self-incompatible, annual plant, is regularly cross-pollinated by the ant Formica argentea. Comparison of other purported ant-pollinated plants with traits favoring such pollination suggests that some, but not all, may be ant pollinated. Ant-pollination interactions are characterized by low expenditure of energy by both ant and plant."
https://openalex.org/W2063737405,"Residuals for P-wave traveltimes at a seismnograph station near Bear Valley, California, for small, precisely located local earthquakes at distances of 20 to 70 kilometers show a sharp increase of nearly 0.3 second about 2 months before a magnitude 5.0 earthquake that occurred within a few kilometers of the station. This indicates that velocity changes observed elsewhere premonitory to earthquakes, possibly related to dilatancy, occur along the central section of the San Andreas fault system."
https://openalex.org/W1971945302,"Reexamination of geodetic data has shown that aseismic slip occurred on or near the San Andreas fault in the period of about 20 years after 1906. The inferred displacements are comparable to but at greater depths than the sudden slip that occurred at the time of the earthquake. The postseismic slip is constrained only between late 1906 and 1925, and data are insufficient to determine the movements, if any, below about 20 kilometers on the fault. Two independent observations also indicate substantial anomalous crustal deformation away from the fault at least 30 years before the earthquake."

https://openalex.org/W2039458952,The problem of delineating cultural refuse sites (dumps) arises in civil engineering studies. Induced polarization measurements have been successfully applied in several cases. Laboratory tests on synthetic samples indicate that the effect is due to the metal content of the dumps. The method may be applicable to archeological investigations.
https://openalex.org/W2057080264,"Focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes in the central United States suggest that local stress fields are important in determining the type and orientation of faulting. The implied stress system is considerably more complicated than that which would be produced by east-west trending compressive stresses, as previously suggested for this region."
