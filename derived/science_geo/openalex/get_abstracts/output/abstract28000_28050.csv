https://openalex.org/W1528708838,"Relaxin is believed to play a role in connective tissue remodeling during pregnancy (Bell, R.J., Eddie, L. W., Lester, A. R., Wood, E. C., Johnston, P.D., and Niall, H. D. (1987) Obstet. Gynecol. 69, 585-589; MacLennan, A. H. (1983) Clin. Reprod. Fertil. 2, 77-95). In the present study, normal human fibroblasts exposed to concentrations of a synthetic bioactive relaxin peptide from 0.1 to 10 ng/ml synthesized and secreted the metalloproteinase procollagenase, which was immunoprecipitable as a doublet of 52 and 57 kDa by a monoclonal antibody to human collagenase. The stimulation in procollagenase protein expression was reflected in an elevation in procollagenase mRNA levels. Media conditioned for 48 h by relaxin-treated fibroblasts (0.1 ng/ml) contained 1.7 units/ml activatable collagenase compared with 0.2 units/ml by untreated fibroblasts. In addition, relaxin caused a modest decrease in the levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, as detected by reverse zymography and Northern analysis. Relaxin was also a potent modulator of the collagen secretory phenotype of these fibroblasts. Relaxin at 100 ng/ml down-regulated collagen secretion by 40%. When fibroblasts were treated simultaneously with cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta or interleukin 1 beta, which stimulated collagen synthesis to at least 9-fold of basal levels, relaxin at 100 ng/ml was able to down-regulate collagen expression by up to 88%. This decrease was reflected by changes at the mRNA level. These results indicate that relaxin can cause significant collagen turnover both by stimulating collagenase expression and by down-modulating collagen synthesis and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1565592850,"We have quantitated in adult and developing rat tissues the molar concentrations of c-erbA alpha 1- and beta 1-mRNAs, which code for nuclear T3-binding proteins, and c-erbA alpha 2-mRNA, which is generated by alternate splicing of the alpha gene transcript and codes for a receptor variant that does not bind T3. Comparison of the concentrations of c-erbA alpha 1-mRNA, beta 1-mRNA, or their sum to the T3 nuclear binding capacity per mg of DNA in adult liver, kidney, heart, cerebrum, and cerebellum and during the ontogeny of liver and brain shows that the T3 binding capacity/c-erbA mRNA ratio is tissue-specific and related to developmental state. Administration of T3 resulted in a 40-50% fall in the alpha 1 signal of adult liver, kidney, and heart without changing either the beta 1 signal or T3 binding capacity. A 40-fold increase in rat brain beta 1-mRNA occurred in the transition between the 19-day gestational fetus and the 10-day-old neonate. This corresponds to the period during which the T3 content rises in brain and during which T3 is known to influence central nervous system development. Our findings indicate that important translational or post-translational factors influence nuclear binding capacity and raise the possibility that c-erbA beta 1 may play a primary role in mediating T3 effects in developing and adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W1558212310,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) binds to a specific receptor on various cell types, the bound molecule retaining its enzymatic activity against plasminogen. We have now investigated whether receptor-bound uPA also retains the ability to react with and be inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2). uPA bound to its receptor on human U937 monocyte-like cells was inhibited by PAI-1 (in its active form in the presence of vitronectin fragments) with an association rate constant of 4.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, which was 40% lower than that obtained for uPA in solution (7.9 x 10(6) M-1 s-1). The inhibition of uPA by PAI-2 was decreased to a similar extent by receptor binding, falling from 5.3 x 10(5) to 3.3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. Stimulation of U937 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was accompanied by a further reduction in receptor-bound uPA inhibition by PAI-1 and PAI-2 to 1.7 x 10(6) and 1.1 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, respectively. These constants although lower than those for uPA in solution still represent rather rapid inhibition of the enzyme, and demonstrate that uPA bound to its specific cellular receptor remains available for efficient inhibition by PAI's, which may therefore play a major role in controlling cell-surface plasminogen activation and extracellular proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1563280839,"In the cultured human hepatoma HepG2, Ca2+ ionophores block secretion of different secretary proteins to different extents, alpha 1-antitrypsin secretion being more sensitive to A23187 and ionomycin than is alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and albumin secretion the least of the three proteins studied. As judged by subcellular fractionation experiments and by treatment of pulse chase labeled protein with endoglycosidase H, A23187 and ionomycin cause newly made secretory proteins to remain within the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Experiments in which A23187 is added at different times during a pulse or chase show that secretion of newly made alpha 1-antitrypsin becomes resistant to the ionophore, on average, 15 min after synthesis; this is about 20 min before it reaches the trans-Golgi, and while it is still within the rough ER. We speculate that a high concentration of Ca2+ within the ER may be essential for certain secretory proteins to fold properly, that folding is inhibited when ER Ca2+ levels are lowered by ionophore treatment, and that unfolded proteins, particularly alpha 1-antitrypsin, cannot exit the rough ER. Treatment of murine 3T3 fibroblasts or human hepatoma HepG2 cells with the Ca2+ ionophores A23187 or ionomycin also induces a severalfold accumulation of the ER lumenal protein Bip (Grp78). These findings disagree with a recent report that Ca2+ ionophores cause secretion of Bip and other resident ER proteins, but is consistent with other reports that A23187 causes accumulation of mRNAs for Bip and other ER lumenal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1554714271,"Dopaminergic D2 receptors are widely regarded as typical inhibitory receptors, as they both inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by activating K+ channels. A D2 receptor has recently been cloned (Bunzow, J. R., Van Tol, H. H. M., Grandy, D. K., Albert, P., Salon, J., Christie, M. D., Machida, C. A., Neve, K. A., and Civelli, O. (1988) Nature 336, 783-787) and expressed in two different cell lines, pituitary GH4C1 cells and Ltk- fibroblasts, where it has been shown to induce inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have investigated the additional effector systems coupled to this receptor. The responses observed in the two cells lines, which express similar levels of receptors (0.5-1 x 10(5)/cell), were surprisingly different. In GH4C1 cells D2 receptors failed to affect phosphoinositide hydrolysis and induced a decrease of [Ca2+]i. This latter effect appears to be mediated by hyperpolarization, most likely due to the activation of K+ channels. In striking contrast, in Ltk- fibroblasts the D2 receptor induced a rapid stimulation of inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (+73% at 15 s) followed by the other inositol phosphates, and an immediate increase of [Ca2+]i due to both Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores and influx from the extracellular medium. In both GH4C1 and Ltk- cells, the D2 receptor response was mediated by G protein(s) sensitive to pertussis toxin. The increases of inositol trisphosphate and [Ca2+]i observed in Ltk- cells required dopamine concentrations only slightly higher than those inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (EG50 = 25, 29, and 11 nM, respectively) and were comparable in magnitude to the responses induced by the endogenous stimulatory receptor agonists, thrombin and ATP. The results demonstrate that in certain cells D2 receptors are efficiently coupled to the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The nature of receptor responses appears therefore to depend on the specific properties not only of the receptor molecule but also of the cell type in which it is expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1637808652,"A set of cAMP analogs were synthesized that combined exocyclic sulfur substitutions in the equatorial (Rp) or the axial (Sp) position of the cyclophosphate ring with modifications in the adenine base of cAMP. The potency of these compounds to inhibit the binding of [3H]cAMP to sites A and B from type I (rabbit skeletal muscle) and type II (bovine myocardium) cAMP-dependent protein kinase was determined quantitatively. On the average, the Sp isomers had a 5-fold lower affinity for site A and a 30-fold lower affinity for site B of isozyme I than their cyclophosphate homolog. The mean reduction in affinities for the equivalent sites of isozyme II were 20- and 4-fold, respectively. The Rp isomers showed a decrease in affinity of approximately 400-fold and 200-fold for site A and B, respectively, of isozyme I, against 200-fold and 45-fold for site A and B of isozyme II. The Sp substitutions therefore increased the relative preference for site A of isozyme I and site B of isozyme II. The Rp substitution, on the other hand, increased the relative preference for site B of both isozymes. These data show that the Rp and Sp substitutions are tolerated differently by the two intrachain sites of isozymes I and II. They also support the hypothesis that it is the axial, and not the previously proposed equatorial oxygen that contributes the negative charge for the ionic interaction with an invariant arginine in all four binding sites. In addition, they demonstrate that combined modifications in the adenine ring and the cyclic phosphate ring of cAMP can enhance the ability to discriminate between site A and B of one isozyme as well as to discriminate between isozyme I and II. Since Rp analogs of cAMP are known to inhibit activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, the findings of the present study have implications for the synthesis of analogs having a very high selectivity for isozyme I or II."
https://openalex.org/W1517863220,"The beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) contains significant amounts of N-linked carbohydrate. Deletion mutants spanning the four consensus glycosylation sites on the receptor and single amino acid substitutions within the two amino-terminal consensus glycosylation sites reveal that both the amino-terminal sites are utilized. None of the glycosylation-defective beta AR mutants exhibited altered ligand binding in transient expression assays. In addition, the mutant beta ARs which were completely devoid of carbohydrate were capable of coupling to Gs and stimulating adenylyl cyclase in stable L cell lines. In contrast to the wild-type beta AR, the glycosylation-deficient beta ARs expressed in these cells showed a 50% decrease in the level of accumulation on the cell surface. Therefore, while glycosylation of the beta AR does not appear to be essential for receptor function, it is important for correct trafficking of the beta AR protein through the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1505515840,"It is now well established that autophosphorylation of a threonine residue located next to each calmodulin-binding domain in the subunits of type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase causes the kinase to remain active, although at a reduced rate, after Ca2+ is removed from the reaction. This autophosphorylated form of the kinase is still sensitive to Ca2+/calmodulin, which is required for a maximum catalytic rate. After removal of Ca2+, new sites are autophosphorylated by the partially active kinase. Autophosphorylation of these sites abolishes sensitivity of the kinase to Ca2+/calmodulin (Hashimoto, Y., Schworer, C. M., Colbran, R. J., and Soderling, T. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8051-8055). We have identified two pairs of homologous residues, Thr305 and Ser314 in the alpha subunit and Thr306 and Ser315 in the beta subunit, that are autophosphorylated only after removal of Ca2+ from an autophosphorylation reaction. The sites were identified by direct sequencing of labeled tryptic phosphopeptides isolated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Thr305-306 is rapidly dephosphorylated by purified protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, whereas Ser314-315 is resistant to dephosphorylation. We have shown by selective dephosphorylation that the presence of phosphate on Thr305-306 blocks sensitivity of the kinase to Ca2+/calmodulin. In contrast, the presence of phosphate on Ser314-315 is associated with an increase in the Kact for Ca2+/calmodulin of only about 2-fold, producing a relatively small decrease in sensitivity to Ca2+/calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1635983242,"The response of rat aortic smooth muscle cells to all three isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was studied. 5,000 binding sites/cell were estimated for rPDGF-AA (Kd 0.22 nM), 45,000 for rPDGF-AB and (Kd 0.4 nM), and 31,000 for rPDGF-BB (Kd 0.29 nM). rPDGF-AB and -BB stimulated effectively [3H]thymidine incorporation, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release, diacylglycerol productions, [Ca2+]i increase, and pHi changes at concentration in the range from 3 to 10 ng/ml. The extent of DNA synthesis stimulated by rPDGF-AA varied considerably, and in all cases higher concentrations than 10 ng/ml were required. rPDGF-AA did not stimulate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate release, [Ca2+]i increase or pHi changes but induced the production of diacylglycerol, although with a different kinetic compared with that observed with rPDGF-AB or -BB. Apparently rPDGF-AA acts via a different mechanism, generating diacylglycerol without the release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1558751029,"The reconstitution of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from the copper-free protein by the Cu(I).GSH complex was monitored by: (a) EPR and optical spectroscopy upon reoxidation of the enzyme-bound copper; (b) NMR spectroscopy following the broadening of the resonances of the Cu(I).GSH complex after addition of Cu-free,Zn-superoxide dismutase; and (c) NMR spectroscopy of the Cu-free,Co(II) enzyme following the appearance of the isotropically shifted resonances of the Cu(I), Co enzyme, Cu(I).GSH was found to be a very stable complex in the presence of oxygen and a more efficient copper donor to the copper-free enzyme than other low molecular weight Cu(II) complexes. In particular, 100% reconstitution was obtained with stoichiometric copper at any GSH:copper ratio between 2 and 500. Evidence was obtained for the occurrence of a Cu(I).GSH.protein intermediate in the reconstitution process. In view of the inability of copper-thionein to reconstitute Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase and of the detection of copper.GSH complexes in copper-over-loaded hepatoma cells (Freedman, J.H., Ciriolo, M.R., and Peisach, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5598-5605), Cu(I).GSH is proposed as a likely candidate for copper donation to Cu-free,Zn-superoxide dismutase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1527999680,"Two synthetic peptides containing the previously identified calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) (residues 296-309, Payne, M. E., Fong, Y.-L., Ono, T., Colbran, R. J., Kemp, B. E., Soderling, T. R., and Means, A. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7190-7195) were phosphorylated by Ca2+/CaM-independent forms of the kinase. In the presence of EGTA, CaMK-(290-309) was phosphorylated exclusively on threonine residues (Km = 13 microM; Vmax = 211 nmol/min/mg). When the phosphorylated product was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) two radioactive peaks were resolved. The first peak contained CaMK-(290-309) phosphorylated on Thr306, whereas the second peak contained CaMK-(290-309) phosphorylated on Thr305. However, under the same conditions CaMK-(294-319) was phosphorylated predominantly (approximately 70%) on serine residues (Km = 23 microM; Vmax = 99 nmol/min/mg) and HPLC analysis revealed a single major radioactive peak predominantly (more than 90%) phosphorylated at Ser314. Phosphorylation of both peptides was completely blocked in the presence of Ca2+ and a stoichiometric amount of CaM. Samples of each phosphorylated peptide were tested for CaM-binding ability by two procedures and compared to the nonphosphorylated peptides. Phosphorylation of either Thr305 or Thr306 greatly reduced the interaction between CaMK-(290-309) and CaM, whereas phosphorylation of Ser314 did not affect the ability of CaMK-(294-319) to bind CaM. These results indicate that Thr305 and/or Thr306 may be the Ca2+/CaM-independent autophosphorylation site(s) responsible for the loss of ability of CaM-kinase II to bind and be activated by Ca2+/CaM (Hashimoto, Y., Schworer, C. M., Colbran, R. J., and Soderling, T. R., J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8051-8055)."
https://openalex.org/W1521898800,"The connective tissue stroma of malignant tumors is a newly formed tissue that supports the growth and progression of neoplastic cells. Proteoglycans are intrinsic components of this complex structure and molecular changes in this class of macromolecules can significantly affect behavioral properties of transformed cells. We report that human colon carcinoma contained increased levels of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that exhibited an altered glycosaminoglycan structure in which 0- and 6-sulfated units, as detected by specific monoclonal antibodies, predominated. Proteoglycans with such epitopes were localized primarily to the connective tissue stroma surrounding the tumor cells but not to the tumor cells themselves or the native, non-cancerous connective tissue. Analysis of mRNA encoding PG-40, the main chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of colon tissue, revealed a 7-fold increase in the two transcripts encoding this gene product. This increase was evident whether the data were normalized to total RNA content or beta-actin mRNA levels. The altered steady state levels of PG-40 mRNA did not correlate with any significant gene amplification or rearrangement of PG-40 in human colon cancer. However, when genomic DNA was tested for degree of methylation, the colon carcinoma tissue showed a marked hypomethylation of PG-40 gene locus, a finding that has been associated with increased gene activation. Interestingly, PG-40 gene was also hypomethylated in cultured colon fibroblasts, which express PG-40, but not in colon carcinoma cells which do not express this gene. These results indicate that specific proteoglycan changes occur in colon carcinoma and that these alterations are the product of stromal cells that are topologically associated with and functionally respondent to the growing malignant cells. This is the first evidence that enhanced PG-40 expression in a human malignant tissue is associated with a hypomethylated gene and suggests that the control of PG-40 gene expression may represent an important factor in the progression of colon carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2090904351,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous pathogen responsible for considerable morbidity in the general population. The results presented herein establish the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor as a means of entry of HSV-1 into vertebrate cells. Inhibitors of basic FGF binding to its receptor and competitive polypeptide antagonists of basic FGF prevented HSV-1 uptake. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that do not express FGF receptors are resistant to HSV-1 entry; however, HSV-1 uptake is dramatically increased in CHO cells transfected with a complementary DNA encoding a basic FGF receptor. The distribution of this integral membrane protein in vivo may explain the tissue and cell tropism of HSV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1557907146,"Pulse-chase studies combined with subcellular fractionation indicated that LpB 100 (i.e. the apoprotein B (apoB) 100 containing lipoproteins) was released to the lumen of the secretory pathway in a subcellular fraction enriched in smooth vesicles, and referred to as SMF (the smooth membrane fraction). The migration of SMF during gradient ultracentrifugation as well as kinetic studies indicated that the fraction was derived from a pre-Golgi compartment, probably the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Only small amounts of LpB 100 could be detected during these pulse-chase experiments in the subcellular fractions derived from the rough endoplasmatic reticulum (RER). SMF contained the major amount of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity present in the ER, while the major amount of membrane bound apoB 100 was present in the RER. Pulse-chase studies of the intracellular transfer of apoB 100 demonstrated the formation of a large membrane-bound preassembly pool in the ER, while no significant amount of apoB 100 radioactivity was present in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus. The maximal radioactivity of LpB 100, recovered from the ER or the Golgi lumen, was small compared with the radioactivity recovered from the ER membrane, indicating that the assembled LpB 100 rapidly leaves the cells. This in turn indicates that the rate-limiting step in the secretion of apoB 100 was the transfer of the protein from the ER membrane to the LpB 100 in the lumen. A portion of the intracellular pool of apoB 100 was not secreted but underwent posttranslational degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1551046306,"We have mapped the promoter elements required for hepatic and intestinal transcription of the human apoCIII gene by deletion, nucleotide substitution, and DNase I footprinting analyses of the promoter region (nucleotides -1411 to +24). Deletion of the region -1020 to -871 increased 2-fold intestinal transcription without affecting hepatic transcription. Deletion of the region -890 to -686 decreased hepatic and intestinal transcription 34- and 13-fold respectively. Internal deletions of the -686 to -553 region increased intestinal transcription 2-fold and decreased hepatic transcription 9-fold. Finally, internal deletions in the region -408 to -163 decreased hepatic transcription 2- to 4-fold without affecting the intestinal transcription. Footprinting analysis using rat liver nuclear extracts identified 10 protected regions as follows: A, -32 to -25; B, -87 to -72; C, -138 to -119; D, -160 to -142; E, -414 to -403; F, -611 to -592; G, -669 to -648; H, -705 to -690; I, -766 to -726; and J, -792 to -779. The findings indicate that the region -890 to -686 is recognized by nuclear factors which promote both intestinal and hepatic transcription, whereas the region -686 to -553 is recognized by factors which promote only hepatic transcription. DNA binding and methylation interference assays indicated that the region -86 to -74 is recognized by two mutually exclusive nuclear factors with overlapping domains. One factor (CIIIB1) is unique to apoCIII and the other (CIIIB2) recognizes the regulatory elements of other apolipoprotein promoters. Binding of factor CIIIB2 is associated with normal transcription. In contrast, binding of factor CIIIB1 is associated with reduced transcription indicating that this factor may act as a modulator of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2042178762,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by abnormal regulation of epithelial cell chloride channels. Nonepithelial cells, including lymphocytes and fibroblasts, may exhibit a similar defect. Two independent techniques were used to assess the macroscopic chloride permeability (PCl) of freshly isolated B lymphocytes and of B and T lymphocyte cell lines. Values for PCl increased specifically during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and could be further enhanced by increasing intracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) or calcium. In lymphocytes from CF patients, regulation of PCl during the cell cycle and by second messengers was absent. Characterization of the cell cycle-dependent expression of the chloride permeability defect in lymphocytes from CF patients increases the utility of these cells in the analysis of the functional consequences of mutations in the CF gene."
https://openalex.org/W1537896612,"The alpha-MHC gene is under positive regulation by 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), however, the mechanism by which T3 modulates its transcription is not clearly understood. We have used an avidin-biotin complex DNA binding assay and footprint analysis employing dimethyl sulfate interference and hydroxyl radical protection to characterize the interaction of T3 receptors with target sequences located in the 5'-flanking region of the human alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. The results indicate that liver T3 receptors and in vitro transcribed-translated beta c-erbA bind with high affinity to a site (TRE1) located at positions -138/-158 base pairs upstream from the CAP site. The Kd of TRE1 for nuclear liver T3 receptors (0.82 nM) was less than that determined for the rat growth hormone gene (1.78 nM). An additional site (TRE2) located at positions -111/-129 was found which bound T3 receptors with considerably lower affinity (Kd = 23 nM). Methylation interference experiments demonstrated that T3 receptors interact with guanines, in TRE1 on the sense and antisense strands, within two octameric imperfect direct repeats (underlined) 5'-TCTGGAGGTGACAG-GAGGACA-3' (antisense strand sequence) containing the consensus sequence 5'-C(T/A)GGAGG(T/A)-3'. By contrast, methylation interference and hydroxyl radical footprinting demonstrate that the T3 binding element of TRE2 is not structurally similar to TRE1 except for a purine-rich octameric cluster (underlined, 5'-ATCAAAGGAGGAGGAGCCA-3') containing six guanines on the sense strand. These results suggest that differences in nucleotide sequences involved in T3 receptor-DNA complex formation determine the binding affinities of TRE1 and TRE2."
https://openalex.org/W1517928538,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is an inhibitor of skeletal muscle myoblast differentiation. Myoblast differentiation is dependent on the expression of certain myogenic differentiation genes and is affected by cell interaction with the extracellular matrix. We have searched for events in the differentiation process of L6E9 rat myoblasts that may be involved in the inhibitory action of TGF-beta 1. Elevated expression of the myogenic differentiation gene, myogenin, which is thought to play a central role in the differentiation process, occurs 10 h after the shift of L6E9 myoblasts to differentiation medium. Elevation of myogenin mRNA is blocked by TGF-beta 1 added at the time of the shift. This effect is preceded by, and might be related to, a rapid up-regulation of junB mRNA observed in TGF-beta 1-treated L6E9 myoblasts. However, TGF-beta 1 can also block myogenic differentiation in cells transfected with the myogenin gene under the control of a constitutive SV40 viral promoter. The nature of a mechanism that could mediate the inhibitory action of TGF-beta 1 without blocking myogenin mRNA expression is suggested by the observations that (a) TGF-beta 1 upregulates type I collagen expression and deposition in L6E9 myoblasts, (b) a fibrillar type I collagen layer inhibits L6E9 myoblast differentiation, and (c) inhibition of L6E9 myoblast differentiation by a type I collagen layer occurs without a block in myogenin expression. Thus, the data suggest that inhibition of L6E9 myoblast differentiation by TGF-beta 1 may be accomplished by at least two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism leads to a block in the expression of myogenin whereas the other mechanism may involve TGF-beta 1-induced changes in cell adhesion that either block the action of myogenic differentiation gene products or prevent the function of other as yet unknown components of the myogenic differentiation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1607064730,"New indicators for fluorescent measurement of Na+ and K+ ions should prove particularly useful for studies of reconstituted carriers of these ions. We show that PBFI, a K(+)-specific probe, provides a convenient and sensitive assay for the study of K+ uptake mediated by the reconstituted mitochondrial K+/H+ (Na+/H+) antiporter. Fluorescent measurements have enabled us for the first time to establish reconstitution of the K+/H+ (Na+/H+) antiporter from beef heart as well as from rat liver mitochondria. This technique has also enabled us to establish that dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is capable of complete inhibition of K+/H+ antiport in the reconstituted system, in accord with findings in intact mitochondria. PBFI fluorescence, which measures net K+ uptake, was essential for this corroboration, since dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is not capable of complete inhibition of 42K+/K+ or 86Rb+/Rb+ exchange, presumably because it acts selectively on proton transport within the carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1498552253,"By utilizing chimeric genes constructed from 5'-flanking sequences of the human CYP21B (P-450C21) gene and reporter genes (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or rabbit beta-globin), a 34-nucleotide sequence has been found to be required for cAMP-dependent transcription. This sequence (-129/-96 base pairs) shows no homology to that of the consensus (CRE) cAMP-regulatory element. Gel retardation analysis shows that a protein-DNA complex is formed between this DNA sequence and nuclear proteins from mouse adrenal Y1 tumor cells or bovine adrenal cortical cells or human fetal adrenal tissue and that formation of this complex cannot be competed by DNA containing the consensus CRE sequence. Even though cAMP-enhanced accumulation of P-450C21 mRNA in primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, reporter gene transcription enhanced by the cAMP-responsive -129/-96-base pair fragment of the human CYP21B gene is not. We conclude that cAMP-dependent transcription of the human P-450C21 gene (CYP21B), an event required for maintenance of optimal steroidogenic capacity in the adrenal cortex, involves a stable transcription factor(s) distinct from the CRE-binding protein. Furthermore the cAMP-dependent cis-regulatory element of the human P-450C21 gene is distinct from those found associated with the other steroid hydroxylase genes, 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450, and 11 beta-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450, suggesting that each of these genes may require its own set of specific transcription factors for cAMP-dependent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1492998658,"The Ca2(+)-mobilizing second messenger D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) is converted to the putative messenger D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate by Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. We found that cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C phosphorylate, and thereby modulate, the activity of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. cAMP-dependent kinase introduced a stoichiometric amount of phosphate at serine 109 of the 53-kDa polypeptide and caused a 1.8-fold increase in Vmax, whereas the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation reduced the Vmax to one-fourth of that of the unphosphorylated enzyme. Upon prolonged incubation, protein kinase C introduced phosphate at multiple sites in Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, and the resulting inactivation of the enzyme appeared to be well-correlated with the simultaneous phosphorylation of two major sites, serine 109 and serine 175. The Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 was not affected significantly after phosphorylation by either protein kinase. We propose, therefore, that the phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase by cAMP-dependent kinase and protein kinase C constitutes mechanisms of cross-talk between cellular signaling pathways that use various second messengers such as inositol phosphates, diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and cAMP."

In the spectrum recorded at 10 microseconds subsequent to carbon monoxide photolysis, a mode is observed at 572 cm-1 that shifts to 548 cm-1 when the experiment is repeated with 18O2. The appearance of this mode is dependent upon the laser intensity used and disappears at higher incident energies. The high frequency data in conjunction with the mid-frequency data allow us to assign the 572 cm-1 mode to the Fe-O stretching vibration of the low-spin O2 adduct that forms in the mixed valence cytochrome oxidase/dioxygen reaction. The 572 cm-1 v(Fe2(+)-O2) frequency in the mixed valence enzyme/O2 adduct is essentially identical to the 571 cm-1 frequency we measured for this mode during the reduction of O2 by the fully reduced enzyme (Varotsis, C., Woodruff, W. H., and Babcock, G. T. (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 6439-6440; Varotsis, C., Woodruff, W. H., and Babcock, G. T. (1990) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112, 1297), which indicates that the O2-bound cytochrome a3 site is independent of the redox state of the cytochrome a/CuA pair. The photolabile oxy intermediate is replaced by photostable low- or intermediate-spin cytochrome a3+(3), with t1/2 congruent to 200 microseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1521716941,"The membrane topology of subunit alpha from the Escherichia coli F1F0-ATP synthase was studied using a gene fusion technique. Fusion proteins linking different amino-terminal fragments of the alpha subunit with an enzymatically active fragment of alkaline phosphatase were constructed by both random transposition of TnphoA and site-directed mutagenesis. Those proteins with high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity are predicted to define periplasmic domains of alpha, and this was confirmed by testing for cell growth in minimal medium supplemented with polyphosphate (P greater than 75) as the sole source of phosphate. The enzymatic activity of some fusion proteins was shown to be sensitive to glucose present in the growth medium. Results from subcellular fractionation experiments suggest that these fusion proteins may be inactive even though they have a periplasmic alkaline phosphatase. The enzymatic activity appears dependent upon proteolytic release of the alkaline phosphatase moiety from its alpha subunit membrane anchor and suggests the target of glucose repression may be a protease present in the periplasm. For the topological analysis of the alpha subunit, a total of 28 unique fusion proteins were studied and the results were consistent with a model of alpha containing eight transmembrane segments, including periplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. Surprisingly, separate periplasmic domains were identified near amino acids 200, 233, and 270. These results suggest the flanking membrane spans are only 10-15 amino acids in length and not able to span a standard 30 A bilayer in an alpha-helical conformation. These short spans may have interesting mechanistic implications for the function of F0, because they contain several amino acids which appear critical for proton translocation. Finally, a fusion of alkaline phosphatase at amino acid 271, the carboxyl-terminal residue, but not at amino acid 260, was able to complement the strain RH305 (uncB-) for growth on succinate and suggests the last 11 amino acids of the alpha subunit are critical to the function of F1F0-ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1591735733,"Heparin and related polyanions are a new class of compounds interacting with 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels in a tissue-specific manner. Labeling of membrane-bound Ca2+ channels in rabbit skeletal muscle transverse tubules at the phenylalkylamine, benzothiazepine, and 1,4-dihydropyridine-selective domains was inhibited reversibly by a noncompetitive mechanism as shown by equilibrium saturation analysis and kinetic studies. (+)-cis-diltiazem but not (-)-cis-diltiazem reduced the inhibitory potency of heparin for 1,4-dihydropyridines. Antagonistic but not agonistic 1,4-dihydropyridines reversed heparin inhibition at the benzothiazepine site. Heparin forms a tight complex with the purified Ca2+ channel which is highly sensitive with respect to heparin inhibition (IC50 value: 0.05 microgram/ml) of 1,4-dihydropyridine binding. Reconstituted channel complexes have completely lost 1,4-dihydropyridine binding-inhibition by heparin and are not retained by lectin or heparin affinity columns. In whole cell patch clamp experiments with guinea-pig cardiac myocytes heparin increased the current through L-type Ca2+ channels when applied extracellulary. Synthetic peptides (representing putative heparin binding domains) which were derived from the rabbit skeletal muscle alpha 1-subunit reversed the inhibitory effects of heparin on 1,4-dihydropyridine receptors. Reversal for a peptide representing an extracellular domain occurred by an apparently competitive mechanism. It is suggested that heparin and related polyanions may interact with an evolutionary conserved cluster of basic amino acids in the large putative extracellular domain connecting the fifth and sixth putative transmembrane segment in the first motif of the ionic pore-forming alpha 1-subunit from skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1495970501,"A 74-kDa protein (adseverin) derived from adrenal medulla severs actin filaments and nucleates actin polymerization in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner but does not form an EGTA-resistant complex with actin monomers, which is different from the gelsolin-actin interaction. The dissociation of gelsolin-actin complexes by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the inhibitory effect on actin filament severing by gelsolin was recently reported. This study shows that the activity of adseverin is inhibited not only by PIP2 but also by some common phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) showed no effect. The addition of PC or PE to PI diminished the inhibitory effect of PI. Triton X-100 and neomycin were also found effective in suppressing the effect of PI, suggesting that the arrangement of polar head groups is important in exerting the inhibitory effect. Ca2(+)-dependent binding of adseverin to PS liposomes but not to PC or PE liposomes was observed by a centrifugation assay."
https://openalex.org/W1568827882,"Phorbol esters and 1,2-diacylglycerols have been used interchangeably to study protein kinase C action. This laboratory first suggested that 1,2-diacylglycerols may also act independent of protein kinase C using protein kinase C-down-modulated cells (Kolesnick, R. N., and Paley, A. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9204-9210). Unfortunately, down-modulation was never complete. The present studies establish an in vitro system of enzyme translocation to resolve this issue. Choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15), the regulatory enzyme for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, was utilized. Cytidylyltransferase translocation from cytosol to membranes mediates phorbol ester-induced phosphatidylcholine synthesis in GH3 pituitary cells. In the present studies, 1,2-diacylglycerols similarly induced phosphatidylcholine synthesis and cytidylyltransferase translocation. 1,2-Diacylglycerol-induced phosphatidylcholine synthesis, however, was not concentration-dependent but proportional to the moles of 1,2-diacylglycerol added per cell, i.e. subject to surface dilution. For instance, at constant cell number (1.67 x 10(6)/sample) and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol concentration (diC8; 20 micrograms/ml), 32Pi incorporation into phosphatidylcholine varied from 150 to 350% above control as the incubation volume increased from 0.3 to 1.2 ml. Hence, the effective diC8 concentrations 0.5-30 micrograms/ml are preferably referred to as doses and reported as 0.25-15 nmol/10(6) cells. These doses increased cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol levels within a few fold of basal (374 pmol/10(6) cells). In vitro, diC8 also induced translocation of purified cytidylyltransferase devoid of protein kinase C to microsomes. Translocation was again subject to surface dilution. Translocation occurred with the same ratio of diC8 to microsomal membrane as phosphatidylcholine synthesis in intact cells (1-10 nmol of diC8/10(6) cell membranes). Despite stimulating cytidylyltransferase translocation in intact cells, phorbol esters failed to stimulate translocation in vitro. Hence, 1,2-diacylglycerols are not always interchangeable with phorbol esters and at physiologic levels may stimulate enzyme translocation by an alternative mechanism to protein kinase C."

We have prepared transcriptionally active nuclear extracts from normal and hypoxia-induced Hep3B cells and shown that the hypoxic extracts produce a consistent increase in the level of Epo transcription in vitro, relative to control Hep3B cells. Hypoxic treated HeLa cells failed to express the endogenous Epo gene in vivo, and extracts prepared from them did not show increased Epo transcription in vitro. The Epo transcript which is induced in vitro is initiated at the same site as Epo RNA synthesized in intact Hep3B cells and in human kidney adenocarcinoma cells. This system will facilitate the purification and analysis of factors and sequences required for Epo gene transcription in response to changes in tissue oxygen tension."
https://openalex.org/W1514465145,"The membrane signaling properties of the neuronal type-5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M5 AChR) as expressed in murine L cells were studied. Recipient Ltk- cells responded to ATP acting through a P2-purinergic receptor by increasing phosphoinositide hydrolysis 2-fold but were unresponsive to 17 receptor agonists that are stimulatory in other cells. L cells expressing the M5 AChR responded to carbachol (CCh) with an approximately 20-fold increase in phospholipase C activity, mobilization of Ca2+ from endogenous stores, causing a transient peak increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), influx of extracellular Ca2+, causing a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and release of [3H]arachidonic acid from prelabeled cells, without altering resting or prostaglandin E1-elevated intracellular cAMP levels. None of the effects of the M5 AChR were inhibited by pertussis toxin. The regulation of L cell [Ca2+]i was studied further. ATP had the same effects as CCh and the two agonists acted on a shared intracellular pool of Ca2+. The peak and sustained [Ca2+]i increases were reduced by cholera toxin and forskolin, neither of which altered significantly phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This is consistent with interference with the action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) through cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and suggests a continued involvement of IP3 during the sustained phase of [Ca+]i increases. The temporal pattern of the sustained [Ca2+]i increase differed whether elicited by CCh or ATP, and was enhanced in pertussis toxin-treated cells. This is consistent with existence of a kinetic control of the sustained [Ca2+]i change by a receptor-G protein-dependent mechanism independent of the IP3 effector site(s) (e.g. pulsatile activation of phospholipase C and/or pulsatile activation of a receptor/G protein-operated plasma membrane Ca2+ channel). Thus, the non-excitable L cell may be a good model for studying [Ca2+]i regulations, as may occur in other nonexcitable cells of which established cell lines do not exist, and for studying of receptors that as yet cannot be studied in their natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W1545597896,"The cytochrome o complex of the Escherichia coli aerobic respiratory chain is a ubiquinol oxidase. The enzyme consists of at least four subunits by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and contains two heme b prosthetic groups (b555 and b562) plus copper. The sequence of the cyo operon, encoding the subunits of the oxidase, reveals five open reading frames, cyoABCDE. This paper describes results obtained by expressing independently cyoA and cyoB in the absence of the other subunits of the complex. Polyclonal antibodies which react with subunits I and II of the purified oxidase demonstrate that cyoA and cyoB correspond to subunit II and subunit I, respectively, of the complex. These subunits are stably inserted into the membrane when expressed. Furthermore, expression of cyoB (subunit I) results in elevated heme levels in the membrane. Reduced-minus-oxidized spectra suggest that the cytochrome b555 component is present but that the cytochrome b562 component is not. This heme component is shown to bind to CO, as it does in the intact enzyme. Hence, subunit I alone is sufficient for the assembly of the stable CO-binding heme component of this oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1593761685,"Pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (AP2PL) inhibits lamb kidney (Na,K)-ATPase and that inhibition and covalent modification is blocked by the presence of ATP. After trypsin digestion of the labeled, purified alpha subunit and subsequent peptide mapping of the fluorescently labeled peptides by means of high performance liquid chromatography, the main labeled peptide was further purified and analyzed by amino acid composition analysis and peptide sequencing. The obtained peptide had the sequence Ile470-Val-Glu-Ile-Pro-Phe-Asn-Ser-Thr-Asn-Lys480-Tyr-Gln-Le u-Ser-Ile-His- Lys487. Lysine 480 is the residue modified by AP2PL in the absence, but not in the presence of ATP. The beta subunit is not differentially labeled by AP2PL in the presence or absence of ATP. Interestingly, the same results were obtained using pyridoxal phosphate as the labeling and inactivation reagent, indicating that the specificity of labeling by these reagents is not due to the presence of the adenosine moiety, but instead that the initial recognition of nucleotides by the ATP-binding site of (Na,K)-ATPase may be due to recognition of the phosphate moiety. The amino acid sequence surrounding this lysine residue labeled by both reagents is highly conserved in (Na,K)-ATPase and the related (H,K)-ATPase sequences thus far obtained, which may signify a functional importance for this region of the putative ATP-binding site in these transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1515190708,"Cultured pig aortic smooth muscle cells respond to extracellular adenosine by activating adenylate cyclase and by initiating the efflux of cAMP. In the presence of extracellular adenosine, efflux is first order with respect to intracellular cAMP concentration up to at least 125 pmol/10(6) cells. The apparent first-order rate constant for the efflux of cAMP increases in a dose-dependent manner in response to extracellular adenosine or 5-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine. The EC50 for adenosine for promoting cAMP efflux is 12 microM. For cells stimulated with 5-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine, the EC50 is 5 microM. When extracellular adenosine is removed, efflux stops abruptly. Cellular cAMP content falls but is still in a range that supports cAMP efflux when agonist is present. Efflux is not affected by H8 (N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data suggest that in pig aortic smooth muscle cells, the efficiency of cAMP efflux is regulated by A2 receptor occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1605937204,"Transcriptional regulation of the cyo operon coding for a terminal oxidase, the cytochrome b562-o complex, of the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli was studied using a chromosomal operon fusion technique with the lacZ gene. Expression of the cyo gene was found to be subject to catabolite repression and also to control by the oxygen concentration. Information on the mechanisms of these regulations was obtained by nucleotide sequencing of the regulatory region, which corresponds to the 5'-flanking region of the cyoA gene. A typical promoter sequence and two noteworthy composite structural features, that is, two potential catabolite gene activator protein-binding sites and a region of hyphenated dyad symmetry were found. The transcription start point was identified by primer extension analysis, confirming the promoter site in the nucleotide sequence. The homology search of the nucleotide sequence in the region of hyphenated dyad symmetry showed a conserved nucleotide sequence in six oxygen-regulated genes examined, which suggests that this is the consensus sequence for the regulation by oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1493312303,"ApoB-100, the major protein of low density lipoprotein, is produced primarily in the liver. The apoB promoter region from -86 to -52 binds two hepatic nuclear proteins. The protein that binds to the sequence between -86 to -61, called AF-1, was characterized and also shown to interact with the apoCIII, apoA-I, and apoCII promoters. We now show that the second protein, which by DNase I footprinting binds to the sequence between -69 and -52, is the heat stable hepatic factor C/EBP. The binding of this protein is competed by a known C/EBP-binding sequence in the transthyretin gene enhancer (TRR oligo 3). In addition, the protein protects the same region in DNase I footprinting as purified C/EBP. Mutants that affect AF-1 or C/EBP binding to the apoB promoter were created. These mutants were analyzed by the gel mobility shift assay and transient transfections into HepG2 cells. We have demonstrated that the two factors bind to overlapping sites and that they modulate apoB transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1589021764,"Protein phosphatases and phosphatase inhibitors were used to examine the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of norepinephrine secretion in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells. The addition of an exogenous type 2A protein phosphatase caused as much as a 70% decrease in Ca2(+)-dependent norepinephrine secretion. In the presence of okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of type 2A protein phosphatases, phosphatase 2A had no effect on secretion. The addition of exogenous calcineurin, a Ca2(+)-calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase, also caused decrease in Ca2(+)-dependent secretion, but on a molar basis it was less effective than phosphatase 2A. Two phosphatase inhibitors, 1-naphthylphosphate and sodium pyrophosphate, caused 75-100% increases in the amount of norepinephrine secreted in the absence of Ca2+ without affecting the amount of norepinephrine secreted in the presence of Ca2+. This stimulation of Ca2(+)-independent secretion by 1-naphthylphosphate and pyrophosphate suggests that there is a slow rate of Ca2(+)-independent phosphorylation and that phosphorylation triggers secretion. Unlike the results obtained in the presence of ATP, secretion in the presence of adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), ATP gamma S, was not affected by the addition of type 2A protein phosphatase or by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors. These results are consistent with secretion in these permeabilized cells being regulated by a Ca2(+)-stimulated phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1502384183,"The chemotactic peptide formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), at concentrations below 10(-9) M, elicits a sustained increase in the human neutrophil's membrane potential within 10 s of its addition. This hyperpolarization, detected with the fluorescent cationic potentiometric probes, 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine (diO-C5-(3)), and 1,1'-dipropyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine iodide (diI-C3-(3)), and with the anionic probe bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric)trimethine oxonol (bis-oxonol), is immediately followed by a large depolarization when [fMLP] greater than 10(-9) M. By extracellular substitution of sodium ions with potassium ions or choline or by pretreatment of the cells with ionophores, we report here that the hyperpolarization is primarily dependent on an intact potassium ion gradient and is accompanied by a concurrent acidification of the cytoplasm (approximately 0.05 pH unit) Although the latter occurs simultaneously with a large, transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ at [fMLP] greater than 10(-10) M, it occurs without a detectable increase in cytosolic Ca2+ at [fMLP] less than 10(-10) M. The hyperpolarization is neither affected nor initiated by the chemotactic peptide antagonist tert-butyloxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, whereas the depolarization is completely inhibited. Neutrophils isolated from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease exhibit normal hyperpolarizations and cytosolic Ca2+ increases in response to chemotactic peptides but exhibit no depolarization or oxidative burst. The hyperpolarization appears earlier in the ontogeny of differentiating myeloid precursor cells than either the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ or the depolarization response. Together, these findings indicate that an increase in transmembrane potential is one of the earliest events in the neutrophil response to chemotactic peptides, coinciding temporally with increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and H+ concentrations but preceding detectable oxidative burst activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534429181,"Stopped-flow techniques were used to investigate the kinetics of the reaction of lignin peroxidase compounds II and III (LiPII and LiPIII) with peroxides. Rate data were obtained from single-turnover experiments under pseudo-first-order conditions. LiPII reacts with H2O2 or peracetic acid (AcOOH) to form a modified LiPIII, designated as LiPIII*, via a biphasic reaction. During the first phase, LiPIII is formed as an intermediate. Kinetic analysis also indicates a LiPII-peroxide complex. The first-order dissociation rate constants for the reaction of LiPII with H2O2 and AcOOH are 7.9 +/- 0.5 and 4.9 +/- 0.6 s-1, respectively. The rate of the H2O2 reaction is approximately 500 times the rate of the comparable reaction with horseradish peroxidase, suggesting it is physiologically significant. The activation energy for the formation of LiPIII is 23 kJ mol-1. During the second phase, the intermediate LiPIII is converted to LiPIII*, confirmed by analyzing the reaction of exogenously prepared LiPIII with peroxides. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of LiPIII with H2O2 and AcOOH are (3.7 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) M-1 s-1 and (2.9 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) M-1 s-1, respectively. The conversion of LiPIII to LiPIII* is reversible; the first-order rate constant for the reverse reaction is approximately (6.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(-2) s-1. The rates of both LiPIII and LiPIII* formation decrease markedly above pH 4.0. The pH dependence of these reactions is controlled by a heme-linked ionizable group of pK alpha congruent to 4.2."
https://openalex.org/W1608084501,"To ascertain whether mannose 6-phosphate-containing peptides that bind to the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II)/mannose 6-phosphate receptor activate phospholipase C, we determined the effect of proliferin, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) precursor, and beta-galactosidase on production of inositol trisphosphate (Ins-P3) in basolateral membranes isolated from the renal proximal tubule of dogs. Both proliferin and TGF-beta 1 precursor stimulated Ins-P3 production in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal production was stimulated by approximately 10(-13) M of each peptide. beta-Galactosidase had no effect on Ins-P3 generation. Neither proliferin nor TGF-beta 1 precursor potentiated IGF II-stimulated Ins-P3 production. Mannose 6-phosphate itself had no effect on Ins-P3 generation. However, mannose 6-phosphate potentiated production stimulated by 10(-11) M proliferin or 10(-11) M TGF-beta 1 precursor while inhibiting production stimulated by 10(-14) M of either peptide. Addition of anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor antibodies to basolateral membranes abolished proliferin and TGF-beta 1 precursor-stimulated Ins-P3 generation. We conclude that, in addition to IGF II, mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligands for the IGF II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor activate basolateral membrane phospholipase C. Such activation could reflect a common mechanism for signal transduction by these peptides mediated via the IGF II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W172606637,"Fluoroaluminate had no effect on cAMP levels in cells but inhibited agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In membranes, fluoroaluminate stimulated adenylate cyclase activity between 1 and 10 mM but not at higher concentrations, and it inhibited agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at concentrations greater than 1 mM. Fluoroaluminate is known to activate Gs and Gi, the guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins that stimulate and inhibit adenylate cyclase. G proteins are heterotrimeric, with unique alpha and common beta gamma subunits, and activation involves dissociation of alpha from beta gamma. Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of alpha i of heterotrimeric Gi but not free alpha i. Fluoroaluminate prevented pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi in cells and membranes, suggesting that Gi is activated by fluoroaluminate in both. Cholera toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the alpha s subunit of Gs. In cells, agonist often increased cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gs, but fluoroaluminate decreased ADP-ribosylation even in the presence of agonist, suggesting that Gs cannot be activated in the presence of fluoroaluminate. In membranes, both agonist and fluoroaluminate increased cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, suggesting that Gs is activated by these agents. We conclude that fluoroaluminate activates Gi but not Gs in cells and activates both G proteins in membranes. The value of bacterial toxins in assessing the state of G protein in cells and membranes is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1541664337,"Hemophilia Bm is characterized by a strikingly prolonged plasma ox brain prothrombin time. In an attempt to find an explanation for this phenomenon we have analyzed various aspects of the Bm variants factor IX Deventer, factor IX Milano, factor IX Novara, and factor IX Bergamo. Proteolytic cleavage by factor XIa was normal in two Bm variants, but absent at the Arg180-Val bond in the other two. In the latter variants Arg180 was replaced by either Trp or Gln, whereas Val181----Phe and Pro368----Thr replacements have occurred in the variants that were normally cleaved by factor XIa. In all four variants the Bm effect could be neutralized with a single monoclonal antibody against factor IX. Also, after treatment with factor XIa, none of the Bm variants reacted with antithrombin III (in contrast to normal factor IXa). Purified factor IX Deventer (one of the variants with a replacement of Arg181), either with or without pretreatment with factor XIa, was found to be a more effective competitive inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue factor-induced factor X activation than similarly treated normal factor IX. In addition, this inhibitory effect was much more pronounced when bovine tissue factor was used instead of human tissue factor. We propose that the normal activation of factor IX not only produces a conformational change around the active site serine that allows efficient substrate binding and catalysis, but that the same conformational change is instrumental in effectively dissociating factor IXa from the activating factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. Amino acid replacements that disrupt this conformational transition directly (e.g. Pro368----Thr near the catalytic center) or indirectly (mutations at the Arg180-Val activation site) therefore lead to a combination of 1) the loss of coagulant activity and 2) an inhibitory effect in the ox brain prothrombin time assay."
https://openalex.org/W1559454156,"In assays containing a physiological concentration of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (1 microM), this isomer was attacked by both 3- and 5-phosphatases present in rat parotid homogenates and 100,000 X g supernatant and particulate fractions. As the concentration of cytosolic protein in the assay was decreased, the specific activity of the soluble 3-phosphatase increased significantly. In contrast, the specific activity of particulate 3-phosphatase was independent of protein concentration. At the lowest protein concentrations tested, the sum of soluble and particulate 3-phosphatase specific activities was 2.5-fold greater than that of the parent homogenate. These observations indicate that parotid cytosol contains a hitherto undescribed endogenous mechanism for inhibiting 3-phosphatase. The effects upon 3- and 5-phosphatase of a number of inositol polyphosphates were studied. Both activities were inhibited by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (IC50 approximately 50 microM). Inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate was a more potent inhibitor of 3-phosphatase (IC50 about 10 microM) and did not affect 5-phosphatase. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate were very potent inhibitors of 3-phosphatase (IC50 values of 1 and 0.5 microM, respectively); these polyphosphates did not affect 5-phosphatase activity at concentrations of up to 10 microM. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate was a competitive inhibitor of the 3-phosphatase, whereas inositol hexakisphosphate was a mixed inhibitor. These data lead to the proposal that the inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase is unlikely to be an important enzyme activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1590949152,"Purine analogues were used to probe the mechanism by which nerve growth factor (NGF) and other agents regulate cellular ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Exposure of cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells to NGF causes a 10-50-fold induction of ODC activity within 4-6 h. We recently found that purine analogues block this induction as well as other, but not all, actions of NGF and have provided evidence that the inhibitory actions of the analogues may be due in part to the suppression of an NGF-activated protein kinase activity (Volonte, C., Rukenstein, A., Loeb, D. M., and Greene, L. A. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 2395-2403). The present results show that the purine analogues also suppress the induction of ODC mRNA. One of the analogues used was 6-thioguanine (6-TG). Although 6-TG was effective when applied simultaneously with NGF, if NGF was administered for as little as 1-3 min before 6-TG, ODC induction was unimpaired. This suggests that 6-TG blocks an early step in the NGF mechanism, and that once this step is triggered, the ODC induction pathway is no longer sensitive to this analogue. In contrast, another purine analogue, 2-aminopurine (2-AP), effectively inhibited ODC induction even if applied only during the last hour of a 5-h exposure to NGF. It is hypothesized that this increased period of sensitivity to 2-AP may be due to its broader range (as compared to 6-TG) as an inhibitor of protein kinase activities. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and cAMP derivatives also induce ODC activity in PC12 cells, and these effects were suppressed by 6-TG and 2-AP at concentrations similar to those that affect responses to NGF. However, short term (less than 30 min) pretreatment with EGF or a cAMP derivative did not protect induction of ODC activity by these agents from inhibition by 6-TG. This suggests that there are both convergent and divergent elements in the mechanistic pathways used by NGF, cAMP analogues, and EGF to induce ODC."
https://openalex.org/W1524879983,"The (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from 3T3-F442A fibroblasts and adipocytes was characterized by immunoblotting, ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake, sodium affinity, and Northern analysis. Using an antibody that cross-reacts with all three forms of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, it was found that only the alpha 1 isozyme was present in both fibroblasts and adipocytes. This result was confirmed using an antibody specific for the alpha 2 isoform. Additionally, the ouabain dependence of Rb+ uptake in both cell types gave KI values of 0.7-1.0 X 10(-4) M, a concentration that is characteristic for the alpha 1 isoform. For both fibroblasts and adipocytes, the dependence of rubidium uptake activity on sodium concentration was characterized by K0.5 values of 9.4 and 6.2 mM, respectively, which is also diagnostic for the alpha 1 subunit in vivo. Although in fibroblasts there was no detectable message for the alpha 2 isozyme, the 3.4-kilobase message for this isozyme was present in adipocytes; this discrepancy is discussed. The (Na+ (+) K+)-ATPase was activated in fibroblasts and adipocytes by insulin at half-maximal concentrations of 11 nM and about 100 pM, respectively. Glucose uptake was also stimulated at similar concentrations of the hormone. In fibroblasts, insulin caused an increase in sodium uptake which was not inhibited by 1 mM amiloride. From these data, the presence of an insulin-sensitive sodium channel is hypothesized."
https://openalex.org/W1581159824,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored within atrial myocyte secretory granules as pro-ANF (ANF-(1-126] and is proteolytically processed co-secretionally C-terminal to a single basic amino acid to form ANF-(1-98) and the bioactive product ANF-(99-126). Pro-ANF is also expressed in certain non-cardiac neuroendocrine cell types (e.g. brain, adrenal). Although the relatively low levels of the peptide in these cell types have precluded detailed processing and secretion studies using cultured cells, some work with tissue extracts suggests that pro-ANF is pre-secretionally processed between or C-terminal to Arg101-Arg102 in such cells. In order to assess whether cultured non-cardiac endocrine cells process pro-ANF pre- or co-secretionally, and to establish whether both paired and single basic amino acids can serve as cleavage sites, transfection studies were carried out using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20/D-16v. These cells normally cleave pro-ACTH/endorphin pre-secretionally at selected, but not all, pairs of basic amino acids to a variety of product peptides. A prepro-ANF expression plasmid was constructed and transfected into the AtT-20 cells. The resulting ANF/AtT-20 cell clone selected for this study expressed ACTH at levels similar to the untransfected wild type cells and secreted immunoreactive ANF-related material at a rate of approximately 1 fmol/min/10(5) cells, which was about 10% the rate of ACTH secretion. The rates of secretion of both ANF and ACTH could be increased 3-5-fold with a variety of known AtT-20 cell secretagogues including phorbol esters and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, thus indicating that both peptides were routed through regulated secretory pathways. Utilizing a combination of specific antisera directed against various regions of pro-ANF, size exclusion and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, and peptide mapping, it was shown that the ANF/AtT-20 cells contained and secreted the bioactive peptide ANF-(103-126) and -(1-97). These results indicate that the ANF/AtT-20 cells specifically cleave pro-ANF pre-secretionally at the same single basic site used by cardiac tissue; this single basic cleavage is apparently followed by removal of Arg98 by carboxypeptidase H. It is also apparent that the cells can cleave at the sole paired basic site in pro-ANF, which is the probable cleavage site used by neurons and some other endocrine cells that express low levels of the prohormone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W131842261,"Abstract We have recently solubilized and enriched a chloride- and calcium-dependent glutamate-binding protein from rat brain (Brose, N., Halpain, S., Suchanek, C., and Jahn, R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9619-9625). The partially purified protein fraction, containing two major protein components of 51,000 Da and 105,000 Da, was used to generate a rabbit antiserum. This serum quantitatively precipitated the binding activity from membrane extracts. Small amounts of the antiserum inhibited glutamate binding when chloride was absent from the incubation medium. Three protein bands were labeled by the serum on immunoblots. From the affinity purified antibody fractions contained in the serum, only the antibodies directed against a 51,000-Da protein were able to immunoprecipitate the binding activity, indicating that this protein is an essential component of the binding site. A survey of a variety of rat tissues by immunoblot analysis revealed a ubiquitous distribution of the protein. After subcellular fractionation of liver and brain, the 51,000-Da protein copurified with mitochondrial markers. Furthermore, exclusive labeling of mitochondria was observed by light and electron microscopy immunocytochemistry. Subfractionation of purified liver mitochondria resulted in a selective association of the protein with inner mitochondrial membranes. Pharmacological characterization of glutamate binding to liver mitochondrial membranes revealed a pattern almost identical to that of the chloride- and calcium-dependent glutamate-binding site in rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1528308892,"Polyclonal antisera prepared against the purified NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (Enterococcus hirae) do not cross-react with the ATCC 11700 enzyme. Comparative tryptic maps of the two proteins indicate that the differences in primary structures extend beyond those localized to respective antigenic epitopes. Alignments of the NH2-terminal and active-site cysteinyl peptide sequences of the two streptococcal peroxidases reveal identities of 50 and 67% in the respective overlap regions. Dithionite titrations of the ATCC 9790 enzyme reveal a separation in potentials (E2 - E1) for the nonflavin and flavin redox centers of 39 mV, a value nearly 50 mV lower than that observed with the ATCC 11700 peroxidase. Despite these changes in redox behavior NADH titrations of the ATCC 9790 enzyme give rise to both EH2 and EH2.NADH species as previously observed. The enzyme turnover number with hydrogen peroxide is approximately 60% that of the ATCC 11700 peroxidase; the ATCC 9790 peroxidase is also inhibited during turnover with ethyl hydroperoxide. These findings suggest that the flavoprotein NADH peroxidases may exhibit greater diversity among the group D streptococci than previously observed with the widely distributed enzymes of the related flavoprotein disulfide reductase class."
https://openalex.org/W1593581018,"Two forms of DNA primase stimulatory factor have been purified from mouse FM3A cells and shown to have RNase H activity. One of the factors, which consists of three polypeptides of 42,000, 41,000, and 27,000 daltons, was characterized in its properties as RNase H and DNA primase stimulatory factor. The nucleolytic activity of the factor specifically digested the RNA component of RNA-DNA hybrids in an endonucleolytic manner. The stimulation by the factor was observed in DNA synthesis by DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex on unprimed DNA templates, and the DNA chains synthesized under these conditions in the presence of the factor were much shorter than those synthesized in its absence. The stimulatory effect of the factor on DNA primase activity was directly confirmed with DNA primase dissociated from DNA polymerase alpha by the observation of the increase in the number of synthesized oligoribonucleotides. The primer RNA synthesis by DNA primase-DNA polymerase alpha complex under the condition where DNA synthesis occurred was also significantly stimulated by the factor. Furthermore, under these conditions RNA primers were removed from DNA chains by the RNase H activity of the factor."
https://openalex.org/W1485977621,"We previously studied the equilibrium binding of ADP, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to actomyosin-subfragment 1 (acto.S-1) and found that AMP-PNP and PPi bind considerably more weakly to acto.S-1 than does ADP. In this study, we investigated the pre-steady-state kinetics of the binding of AMP-PNP and PPi to acto.S-1 and of S-1.AMP-PNP and S-1.PPi to actin to determine if the pre-steady-state kinetic data are consistent with our previous equilibrium data. We find that the kinetic data are consistent with the equilibrium data and agree with a model in which acto.S-1 forms a collision intermediate with the ATP analog, followed by a slower conformational change to a ternary complex that rapidly dissociates into actin and the S-1.ATP analog. Although this scheme fits the AMP-PNP as well as the PPi data, we find that the isomerization of the collision intermediate to the ternary complex is approximately 10 times faster in the presence of PPi than in the presence of AMP-PNP, which is consistent with previous physiological studies (Schoenberg, M., and Eisenberg, E. (1985) Biophys. J. 48, 863-872)."
