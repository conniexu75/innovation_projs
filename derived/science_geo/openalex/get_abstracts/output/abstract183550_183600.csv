https://openalex.org/W1990095603,"The gastrointestinal peptide hormone ghrelin stimulates appetite in rodents and humans via hypothalamic actions. We discovered expression of ghrelin in a previously uncharacterized group of neurons adjacent to the third ventricle between the dorsal, ventral, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei. These neurons send efferents onto key hypothalamic circuits, including those producing neuropeptide Y (NPY), Agouti-related protein (AGRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) products, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Within the hypothalamus, ghrelin bound mostly on presynaptic terminals of NPY neurons. Using electrophysiological recordings, we found that ghrelin stimulated the activity of arcuate NPY neurons and mimicked the effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). We propose that at these sites, release of ghrelin may stimulate the release of orexigenic peptides and neurotransmitters, thus representing a novel regulatory circuit controlling energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2040651276,"Small-diameter (1 to 7 nanometers) silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were prepared, and their surfaces were removed of oxide and terminated with hydrogen by a hydrofluoric acid dip. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of these SiNWs, performed both in air and in ultrahigh vacuum, revealed atomically resolved images that can be interpreted as hydrogen-terminated Si (111)-(1 x 1) and Si (001)-(1 x 1) surfaces corresponding to SiH3 on Si (111) and SiH2 on Si (001), respectively. These hydrogen-terminated SiNW surfaces seem to be more oxidation-resistant than regular silicon wafer surfaces, because atomically resolved STM images of SiNWs were obtained in air after several days' exposure to the ambient environment. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements were performed on the oxide-removed SiNWs and were used to evaluate the electronic energy gaps. The energy gaps were found to increase with decreasing SiNW diameter from 1.1 electron volts for 7 nanometers to 3.5 electron volts for 1.3 nanometers, in agreement with previous theoretical predictions."
https://openalex.org/W1998033984,"Drug seeking and drug self-administration in both animals and humans can be triggered by drugs of abuse themselves or by stressful events. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo administration of drugs of abuse with different molecular mechanisms of action as well as acute stress both increase strength at excitatory synapses on midbrain dopamine neurons. Psychoactive drugs with minimal abuse potential do not cause this change. The synaptic effects of stress, but not of cocaine, are blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. These results suggest that plasticity at excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons may be a key neural adaptation contributing to addiction and its interactions with stress and thus may be an attractive therapeutic target for reducing the risk of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2016124588,Responses to pain and other stressors are regulated by interactions between multiple brain areas and neurochemical systems. We examined the influence of a common functional genetic polymorphism affecting the metabolism of catecholamines on the modulation of responses to sustained pain in humans. Individuals homozygous for the met 158 allele of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism ( val 158 met ) showed diminished regional μ-opioid system responses to pain compared with heterozygotes. These effects were accompanied by higher sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val 158 homozygotes. The COMT val 158 met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli.
https://openalex.org/W2066381476,"The ability to taste the substance phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) has been widely used for genetic and anthropological studies, but genetic studies have produced conflicting results and demonstrated complex inheritance for this trait. We have identified a small region on chromosome 7q that shows strong linkage disequilibrium between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and PTC taste sensitivity in unrelated subjects. This region contains a single gene that encodes a member of the TAS2R bitter taste receptor family. We identified three coding SNPs giving rise to five haplotypes in this gene worldwide. These haplotypes completely explain the bimodal distribution of PTC taste sensitivity, thus accounting for the inheritance of the classically defined taste insensitivity and for 55 to 85% of the variance in PTC sensitivity. Distinct phenotypes were associated with specific haplotypes, which demonstrates that this gene has a direct influence on PTC taste sensitivity and that sequence variants at different sites interact with each other within the encoded gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2127806759,"In many cells and specially in muscle, mitochondria form elongated filaments or a branched reticulum. We show that Mfn2 (mitofusin 2), a mitochondrial membrane protein that participates in mitochondrial fusion in mammalian cells, is induced during myogenesis and contributes to the maintenance and operation of the mitochondrial network. Repression of Mfn2 caused morphological and functional fragmentation of the mitochondrial network into independent clusters. Concomitantly, repression of Mfn2 reduced glucose oxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell respiration, and mitochondrial proton leak. We also show that the Mfn2-dependent mechanism of mitochondrial control is disturbed in obesity by reduced Mfn2 expression. In all, our data indicate that Mfn2 expression is crucial in mitochondrial metabolism through the maintenance of the mitochondrial network architecture, and reduced Mfn2 expression may explain some of the metabolic alterations associated with obesity.

The electrical activity of the mitochondrial network in large cells such as muscle fibers may permit the movement of energy from the cell periphery to the cell core. There is evidence in Saccharomyces, Aspergillus, and mammalian cells that mitochondrial filaments are highly dynamic structures (5Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P.

In yeast this dynamic is regulated by changes in the rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Based on the isolation and analysis of yeast mutants that are defective in mitochondrial division and fusion, several laboratories have isolated proteins that mediate mitochondrial fission and fusion (8Jensen R.E.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such fusion and fission events may also be critical for the architecture of mitochondrial networks in mammalian cells. Tissues with high and variable rates of aerobic metabolism such as skeletal muscle or heart show a more prominent development of the mitochondrial network (1Bakeeva L.E. Chentsov Yu.S. Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 501: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Kirkwood S.P. Munn E.A. Brooks G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C395-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although this remains unexplained. In addition, the extent of the mitochondrial network is regulated by hypoxic conditions (23Bereiter-Hahn J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 122: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the mitochondrial network per se or proteins that participate in the generation of the mitochondrial network may be involved in the control of mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this study, we screened differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle from obese Zucker rats, and we isolated the fzohomologue mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). We demonstrate that Mfn2 expression is crucial to the maintenance of the morphology and operation of the mitochondrial network and in mitochondrial metabolism. We also show that this regulatory mechanism is disturbed in obesity. Messenger RNA was extracted fromgastrocnemius muscle of control (fa/+) and obese (fa/fa) rats with oligo(dT)20-cellulose columns, as described (24Mora S. Monden I. Zorzano A. Keller K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA was prepared from 2 ॖg of mRNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen). A PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit (Clontech) was used to select for genes that are down-regulated in the obese. The cDNA fragments obtained were arrayed on 96-well plates and screened using labeled cDNA from lean or control rats. Northern blot assays from 20 ॖg of total RNA were performed as described (25Castello A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Perez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacin M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5905-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using as probes the32P-labeled C31 cDNA fragment (321 bp) obtained from the subtractive hybridization or the 32P-labeled stem-cell factor cDNA fragment obtained by PCR. The C31 cDNA fragment is identical to the nucleotide sequence 2098–2419 of the rat U41803(GenBankTM). Retrotranscription and competitive-quantitative PCR was performed from 0.1 ॖg of total RNA from vastus lateralis muscle from lean and obese subjects, as described (26Auboeuf D. Vidal H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each sample Mfn2 mRNA and an internal competitor at different known concentrations were co-amplified with the same pair of primers: 5′-atgcatccccacttaagcac-3′ and 5′-ccagagggcagaactttgtc-3′. Mfn2 concentration was extrapolated from the point at which both products are amplified to the same extent. Thirteen healthy lean volunteers (51 ± 2 years; body mass index, 23 ± 1 kg/m2; blood glucose, 4.9 + 0.1 mmol/liter; plasma insulin, 34 ± 2 pmol/liter) and nine obese volunteers (46 ± 2 years; body mass index, 34 ± 1 kg/m2; blood glucose, 4.9 + 0.1 mmol/liter; plasma insulin, 62 ± 6 pmol/liter) participated in the study. Percutaneous biopsies of the vastus lateralismuscle were obtained before a 3-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin infusion rate of 12 pmol/kg/min), as described elsewhere (27Andreelli F.

Insulin-stimulated glucose utilization was determined as reported (26Auboeuf D. Vidal H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A rabbit antibody against the Mfn2 specific peptide LGPKNSRRALMGYNDQVQRP was purchased from Research Genetics. Anti-Porin antiserum was used as a mitochondrial marker. Proteins from total homogenates or fractions enriched in mitochondria were resolved in 107 SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon sheets. Incubation with antibodies and ECL detection were performed as described (25Castello A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Camps M. Perez-Castillo A. Testar X. Palacin M. Santos A. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5905-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 37 paraformaldehyde in PBS,1then washed three times in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 min in PBS containing 20 mm glycine, and 30 min in PBS containing 107 normal goat serum. Subsequently coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at 0.5–1.0 ॖg/ml (anti-COXI subunit, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands; anti-Myc 9E10, ATCC, Manassas, VA) diluted in PBS containing 107 goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with fluorochrom-conjugated (Oregon Green or Texas Red) goat secondary antibodies for 45 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS prior to mounting in immunofluore medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). MitoTracker Red CXRos and JC-1 (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands) were used to label mitochondria using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.5 ॖg/ml mitochondrial dye diluted in DMEM incomplete medium at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter the cells were washed in PBS warmed to 37 °C and fixed with 37 paraformaldehyde in PBS or were processed in vivo. To assess mitochondrial connectivity, the laser microirradiation technique was applied to cause mitochondrial membrane perforation in living cells previously stained with JC-1. A continuous argon laser (at λ = 488 nm) with an output of 11.4 mW was used. The duration of the light laser irradiation was 60 s, and the diameter of the focused laser spot was 0.5 ॖm. The cells were viewed by confocal microscopy before and 1.5 and 5 min after laser irradiation. The confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a 63× objective at the Serveis Cientı́fico-Tècnics, University of Barcelona. JC-1 is a cationic fluorescent dye (green color as monomer; 539 nm) that accumulates in mitochondria in a potential-dependent manner. Its accumulation in mitochondria leads to high concentrations of the dye and the subsequent formation of red fluorescent aggregates (597 nm). The concentration of JC-1 green monomers in the mitochondria increases proportionally to the membrane potential, and they form J-aggregates when green monomers concentration reach a certain level. This critical concentration is reached when membrane potential exceeds −240 mV. This allows the membrane potential measurement by determination of red, relative to green, emitted light irrespective of the number of mitochondria measured per image (28Di Lisa F. Blank P.S.

Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33249-33257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To measure differences in mitochondrial membrane potential between control cells and Mfn-2 knock-out cells, the dual emission of the potentiometric dye JC-1 was observed, and the red/green fluorescence ratio was measured. The cells were incubated with 1 ॖm JC-1 (Molecular Probes) diluted in DMEM with 27 FBS for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed once in DMEM with 27 FBS and viewed in vivo at the confocal microscope. Z-series stacks (always at the same nonsaturating conditions) were taken to measure red (597 nm) and green (539 nm) fluorescence. JC-1 potentiometric method accuracy was validated using carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (10 ॖm) and oligomycin (0.5 ॖg/ml) to assess minimal and maximal mitochondrial membrane potential either by confocal microscopy or by flow cytometry (data not shown). The volume and surface area of skeletal muscle mitochondria were measured by the “vertical sections” method (30Baddeley A.J. Gundersen H.J.G. Cruz-Orive L.M. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1986; 142: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Soleus muscles from four obese Zucker rats and four control lean rats were fixed and sectioned in random orientations, always perpendicular to their longitudinal axis, and 80 photographs/group at 5,000× were taken at random. The photographs were taken excluding the subsarcolemmal mitochondria population and always including Z-disc in the field. For each image, the mitochondrial surface area and volume were calculated from the number of randomly distributed points and cycloid arcs in a grid. The number of points inside the mitochondria is taken as the volume, and the number of cycloid arcs crossing the mitochondrial outer membrane is taken as the area. The volume/area ratio is an intrinsic parameter of mitochondria and does not depend on number of mitochondria studied. 10T/2 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 107 FBS. A plasmid enclosing two independent expression cassettes expressing Mfn2 and GFP was prepared for transient transfection. Each expression cassette was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and contained an SV40 polyadenylation signal. Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. Cells transfected with the empty vector were used as control. For electron microscopy, the transfected cells were sorted using flow cytometry; thereafter, GFP-expressing cells were pelleted and processed for Spurr embedding and ultramicrotomy. For stable transfection, IMAGE clone 3746-e24 was digested withKpnI and XhoI, and the antisense fragment corresponding to sequence 1–370 from mouse Mfn2 (GenBankTMaccession number AY028170) was purified and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) between the XhoI and KpnI sites. Geneticin selection at 500 ॖg/ml allowed isolation of individual clones. All of the transfections were performed with 20 ॖg of plasmid by the calcium phosphate method (31Santalucia T. Boheler K.R. Brand N.J. Sahye U. Fandos C. Vinals F. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP, lacZ, or antisense Mfn2 cDNA fragment were generated by homologous recombination as previously described (32Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The mouse Mfn2 sequence between nucleotides 1 and 370 was cloned in antisense orientation in the shuttle plasmid pdelE1sp1A and co-transfected with pJM17 into 293 cells to achieve homologous recombination. Individual plaques were isolated and checked for mRNA expression after infection of 293 cells. Recombinant adenovirus were further amplified in 293 cells, purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, dialyzed against 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 107 glycerol and stored at −80 °C. DNA was isolated from purified viral particles, and the recombinant viral genome was verified by restriction enzyme analysis. Viral stocks were titrated by infecting 293 cells with serial dilutions of the preparation and counting plaque forming units on the monolayer 15 days after infection. Glucose oxidation was measured in cells expressing or not a Mfn2 antisense sequence. The cells were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt medium (27 FBS, 5 mmol/liter glucose) containing 0.33 ॖm[14C](U)-d-glucose (323 Ci/mol) (Amersham Biosciences), and 14CO2 was trapped and measured as described (33Auestad N. Korsak R.A. Morrow J.W. Edmond J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1376-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The respiration rates were measured using two 2-ml Clark oxygen electrodes (Rank Brothers, Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) at 37 °C and connected to a Kipp & Zonendual channel chart recorder, assuming 479 nmol O/ml at air saturation. The cell respiration rates were expressed as a function of cell number. The cells were diluted with Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose and bovine serum albumin 27 to 4.106 cells/ml in a 2-ml Clark electrode at 37 °C. Inhibitors were used at times and concentrations that caused maximal inhibition (data not shown), and the measurements were performed at 707 air saturation after at least 5 min. Respiration insensitive to myxothiazol (200 ॖm) was defined as nonmitochondrial, and respiration sensitive to myxothiazol was defined as mitochondrial. Similarly, respiration sensitive to oligomycin (80 ॖg/ml) was defined as coupled respiration, and respiration insensitive to oligomycin but sensitive to myxothiazol was defined as respiration driving proton leak or uncoupled respiration. In a screening designed to identify genes differentially expressed in obese Zucker rats using PCR-select cDNA subtraction, we isolated a 321-bp clone (C31) that hybridized with a 4.7-kb mRNA species in skeletal muscle. C31 cDNA sequence was identical to the sequence in GenBankTM between nucleotides 2098 and 2419 of rat U41803 and 797 identical to the human cDNA sequence D86987 submitted by Nagase et al. (52Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to the GenBankTM and recently identified as mitofusin Mfn2 (22Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multi-alignment of human Mfn2 with other gene products showed that it is 957 identical to the rat Mfn2 protein (U41308), 947 identical to the mouse Mfn2 counterpart (GenBankTMaccession number AY028170), and 477 identical to Drosophila melanogaster Mfn2 (GenBankTM accession numberAF355475). Lower identity was found with the fzo gene product from D. melanogaster (317 identity) (10Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and that from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (87 identity) (11Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of human Mfn2 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis at high stringency (Fig.1A). The mRNA species of 4.7 kb hybridized with the 321-bp clone. Transcripts were predominant in skeletal muscle and heart, but expression was low in brain, kidney, and liver (Fig. 1A). A similar distribution profile was detected in rat tissues (data not shown). Based on the abundant expression of Mfn2 mRNA in skeletal muscle, we examined whether the expression was regulated during myogenesis. L6E9 myoblasts barely expressed Mfn2, but a marked induction of Mfn2 mRNA levels was detected with differentiation into myotubes (Fig.1B). A polyclonal antibody was raised against a Mfn2 sequence, which detected a 110-kDa band in extracts from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney in rats (Fig.2A); the band was specifically washed by an excess of the immunogenic peptide (Fig. 2A). Endogenous Mfn2 was enriched in mitochondrial fractions in heart, brown adipose tissue, and kidney (Fig. 2B), which is in keeping with observations that overexpressed Mfn2 is found in mitochondria (22Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, we found that myogenesis caused the induction of Mfn2 protein in L6E9 cells (Fig. 2C). Induction of Mfn2 gene expression in L6E9 myotubes was parallel to the development of a very extensive mitochondrial network (Fig. 3, A and B). Evidence for the operation of the mitochondrial network as an intralumenally connected system in muscle cells was obtained by laser microirradiation (3Amchenkova A.A. Bakeeva L.E. Chentsov Y.S. Skulachev V.P. Zorov D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In myoblast cells, a short portion of a mitochondrial filament became de-energized when one of the cluster-composing mitochondria was damaged by laser (Fig. 3,C and D). As a consequence of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondria became unstained by JC-1. In contrast, illumination of a single mitochondrial filament in L6E9 myotubes caused a generalized loss of mitochondrial membrane potential throughout the mitochondrial network, and affecting areas situated far from the irradiation spot (see Fig. 6, A andB). These data indicate the existence of a very extensive intralumenal connectivity in the mitochondria that form the mitochondrial network in myotubes.Figure 6Mfn2 repression alters the operation of the mitochondrial network in muscle cells. Myotubes infected with the AS adenoviral vector (C and D) or with adenoviruses encoding औ-galactosidase (A and B) were irradiated with a laser beam to perforate mitochondria and to induce discharge of the membrane potential in the mitochondrial network. Pseudocolor images of the green fluorescence emitted by the monomers of JC-1 were taken before (A and C) and after 5 min (B and D) of laser irradiation. Total discharge of mitochondrial membrane potential is detected as destained of previously stained mitochondria. The arrows show the place of the laser illumination. The arrowheads show mitochondrial clusters unaffected after laser illumination in AS cells. The dotted lines delineate the myotubes.

Overexpression of Mfn2 after transient transfection collapsed the network in L6E9 myoblasts and mitochondria clustered around the nucleus (Fig. 4,A and B). Mitochondria in 10T1/2 fibroblasts are also usually organized in filaments but rarely seen as isolated organelles (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of Mfn2 after transient transfection also caused mitochondrial clustering around the nucleus (Fig. 4D). This is in keeping with recent observations (22Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that this clustering was not due to the generation of giant mitochondria. Instead, it corresponds to aggregates of mitochondria with normal ultrastructural morphology (Fig. 4, E and F). Both endogenous and overexpressed Mfn2 protein was localized in mitochondria by biochemical and immunofluorescence assays (data not shown). These data indicate that Mfn2 requires additional proteins to complete the full mitochondrial fusion process. To determine the impact of the repression of Mfn2 gene expression, we knocked down Mfn2 expression in muscle cells. To this end, we generated an adenoviral vector encoding a mouse Mfn2 antisense sequence (AS), and this was used to infect L6E9 myotubes. AS adenoviral infection reduced Mfn2 protein levels in mitochondrial extracts (by about 507) in the absence of alterations in the abundance of Porin (Fig.5A). This effect was specific, and infection with an irrelevant adenovirus, encoding औ-galactosidase, had no effect on Mfn2 expression (Fig.5A). Control myotubes or myotubes infected with an irrelevant adenovirus had an extensive mitochondrial network with large filaments running longitudinal to the muscle cell (Fig. 5, Band C). In contrast, AS muscle cells showed discontinuity of the mitochondrial network (Fig. 5D). Quantitation indicated that 827 of mitochondrial filaments were longer than 5 ॖm in control cells, whereas only 227 of the total mitochondrial filaments showed that size in AS cells. Illumination of mitochondria in AS myotubes was associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that affected a very reduced extension of the mitochondrial network (Fig.6, A and B) compared with control cells (Fig. 6, C and D), supporting the view for a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network into independent functional clusters. Next, we examined whether reduction in Mfn2 expression caused alterations in mitochondrial metabolism. Repression of Mfn2 expression mediated by AS adenoviral expression in L6E9 myotubes reduced glucose oxidation by 307 (Fig. 7A). This effect was specific, and infection with an adenoviral vector encoding औ-galactosidase did not alter glucose oxidation (Fig. 7A). One point of note is that not all L6E9 myoblasts are usually differentiated into myotubes in culture, and near 307 of myoblasts remain undifferentiated (35Canicio J. Gallardo E. Illa I. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Kaliman P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5042-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); provided that undifferentiated myoblasts are not infected with adenoviruses, the reduction we observe in glucose oxidation after AS adenoviral infection represents a substantial underestimate of the actual inhibition. In these conditions, Mfn2 repression reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.7B). We also stably transfected 10T1/2 cells with a mouse Mfn2 antisense sequence. Mfn2 mRNA and protein levels were lower in antisense clones than in untransfected or mock transfected cells (Mfn2 protein levels ranged from 32 to 677 of control values in AS clones) (Fig.8, A and B). Repression of Mfn2 in 10T1/2 cells also reduced glucose oxidation by 307 (Fig. 8C). In addition, AS cells showed a 307 reduction in oxygen consumption (Fig. 8D). In these conditions, coupled oxygen consumption was unaltered, whereas respiration linked to the mitochondrial proton leak was significantly reduced in AS cells (Fig. 8D). These data indicate that reduction of Mfn2 expression causes alterations in mitochondrial metabolism characterized by reduced cellular oxygen consumption and depressed glucose oxidation. Skeletal muscle in human obesity is characterized by metabolic alterations, including insulin resistance, accumulation of intracellular triglycerides, reduced oxidation processes, and impaired glucose-induced thermogenesis (36Astrup A. Andersen T. Henriksen O. Christensen N.J. Bulow J. Madsen J. Quaade F. Int. J. Obesity. 1987; 11: 51-66PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In some animal models of obesity such as in obese Zucker rats or ob/ob mice, skeletal muscle shows a metabolic profile characterized by reduced glucose uptake and glucose oxidation, altered partitioning of fatty acids that are incorporated into triglycerides, or oxidized, insulin resistance and reduced oxygen consumption (38Cuendet G.S.

https://openalex.org/W1994652412,"We have developed a proteomic approach for identifying phosphopeptide binding domains that modulate kinase-dependent signaling pathways. An immobilized library of partially degenerate phosphopeptides biased toward a particular protein kinase phosphorylation motif is used to isolate phospho-binding domains that bind to proteins phosphorylated by that kinase. Applying this approach to cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), we identified the polo-box domain (PBD) of the mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as a specific phosphoserine (pSer) or phosphothreonine (pThr) binding domain and determined its optimal binding motif. This motif is present in known Plk1 substrates such as Cdc25, and an optimal phosphopeptide containing the motif disrupted PBD-substrate binding and localization of the PBD to centrosomes. This finding reveals how Plk1 can localize to specific sites within cells in response to Cdk phosphorylation at those sites and provides a structural mechanism for targeting the Plk1 kinase domain to its substrates."

The template-directed deposition and crystallization of the amorphous phase resulted in the fabrication of millimeter-sized single calcite crystals with sub–10-μm patterns and controlled crystallographic orientation.

https://openalex.org/W2005622137,"Accumulation of misfolded proteins as insoluble aggregates occurs in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), alpha-synuclein (alpha S) accumulates in insoluble inclusions. To identify soluble alpha S oligomers that precede insoluble aggregates, we probed the cytosols of mesencephalic neuronal (MES) cells, normal and alpha S-transgenic mouse brains, and normal, PD, and DLB human brains. All contained highly soluble oligomers of alpha S whose detection was enhanced by delipidation. Exposure of living MES neurons to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increased alpha S oligomer levels, whereas saturated FAs decreased them. PUFAs directly promoted oligomerization of recombinant alphaS. Transgenic mice accumulated soluble oligomers with age. PD and DLB brains had elevated amounts of the soluble, lipid-dependent oligomers. We conclude that alpha S interacts with PUFAs in vivo to promote the formation of highly soluble oligomers that precede the insoluble alpha S aggregates associated with neurodegeneration."

In the absence of explicit magnitude processing, numbers compared with letters and colors across modalities activated a bilateral region in the horizontal intraparietal sulcus.

https://openalex.org/W2037809197,"Genes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a role for ubiquitin-proteasome dysfunction and aberrant protein degradation in this disorder. Inasmuch as oxidative stress has also been implicated in PD, the present study examined transcriptional changes mediated by the Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in a dopaminergic cell line. Microarray analysis of RNA isolated from toxin treated samples revealed that the stress-induced transcription factor CHOP/Gadd153 was dramatically up-regulated by both 6-OHDA and MPP+. Treatment with 6-OHDA also induced a large number of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) such as ER chaperones and elements of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemical approaches were used to quantify and temporally order the UPR pathways involved in neurotoxin-induced cell death. 6-OHDA, but not MPP+, significantly increased hallmarks of UPR such as BiP, c-Jun, and processed Xbp1 mRNA. Both toxins increased the phosphorylation of UPR proteins, PERK and eIF2α, but only 6-OHDA increased phosphorylation of c-Jun. Thus, 6-OHDA is capable of triggering multiple pathways associated with UPR, whereas MPP+ exhibits a more restricted response.

Although the etiology of PD remains unknown, both genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role. For example, three genes and several putative loci have been identified (1Lansbury P. Brice A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 653Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), including two autosomal dominant mutations of the α-synuclein gene, that were linked to rare familial early-onset PD (2Polymeropoulos M.H.

Finally, a missense mutation in the gene encoding ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 is also associated with rare cases of PD (9Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G.

Thus, aggregation of α-synuclein together with defects in the ubiquitin pathway support the notion that a dysfunctional ubiquitin-proteasome system in which aberrant proteins are not cleared may play a major role in PD. The role of proteasomal impairment has been further emphasized by recent reports that pharmacological inhibition of proteasome function leads to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in culture (10McNaught K.S. Mytilineou C. Jnobaptiste R. Yabut J. Shashidharan P. Jennert P. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo (11McNaught K.S. Bjeorklund L.M. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In particular, cell death was associated with increased cytoplasmic levels of α-synuclein and ubiquitin, as well as the formation of inclusion bodies (10McNaught K.S. Mytilineou C. Jnobaptiste R. Yabut J. Shashidharan P. Jennert P. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 11McNaught K.S. Bjeorklund L.M. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Taken together, accumulating genetic and molecular evidence suggests that defects in ER and ubiquitin-proteasomal processing contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Because PD is largely restricted to dopaminergic neurons and because dopamine is easily oxidized in vitro and in vivo to a variety of neurotoxic metabolites, dopamine itself is considered a major factor in this disorder. For example, dopamine is readily oxidized to highly cytotoxic quinone molecules via at least three different enzymatic pathways (for review see Ref. 12Stokes A.H. Hastings T.G. Vrana K.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the presence of transition metals and hydrogen peroxide, dopamine can be converted to 6-OHDA (for review see Ref. 13Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), a highly potent endogenous neurotoxin widely used to create animal models of PD (13Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Both 6-OHDA and other dopamine quinine derivatives have been found in post-mortem Parkinsonian brains (14Curtius H.C. Wolfensberger M. Steinmann B. Redweik U. Siegfried J. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 99: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Fornstedt B. Rosengren E. Carlsson A.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2112-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), a finding that, together with the extensive studies documenting 6-OHDA-induced nigral degeneration, underscores the role dopamine plays in its own demise. Similarly, another PD mimetic, N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroyridine (MPTP) or its active derivative, MPP+, is also thought to induce oxidative stress and impair energy metabolism (for review see Ref. 17Speciale S. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 2002; 24: 607Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The original finding that human exposure to MPTP results in PD (18Langston J.W. Ballard P. Tetrud J.W. Irwin I. Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar) has been replicated in various animal models including non-human primates (for review see Ref. 17Speciale S. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 2002; 24: 607Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, both 6-OHDA and MPP+ have been shown to produce reactive oxygen species and to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, as well as to mimic many behavioral, pharmacological, and pathological symptoms of this disorder (for review see Refs. 13Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 17Speciale S. Neurotoxicol.

Despite these parallels, the molecular mechanisms by which these neurotoxins kill cells remain unclear. Further, their relevance to emerging genetic and pharmacological models investigating ubiquitin-proteasome pathway dysfunction and protein aggregation has yet to be studied. Previous results from this laboratory and others have demonstrated that 6-OHDA and MPP+ trigger morphologically distinct forms of cell death in the dopaminergic cell line MN9D and mouse primary mesencephalic cultures (13Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 20Choi W.-S. Yoon S.-Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.-J. O'Malley K.L.

Markers of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and caspase-3 cleavage are widespread in cells treated with 6-OHDA, but not with MPP+. Despite the different forms of cell death induced by either toxin, both types of cell death seem to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis (22Oh Y. Wong S. Moffat M. O'Malley K.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Choi W.-S. Canzoniero L.M.T. Sensi S.L. O'Malley K.L. Gwag B.J. Seonghyang S. Kim J.-E. Oh T.H. Lee E.B. Oh Y.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, few studies of gene expression in 6-OHDA or MPP+-induced dopaminergic cell death models have been done. Presumably, this is a result of the scarcity and heterogeneity of the tissue involved as well as the technical limitation in analyzing a few genes at a time. Thus, at present, there is no information about the coordinated patterns of gene expression involved in 6-OHDA or MPP+ toxicity. To unravel biological processes occurring in response to 6-OHDA and MPP+, we used microarray analysis of RNA isolated from the dopaminergic cell line MN9D (24Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffmann P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) as a starting point to identify possible pathways induced by these Parkinsonian mimetics. These cells have been shown to mimic many aspects of the dopaminergic cell type from which they were immortalized (20Choi W.-S. Yoon S.-Y. Oh T.H. Choi E.-J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci.

Capitalizing on the homogeneity and similarity in response of MN9D cells, the present study used microarray results, in addition to RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemical approaches, to reveal that 6-OHDA triggers three separate signaling pathways associated with ER stress and UPR, whereas MPP+ seems to only involve one such signaling pathway. The unexpected identification of UPR induction in these models of dopaminergic cell death increases our understanding of how they may function to mimic the disease state and supports the theory that aberrations in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway play an important role in PD. Cell Cultures—For primary cultures, the ventral mesencephalon was removed from embryonic day 14 CF1 murine embryos (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as described previously (21Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were mechanically dissociated, incubated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.05% DNase in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C, and further triturated using a constricted Pasteur pipette. All plates were pre-coated overnight at room temperature with 0.5 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) followed by 2.5 μg/ml laminin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in serum-free Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), and 0.01 μg/ml streptomycin plus 100 units of penicillin. Half of the culture medium was replaced with fresh Neurobasal medium on the third and fifth day following plating. All experiments were conducted after 6 days in vitro. MN9D cells were plated on dishes coated with 0.5 mg/ml poly-d-lysine for 1 h at 37 °C and then rinsed with sterile H2O. Cells were maintained in Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in an incubator with 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were switched to serum-free Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 1× B27 prior to addition of experimental agents. Cycloheximide Treatment and Determination of Cell Viability— MN9D cells were plated at a density of 40,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and treated after 3 days. One μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added either immediately prior to, or at times following, addition of 100 μm 6-OHDA with ascorbic acid (dissolved in boiled water; Sigma) or 75 μm MPP+ (Sigma). After 48 h, cell survival was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay as previously described (22Oh Y. Wong S. Moffat M. O'Malley K.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—MN9D cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in six-well plates. After 3 days, cells were treated with 75 μm 6-OHDA or 75 μm MPP+, or left untreated for control comparisons. Total RNA was isolated after 9 h of neurotoxin treatment using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA from three independent neurotoxin treatments were pooled together for each GeneChip hybridization experiment. Two separate GeneChip hybridizations of pooled, treated, and control RNA were performed, representing six independent experiments. A minimum of 20 μg/sample of total RNA was sent to the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center GeneChip Core Facility (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) for generation of labeled cRNA target and hybridization against Affymetrix Murine Genome U74Av2 GeneChip arrays (Santa Clara, CA) using standard protocols (pathbox.wustl.edu/~mgacore). Data were analyzed by Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.0, as well as Spotfire Decision Site for Functional Genomics (Somerville, MA). For those transcripts designated both “present” and “increasing” in each replicate by the software, a threshold of an average signal log ratio greater than 0.5 (∼1.5-fold change) was set. Transcripts for which signal was less than 3% of the maximum signal were filtered out. Reverse Transcription-PCR—MN9D cells were plated and treated exactly as described for microarray experiments. Total RNA was extracted after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h. Primers to 18 S ribosomal RNA (26O'Malley K.L. Mack K.J. Gandelman K.Y. Todd R.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were used to standardize amounts of RNA in each sample. RNA was reverse transcribed using gene-specific reverse primers, and resulting cDNAs were PCR-amplified. PCR primer sequences used were: CHOP (+) and CHOP (-) described in Ref. 27Fleming J.V.

PCR products were resolved on a 4% PAGE gel and analyzed with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences) detection and quantitative fluoroimaging. Western Blot Analysis—For MN9D Western blots, cells were plated and treated exactly as described for microarray experiments. For primary culture Western blots, 600,000 cells/well were plated in six-well plates and treated on the 6th day in vitro with 40 μm 6-OHDA or 1 μm MPP+ (21Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MN9D lysates were taken at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, and primary lysates were taken at 6 and 12 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and harvested in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% NaDoc, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and placed on ice for 30 min. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were run on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Mouse monoclonal antibody against CHOP/Gadd153 (1:100) and goat polyclonal antibodies against Hsp60 (1:500) and BiP/Grp78 (1:125) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cleaved caspase-3, phospho-c-Jun, phospho-eIF2α, and phospho-PERK (all 1:1,000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). After incubation with appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse 1:5000, Sigma; anti-goat 1:5000, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA; or anti-rabbit 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technologies), specific protein bands were detected and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence substrate detection (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) and quantitative fluoroimaging. Immunocytochemistry—MN9D cells were plated at a density of 300,000 cells/well on a four-well chamber slide. Twelve hours after plating, cells were treated with 75 μm 6-OHDA or 75 μm MPP+ and fixed 12 h later with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Primary culture cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/35-mm microwell plate (1.25 × 103 cells/mm2; MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). On day 6 in vitro, cells were treated with 40 μm 6-OHDA or 1 μm MPP+, and fixed after 12, 18, or 24 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cultures were double-stained with either mouse monoclonal anti-CHOP (1:300) or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (1:500), together with rabbit polyclonal (1:500; Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR) or mouse monoclonal (1:2,500; Immunostar, Hudson, WI) antibodies against the dopaminergic neuron marker TH, respectively. Secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit 1:300) and Alexa488 (anti-mouse 1:500; anti-rabbit 1:2000) were used. Cells were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. Statistics—GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis. The significance of effects between control and drug conditions was determined by one-way ANOVA as indicated and post hoc Dunnett's multiple comparison tests (GraphPad Prism software). Cell Death Induced by 6-OHDA and MPP+Is Blocked by Inhibition of Macromolecular Synthesis—Previous studies have characterized 6-OHDA-induced cell death as a caspase-dependent, apoptotic process, whereas MPP+-induced cell death can occur independent of caspase activation, and without canonical markers of apoptosis (13Blum D.

Blood. 2003; 101: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether 6-OHDA- or MPP+-induced cell death require de novo macromolecular synthesis, cultures were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Addition of 1.0 μg/ml cycloheximide together with 100 μm 6-OHDA or 75 μm MPP+ provided significant protection. In contrast, delaying addition of cycloheximide following neurotoxin treatment resulted in increasing cell death in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). These data indicate that, although 6-OHDA induces an apoptotic form of cell death and MPP+ does not, both types of cell death require de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, it may be possible to identify changes in gene expression associated with the cell death process. Microarray Analysis Identifies Distinct Changes in Gene Expression following 6-OHDA and MPP+Treatment—Microarray analysis was used to examine the expression profile of a large number of transcripts. Out of the ∼12,000 genes and expressed sequence tags represented on the MG-U74Av2 GeneChip, 4,304 (∼35% of total) were defined as “present” by the microarray analysis software for MPP+-treated samples. Similarly, 4,580 (∼37% of total) were defined as present for 6-OHDA-treated samples. Transcripts were subsequently grouped by individual toxin treatment, or by both 6-OHDA and MPP+ (Fig. 2). Notably, 6-OHDA treatment affected almost three times as many transcripts as MPP+. Specifically, 153 transcripts increased in response to 6-OHDA, whereas only 55 transcripts increased in response to MPP+. Results for decreasing transcripts were similar (data not shown). Both neurotoxins induced a number of the same transcripts, with 39 of the 55 transcripts induced by MPP+ also induced by 6-OHDA (Table I). These included genes involved in cell cycle and/or differentiation, signaling, stress, and transcription factors, indicating possible common cell death mechanisms. The most highly induced transcript in response to either treatment was that to the stress protein CHOP/Gadd153. 6-OHDA also induced a large number of transcripts that were unchanged by MPP+ treatment, including molecular chaperones and other genes involved in protein folding, trafficking, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Table II). These results support previous findings showing that MPP+ and 6-OHDA promote distinct yet overlapping programs of cell death.Table IGenes increased by both 6-OHDA and MPP+ Table lists 18 of 39 transcripts increased by both 6-OHDA and MPP+.Gene symbolGene nameChange6-OHDAMPP+foldGadd153CHOP/Gadd15326.09.2Atf3Activating transcription factor 39.82.6CebpbCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein C/EBP-β4.64.0Sqstm1Sequestosome 17.01.9Myd116Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 1164.32.3Gtpbp2GTP-binding protein 22.93.2Lbcl1Lymphoid blast crisis-like 1 (cell growth and maintenance)2.52.1CarsCysteinyl-tRNA synthetase2.22.1Slc1a4Neutral amino acid transporter1.72.4Atf4Activating transcription factor 42.01.9Gas5Growth arrest-specific 52.11.7Eif4ebp1Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 11.62.0Slc7a5Solute carrier family 7 cationic amino acid transporter1.51.9Glyt1Glycine transporter 11.61.7Clic4Chloride intracellular channel 4 mitochondrial1.51.8Clcn3Chloride channel 31.81.5WarsTryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase1.61.6Hspa9aHeat shock protein cognate 74 (mitochondrion)1.61.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIGenes increased by 6-OHDA only Table lists 21 of 114 transcripts increased by 6-OHDA, but not by MPP+.Gene symbolGene nameChange6-OHDAMPP+foldDnajb9DNA j protein b97.00.7Herpud1ER stress-inducible ubiquitin-like domain member 16.51.3Hmox1Heme oxygenase decycling 15.71.5Hspa5Bip/Grp783.00.5Ubcubiquitin C2.80.8Bag3Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (cytosol anti-apoptotic)2.61.0Tra1Tumor rejection antigen gp96 (chaperone calcium binding)2.30.8Sec23bSEC23B Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ER intracellular protein trafficking)2.11.0PorP450 cytochrome oxidoreductase2.11.0Txnrd1Thioredoxin reductase 11.91.0Spc18Signal peptidase complex 18-kDa1.90.9ArhbAplysia Ras-related homolog B RhoB1.81.0Xbp1X-box-binding protein 11.70.7Hsc70tHeat shock protein cognate 70 testis1.70.9Sec23aSEC23A S. cerevisiae(ER intracellular protein trafficking)1.61.0PpibPeptidylprolyl isomerase B1.61.0Grp58grp58 kDa (protein-disulfide isomerase)1.60.7Psmd4Proteasome 26 S subunit, non-ATPase, 41.51.1S100a10Calcium-binding protein A11 calgizzarin1.50.9Sec61gSEC61 gamma subunit S. cerevisiae1.50.9Uch11Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L11.51.1 Open table in a new tab CHOP Is Induced in Response to 6-OHDA and MPP+—To confirm the microarray findings that CHOP mRNA was up-regulated by 6-OHDA and MPP+ in MN9D cells, RT-PCR was performed (Fig. 3A). 6-OHDA induced a large and rapid induction of CHOP mRNA that peaked between 6 and 9 h. MPP+ induction of CHOP mRNA lagged behind that of 6-OHDA, but continued to increase for at least 12 h (Fig. 3, A and C). These data are consistent with the GeneChip results from a 9-h time point showing greater induction with 6-OHDA than with MPP+ (Fig. 2 and Table I). Western blotting of MN9D total cell lysates confirmed that levels of CHOP protein were also increasing (Fig. 3, B and C). Again, 6-OHDA induced a larger and more rapid increase in protein expression than did MPP+ (Fig 3C). To visualize CHOP induction in situ (Fig. 3D), treated cells were fixed, stained, and imaged using confocal microscopy. Control cultures had dim, diffuse staining, whereas both 6-OHDA and MPP+ treated cells showed intense nuclear staining. This localization is consistent with the role of CHOP as a transcription factor. Together, these results confirm and extend the GeneChip findings that toxin treatment of dopaminergic cells leads to an up-regulation of CHOP mRNA and protein levels. RT-PCR Reveals Markers of Unfolded Protein Response Are Up-regulated by 6-OHDA and MPP+Treatment—CHOP is up-regulated by a variety of cellular stresses including ER stress (27Fleming J.V.

https://openalex.org/W1980641455,"This intracellular study investigates synaptic mechanisms of orientation and direction selectivity in cat area 17. Visually evoked inhibition was analyzed in 88 cells by detecting spike suppression, hyperpolarization, and reduction of trial-to-trial variability of membrane potential. In 25 of these cells, inhibition visibility was enhanced by depolarization and spike inactivation and by direct measurement of synaptic conductances. We conclude that excitatory and inhibitory inputs share the tuning preference of spiking output in 60% of cases, whereas inhibition is tuned to a different orientation in 40% of cases. For this latter type of cells, conductance measurements showed that excitation shared either the preference of the spiking output or that of the inhibition. This diversity of input combinations may reflect inhomogeneities in functional intracortical connectivity regulated by correlation-based activity-dependent processes."

To assess how the central nervous system integrates the complex repertoire of pheromones, we recorded from single neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb, a nucleus that processes pheromonal signals, of male mice engaged in natural behaviors. Neuronal firing was robustly modulated by physical contact with male and female conspecifics, with individual neurons activated selectively by specific combinations of the sex and strain of conspecifics. We infer that mammals encode social and reproductive information by integrating vomeronasal sensory activity specific to sex and genetic makeup."
https://openalex.org/W1968148047,"By modifying habitats and creating bridges and barriers between landmasses, climate change and tectonic events are believed to have important consequences for diversification of terrestrial organisms. Such consequences should be most evident in phylogenetic histories of groups that are ancient, widespread, and diverse. The squirrel family (Sciuridae) is one of very few mammalian families endemic to Eurasia, Africa, and North and South America and is ideal for examining these issues. Through phylogenetic and molecular-clock analyses, we infer that arrival and diversification of squirrels in Africa, on Sunda Shelf islands, across Beringea, and across the Panamanian isthmus coincide in timing and location with multiple well-documented sea-level, tectonic, and paleontological events. These precise correspondences point to an important role for global change in the diversification of a major group of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2124813164,"We have investigated the trafficking of two endogenous axonal membrane proteins, VAMP2 and NgCAM, in order to elucidate the cellular events that underlie their polarization. We found that VAMP2 is delivered to the surface of both axons and dendrites, but preferentially endocytosed from the dendritic membrane. A mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 that inhibits endocytosis abolished its axonal polarization. In contrast, the targeting of NgCAM depends on sequences in its ectodomain, which mediate its sorting into carriers that preferentially deliver their cargo proteins to the axonal membrane. These observations show that neurons use two distinct mechanisms to polarize proteins to the axonal domain: selective retention in the case of VAMP2, selective delivery in the case of NgCAM."

Chromatic tuning properties, determined for homogeneous color patches presented on a neutral gray background, varied strongly between cells. The continuum of preferred chromaticities and tuning widths indicated a distributed representation of color signals in V1. When stimuli were presented on colored backgrounds, chromatic tuning was different in most neurons, and the changes in tuning were consistent with some degree of sensitivity of the neurons to the chromatic contrast between stimulus and background. Quantitatively, the average response changes matched the magnitudes of color induction effects measured in human subjects under corresponding stimulus conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2076700300,"We identified four PDZ domain-containing proteins, syntenin, PICK1, GRIP, and PSD95, as interactors with the kainate receptor (KAR) subunits GluR52b, GluR52c, and GluR6. Of these, we show that both GRIP and PICK1 interactions are required to maintain KAR-mediated synaptic function at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. In addition, PKCα can phosphorylate ct-GluR52b at residues S880 and S886, and PKC activity is required to maintain KAR-mediated synaptic responses. We propose that PICK1 targets PKCα to phosphorylate KARs, causing their stabilization at the synapse by an interaction with GRIP. Importantly, this mechanism is not involved in the constitutive recycling of AMPA receptors since blockade of PDZ interactions can simultaneously increase AMPAR- and decrease KAR-mediated synaptic transmission at the same population of synapses."

Contrary to proposed models for vertebrate asymmetric divisions, no apico-basal cell divisions take place in the zebrafish retina during the generation of postmitotic neurons. However, a surprising shift in the orientation of cell division from central-peripheral to circumferential occurs within the plane of the ventricular surface. In the sonic you (syu) and lakritz (lak) mutants, the shift from central-peripheral to circumferential divisions is absent or delayed, correlating with the delay in neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis in these mutants. The reconstructions here show that mitotic cells always remain in contact with the opposite basal surface by means of a thin basal process that can be inherited asymmetrically."
https://openalex.org/W2101953699,"Natural scene coding in ferret visual cortex was investigated using a new technique for multi-site recording of neuronal activity from the cortical surface. Surface recordings accurately reflected radially aligned layer 2/3 activity. At individual sites, evoked activity to natural scenes was weakly correlated with the local image contrast structure falling within the cells' classical receptive field. However, a population code, derived from activity integrated across cortical sites having retinotopically overlapping receptive fields, correlated strongly with the local image contrast structure. Cell responses demonstrated high lifetime sparseness, population sparseness, and high dispersal values, implying efficient neural coding in terms of information processing. These results indicate that while cells at an individual cortical site do not provide a reliable estimate of the local contrast structure in natural scenes, cell activity integrated across distributed cortical sites is closely related to this structure in the form of a sparse and dispersed code."
https://openalex.org/W1999411923,"The calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway is best known for its role in T lymphocyte activation. However, it has become increasingly apparent that this signaling pathway is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and development in a wide variety of different tissues and cell types. Here we have investigated the effects of sustained NFATc1 signaling on the growth and differentiation of the murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. Remarkably, we find that expression of a constitutively active NFATc1 mutant (caNFATc1) in these immortalized cells inhibits their differentiation into mature adipocytes and causes them to adopt a transformed cell phenotype, including loss of contact-mediated growth inhibition, reduced serum growth requirements, protection from growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis, and formation of colonies in semisolid media. Furthermore, we find that caNFATc1-expressing cells acquire growth factor autonomy and are able to proliferate even in the complete absence of serum. We provide evidence that this growth factor independence is caused by the NFATc1-dependent production of a soluble heat-labile autocrine factor that is capable of promoting the growth and survival of wild type 3T3-L1 cells as well as potently inhibiting their differentiation into mature adipocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that cells expressing caNFATc1 form tumors in nude mice. Taken together, these results indicate that deregulated NFATc1 activity is able to induce the immortalized 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line to acquire the well established hallmarks of cellular transformation and thereby provide direct evidence for the oncogenic potential of the NFATc1 transcription factor.

The principal function of NFAT proteins in T cells is to couple stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor to changes in the expression of a number of cytokine and other immunologically important genes. NFAT proteins are regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localization through the actions of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (1Rao A. Luo C.

However, following an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, activated calcineurin directly dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, inducing their rapid nuclear import and increasing their intrinsic DNA binding activity. Once located in the nucleus, NFAT proteins are then free to bind to their target promoter elements and activate the transcription of specific NFAT target genes, either alone or in combination with other nuclear partners. This calcineurin-mediated activation pathway is strongly opposed by a number of specific NFAT kinases, which act to directly rephosphorylate NFAT proteins, thereby directly antagonizing NFAT activity by inhibiting their DNA binding activity and promoting their rapid export back into the cytoplasm (4Shibasaki F.

Whereas the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is certainly best known for its role in the regulation of the immune response, it has become increasingly apparent that this pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular responses in a number of other tissues (2Crabtree G.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, important roles for distinct NFAT proteins have been demonstrated in the development and function of the cardiovascular system, including regulation of cardiac valve morphogenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, early patterning of the vasculature, and angiogenesis in mature blood vessels (15de la Pompa J.L.

In addition, NFAT proteins have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of chondrocyte growth and differentiation (20Ranger A.M. Gerstenfeld L.C. Wang J. Kon T. Bae H. Gravallese E.M. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as well as to play important roles in skeletal muscle, where they have been shown to differentially regulate myogenesis, muscle fiber type gene expression, and myocyte hypertrophy (21Chin E.R.

Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is likely to play a much broader role in the regulation of cell growth and development than previously appreciated. Previous studies have revealed the expression of NFAT proteins in the murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line, suggesting a potential role for these proteins in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and function (25Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line is a well establishedin vitro model of adipocyte differentiation that has been extensively used to investigate the molecular processes that control adipocyte growth and development (26Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 27Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). When confluent, growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells are exposed to the adipogenic hormones methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin (collectively known as MDI), they synchronously enter the cell cycle and undergo a defined genetic program of terminal differentiation. This process requires the ordered expression of a number of transcription factors, including members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) before permanently exiting the cell cycle and giving rise to mature morphologically distinct adipocytes containing large cytoplasmic triglyceride depots (26Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 27Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee Jr., R.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The current study was prompted by our recent demonstration that calcineurin is a critical effector of a calcium-dependent signaling pathway that acts to inhibit adipocyte differentiation (28Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given this role of calcineurin and the known expression of NFAT proteins in preadipocytes (25Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we wished to examine the potential role of the NFAT signaling pathway in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. To address this question, we took advantage of a previously characterized constitutively active NFATc1 mutant (caNFATc1) that is known to constitutively localize to the nucleus, bind DNA with high affinity, and activate endogenous chromatin-embedded NFAT target genes (29Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have used this constitutively active mutant to examine the effects of sustained NFATc1 activation on the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Remarkably, we find that whereas ectopic expression of this NFATc1 mutant in 3T3-L1 cells is able to potently inhibit their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes, it is also sufficient to induce these immortalized cells to acquire the well established hallmarks of cellular transformation (30Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22249) Google Scholar). Hence, we find that cells expressing caNFATc1 (a) lose contact-mediated growth inhibition, (b) exhibit reduced serum growth requirements, (c) are protected from growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis, (d) gain growth factor autonomy and continue to proliferate in the absence of serum as a result of an NFATc1-induced autocrine regulatory growth loop, (e) undergo anchorage-independent cell growth in semisolid media, and (f) form tumors in athymic nude mice. Taken together, these results indicate that sustained NFATc1 activity is able to subvert the mechanisms that regulate the normal cell growth and differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and is sufficient to induce these immortalized cells to adopt a transformed cell phenotype, thereby establishing the oncogenic potential of the NFATc1 transcription factor. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC) were cultured in growth medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). To induce adipocyte differentiation, cells were grown until 2 days postconfluence (day 0), then treated for 2 days with growth medium plus MDI (0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine, 1 ॖmdexamethasone, and 10 ॖg/ml insulin; all from Sigma). The cells were refed with growth medium containing 10 ॖg/ml insulin at day 2 and every 2 days thereafter with growth medium alone. After 10 days, cells were fixed with formalin and stained with the lipophilic dye Oil Red O (Sigma) as previously described (28Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Stained cells were either photographed directly or counterstained with Giemsa and visualized by bright field microscopy. The retroviral expression vectors pMSCV-GFP and pMSCV-caNFATc1 have been previously described (29Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recombinant retroviruses were produced by co-transfecting either the pMSCV-GFP or pMSCV-caNFATc1 proviral vectors together with pVSV-G (Clontech), encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein, into the GP293 pantrophic packaging cell line (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Medium was replaced after 24 h, and viral supernatants were harvested 2 days post-transfection and stored at −80 °C. For infections, 5 × 104 3T3-L1 cells were plated per well of a six-well plate. The next day, medium was replaced with 2 ml of viral supernatant containing 8 ॖg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1.5 h at room temperature. After removal of the viral supernatant, cells were expanded in growth medium for subsequent analysis and typically used within 5–7 days of infection. To ensure reproducibility, each experiment was repeated using cells derived from independent viral infections and independently derived retroviral stocks. Flow cytometric analysis of green fluorescent protein routinely revealed that greater than 957 of cells were virally infected. Protein extracts prepared from cells harvested at the indicated times following induction of differentiation or withdrawal of serum were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the relevant antibody (Ab). The Abs PPARγ (H-100), C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPऔ (H-7), C/EBPδ (C-22), cyclin D (H-295), c-Myc (N-262), and actin (C-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); Rb (G3–245) was purchased from BD Pharmingen. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) on the indicated day after the induction of differentiation. RNA samples (10 ॖg) were separated using 1.27 agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immobilized RNA was hybridized with a32P-radiolabeled murine aP2 probe cDNA probe (ATCC) and visualized by exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. X-AR film. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe as a loading control. For focus-forming studies, 3T3-L1 cells infected with either the control MSCV-GFP or the MSCV-caNFATc1 viruses were diluted 1:30 with uninfected wild type 3T3-L1 cells. These were plated at a final density of 1 × 104 cells/well of a six-well plate, and the growth medium was changed every 2 days. After 2 weeks, the cells were visualized by both phase-contrast microscopy and fluorescence microscopy for detection of GFP expression. Subsequently, the plates were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with methanol and then stained with 0.47 methylene blue in 0.5 m sodium acetate to visualize foci. 3T3-L1 cells infected with either the control MSCV-GFP or the MSCV-caNFATc1 virus were plated in triplicate. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed three times with DMEM and cultured in DMEM supplemented with either 10, 0.5, or 07 (v/v) FCS. At the indicated times after the medium change, cells were trypsinized and enumerated with a Coulter particle counter set to record events between 7 and 25 ॖm. On the indicated day following medium exchange, cells were trypsinized, washed once with growth medium and twice with sample buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 g/liter glucose), and fixed in ice-cold 707 ethanol. At least 24 h later, 5 × 105 fixed cells were stained for 30 min in 0.5 ml of sample buffer containing 50 ॖg/ml propidium iodide and 100 units/ml RNase A. Analysis of cellular DNA content was determined by collecting 10,000 events using a FACScaliber flow cytometer and CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). 3T3-L1 cells infected with either the control MSCV-GFP or the MSCV-caNFATc1 virus were grown until they had achieved 807 confluence and then washed three times with DMEM and cultured in DMEM lacking serum for a further 2 days. The medium from each cell population was then collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min to yield a debris-free supernatant of serum-free conditioned medium. Where indicated, the conditioned medium was heated to 94 °C for 20 min prior to use. To determine the effects of serum-free conditioned medium on cell growth and survival, wild type 3T3-L1 cells at 207 confluence were washed three times in DMEM and then cultured in a 1:1 mix of the appropriate conditioned medium and an equal volume of fresh DMEM. For adipocyte differentiation assays, serum-free conditioned medium was combined with an equal volume of DMEM containing 207 FCS, which was then used to induce adipocyte differentiation as described above. To assay cells for growth in methylcellulose medium, 60-mm Petri dishes were coated with 17 agarose to resist cell adhesion. Cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in 8 ml of growth medium containing 1.87 methylcellulose and allowed to grow in the Petri dishes for 4 weeks, after which representative colonies were photographed, and colonies were counted. For analysis of tumorigenic potential in vivo, cells that had been infected with either the control MSCV-GFP or the MSCV-caNFATc1 virus were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Athymicnu/nu mice (Harlan) were injected subcutaneously in each flank with 1 × 106 cells, and tumor volume was determined after 16 days using a previously described formula (31Janik P. Briand P. Hartmann N.R. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 3698-3704PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified calcineurin as a critical intrinsic component of a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway involved in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation (28Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since NFAT proteins are known to be directly activated by calcineurin and are also known to be expressed in 3T3-L1 cells (25Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we initially examined whether increased NFAT activity could affect adipogenesis. For this experiment, we took advantage of our previously characterized caNFATc1 mutant that is known to be constitutively localized to the nucleus, able to bind DNA with high affinity, and capable of activating endogenous gene expression (29Porter C.M. Clipstone N.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4936-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To facilitate efficient gene transfer, the caNFATc1 cDNA was introduced into the MSCV-GFP retroviral vector under the transcriptional control of the MSCV-long terminal repeat and upstream of an internal ribosome entry site-GFP expression cassette, thereby allowing the expression of both caNFATc1 and GFP from a single bicistronic mRNA. We have previously shown that we are able to generate high titer virus capable of routinely infecting >957 of 3T3-L1 cells by pseudotyping our recombinant retroviruses with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-G (28Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49776-49781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This high level of infection obviates the process of isolating and expanding clonal cell lines and allows analysis of bulk populations of cells immediately after infection. To determine the effects of sustained NFATc1 signaling on adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells were infected with either a retrovirus encoding caNFATc1 (MSCV-caNFATc1) or the control MSCV-GFP retrovirus and then induced to differentiate using a well established adipocyte differentiation protocol that involves exposure to the MDI adipogenic mixture. As shown in Fig.1A, cells infected with the control MSCV-GFP virus and treated with MDI readily differentiated into morphologically distinct fat-laden adipocytes, as assessed by staining with the neutral lipid-specific dye, Oil Red O. In contrast, 3T3-L1 cells expressing caNFATc1 failed to differentiate into mature adipocytes, based upon both morphological criteria and a lack of specific staining with Oil Red O. This lack of differentiation was confirmed by analyzing cells for their expression of both the adipocyte-specific marker gene aP2 and the critical proadipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. Whereas control cells expressed aP2, PPARγ, and C/EBPα following treatment with MDI, the expression of these gene products was undetectable in MDI-treated, caNFATc1-expressing cells (Fig. 1, B–D). However, ectopic expression of caNFATc1 did not completely disrupt all responses of 3T3-L1 cells to the MDI adipogenic stimuli. Treatment of caNFATc1-expressing cells with MDI induced expression of C/EBPऔ and C/EBPδ, two early transcription factors in the adipogenic cascade, with similar kinetics to those observed in control cells (Fig. 1,E and F). Taken together, these data suggest that sustained activation of the NFATc1 signaling pathway inhibits the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes by preventing the expression of the critical proadipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. When we initially analyzed 3T3-L1 cells expressing caNFATc1, we noticed that they exhibited a very different cellular morphology compared with either control 3T3-L1 cells or cells infected with the control MSCV-GFP virus. Whereas control 3T3-L1 cells and cells infected with control MSCV-GFP virus were relatively uniform in size and shape and represented a typical fibroblast morphology, cells expressing caNFATc1 adopted a wider range of morphologies, including many tracts of highly refractile spindle-like cells interspersed with occasional large, flat cells (Fig.2A). Moreover, unlike control cells that stopped growing once they had reached confluence, we found that cells expressing caNFATc1 overgrew the monolayer and continued to proliferate beyond confluence (Fig. 2B). In fact, visual inspection of caNFATc1-expressing cells under the microscope revealed that they accumulated in dense mutilayers of cells growing on top of one another. These observations suggested that expression of caNFATc1 had caused these 3T3-L1 cells to lose contact-mediated growth inhibition, one of the known hallmarks of cellular transformation (30Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22249) Google Scholar). To more clearly visualize this phenotype, we performed a focus-forming assay in which a small number of either MSCV-GFP- or MSCV-caNFATc1-infected cells were mixed together with an excess of uninfected wild type 3T3-L1 cells and then grown in culture for 10–14 days and analyzed for the formation of transformed foci by either methylene blue staining or direct microscopy. Whereas cells infected with the control MSCV-GFP virus did not give rise to any foci as detected by methylene blue staining, we found that caNFATc1-expressing cells formed numerous foci (Fig. 2C). Because caNFATc1 and GFP are expressed from the same bicistronic mRNA in the MSCV-caNFATc1 retroviral vector, both caNFATc1-expressing cells and cells infected with the control retrovirus can be readily discriminated from wild type uninfected 3T3-L1 cells on the basis of their GFP expression. This allowed us to identify cells infected with either the MSCV-caNFATc1 or control MSCV-GFP retrovirus, which in turn allowed us to evaluate their cellular and colony morphologies. As a result of this analysis, we found that all of the caNFATc1-expressing cells in the mixed cultures formed readily detectable foci, whereas cells infected with the control MSCV-GFP virus were morphologically indistinguishable from their uninfected neighboring cells (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggest that expression of caNFATc1 in 3T3-L1 cells promotes the loss of contact-mediated growth inhibition and induces these cells to form foci in culture. Having demonstrated that ectopic expression of caNFATc1 promotes the proliferation of 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of 107 FCS, we next investigated whether caNFATc1 could affect cell proliferation under reduced serum conditions. As shown in Fig.3, control 3T3-L1 cells cultured in medium containing only 0.57 FCS fail to proliferate (Fig.3A) and accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle after a 24-h period (Fig. 3B). In contrast, we found that caNFATc1-expressing cells steadily continue to proliferate under these reduced serum conditions (Fig. 3A) and maintain a cell cycle profile typical of actively dividing cells (Fig.3B). Since cells expressing caNFATc1 appeared to overcome the G1cell cycle arrest induced by low serum conditions, we next examined the effects of caNFATc1 on the expression of the cell cycle-related genes cyclin D, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and c-myc, which are all known to play a role in cell cycle progression. Within 24 h of shifting to reduced serum conditions, the expression of the d-type cyclin proteins, which is known to be dependent upon the presence of mitogenic growth factors (32Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar), was significantly diminished in control cells. In contrast, the levels of cyclin D1 and D2 were maintained at a high level in caNFATc1-expressing cells, even after 48 h in the presence of reduced serum (Fig. 3C). Since cyclin d-dependent protein kinases are known to contribute toward cell cycle progression by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting the growth-inhibitory activity of the Rb cell cycle regulatory protein (33Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4960) Google Scholar), we next examined the ef"

Here we show that sediments from the Santa Barbara Basin deposited during warm intervals in the last glacial period contain molecular fossils that are diagnostic of aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs. Sediment intervals with high abundances of these compounds indicate episodes of vigorous methanotrophic activity in methane-laden water masses. Signals for anaerobic methanotrophy in 44,100-year-old sediment are evidence for particularly intense methane emissions and suggest that the basin's methane cycle can profoundly affect oxygen budgets in the water column."
https://openalex.org/W2073848824,"Placoderms are extinct jawed fishes of the class Placodermi and are basal among jawed vertebrates. It is generally thought that teeth are absent in placoderms and that the phylogenetic origin of teeth occurred after the evolution of jaws. However, we now report the presence of tooth rows in more derived placoderms, the arthrodires. New teeth are composed of gnathostome-type dentine and develop at specific locations. Hence, it appears that these placoderm teeth develop and are regulated as in other jawed vertebrates. Because tooth development occurs only in derived forms of placoderms, we suggest that teeth evolved at least twice, through a mechanism of convergent evolution."

Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of RecA is involved in monomer-monomer interactions (1Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 3Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of RecA protein consists of residues 270–352, the last 24 of which are disordered in the apoenzyme crystal structure (1Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 2Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues, which we will refer to as the C terminus (as opposed to the entire domain). Over half of these terminal 25 residues have side chains that are either negatively charged (7 of the last 17 are Glu or Asp residues) or contain hydroxyl groups (six Ser or Thr residues) (Fig.1). Positively charged amino acid side chains are absent. Other ssDNA1-binding proteins such as single-stranded binding protein (SSB) of E. coli and the gene 32 protein of phage T4 also have highly negatively charged C-terminal regions. Upon C-terminal deletion to remove these negative charges, SSB and the gene 32 protein show increased dsDNA affinities relative to the intact proteins (11Williams K.R. Spicer E.K. LoPresti M.B. Guggenheimer R.A. Chase J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3346-3355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S. Paul L. von Hippel P. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Primary structure provides few clues to the function of the RecA C terminus. Sequence conservation in this part of the protein is quite limited even when comparisons are limited to other bacterial RecA proteins. The major feature of the primary structure in the E. coli protein is the preponderance of negatively charged residues in this region. This feature is found in most but not all other bacterial RecA sequences. A few RecA proteins, notably fromBacteroides and Mycoplasma species, lack this protein segment altogether (4Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a few other species, particularlyStreptomyces, the C terminus is lengthened and exhibits a preponderance of positively charged residues (4Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a general lack of structural information about the RecA C terminus, there has been little indication that this part of the protein has functional significance. Several C-terminal deletion mutants of the E. coli RecA protein have been characterized. Ogawa and colleagues (13Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) characterized RecAΔC25 (RecA5327), and Benedict and Kowalczykowski (14Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described a RecA mutant in which a fragment of the protein, about 15% of the of the RecA polypeptide, was missing from the C terminus. The primary reported effect of these deletions was a faster nucleation, leading to filament formation on dsDNA, reducing the telltale lag in dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis that is well documented with wild-type RecA (15Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the negatively charged C terminus of RecA regulates the binding of RecA to dsDNA by electrostatically repelling the phosphate backbone of the DNA (13Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both C-terminal deletion mutants were shown to be proficient in the key RecA protein reaction of DNA pairing, and the RecAΔC25 protein promoted significant levels of final product formation during DNA strand exchange under at least two sets of conditions. Somewhat shorter C-terminal deletions of RecA protein have also been constructed and characterized. A 17-residue C-terminal deletion mutant was shown not to affect UV resistance, induction of the SOS response, or Weigle reactivation (17Larminat F. Defais M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The same study showed that this mutant had a minimal effect on recombination when expressed by itself. A small effect on conjugational recombination was observed only when the wild-type and mutant proteins were both present in vivo(17Larminat F. Defais M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The removal of about 18 residues from the C terminus resulted in a substantial conformational difference in RecA filaments bound to dsDNA, as observed in three-dimensional reconstructions of electron microscopy images (18Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The biochemistry of these C-terminal deletion mutants was not explored. We have initiated an effort to explore the function of the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues of RecA protein in more detail. To better define what parts of this segment are involved in activity changes, we have constructed a set of C-terminal deletion mutations, removing 6, 13, and 17 amino acid residues. These remove 3, 6, and 7 of the negatively charged amino acid residues, respectively (Fig.1). The RecA protein mutant with 25 amino acids removed from the C terminus was also included in part to provide a reference point with which to compare our results with those previously published by Ogawa and co-workers (13Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The first study examines the effects of these mutations on cell survival and on fundamental in vitro properties of RecA protein. E. coli SSB was purified as described (19Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified SSB protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.83 × 104m−1 cm−1 (20Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSB was also purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Fisher and were of the highest grade available.EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. ATPγS was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DTT and TAPS were obtained from Research Organics. CHES, MES, HEPES, lysozyme, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate kinase, ATP, polyethyleneimine, bromphenol blue, mitomycin C, and NADH were purchased from Sigma. XhoI restriction endonuclease and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow resin were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Hydroxyapatite resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was purchased from BioVectra. P buffer contained 20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. R buffer contained 20 mmTris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. TAE buffer contained 40 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation) and 1 mm EDTA. Luria-Burtani medium (LB broth) is 10 g/liter trypone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 10 g/liter NaCl, with pH adjusted to 7.0. M9 minimal medium is 12.8 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1.0 g/liter NH4Cl, and 4% (w/v) glucose. Bacteriophage φX174 circular single-stranded DNA (virion) was purchased from New England Biolabs. φX174 RF I supercoiled circular duplex DNA was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length linear duplex DNA was generated by the digestion of φX174 RF I DNA (5386 bp) with the XhoI restriction endonuclease, using conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier. The digested DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation. Circular single-stranded and supercoiled circular duplex DNAs from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 nucleotides) was prepared using previously described methods (21Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 70-82Google Scholar, 22Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar, 23Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circular M13mp8 duplex DNA containing a single nick (nicked circular dsDNA) was generated using a previously described method (24Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 36 and 50 μg ml−1 A 260−1, respectively, as conversion factors. All DNA concentrations are given in μmnucleotides. A plasmid was constructed to express the wild-type E. coli RecA protein under the control of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The wild-type recA open reading frame (ORF) was cloned in two parts. The N-terminal coding region came from theNcoI-PstI fragment of plasmid pTRecA103, which was a gift from Kendall Knight (25Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PCR was used to generate the remaining coding region of the recA ORF using plasmid pGE226 as a template, kindly given by George Weinstock (26Weisemann J.M. Weinstock G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers were designed to amplify from the PstI site to the stop codon of the recA ORF with the introduction of a HindIII site just downstream of the stop codon. The full-length recAORF (NcoI-HindIII fragment) was cloned downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the AmpR plasmid pET21d(+) from Novagen to generate plasmid pAIR79. Both strands of therecA ORF were manually sequenced to ensure the integrity of the coding region. To overexpress the wild-type RecA protein, pAIR79 was co-transformed with pT7POL26 (KanR) into the multiply nuclease-deficient strain STL327 (exoI − exoIII − endoI − recJ −) provided by Susan Lovett. The strain is also named RDK1896 (27Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Plasmid pT7POL26 codes for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of a lac promoter (28Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Eight liters of culture were grown in LB broth to an A 600of 0.5, and RecA protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, ∼20 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. The recAΔC6, recAΔC13, andrecAΔC17 genes were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel selection method (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). An EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pAIR79 coding for the C terminus region of the recA ORF was cloned into the AmpR plasmid pGEM3Zf(−) from Promega to create plasmid pAIR34. This plasmid was used as the template for the in vitro mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides encoding stop codons were used to introduce new translational stop sites at the appropriate positions in the C-terminal coding region. Both strands of the subcloned region were manually sequenced to ensure that no other mutations were introduced during mutagenesis. Cloning was used to swap these C-terminal coding regions into plasmid pAIR79. The plasmid containing the recAΔC25 gene (pTH5327) was a gift from Tomoko Ogawa (13Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing the mutant genes recAΔC6,recAΔC13, and recAΔC17, designated pAIR64, -45, and -46, respectively, were each co-transformed with pT7POL26 (KanR) (28Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) into the nuclease deficient strain STL2669 (ΔrecA-srlR)306::Tn10 TetR, xonA2 (exoI −) in an AB1157-derived genotypic background; a gift from Susan Lovett). Culture growth and protein induction conditions were the same as for the wild-type RecA protein. The genes encoding the wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins were each integrated into the identical site on the chromosome (base 1899 of the rmlD gene of MG1655 ΔrecA tetS 127fRT#1/pLH29 (30Huang L.C. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6076-6083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the FLIRT system (30Huang L.C. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6076-6083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLIRT makes use of the Flp site-specific recombination system to efficiently introduce cloned DNA onto the bacterial chromosome. In each case, the proteins were expressed from the wild-type recA promoter. The plasmids used to introduce wild-typerecA, recAΔC6, recAΔC13, andrecAΔC17 to the chromosome are designated pEAW 222, 232, 230, and 229, respectively. The wild-type recA promoter was added to the start of each recA gene by including the 200 base pairs of the DNA sequence upstream of the recA gene in MG1655 (a gift from George Weinstock). Multiple attempts to clone therecAΔC25 gene onto the chromosome in the same manner as the others were unsuccessful. 10 ml of LB broth was inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight culture of the ΔrecA MG1655 strain containing the wild-type recA,recAΔC6, recAΔ13, orrecAΔC17 genes described above and grown for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted in a clinical centrifuge and washed with 5 ml of M9 minimal medium. Cells were pelleted again and resuspended in 5 ml of M9 minimal medium. Cells were diluted further in M9 to an A 600 of 0.06 in a volume of 5 ml. Further serial 1:10 dilutions were made in M9 to optimize cell density to obtain ∼30–100 colonies per experiment. The various dilutions (50 μl of each) were plated on LB agar plates. Uncovered plates were exposed to UV using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker, model 1800 (Stratagene) in a darkened room at the J/m2 indicated in the figure. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark. Colonies were counted using GelExpert software (Nucleotech) and adjusted for dilutions. Mitomycin C and ionizing radiation sensitivity tests were performed as with the UV tests above except that diluted cells were plated on LB agar plates containing the indicated amount of mitomycin C or exposed to ionizing radiation in a model 30 Mark I 137 cesium irradiator (J. L. Shepard and Associates) for times necessary to achieve the indicated dose and incubated overnight in the dark. Wild-type RecA protein was purified using modifications to previously described protocols (31Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell paste (20 g) was thawed and fully resuspended in 80 ml of a solution of 25% (w/v) sucrose and 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by a 60-min incubation with 40 ml of a 5 mg/ml solution of lysozyme in 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), followed by the addition of 50 ml of 25 mm EDTA, sonication, and centrifugation. The lysate was precipitated with 22 ml of 5% (w/v) polyethyleneimine, pH 7.5 (0.5% final concentration), and centrifuged. The pellet was washed with 50 ml of R buffer plus 150 mmammonium sulfate and extracted two times with 25 ml of R buffer plus 300 mm ammonium sulfate. The protein solution was precipitated by the addition of 0.28 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution (48% saturation). The resulting pellet was washed two times with R buffer plus 2.1 m ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 50 ml of R buffer plus 50 mm KCl, and dialyzed versus the same. The protein was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column and washed with two column volumes of R buffer plus 50 mm KCl. Flow-through peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed versus P buffer. Protein was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column, washed with two column volumes of P buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient from 20–350 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) over 10 column volumes. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, concentrated with Centricon Plus-20, 10,000-dalton molecular mass cut-off concentrators (Amicon) or by ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspension in R buffer, dialyzed into R buffer, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of the wild-type RecA protein (37,842 Da) was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 2.23 × 104m−1cm−1 (33Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was free of detectable nuclease activities. The deletion mutants RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, and RecAΔC25 were purified using the following modifications to the wild-type RecA procedure from above. (a) The initial polyethyleneimine pellet was washed with R buffer plus 50 mm ammonium sulfate and extracted two times with R buffer plus 150 mm ammonium sulfate. The RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins were precipitated with 0.31 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution (48% saturation). The RecAΔC25 protein solution was precipitated with 0.28 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution. The RecAΔC25 protein was precipitated from the supernatant fraction after centrifugation with an additional 0.113 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution (to 65% saturation). Each deletion mutant protein was resuspended in R buffer plus 300 mm KCl, dialyzed one time versus the same buffer and then two times versus R + 100 mmKCl for the RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins andversus R buffer for the RecAΔC25 protein. (b) All deletion mutants were eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column with a linear gradient of KCl, from 100 to 500 mm for the RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins and from 0 to 500 mm for the RecAΔC25 protein. All proteins eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column at ∼250 mm KCl. (c) The calculated molecular masses of the RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, and RecAΔC25 proteins are 36,999, 36,200, 35,680 and 34,783 Da, respectively. Each mutant protein was determined to be greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and free of detectable nuclease activities. The wild-type RecA extinction coefficient was used to calculate the concentration of each mutant protein. A modified Alcian method was used to visualize RecA filaments and unreacted DNA if present. Activated grids were prepared as follows. 0.2% Alcian in 3% acetic acid was left for many days to dissolve and then centrifuged in a Millipore 0.22-μm filter unit at 5000 rpm for 40 min. 25 μl of the clear solution was diluted with 500 μl of distilled water. A carbon film (attached to an electron microscope grid) was floated on a 70-μl drop of this solution (placed on a Teflon block) for 10 min. The film was then washed by touching to a drop of water and finally floated on two 3-ml drops of water, each for 5 min. After the final wash, an empty 5-μl glass pipette was used to draw off remaining liquid from the edge of the grid by capillary action. The activated grid was then dried under a heat lamp. Samples for electron microscopy analysis were prepared as follows. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. wild-type RecA or RecAΔC17 protein (6.7 μm) was preincubated with 20 μm M13mp8 circular ssDNA, 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation) buffer, 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and 10 mmMg(OAc)2 for 10 min. An ATP regeneration system of 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 5 mm PEP was also included in the preincubation. ATP and SSB protein were added to 3 mmand 2 μm, respectively, and the reaction was incubated for 10 min longer, after which ATPγS was added to 3 mm to stabilize the filaments and incubated for 5 min. An 8-μl sample of the reaction mixture described above was diluted 17-fold with 200 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), and 10% glycerol and adsorbed to the activated carbon film for 3 min. The grid was then touched to a drop of the above buffer followed by floating on a drop of the same buffer for 1 min. The sample was stained by touching to a drop of 5% uranyl acetate followed by floating on a fresh drop of the same solution. Finally, the grid was washed by touching to a drop of water followed by immersion in two 10-ml beakers of water and one beaker of ethyl alcohol. After the sample was dried, it was rotary-shadowed with platinum. This protocol is designed for visualization of complete reaction mixtures, and no attempt was made to remove unreacted material. Although this approach should yield results that give a true insight into reaction components, it does lead to samples with a high background of unreacted proteins. Photography and measurement of filament and DNA length were performed as described previously (34Littlewood R.K. Inman R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1691-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (35Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was used to measure the DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, and RecAΔC25 proteins. The regeneration of ATP from PEP and ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and followed by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm (380-nm wavelength was used so that the signal remained within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment). The assays were carried out on a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficient at 380 nm of 1.21 mm−1cm−1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mmTris-OAc (80% cation), MES (33% anion), or Tris-OAc (56% cation) for a reaction pH of 7.3, 6.0, or 8.0, respectively, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmMg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.2 mm PEP for reactions with single-stranded DNA or 3.0 mm PEP for reactions with duplex DNA), a coupling system (3 mm NADH and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase), and the concentration of DNA and wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, or RecAΔC25 proteins indicated in the table or figure legends. Unless otherwise noted, ATPase assays that included RecAΔC25 protein also included an additional 40 mm potassium glutamate. The aforementioned components were incubated for 10 min. The assay was initiated by the addition of the SSB protein (to 0.8 μm) and the concentration of ATP indicated in the figure legends. SSB protein was omitted from reactions with nicked circular dsDNA. Three-strand exchange reactions were carried out in 25 mm buffer (varied as indicated to alter pH), 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mmpotassium glutamate, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. The buffers used were MES (33% anion, pH 6.0), MES (44% anion, pH 6.2), MES (55% anion, pH 6.4), MES (61% anion, pH 6.5), MES (76% anion, pH 6.9), HEPES (24% cation, pH 7.0), Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.3), HEPES (39% cation, pH 7.3), HEPES (56% cation, pH 7.6), Tris-OAc (56% cation, pH 8.0), Tris-OAc (39% cation, pH 8.3), TAPS (44% anion, pH 8.4), CHES (17% anion, pH 8.5), Tris-OAc (20% cation, pH 8.7), TAPS (72% anion, pH 8.8), CHES (33% anion, pH 8.9) for the indicated reaction pH. In each case, the reported pH is the expected final pH of the reaction mixture, obtained by determining the pH of a model reaction mixture containing all reaction components but substituting TE buffer for the DNA additions and the appropriate protein storage buffers for each protein addition. Reactions also contained an ATP regeneration system of 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3.2 mm PEP. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. The following are final concentrations. The wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, or RecAΔC25 protein (6.7 μm) was preincubated with 20 μm φX174 ci"
https://openalex.org/W2018258194,"The UNC5Hs are axon guidance receptors that mediate netrin-1-dependent chemorepulsion, and dependence receptors that mediate netrin-1-independent apoptosis. Here, we report an interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE. Our experiments show that this interaction is responsible for apoptosis induced by UNC5H1, and this level of apoptosis is greater than the amount induced by either UNC5H2 or UNC5H3. We mapped the NRAGE binding domain of UNC5H1 to its ZU-5 domain and show that this region, in addition to an adjacent PEST sequence, is required for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis. Chimeric UNC5H2 and UNC5H3 receptors, containing the NRAGE binding domain and PEST sequence of UNC5H1, bind NRAGE and cause increased levels of apoptosis. UNC5H1 expression does not induce apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells, which down-regulate NRAGE, but induces apoptosis in native PC12 cells that endogenously express high levels of NRAGE and in differentiated PC12 cells when NRAGE is overexpressed. Together, these results demonstrate a mechanism for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis that requires an interaction with the MAGE protein NRAGE. The UNC5Hs are axon guidance receptors that mediate netrin-1-dependent chemorepulsion, and dependence receptors that mediate netrin-1-independent apoptosis. Here, we report an interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE. Our experiments show that this interaction is responsible for apoptosis induced by UNC5H1, and this level of apoptosis is greater than the amount induced by either UNC5H2 or UNC5H3.

Honarpour N. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The execution phase of the apoptotic program in neurons is well characterized and, as with most cell types, depends on the activation of intracellular proteases, primarily caspases (2Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is not well understood how cues from the environment regulate this process during development of the nervous system. UNC-5 was originally characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans as a gene required for axonal repulsion in netrin/UNC-6 responsive neurons (3Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Hall D.H.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), comprise a subgroup of the Ig superfamily of receptors. The UNC5s contain two Ig and two thrombospondin type-I repeats in the extracellular domain. In addition, their cytoplasmic domains contain regions of homology with other proteins: 1) a ZU-5 domain homologous to Zona Occludens-1, a protein implicated in tight-junction formation (8Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar); and 2) a C-terminal death domain, a domain first identified as the pro-apoptotic region of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (9Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 10Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In a netrin-1 gradient, a complex of UNC5H1 and DCC mediates repulsion (11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), although there is evidence suggesting that short range repulsion by netrin-1 may be mediated by UNC5 alone (3Hedgecock E.M.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). NRAGE (Dlxin-1, MAGE-D1) is a recently identified molecule belonging to the MAGE (melanoma antigen) protein family. There are currently over 25 MAGE proteins in humans, characterized by the presence of a MAGE homology domain. The expression of many MAGE proteins is restricted to cancer cells (12Barker P.A. Salehi A. J Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar); however, recent studies have revealed a role for two MAGE proteins in the nervous system. One MAGE family member, necdin, is thought to maintain the differentiated state of post-mitotic neurons by preventing entry into the cell cycle (13Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Hayashi Y. Matsuyama K. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another MAGE family member, NRAGE, is expressed in the nervous system during early development in proliferative neural populations (15Kendall S.E. Goldhawk D.E. Kubu C. Barker P.A. Verdi J.M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported two major functions for NRAGE, as a transcriptional regulator for the dlx/msx family of transcription factors (16Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Sasaki A. Masuda Y. Iwai K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22541-22546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and as a regulator of apoptosis. The first study to implicate NRAGE in apoptosis found that NRAGE binds the nerve growth factor receptor p75NTR, blocks cell cycle progression, and promotes p75NTR-mediated apoptosis (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found to utilize two mechanisms to induce apoptosis in cells. One involves NRAGE-dependent degradation of the survival protein XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) (19Jordan B.W. Dinev D. LeMellay V. Troppmair J. Gotz R. Wixler L. Sendtner M. Ludwig S. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39985-39989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the other involves NRAGE-dependent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and caspases (20Salehi A.H. Xanthoudakis S. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48043-48050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recently a role has begun to emerge for netrin-1 receptors in apoptosis. In this paper, we report that UNC5H1 mediates more than twice the amount of cell death as UNC5H2 and UNC5H3, and we identify NRAGE as a specific binding partner for UNC5H1. UNC5H1 binds NRAGEin vitro and can be co-immunoprecipitated from cells that endogenously express both proteins. Both the apoptotic region and NRAGE binding domain of UNC5H1 map to its juxtamembrane region that contains a PEST sequence and ZU-5 domain. We find that chimeric UNC5H2 and UNC5H3 proteins containing the PEST and ZU-5 sequence of UNC5H1 bind NRAGE and induce increased levels of apoptosis. UNC5H1 and NRAGE co-localize at the cell membrane in heterologous cells and are co-expressed in several regions of the developing nervous system. Using PC12 cells, we show that UNC5H1 expression induces apoptosis in native, mitotically active cells that endogenously express high levels of NRAGE but not in differentiated cells that sharply down-regulate NRAGE. We also show that UNC5H1 induces apoptosis in these differentiated PC12 cells when NRAGE is over-expressed. Taken together our data identify a novel signaling mechanism for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis that requires an interaction with NRAGE. Full-length rat unc5h1and unc5h2 were cloned into pSecTagB (Invitrogen), which contains a C-terminal myc tag as described previously (6Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Ackerman S.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 1997; 386: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). All other unc5h mutant constructs were generated in pSecTagB by PCR cloning using the flanking restriction sitesHindIII to XbaI and placed in-frame with themyc tag included within the vector. H2/H1apo and H3/H1apo were constructed using PCR to delete the juxtamembrane region of UNC5H2 (amino acids Asp407-Cys625) and UNC5H3 (amino acids Glu410-Cys612), and this region was replaced with a NotI site. Then, the apoptotic region of UNC5H1 (amino acids Leu391-Cys579) was generated by PCR with flanking NotI sites and inserted into the new NotI site in unc5h2 andunc5h3. unc5h3 was also cloned in-frame with themyc tag of pSecTagB using the EcoRI andXbaI sites. Full-length mouse nrage was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with a 5′ HA1 tag as described previously (16Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). unc5h1myc and HA-nrage, including a consensus Kozak and start site, were cloned into the sindbis virus vector pSinRep5 (Invitrogen). All PCR products were verified by sequencing. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and transfected using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 horse serum, 57 fetal bovine serum, and 307 PC12 conditioned medium and grown on collagen-coated dishes. Cells were differentiated for 14 days by incubating in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 ng/ml purified NGF (Sigma). sindbis virus expressing UNC5H1 was packaged in baby hamster kidney cells as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), and undiluted virus was used to infect native and differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were fixed for immunostaining in 47 PFA + 0.17 Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, and blocked in PBS + 37 heat-inactivated goat serum + 0.17 Triton X-100 for 30 min. Primary antibody in blocking buffer was added for 60 min at room temperature followed by three washes for 5 min each. Fluorescent secondary antibody was diluted and incubated on cells for 40 min and washed three times before coverslipping. To determine the percent of pyknotic nuclei using DAPI stain, cells were incubated in DAPI diluted in PBS to 1 ॖg/ml for 5 min before coverslipping. Cells were visualized under fluorescence, and a total of at least 300 transfected cells were scored for pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic morphology. Each transfection was repeated and scored at least three times in a blind manner by multiple researchers. The UNC5H1 antibody 6E9 was raised against the extracellular domain of UNC5H1. 2S. Faynboym, L. Hinck, E. D. Leonardo, and M. Tessier-Lavigne, unpublished information. The NRAGE rabbit polyclonal was used in Western blotting at 1:200 (16Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Anti-myc 9E10 and anti-HA 12CA5 were used for both immunostaining and Western blotting at 1 ॖg/ml. The E18 mouse brain library was made according to manufacturer's instructions using the Stratagene cDNA synthesis kit and ligating into the EcoRI/XhoI sites in pACT2 (Clontech), which contains a Gal4 activating domain. H1ICD was cloned by PCR into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pBTM116 in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain (11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). DNA was transformed into the L40 yeast strain stably transformed with a LexA-driven HIS3 gene and LexA-driven LacZ gene (21Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for the ability to grow on minus histidine plates supplemented with 30 mm3-amino1,2,4-triazole and subsequently screened for the ability to produce LacZ. Rip60NRAGE in pcDNA3 was translated and labeled with [35S]methionine using the in vitro translation system (Promega). In vitro translated rip60NRAGE was incubated in buffer (0.57 Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 107 glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) with 5 ॖg of GST-H1ICD or GST control bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The samples were rocked for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with binding buffer, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE for autoradiography. COS or PC12 cells were immunoprecipitated as described (11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 17 TritonX-100, 107 glycerol) containing aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1 ॖg/ml each. The sample was rocked at 4 °C for 40 min and then pelleted in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm (full speed) for 20 min. The supernatant was then incubated with antibody prebound to protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 6 h at 4 °C. Western blots were visualized using ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). A portion of the ratunc5h1 intracellular domain (1480–2080 bp) was subcloned from cDNA into pBlueScript II. Similarly, the N terminus (1–873 bp) and C terminus (2025–2325 bp) of nrage cDNA were cloned into pBlueScript II. These constructs were used to make digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes. Brain tissue was prepared by immersion in 47 PFA for 2 h at room temperature, infiltrated with 307 sucrose, embedded in tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences), and frozen at −80 °C. 20-ॖm sections were brought to room temperature and post-fixed in 47 PFA. Next, sections were digested with 10 ॖg/ml proteinase K for 2 min, stopped in 0.27 glycine, and fixed in 47 PFA for 5 min. Tissue was acetylated in acetic anhydride for 10 min and permeabilized with PBS with 0.17 Triton X-100 for 30 min. Prehybridization solution (507 deionized formamide, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's, 1 mg/ml tRNA, 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm DNA) was added for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization solution including either digoxigenin-labeled UNC5H1 (900 ng/ml) or NRAGE (500 ng/ml) was added to serial sections and incubated overnight at 65 °C. Washes in 2× SSC/507 formamide for 1 h and 0.2× SSC for 1 h were followed by standard anti-digoxigenin detection protocols (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with detection in BM Purple. Statistical analyses including ANOVA with Tukey's post-test for multiple comparisons were performed using R version 1.6.1 and Microsoft Excel. NIH image 1.63 software was used to determine relative protein levels following Western analysis and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Based on earlier observations that the UNC5Hs may be involved in apoptotic processes (11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 22Llambi F. Causeret F. Bloch-Gallego E. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we directly assessed the ability of UNC5H1, UNC5H2, and UNC5H3 to induce apoptosis in heterologous cells. Apoptosis was assayed by immunohistochemistry to identify transfected cells and DAPI labeling to identify pyknotic nuclei, a standard indicator of apoptosis. The identification of pyknotic nuclei is not affected by differences in the efficiency of transient transfections, because cells are observed at single cell resolution and equal numbers of transfected cells are counted. GFP was transfected as a control to determine the basal rate of death due to culturing, transfecting, and overexpressing protein in COS cells. Fig. 1Ashows a representative image of UNC5H1 expressing cells that display condensed, fragmented nuclei and loss of adhesion, indicative of dying cells. This cell morphology is distinctly different compared with cells expressing UNC5H2 and UNC5H3 that maintain extensive cell processes and intact nuclei, indicative of healthy cells (Fig. 1A). Quantification of apoptotic nuclei reveals that UNC5H1 expression causes a dramatic increase in apoptotic cells (697) compared with the GFP control (127) (p = 0.001; Fig. 1B). UNC5H2 (247) and UNC5H3 (167) induce apoptosis over control cells (p = 0.01 for each; Fig. 1B) but at significantly lower levels than UNC5H1. Because UNC5H1 expression induces the most robust apoptosis in our assays, we focused on understanding the mechanism underlying the ability of UNC5H1 to induce apoptosis. To understand the signaling mechanism used by UNC5H1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed on a cDNA library generated from E18 murine brain tissue using the intracellular domain of UNC5H1 as bait. From 14 positive clones, we identified one, rip60NRAGE, as the C-terminal half of the pro-apoptotic protein NRAGE (Dlxin-1, MAGE-D1) (16Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The NRAGE amino acid sequence contains a repeat region consisting of 25 repeats of a WQXPXX consensus sequence followed by a MAGE homology domain. The rip60NRAGE clone begins at amino acid 411 and continues through the poly(A) tail of NRAGE and contains five WQXPXX repeats, the entire MAGE domain, and the C-terminal tail (Fig.2A). The interacting domains between UNC5H1 and NRAGE were mapped in yeast. The C-terminal tail of NRAGE, the last 100 amino acids, is required for binding the intracellular domain of UNC5H1 (H1ICD), but is not sufficient to interact on its own (Fig. 2A). Neither the WQXPXX repeat nor the MAGE domain alone were sufficient to interact with H1ICD; however, adding the C-terminal tail back onto the MAGE domain restores binding (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the C-terminal tail of NRAGE may directly bind UNC5H1, or the tail is needed for the MAGE domain to fold properly, allowing the MAGE domain to directly bind H1ICD. Similarly, we mapped the NRAGE binding site of UNC5H1. Deletions of H1ICD from the C terminus, including the death domain, interact with rip60NRAGE (Fig. 2A). Increasingly, C-terminal truncations of UNC5H1 interacted less well, possibly because they were subject to degradation. Therefore, we generated several N-terminal truncations of H1ICD and tested them for the ability to interact with rip60NRAGE. We found that removing the ZU-5 domain abolished binding with rip60NRAGE (Fig. 2A) and conclude that this region is necessary for the interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE. UNC5H1 possesses a unique ability to induce apoptosis at significantly higher levels than either UNC5H2 or UNC5H3 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to test whether the NRAGE interaction is specific to UNC5H1 or whether it interacts with other UNC5Hs. Fig. 2A shows that, in yeast, rip60NRAGE does not interact with either UNC5H2 or UNC5H3 and thus, our results suggest that UNC5H1 interacts specifically with NRAGE through its ZU-5 domain. To confirm that the UNC5H1-NRAGE interaction in yeast is the result of a direct protein-protein interaction, we performed an in vitro GST pull down assay. A purified GST-H1ICD fusion protein revealed a strong interaction with in vitro translated rip60NRAGE, whereas GST alone shows little nonspecific binding, indicating that the interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE is direct (Fig. 2B). Next, we tested whether UNC5H1 interacts with NRAGE in cells by co-immunoprecipitation. COS cells were transiently transfected with full-length unc5h1myc and full-length HA-nrage. Fig. 2C shows that immunoprecipitating with anti-Myc pulls down HA-NRAGE only when UNC5H1myc is present and not when cells are transfected with empty vector. Deleting the death domain of UNC5H1 (H1ΔDDmyc) does not affect the interaction with HA-NRAGE in cells, but deleting the entire intracellular domain of UNC5H1 (H1ΔICDmyc) abolishes the interaction (Fig. 2C). These results confirm our observations in yeast and identify the ZU-5 domain as the NRAGE binding domain. To explore the specificity of the interaction between NRAGE and UNC5H1 in cells, we also tested whether UNC5H2myc or UNC5H3myc co-immunoprecipitate with HA-NRAGE. Our results show that UNC5H2myc binds HA-NRAGE but at consistently lower levels than UNC5H1myc (Fig. 2C). Quantification of NRAGE from Western blots shows that UNC5H2myc co-immunoprecipitates ∼707 (±13) less NRAGE than UNC5H1myc, and no interaction between UNC5H3myc and HA-NRAGE is detected (Fig. 2C). Last, we examined the cellular localization of UNC5H1 and NRAGE in COS cells. Previous studies have shown that NRAGE is localized to multiple cellular compartments, including the cytosol, nucleus, and at the cell membrane (16Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because UNC5H1 is a transmembrane protein, we examined whether NRAGE is localized to the membrane in the presence of UNC5H1. Co-expression of UNC5H1myc and HA-NRAGE in COS cells shows strong co-localization between the two proteins at the cell membrane (Fig. 2D). For the interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE to be physiologically relevant, the two proteins must be present in the same place at the same time. It is already known that both unc5h1and nrage are highly expressed in the nervous system (6Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Ackerman S.L. Tessier-Lavigne M.

To determine specific sites of overlapping expression, we performed in situ hybridization analysis on serial sections from embryonic brain tissue. unc5h1 andnrage mRNA are found together in the E16 striatum and both are largely excluded from the neighboring subventricular zone (Fig. 3, A and C). The outer layers of the E16 cortex, including the cortical plate and the marginal zone, stain strongly for both unc5h1 andnrage transcripts (Fig. 3, E and F). We have noted several other sites of overlapping expression during development, including the E18 hippocampus (Fig. 3, G andH) and olfactory bulb and E11 motor neurons (data not shown). These data demonstrate that unc5h1 andnrage are co-localized in the nervous system, suggesting they may function together in vivo. The initial observation that UNC5H1 induces apoptosis was made in COS cells. Therefore, if NRAGE is required for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis, COS cells must express NRAGE endogenously. To test this hypothesis, we performed a Western blot on COS cell lysate using a polyclonal antibody against NRAGE. Fig. 4A shows that NRAGE appears to be abundant in COS cell lysates, and thus we decided to perform a structure/function analysis on the ability of UNC5H1 to induce apoptosis in these cells. To examine whether the interaction between UNC5H1 and NRAGE is required for cell death, we constructed several mutants of UNC5H1 and assayed these constructs for the ability to induce apoptosis. First, we assayed H1Δsac, a truncation that removes much of the intracellular domain, and found that H1Δsac induces significantly less apoptosis than full-length UNC5H1 (p = 0.002; Fig. 4B). Although this mutant removes the NRAGE binding domain, it also removes the death domain, a region of UNC5H1 shown by others to be required for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis (22Llambi F. Causeret F. Bloch-Gallego E. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To address this, we asked whether a construct deleted in only the death domain (H1ΔDD) induces apoptosis. Our results show that H1ΔDD does not significantly impede the ability of UNC5H1 to induce death in COS cells (Fig. 4B). Next, we made an UNC5H1 construct deleted in the DCC binding domain (H1ΔDB), because the UNC5H1 intracellular domain interacts with the netrin-1 receptor DCC (11Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M.

One possibility is that cell death induced by UNC5H1 is the result of a signal through endogenous DCC. Our results show that deleting the DCC binding domain has no effect on the ability of UNC5H1 to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Together, these results indicate that the ZU-5/NRAGE binding domain is required for UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis and rule out a role for both the death and DCC binding domains. We dramatically decreased apoptosis induced through UNC5H1 by deleting the NRAGE binding domain; however, we noticed that H1Δsac still causes apoptosis above the level in control cells expressing GFP (Fig.4B). Therefore, we removed the entire intracellular domain of UNC5H1 (H1ΔICD) to determine whether this completely abrogates the death signal. Fig. 4B shows that H1ΔICD eliminates UNC5H1 apoptosis to control levels. Sequence analysis of this 116-amino acid region between the end of the transmembrane domain and the start of the ZU-5 domain revealed the presence of a PEST sequence that is not conserved in either UNC5H2 or UNC5H3 (26Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 27Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). When we delete the PEST domain (H1ΔPEST) the UNC5H1 apoptotic signal is eliminated. These results suggest that most of the UNC5H1 death signal requires the presence of the NRAGE binding domain (ZU-5); however, some signaling requires only the unique PEST sequence of UNC5H1. Taken together, we identified the juxtamembrane region, consisting of the adjacent PEST and ZU-5 domains, as the primary signaling region in UNC5H1-mediated apoptosis and NRAGE binding. UNC5H1 expression induces the highest percent of apoptosis (697) in cells whereas UNC5H2 expression induces less than half (247), and UNC5H3 expression induces even less (167) (Fig. 1B). The same pattern is true for the UNC5Hs ability to interact with NRAGE. UNC5H1 directly binds NRAGE whereas UNC5H2 binds NRAGE relatively weakly, and UNC5H3 shows no binding (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the ability of UNC5Hs to induce apoptosis depends on their interaction with NRAGE. Thus, we asked whether the apoptotic domain of UNC5H1, when present on the homologous receptors, enhances either the apoptotic signal or NRAGE binding. To accomplish this, we constructed two chimeric receptors (H2/H1apo and H3/H1apo) in which the juxtamembrane region including the ZU-5 domain of UNC5"

The capacity of RecA protein to displace SSB is dramatically enhanced in RecA proteins with C-terminal deletions. The displacement of SSB by RecA protein is progressively improved when 6, 13, and 17 C-terminal amino acids are removed from the RecA protein relative to the full-length protein. The C-terminal deletion mutants also more readily displace yeast replication protein A than does the full-length protein. Thus, the RecA protein has an inherent and robust capacity to displace SSB from ssDNA. However, the displacement function is suppressed by the RecA C terminus, providing another example of a RecA activity with C-terminal modulation. RecAΔC17 also has an enhanced capacity relative to wild-type RecA protein to bind ssDNA containing secondary structure. Added Mg2+ enhances the ability of wild-type RecA and the RecA C-terminal deletion mutants to compete with SSB and replication protein A. The overall binding of RecAΔC17 mutant protein to linear ssDNA is increased further by the mutation E38K, previously shown to enhance SSB displacement from ssDNA. The double mutant RecAΔC17/E38K displaces SSB somewhat better than either individual mutant protein under some conditions and exhibits a higher steady-state level of binding to linear ssDNA under all conditions.

Strand exchange is initiated when RecA binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1 within a gap or an ssDNA terminal extension. RecA protein binds DNA in at least two steps. The first is a slow nucleation step (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this is followed by a rapid, cooperative binding of additional monomers to lengthen the filament uniquely in a 5′ to 3′ direction (4Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12308-12312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The resulting RecA-ssDNA complex has an extended, helical conformation, with ∼6 RecA monomers and 18 nucleotides (nt) of DNA per right-handed helical turn (18.6 base pairs per turn in RecA filaments with bound ATPγS) (6Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). This nucleoprotein filament can pair the bound single strand with the complementary strand of an incoming duplex, resulting in homologous recombination. The ssDNA-binding protein from Escherichia coli, SSB, affects formation of the nucleoprotein filament in several ways.In vitro, under standard reaction conditions that generally include 8–12 mm Mg2+, SSB stimulates filament formation on ssDNA substrates derived from bacteriophages by binding to and denaturing regions of secondary structure in the ssDNA that would otherwise hinder RecA filament extension (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SSB is then displaced by the growing RecA filament (8Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSB thus permits the formation of a contiguous extended filament on the DNA. However, RecA and SSB bind ssDNA competitively in vitro, such that when SSB is prebound to ssDNA, it inhibits the nucleation stage of RecA protein filament formation (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of RecA to ssDNA results either when SSB transiently vacates a region of ssDNA or when the RecOR mediator proteins facilitate RecA nucleation onto SSB-coated ssDNA (5Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,11Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic studies also indicate that SSB inhibits RecA filament formation and subsequent homologous recombination. Mutations in recF,recO, or recR genes, which belong to the same epistasis group, result in defects in the repair of stalled replication forks (13Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Smith K.C. Sharma R.C. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 15Galitski T. Roth J.R.

These defects are probably due at least in part to the inability of RecA protein to displace SSB from the single-stranded region of the stalled fork. In support of this model, overproduction of SSB leads to a sensitivity to UV-inflicted DNA damage that is similar to the phenotype of recF mutants (19Moreau P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence supports a competition between RecA and SSB for ssDNA in vivo. The recF, recO, or recRphenotypes can be partially suppressed, and the suppressor mutations map to the recA gene. These recA mutants includerecA803 (V37M) (20Madiraju M.V. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc.

These mutant RecA proteins would need to be able to compensate in some way for the loss of the RecFOR proteins, and indeed RecA803, RecA441, and RecA E38K proteins all exhibit an enhanced ability to compete with SSB in vitro (8Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Madiraju M.V. Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Clark A.J.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSB protein has multiple DNA binding modes, and interconversion between them is mediated by salt concentrations (29Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4629-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). At relatively low divalent salt concentrations (10–100 μm), SSB binds with a site size of 35 nt and exhibits a smooth contour in the electron microscope. At higher salt concentrations, SSB transitions to binding modes with site sizes of 56 (1–10 mm salt) and then 65 nt (0.1–1 m salt). The SSB65 binding mode is characterized by a beaded appearance in the electron microscope. The cooperativity of SSB binding to ssDNA is enhanced at the lower salt concentrations. The RecA protein of Escherichia coli(M r 37,842) has a structure featuring three distinct domains (32Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 33Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The core domain (residues 31–269) includes the ATP and DNA binding sites. The core is flanked by smaller N- and C-terminal domains. The C-terminal domains (residues 270–352) appear as distinct lobes on the surface of RecA filaments, which shift position markedly in response to the presence of different bound nucleotides (35VanLoock M.S.

Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The far C terminus of the RecA protein (defined here as the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues) exhibits a preponderance of negatively charged amino acids, with seven Glu or Asp residues in the terminal 17 residues. This function of this region has been explored with the use of C-terminal deletions (37Benedict R.C. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15513-15520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tateishi S. Horii T. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol.

Several of these studies documented the in vitro effects of deleting all or most of the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues. The major effects were an improvement of binding to dsDNA (37Benedict R.C.

Biol. 1991; 106: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To more systematically explore the function of the C terminus, C-terminal deletions removing 6, 13, and 17 amino acids were constructed and characterized in detail (43Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

The truncated proteins dramatically alter the pH-reaction profile for DNA strand exchange (43Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the RecAΔC17 mutant protein, there is no measurable requirement for Mg2+in excess of that required to coordinate the ATP used in a given experiment (44Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At Mg2+ concentrations above their respective optima, reactions promoted by the mutant proteins are somewhat inhibited and produce DNA species that do not migrate into the gel. For RecAΔC17, this inhibition is observed at Mg2+concentrations (i.e. 10 mm) that are optimal for strand exchange with wild-type RecA protein. The new DNA species are thought to represent DNA networks that form when RecA protein is able to bind to the outgoing strand and pair the strand again with a duplex DNA (45Chow S.A. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 200-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This trait was previously observed in strand exchange reactions with RecA441, which has an enhanced capacity to compete with SSB for the displaced single strand during strand exchange reactions (46Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4004-4010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested to us that the C-terminal deletion mutants of RecA might also have an enhanced capacity to displace SSB protein. In this study, we demonstrate that C-terminal deletions of RecA protein greatly enhance the capacity of the protein to compete with SSB and that the effect increases with progressive truncation out to at least 17 amino acid residues. E. coli SSB was purified as described (47Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SSB was stored in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 mm NaCl. The concentration of the purified SSB protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.83 × 104m−1 cm−1 (48Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol.

The concentration was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 8.8 × 104m−1 cm−1 (50Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

RecA 441 was purified using the following modification to the wild-type RecA procedure previously described (43Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I.

The initial polyethyleneimine pellet was washed with R buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) and 50 mm ammonium sulfate and extracted two times with R buffer plus 150 mm ammonium sulfate. The RecA E38K (RecA 730) mutant protein was purified like the wild-type RecA protein, except that the final fraction was subjected to an additional step. The protein was loaded onto a PBE 94 column equilibrated with R buffer, and the column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0m KCl. The RecA E38K mutant was eluted at ∼600 mm KCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed extensively against R buffer and concentrated as for the wild-type protein. The RecAΔC17/E38K double mutant protein was purified using the same protocol as the RecAΔC17 protein (43Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J. Abbott L. Dwyer D.W. Roca A.I.

The concentration of each RecA and RecA variant protein was determined using the extinction coefficient of wild-type RecA, 2.23 × 104m−1 cm−1 (51Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Fisher. Lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. PBE 94 resin was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dithiothreitol was purchased from Research Organics, Inc. All DNA concentrations are given in terms of total nucleotides. Poly(dT) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the approximate average length is 229 nt. The concentration of poly(dT) was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8.73 mm−1 cm−1. M13mp8 bacteriophage circular ssDNA was prepared as described (52Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of M13mp8 ssDNA was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient 9.03 mm−1cm−1. A coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (53Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was used to measure the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities of the wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, and RecAΔC17 proteins. The regeneration of ATP from phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and monitored by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm. The 380-nm wavelength was used, so that the signal remained within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment. The assays were carried out on a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficient at 380 nm of 1.21 mm−1cm−1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mmTris-OAc (80% cation), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, 5% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1.92 mmphosphoenolpyruvate), and a coupling system (3 mm NADH and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase). The concentrations of DNA (M13mp8 ssDNA or poly(dT)), RecA protein (wild-type RecA, RecAΔC6, RecAΔC13, RecAΔC17, RecA 441, RecA E38K, or RecAΔC17/E38K), Mg(OAc)2, and SSB or RPA are indicated in the figure legends. To initiate the assay, the ssDNA was preincubated with either a RecA protein or an ssDNA binding protein (SSB or RPA) for 10 min at 37 °C. Then SSB or an RecA protein, respectively, was added. ATP was added to 3 mm final concentration, either with the RecA protein or with SSB or RPA, as indicated. Data collection was then begun. In reactions in which no ssDNA-binding protein is included, SSB storage buffer is added instead. In the salt titrations, conditions were the same as above on poly(dT), except without SSB or SSB storage buffer. After a steady-state rate was achieved, aliquots of concentrated NaCl were added, allowing the reactions to come to steady state between additions. The goal of these experiments was to compare the abilities of wild-type RecA and C-terminally truncated RecA mutant proteins to compete with SSB for binding to ssDNA. RecA protein hydrolyzes ATP when bound to DNA, and the ATPase rate is proportional to the amount of RecA bound under most conditions (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 53Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis can be measured using a coupled enzyme assay described previously (53Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although indirect, this technique has been used extensively to measure RecA binding to DNA (3Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, this assay was also shown to represent a reliable and real time method to monitor SSB displacement by RecA when SSB is prebound to ssDNA (8Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, the time-dependent increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis was shown to correlate with the displacement of SSB, as measured using the change in the fluorescence of SSB upon dissociation from DNA. The outcome of the competition between SSB and RecA for binding to circular bacteriophage M13mp8 ssDNA strongly depends on the relative concentrations of the proteins, on which protein is preincubated with the ssDNA, and on the Mg2+ concentration (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As Fig. 1 illustrates, when the RecA protein is present at concentrations stoichiometric with its available DNA binding sites (3 nt of ssDNA/RecA monomer), RecA displaces prebound SSB from M13mp8 ssDNA quite slowly at 3 mm Mg2+. This Mg2+ concentration is stoichiometric to the ATP concentration used in the experiment. At 10 mm Mg2+, the SSB is displaced much more quickly upon the RecA addition. If, however, RecA is preincubated with the M13mp8 ssDNA at 3 nt/monomer, some RecA protein is gradually displaced in the presence of SSB, but the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis indicate a high level of RecA binding. The rates decline somewhat with time but remain much higher than the initial rates observed when SSB was preincubated with the ssDNA. RecA protein again competes with SSB somewhat better at 10 mm Mg2+ than at 3 mm Mg2+. The decline in rates indicates that the DNA is not completely bound by RecA when RecA is present at these stoichiometric levels, affording SSB significant access to the DNA. When the RecA concentration is increased 50% (2 nt/monomer), so that the excess RecA ensures coverage of the DNA, RecA is not displaced by SSB when the RecA is bound to the DNA prior to the SSB (Fig. 1). A complication in the study of SSB effects on wild-type RecA binding to M13mp8 ssDNA at various Mg2+ concentrations is that SSB can remove Mg2+-induced secondary structure in M13mp8 ssDNA, which otherwise inhibits RecA binding (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 57Muniyappa K. Shaner S.L. Tsang S.S. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, SSB has a stimulatory effect on RecA filament formation as well as a competitive, inhibitory effect. In order to eliminate this stimulatory contribution from SSB, poly(dT) ssDNA was used in place of M13mp8 ssDNA. Previously, it was shown that much more prebound RecA is displaced from poly(dT) by SSB than from M13mp8 ssDNA (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This occurs to a large extent because of end-dependent disassembly of RecA filaments (5Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 56Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45740-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is readily observed only on linear DNAs, where filament extension at one end does not compensate for disassembly at the other. Here we show that at 10 mmMg2+, wild-type RecA protein (3 nt/monomer) is almost completely displaced from poly(dT) by SSB in a process that is complete in less than 10 min (Fig. 2). At 3 mm Mg2+, the displacement of RecA by SSB is considerably faster. RecA added to poly(dT) prebound with SSB is not able to appreciably displace the SSB at 3 or 10 mmMg2+, indicating that binding of SSB to poly(dT) is highly favored over RecA binding to the linear poly(dT). Unlike the case with M13mp8 cssDNA, the resulting steady-state rates are the same regardless of whether RecA or SSB is preincubated with the ssDNA. In these experiments, the ATP is added with the SSB, and thus ATP is not included in the RecA preincubation in the experiments where RecA is added first. However, including ATP in the RecA preincubation had no discernible effect on the results shown (data not shown). As previously observed, a small net disassembly occurs in the absence of SSB, as indicated by the slight decline in the rate of ATP hydrolysis with time (Fig. 2, dashed lines), and disassembly and reassembly of filaments is doubtless occurring at a steady state (5Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,56Arenson T.A. Tsodikov O.V. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45740-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis by RecA protein in the absence of SSB is somewhat higher at 10 mm Mg2+ than at 3 mm. The C terminus of RecA contains a number of acidic residues. As shown in Fig.3 A, deletions of 6, 13, or 17 amino acids from the C terminus progressively remove a total of 3, 6, or 7 glutamate and aspartate residues. We tested the ability of these mutant proteins to compete with SSB, compared with that of wild-type RecA protein. At 3 mm Mg2+, where wild-type RecA has the least capacity to compete with SSB for binding to poly(dT), RecAΔC13 and, to an even greater extent, RecAΔC17, bind well to the poly(dT) that has been prebound with SSB (Fig.3 B). At 3 mm Mg2+, RecAΔC6 is unable to compete with SSB. The ATPase reactions of each protein in the absence of SSB are also displayed in Fig. 3 B to show that at 3 mmMg2+, in the absence of SSB, each protein binds to poly(dT) to approximately the same extent. The apparentk cat for ATP hydrolysis by wild-type RecA (calculated by assuming that all of the DNA is bound by RecA protein) in these reactions is 11.5 min−1, quite comparable with rates with poly(dT) observed previously (7Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, as shown below, this rate is lower than the nearly 30 min−1 rate observed when RecA is carefully titrated onto circular ssDNA. The lower rate almost certainly reflects incomplete binding of the DNA and perhaps an equilibrium state in which filaments are undergoing steady-state end-dependent assembly and disassembly. All of the RecA proteins including RecAΔC6, compete more effectively with SSB at 10 mmMg2+, and a"

We present genetic evidence that receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)-ε performs such a function, as cells from mammary epithelial tumors induced by activated Neu in mice genetically lacking RPTPε appeared morphologically less transformed and exhibited reduced proliferation. We show that at the molecular level, RPTPε activates Src, a known collaborator of Neu in mammary tumorigenesis. Lack of RPTPε reduced Src activity and altered Src phosphorylation in tumor cells; RPTPε dephosphorylated and activated Src; and Src bound a substrate-trapping mutant of RPTPε. The altered morphology of tumor cells lacking RPTPε was corrected by exogenous Src and exogenous RPTPε or RPTPα; exogenous activated Src corrected also the growth rate phenotype. Together, these results suggest that the altered morphology of RPTPε-deficient tumor cells is caused by reduced Src activity, caused, in turn, by lack of RPTPε. Unexpectedly, the phenotype of RPTPε-deficient tumor cells occurs despite expression of the related RPTPα, indicating that endogenous RPTPα does not compensate for the absence of RPTPε in this case. We conclude that RPTPε is a physiological activator of Src in Neu-induced mammary tumors and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of phosphatases that activate Src may be useful to augment direct pharmacological inhibition of Src.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). Molecular details of the functions of many protein-tyrosine kinases are known, and tight association between dysregulated protein-tyrosine kinase activity and malignant transformation, among other phenomena, is well established (2Blume-Jensen P.

A prominent case in point is Neu/ErbB2, a protein-tyrosine kinase that is amplified in 20–30% of breast cancer cases and is associated with poor patient prognosis (reviewed in Refs.4Bange J. Zwick E. Ullrich A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and 5Harari D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6102-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured cells and in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer have demonstrated that activated Neu is an extraordinarily powerful oncogene in vivo and have provided some molecular details of how Neu transforms (6Muller W.J.

Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In recent years, PTPs, which are molecularly, biochemically, and physiologically distinct from protein-tyrosine kinases, have emerged as central regulators of physiological processes. PTPs are a structurally diverse superfamily of transmembranal and non-membrane-associated enzymes, of which several dozen members have been identified in organisms ranging from viruses to man (8Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell.

As many oncogenes are tyrosine kinases, it is conceptually not surprising that many PTPs have been shown to inhibit cellular transformation (e.g. Refs. 10Shin D.Y. Ishibashi T. Choi T.S. Chung E.

Although this does not rule out participation of PTPs in cellular transformation events, studies carried out in transfected cells have revealed only a small number of PTPs that can perform such a role. This group includes, at present, receptor-type PTPα (RPTPα) (13Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which can transform rat embryo fibroblasts by dephosphorylating and activating Src (14Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Also included in this small group are CDC25 (15Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and FAP-1, whose down-regulation of Fas-induced apoptosis may aid tumor cells in evading regulatory mechanisms (16Sato T.

Identification of additional PTPs that function to support the transformed phenotype of tumor cells is of great importance to better understand the molecular inner workings of tumor cells and to suggest starting points for future therapies. The PTPε subfamily contains four distinct protein species, all products of a single gene. RPTPε is an integral membrane protein (13Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H.

Jiang J. Madamanchi N. Runge M.S. Patterson C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H396-H403Google Scholar), is required for proper functioning of mouse macrophages (28Sully V. Pownall S. Vincan E. Bassal S.

The unique N termini of the four PTPε proteins dictate their distinct subcellular localization patterns and, in turn, their physiological roles (21Andersen J.N. Elson A. Lammers R. Romer J. Clausen J.T. Moller K.B. Moller N.P.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31772-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression of RPTPε mRNA and protein is significantly elevated in mouse mammary tumors initiated specifically by Ras orNeu, but not by Myc, Int-2, transforming growth factor-α, or heregulin (18Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26116-26122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The implications of this finding are not obvious and are consistent with RPTPε playing a role either in promoting Neu- or Ras-mediated transformation or in the cellular response countering it. Experimental evidence linking RPTPε with promoting tumorigenesis was provided by the finding that expression of RPTPε in mammary epithelia of transgenic mice causes massive mammary gland hyperplasia and associated tumorigenesis (19Elson A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7535-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present study expands upon these studies by comparing cells from mammary tumors induced by Neu in wild-type and PTPε-deficient mice. Although lack of PTPε does not seem to have major effects on tumor initiation in mice, examination of cells from PTPε-deficient tumors revealed that RPTPε is required for maintaining optimal growth rates and morphology of these cells in culture and in vivo following implantation in nude mice. At the molecular level, we show that RPTPε is an in vivophysiological activator of Src, a well established collaborator of Neu in such tumors. The absence of RPTPε in Neu-induced mammary tumor cells reduces Src activity and correlates with major parts of the phenotype of these cells, whereas expression of exogenous Src, RPTPε, or the related RPTPα can reverse some of these phenotypes. Intriguingly, the effects of lack of RPTPε exist despite expression of RPTPα in the tumor cells studied, suggesting that this closely related PTP cannot fully compensate for lack of RPTPε. The genetic and biochemical evidence presented here indicates that RPTPε joins the small group of PTPs that support, rather than inhibit, the transformed cell phenotype. cDNAs for RPTPε, cyt-PTPε, c-Src, and Y527F Src were cloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) as described (25Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The D302A RPTPε mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and, following sequence verification, cloned into pcDNA3. For retroviral infection studies, cDNAs for chicken c-Src and Y527F Src and mouse RPTPε and RPTPα were cloned into the pBABE vector (32Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used in this study included polyclonal anti-PTPε (18Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol.

Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A.

Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Progeny were genotyped and mated among themselves to generate MMTV-Neumice homozygous for the PTPε-null allele (Ptpre−/−/Neu mice) as well asPtpre−/− and MMTV-Neu mice for control purposes. Female mice of all genotypes were allowed to mate and nurse pups at will to promote expression of the MMTV-Neutransgene; mice were examined visibly or by palpation twice weekly for the presence of tumors. On occasion, equal numbers (1.5 × 106) of low-passage tumor cells (see below) were injected in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline into the left fourth inguinal mammary gland or subcutaneously into the right flank of anesthetized 6–8-week-old CD1 nude female mice. Mice were killed 15 or 21 days later, and tumors were excised and weighed. Each cell line was assayed two or three times at each site, using three mice each time. Tumors were minced in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Each culture originated in a tumor from a separate mouse and was established in culture without additional transformation. Cell growth was quantified by seeding 0.5–1 × 105 cells in duplicates in six-well plates using the crystal violet method (34Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three to four times for each cell line. SYF cells (35Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and glutamine and antibiotics as indicated above. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ptpre−/−/Neu cells were infected with pBABE-based retroviral vectors and selected for 2 days in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were maintained in 1 μg/ml puromycin and analyzed for expression, morphology, and growth rates 2 weeks later. Cells were lysed in cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate and protease inhibitors (1 mm N-(α-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 40 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, and 15 μm pepstatin; Sigma). Sodium pervanadate was replaced with 5 mm iodoacetic acid in substrate-trapping experiments. SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitation, and blotting were as described (31Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Elson A. J.

Following immunoprecipitation, beads were washed extensively three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (for activity assays) or with buffer A (for substrate-trapping experiments). Experiments were repeated two to five times, and representative blots are shown. In control experiments, where known, graded amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting, the intensities of signals obtained were proportional in a linear fashion to the different amounts of antigen loaded on the gel. Beads carrying Src immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysates were rinsed in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and 5 mm MgCl2). Each reaction contained 25 μl of kinase buffer to which 1 μl (5 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) were added. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 10 or 30 min, during which Src activity was linear with respect to time. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Samples were electrophoresed and blotted onto membranes as described above. Radioactivity present in Src and enolase was quantified using a phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS 2500); the same blots were then probed with anti-Src antibodies and scanned with a scanning densitometer for normalization of Src activity to the amount of Src present in the immunoprecipitates. Experiments were repeated three to five times. Full-length RPTPα cDNA was cloned from the Ptpre−/−/Neu cell line 7381 using the ProSTAR Ultra HF reverse transcription-PCR system (Stratagene) and sequenced; the sequence has been deposited in GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. The RPTPα cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector and transfected into 293 cells, which were then lysed in buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors. Total phosphatase activity in lysates was assayed in duplicates at 30 °C in 96-well plates in reactions containing 100 μl of cell lysate (2 μg/ml) and 200 μl of assay buffer (50 mm MES, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Each sample was assayed twice with and without the addition of 0.5 mmsodium pervanadate. Activity was measured by following the increase in absorption at 405 nm for 1 h, during which absorption was linear with time. Tyrosine phosphatase (vanadate-inhibitable) activity was calculated as the difference between activities of a given sample measured with and without pervanadate. RPTPα cloned into the pBABE retroviral vector was used to infect Ptpre−/−/Neucells for examination of infected cell morphology as described above. Neu-induced mammary tumor cells lacking RPTPε were derived from mammary tumors of PTPε-deficient mice expressing activated Neu in their mammary epithelial cells (Ptpre−/−/Neu mice).Ptpre−/−/Neu mice were derived by mating gene-targeted mice lacking PTPε (Ptpre−/− mice) (26Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with mice carrying an activated Neu transgene controlled by the MMTV promoter/enhancer (Neu mice) (6Muller W.J. Sinn E. Pattengale P.K. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Tumor latency and overall morphology were similar in bothPtpre−/−/Neu and Neu female mice, with half the mice of either genotype developing detectable tumors by ∼130 days (data not shown). To examine the cellular and molecular properties of these tumors in greater detail, several independentPtpre−/−/Neu or Neu mammary cell lines were derived from tumors that arose in the mouse colony. Endogenous RPTPε protein was expressed in cells from mice carrying at least one functional allele of PTPε; all cell lines expressed theNeu transgene as well as significant and similar amounts of RPTPα, a PTP closely related to RPTPε (Fig.1 A). Tumor cells expressing RPTPε behaved similarly, irrespective of whether they carried one or two functional PTPε alleles. Examination ofPtpre−/−/Neu and Neu tumor cells revealed clear and reproducible differences between these cell types: whereas both Ptpre−/−/Neu andNeu cells were of epithelial morphology,Ptpre−/−/Neu cells were larger and flatter and proliferated significantly slower than Neu cells (Fig. 1,B and C). No differences in cell survival or plating efficiencies were observed betweenPtpre−/−/Neu and Neu tumor cells, indicating that the slower proliferation rate ofPtpre−/−/Neu cell cultures was due to slower proliferation of these cells. The differences in growth rates noted above persisted in vivo following injection of Ptpre−/−/Neuor Neu tumor cells into the mammary fat pad or subcutaneously into the flank of nude mice. 15 days following injection, mice were killed, and the tumors were excised and weighed. This experimental approach was preferred to measuring tumor size in live mice following cell injection due to the irregular shape of many tumors and the tendency of mouse mammary tumors to form hollow necrotic centers, leading to overestimation of tumor mass based on the dimensions. Care was taken to inject cells that had been propagated in culture for minimal amounts of time. Ptpre−/−/Neuand Neu tumor cells generally formed tumors in vivo, with tumors formed in mammary glands significantly larger than those formed in the flank. Interestingly, tumors that arose fromPtpre−/−/Neu cells were significantly smaller than those from Neu cells in both the mammary fat pad (78% smaller) and flank (55% smaller) (Fig. 1 C); similar results were obtained in separate experiments following a 21-day incubation period (data not shown). Tumors that arose in nude mice lacked any visible signs of necrosis and had clearly succeeded in recruiting blood vasculature, arguing that the reduced growth ofPtpre−/−/Neu tumors in nude mice was not due to differences in cell survival or angiogenesis. We conclude that RPTPε assists proper development of Neu-induced tumor cells bothin vitro and in vivo following injection into nude mice, and that in its absence cells function more poorly. The fact that lack of RPTPε affected the properties of tumor cells generated by activated Neu but did not block the appearance of tumors suggested that RPTPε affects a collaborator of Neu rather than Neu itself. The Src tyrosine kinase is a known collaborator of Neu in transformation of mouse mammary epithelial cells (36Dankort D.L. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 966-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Muthuswamy S.K. Muller W.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1801-1810PubMed Google Scholar). As Src can be dephosphorylated and activated by the related RPTPα (38Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 39Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we asked whether lack of RPTPε could affect Src activity in mammary tumor cells, thereby possibly causing thePtpre−/−/Neu phenotype. For this purpose, Src was immunoprecipitated from tumor cells, and its activity was analyzed; measurements revealed a decrease of ∼50% in Src kinase activity in lysates of Ptpre−/−/Neu cells (Fig.2, A and B). In agreement, protein blotting experiments using phospho-specific antibodies revealed that Src autophosphorylation at Tyr416(numbering as in chicken Src) was reduced by 63%, whereas phosphorylation at its C-terminal inhibitory site Tyr527 was increased by 51% inPtpre−/−/Neu cells (Fig. 2, C andD). Both changes in Src phosphorylation are consistent with the measured reduction in Src kinase activity. To determine whether lack of RPTPε merely correlates with or could be the cause of altered Src phosphorylation and activity inPtpre−/−/Neu cells, we examined the effect of expressing PTPε on Src in transfected cells. Experiments were conducted in SYF mouse embryo fibroblasts (35Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), which are genetically deficient in the Src, Yes, and Fyn kinases and which do not express PTPε. Coexpression of Src and RPTPε resulted in changes in Src that were opposite from those observed in the RPTPε-deficientPtpre−/−/Neu cells. Src activity was increased by 78%; and in agreement, Tyr416 phosphorylation was increased by 52%, and Tyr527 phosphorylation was decreased by 27% (Fig. 3, A–C). Similar results were obtained in cells transfected with Src and RPTPα (data not shown), in agreement with previously published studies (14Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar,40den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with RPTPε preferentially dephosphorylating Src at Tyr527, thereby activating the kinase and resulting in increased autophosphorylation at Tyr416. Interestingly, cyt-PTPε increased Src activity by 117% and strongly reduced phospho-Tyr527 levels in transfected SYF cells, although no changes in phospho-Tyr416 levels were detected (Fig. 3,A–C). We interpret this as being due to the stronger cyt-PTPε activity in these experiments partially dephosphorylating Src at Tyr416, thereby countering autophosphorylation at this site. Note that similar levels of RPTPε and full-length cyt-PTPε were expressed in these cells; p67PTPε and p65PTPε, which are more significantly coexpressed with cyt-PTPε, are exclusively cytosolic proteins and are not believed to reduce phosphorylation of Src (25Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31772-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further support for Src being dephosphorylated by RPTPε was provided by a substrate-trapping mutant of the phosphatase. Mutants of this type, which are generated by mutating specific key residues in the catalytic domains of PTPs, are either virtually or entirely catalytically inactive, but typically retain the ability to bind phosphorylated substrates via their catalytic sites (43Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Following coexpression of Src with wild-type RPTPε in SYF cells, Src was immunoprecipitated and blotted to reveal associated RPTPε. Small amounts of wild-type RPTPε specifically associated with Src and were not detected in identical experiments in which the primary precipitating anti-Src antibody was omitted (Fig. 4). Replacing wild-type RPTPε with the trapping mutant D302A RPTPε resulted in significantly more RPTPε being coprecipitated with Src; again, binding was specific and was not detected in the absence of the precipitating antibody (Fig. 4). Increased binding of D302A RPTPε to Src is consistent with Src interacting with the active site of RPTPε and with Src being a substrate of RPTPε. The results presented here strongly suggest that RPTPε can dephosphorylate and activate Src and that lack of RPTPε is the cause of altered phosphorylation and reduced activity of Src in Ptpre−/−/Neucells. We next examined whether added expression of Src in Ptpre−/−/Neu cells could rescue some aspects of the phenotype of these cells, thereby supporting an RPTPε/Src phenotype connection. For this purpose, we examinedPtpre−/−/Neu cells that had been infected with retroviral vectors for expressing c-Src or constitutively active Src (Y527F). Similar cells infected with an empty vector served as controls in these experiments. c-Src and Y527F Src were detected in infected cells by protein blotting (Fig.5 A). Expression of exogenous Y527F Src was lower than that of exogenous c-Src possibly due to harmful long-term effects of massive overexpression of this highly active Src mutant or t"

We have further explored the relationship between HSPG binding of VLDL and its subsequent internalization by focusing on the LRP pathway using a cell line deficient in LDLR. In this study, we show that LRP and HSPG are part of a co-immunoprecipitable complex at the cell surface demonstrating a novel association for these two cell surface receptors. Cell surface binding assays show that this complex can be disrupted by an LRP-specific ligand binding antagonist, which in turn leads to increased VLDL binding and degradation. The increase in VLDL binding results from an increase in the availability of HSPG sites as treatment with heparinase or competitors of glycosaminoglycan chain addition eliminated the augmented binding. From these results we propose a model whereby LRP regulates the availability of VLDL binding sites at the cell surface by complexing with HSPG. Once HSPG dissociates from LRP, it is then able to bind and internalize VLDL independent of LRP endocytic activity. We conclude that HSPG and LRP together participate in VLDL clearance by means of a synergistic relationship.

VLDL particles consist of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoproteins CI, CII, and CIII (1McKeone B.J. Massey J.B. Knapp R.D. Pownall H.J.

ApoCII is thought to activate lipoprotein lipase, necessary for lipolytic processing (2Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Receptor-mediated clearance of circulating VLDL is a rapid and critical step for maintenance of proper plasma lipid levels. The half-life of injected VLDL is reported to be ∼20 min in mice and rabbits (9Yu K.C. Cooper A.D. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D332-D354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated VLDL levels, as seen in type III hyperlipoproteinemia (10Havel R.J. Yamada N. Shames D.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: I33-I38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Havel R.J. Curr. Opin.

Clearance of VLDL is thought to occur through a multistep process. VLDL initially binds to cell surfaces through interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (14Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J.

Accordingly, apoE knockout mice display severe hypercholesterolemia with a marked elevation of circulating remnants (17Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G.

Although it is established that HSPGs are the primary binding sites for VLDL at the cell surface, their path of uptake into cells is less clear and can occur through several independent receptor-mediated events (19Krieger M. Herz J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 20Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have shown that the LDL receptor participates in VLDL clearance in vivo (8Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar, 21Chappell D.A. Fry G.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRP is a large cell surface multiligand-binding protein and member of the LDL receptor family (26Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LRP is expressed predominantly in the liver but can also be found in many diverse cell types (27Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Impairment of LRP functionin vivo has been shown to result in an increase in circulating levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (28Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin.

Also, aged rats were shown to have decreased LRP expression, which is accompanied by a delayed clearance of VLDL remnants (30Field P.A. Gibbons G.F. Metab. Clin. Exp. 2000; 49: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HSPGs are also able to directly internalize bound lipoproteins and mediate their catabolism, although their internalization rates are slow when compared with those of the LDL receptor family members (31Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Fuki I.V.

Hepatology. 1995; 21: 950-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 is of the transmembrane class of proteoglycans (34Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J.

To attempt to clarify this complex mechanism of lipoprotein clearance, a multistep model has been proposed suggesting that remnant lipoprotein catabolism involves three distinct steps (20Mahley R.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9369-9375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). And third, internalization of the remnants is mediated through combined activities of the LDL receptor, LRP, and cell surface HSPG. Whether these three receptors interact to facilitate lipoprotein clearance is not known. In the present study, we have begun to examine the relationship between HSPG and LRP at the cell surface to identify if these receptors act independently in lipoprotein clearance or if they coordinate their activities in a synergistic manner. Using a cell line deficient in LDL receptor expression, we have identified that HSPG and LRP are present in a co-immunoprecipitable complex at the cell surface. Moreover, incubation of cells with an antagonist of LRP ligand-binding activity increases the availability of HSPG for VLDL binding resulting in increased VLDL catabolism. These results suggest that HSPG and LRP are associated in a macromolecular complex at the cell surface and upon dissociation increase the availability of free HSPG to augment VLDL binding to cells. Human VLDL, purchased from Intracel, Inc. (Frederick, MD), was obtained from a mixed pool of normal, non-fasting donors. Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), heparin, heparinase I, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Protein A-agarose was obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside was fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [35S]Methionine and35SO4 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Precast SDS-PAGE gels were from BioWhittaker (East Rutherford, NJ). RAP-GST fusion protein was purified as previously described (45Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Anti-LRP polyclonal antibody was raised against an 18-amino acid peptide from the cytoplasmic tail of human LRP (46Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1433-1441PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture plastics were purchased from Corning (Corning, NY). Buffers, salts, and detergents were obtained from either Sigma-Aldrich or Calbiochem. Mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in LRP expression (MEF-2) or deficient in LDL receptor expression (MEF-3) were generous gifts from Dr. Joachim Herz, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were prepared in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm CHAPS, and cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a wet tank transfer method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), 0.1% Tween-20, 5% calf serum for 15 min at 23 °C and incubated with anti-LRP antisera (1:2000) in blocking buffer for 2 h at 23 °C. Membranes were washed three times (10 min each) with TBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% calf serum, and bound antibodies were detected with species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by chemiluminescence detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, cells were incubated with 125 μCi/ml of either [35S]methionine in complete culture media or35SO4 in sulfate-free media for 16 h. Cells were rinsed twice with TBS and solubilized with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and protease inhibitor mix (2 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and soluble proteins were incubated with anti-LRP antisera (1:200) and protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed two times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) followed by two times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Antibody-bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 4% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue-R in water:methanol:acetic acid (50:40:10, v/v), destained, and incubated for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −80 °C. α2M was activated for receptor binding by incubating with an equal volume of 0.4m methylamine in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound methylamine was then removed by passage over a desalting column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences). VLDL and α2M were radioiodinated with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) as previously described (47Kerjaschki D. Exner M. Ullrich R. Susani M. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. Farquhar M.G. Orlando R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Specific activities were routinely between 3000 and 4000 cpm/ng of protein. Using the Bligh-Dyer lipid extraction procedure, we determined that ∼10% of the 125I label was incorporated into lipid of the VLDL particle while the remaining 90% of label was found coupled to protein. Cells were grown on tissue culture plates precoated with 1% gelatin and used when confluent. In some cases, cells were cultured for 72 h in 3 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside orp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside or incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with heparinase I (1 Sigma unit/ml) prior to performing the binding assay. Cells were rinsed twice with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2 (buffer A), followed by incubation for 3 h with125I-VLDL or 125I-α2M (2 μg/ml) at 4 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated potential competitors. 125I-Labeled ligands were diluted into buffer A containing 1% BSA and chilled to 4 °C before adding to cells. Unbound 125I-ligand was removed by rinsing cells three times with cold buffer A after which cells with bound ligand were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH. Solubilized proteins were added to EcoLume (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) and subjected to scintillation counting (73% efficiency for iodine 125). Results were normalized to total cellular protein (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Specificity was determined as the difference between total binding (without competition) and nonspecific binding (non-competable) (48Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The actual amount of ligand bound to cells was calculated as cpm divided by the specific activity of125I-labeled ligand. All data points represent averages of duplicates or triplicates with standard errors of <5%. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. The paired t test was used to determine statistical significance. Wells of 96-well plates contained either confluent MEF-3 cells or were pre-coated with RAP-GST or BSA by incubating for 16 h at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml protein diluted into phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubating at 4 °C for 2 h with TBS containing 3% BSA.125I-VLDL was diluted to 2 μg/ml in TBS, 3% BSA and added to wells for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of unlabeled VLDL (50 μg/ml). Wells were then rinsed with TBS, and proteins were solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH and subjected to scintillation counting as described above. Cells were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 with 2 μg/ml 125I-VLDL or125I-α2M diluted into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA in the presence or absence of the indicated potential competitor. At the indicated times, media was removed and processed for trichloroacetic acid precipitation (49Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Lundstrom M. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-soluble material was added to EcoLume and subjected to scintillation counting. Degradation was calculated as trichloroacetic acid-soluble cpm divided by the specific activity of the radioiodinated ligand. Because we have chosen to examine the relationship between HSPG and LRP toward VLDL clearance, we have selected a cell line (mouse embryo fibroblasts, MEF-3) that is devoid of LDL receptor expression to remove its contribution toward VLDL binding and clearance. MEF-3 cells were originally established from LDL receptor knockout mice (50Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). To confirm LRP expression in these cells, detergent lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies (pAb) specific for the cytoplasmic tail of LRP (46Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Adamson E.D. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1433-1441PubMed Google Scholar). In MEF-3 cells, anti-LRP antibodies clearly reacted with the light chain of LRP (∼95 kDa), which contains the receptor's cytoplasmic tail sequence (Fig.1, lane 2). MEF-2 cells, which are devoid of LRP expression (51Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), show no reactivity with anti-LRP demonstrating the specificity of this antibody (Fig. 1, lane 3). Because VLDL is known to bind to HSPG on the cell surface prior to its internalization, we examined the relationship between LRP and this primary binding event by first determining if LRP is associated with HSPG at the cell surface. MEF-3 cells were incubated with [35S]methionine to label proteins or35SO4 to label proteoglycans. Cell lysates were prepared using a mild, non-denaturing detergent (1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated with pAb to LRP. With [35S]methionine labeling, the heavy chain of LRP can be seen at 515 kDa (Fig.2 A). In cells labeled with35SO4, a very large (>600 kDa) sulfated molecule is found to co-immunoprecipitate with LRP. To determine if this large sulfated molecule is an HSPG, immunoprecipitates were prepared from 35SO4-labeled cells using anti-LRP antibodies, and antibody-bound proteins were treated with or without heparinase. Confirming our results obtained in Fig.2 A, anti-LRP antibodies co-immunoprecipitate a large sulfated molecule from 35SO4-labeled cells (Fig. 2 B). When this material is treated with heparinase, little or none of the high molecular weight sulfated molecule remains thus identifying it as an HSPG. These data indicate that LRP is associated with HSPG in a co-immunoprecipitable complex at the cell surface in MEF-3 cells. We next examined the binding properties of VLDL on MEF-3 cells. Cells were incubated at 4 °C (to prevent internalization, but permit lateral movement of protein in the plasma membrane) with125I-VLDL alone or together with unlabeled VLDL, heparin, RAP, or mix of RAP and heparin. Unlabeled VLDL effectively competed for the binding of 125I-VLDL demonstrating the specificity of its binding to the surface of MEF-3 cells (Fig.3 A). Heparin also effectively competed for 125I-VLDL binding confirming that the initial binding of VLDL to cells occurs through HSPG. To determine if, in addition to HSPG, 125I-VLDL also bound directly to LRP, we challenged its binding with the receptor-associated protein (RAP), because RAP is known to compete for the binding of all ligands to LRP (52Willnow T.E. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1025-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 53Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), including VLDL (54Chappell D.A. Inoue I. Fry G.L. Pladet M.W. Bowen S.L. Iverius P.H. Lalouel J.M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18001-18006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, co-incubation of 125I-VLDL with RAP resulted in a significant increase in VLDL binding (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of 125I-VLDL together with RAP and heparin reduced its binding to background levels suggesting that the increase in VLDL binding by co-incubation with RAP is due to increased availability of HSPG binding sites. To confirm that our preparation of RAP is active as a ligand binding antagonist for LRP, we incubated MEF-3 cells with125I-α2M in the presence or absence of RAP. α2M is known to be a specific ligand for LRP (56Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Our preparation of RAP proved to be an effective competitor for125I-α2M binding to LRP (Fig. 3 B). Heparin, as expected, had no effect on125I-α2M binding to LRP. To determine if the effect of RAP on VLDL binding to MEF-3 cells is concentration-dependent, cells were incubated at 4 °C with 125I-VLDL and varying concentrations of RAP. As shown in Fig. 4, increasing amounts of RAP do increase the availability of specific VLDL binding sites in a concentration-dependent manner. The fact that heparin effectively competes for 125I-VLDL binding to the increased sites made available by incubation with RAP suggests that these new sites are HSPG. To explore this possibility, we treated MEF-3 cells with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside orp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, both of which are known to be potent competitors of heparan sulfate polysaccharide chain addition to proteoglycan core proteins (57Lugemwa F.N.

Cells treated with these reagents have reduced amounts of glycosaminoglycan associated at the cell surface and have been shown to bind reduced amounts of VLDL (59Zeng B.J. Mortimer B.C. Martins I.J.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1318-1333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated MEF-3 cells with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (Fig.5 A) orp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (Fig.5 B) for 72 h, followed by incubation at 4 °C with125I-VLDL in the presence or absence of RAP. As expected, both 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside andp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside reduced overall binding of 125I-VLDL to cells. In addition, both reagents also significantly reduced VLDL binding to the additional sites made available by RAP incubation indicating that these sites are HSPG. To further confirm this observation, 125I-VLDL binding study was performed on MEF-3 cells treated with heparinase (Fig. 6). Following heparinase treatment, the binding of 125I-VLDL to cells was markedly reduced as expected. Moreover, the RAP-inducible binding sites were also significantly reduced due to heparinase treatment. Together, these data indicate that the additional VLDL binding sites made available by incubation with RAP are HSPG.Figure 6Heparinase treatment of MEF-3 cells reduced the number of RAP-induced binding sites for VLDL. MEF-3 cells were incubated with or without heparinase (1 unit/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation at 4 °C with 125I-VLDL (2 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of unlabeled VLDL (50 μg/ml), RAP (50 μg/ml), heparin (500 μg/ml), or combination of RAP and heparin. Heparinase treatment of cells reduced VLDL binding to levels comparable to those obtained by competition with unlabeled VLDL and heparin. Similarly, heparinase also reduced 125I-VLDL binding to RAP-inducible sites to levels comparable to those obtained by competition wi"

Using cell and mouse models, we have shown that expanded polyglutamine led to activation of the stress kinase JNK and the transcription factor AP-1, which are implicated in neuronal death. Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 were down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1.

Progressive neuronal loss characterizes all polyglutamine diseases, although the affected brain regions are variable between disorders (2Ross C.

Polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) confers a gain of toxic function to the respective proteins, which results in neurodegeneration (3Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M.

Why and how polyQ is toxic has still to be determined, although recent findings have shown that it impairs different critical cellular processes. PolyQ is highly prone to aggregation, as shown in vitro (5Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). As discussed above, there is evidence that the toxicity of polyQ results in part from its propensity to misfold, a situation that might be equivalent to the one induced by a protein-damaging stress. Thus, to get insight into polyQ toxicity, we have investigated the possibility that polyQ could lead to a cellular stress comparable to a protein-damaging stress. Here we have shown that polyQ expression resulted in activation of JNK and c-Jun, through inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. In particular, the solubility of the JNK phosphatase M3/6 was impaired by polyQ. M3/6 was not recruited into NIs, suggesting that its aggregation was indirectly induced by polyQ. Expression of HSP70 suppressed polyQ-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK, suggesting that HSP70 is a critical regulator of polyQ-induced stress. In addition, expression of polyQ in cells resulted in down-regulation of HSP70 levels and in its recruitment into NIs. Altogether, our results indicate that impairment of HSP70 by polyQ is responsible for inactivation of JNK phosphatase(s). As a result, activation of JNK and c-Jun, which are involved in neuronal death, might be critical in the triggering of polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration. Monoclonal 1C2 and 2A10 antibodies and polyclonal 1261 and M3/6 antibodies have been previously described (21Palacios C. Collins M.K. Perkins G.R. Curr.

Anti-JNK3, anti-c-Jun (sc-45), anti-ERK (K23), and anti-CBP (A22) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2), anti-actin, and anti-औ-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-HSP70 and anti-HSC70 antibodies were from Stressgen. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins) conjugated to peroxidase or CY3 or Oregon Green were from Jackson Laboratories. pTL1-based expression vectors encoding the first 133 amino acids of the human huntingtin protein with either 15 or 125 glutamines and FLAG-tagged at the N-terminal extremity have been previously described (29Trottier Y.

The expression vector encoding murine c-Jun and reporter constructs were a gift from P. Sassone-Corsi. Expression vector encoding murine M3/6 has been described previously (31Johnson T.R. Biggs J.R.

A pcDNA-based expression vector encoding HSP70 was generated from a pH2.1 plasmid containing the sequence of a humanhsp70 gene, which was given by R. I. Morimoto. Transient transfections were performed by the phosphate calcium method as follows: COS-1 cells were cultured in DMEM/57 fetal calf serum (FCS) and plated at 307 confluence before transfection. After transfection (15 h), medium was changed and cells were grown for additional 48 h. Generation, culture, and differentiation of reverse tetracycline-inducible NG108 cell lines expressing an N-terminal FLAG-tagged version of the first 80 amino acids of the human huntingtin protein with either 15 or 125Q have been previously described (32Lunkes A. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, clones were maintained in DMEM/107 FCS, antibiotics, 0.5 mg/ml G418, and 250 ॖg/ml hygromycin B. For neuronal differentiation and induction of expression, medium was replaced by DMEM/17 FCS, antibiotics, G418, hygromycin B, 10 ॖm forskolin, 100 ॖm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 ॖg/ml doxycycline. Transient transfections with CAT- and lacZ-reporter constructs were performed as followed. Cells maintained in the DMEM/107 FCS medium were plated at 307 confluence and transfected with the phosphate calcium method. After transfection (15 h), medium was replaced by the differentiation and induction medium for the indicated period. COS-1 and NG108 cell extracts were prepared as follows: cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and directly lysed in boiling Laemmli buffer. Mice retinas were dissected and homogenized in TGEK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 107 glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a mixture of protease inhibitors, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). They were incubated for 15 min on ice, sonicated, and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. Supernatants were collected. For fractionation experiments, proteins were prepared as described previously (33Lunkes A. Lindenberg K.S. Ben-Haiem L. Weber C. Devys D. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Mandel J.L. Trottier Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, the soluble SN1 fraction of cells or retinas was recovered in TGEK buffer, as described above. After centrifugation, the pellet was conserved and solubilized in an SDS buffer (final concentration of 27 SDS, 57 औ-mercaptoethanol, 157 glycerol) by boiling for 10 min. The preparation was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 rpm and room temperature, and the supernatant was recovered, giving the SN2 fraction. The pellet (fraction P) was solubilized by incubation in pure formic acid at 37 °C for 30 min then lyophilized overnight and resuspended in SDS buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments, protein extracts were prepared as described above, by lysing cells or retinas in TGEK buffer. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-M3/6 antibody overnight at 4 °C, and with protein A-Sepharose for additional 30 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times and resuspended in TGEK buffer. Protein extracts were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE. Samples were electroblotted onto Protan nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were incubated in PBS/57 low fat milk overnight at 4 °C with non-phosphospecific antibodies, and in TBS/57 bovine serum albumin with phosphospecific antibodies. Immunocomplexes were revealed by chemiluminescence with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies. Quantitative determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in transfected cells was performed using a CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were lysed and proteins extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracts were incubated on ELISA wells, which were precoated with a polyclonal antibody to CAT. A sandwich ELISA was then realized, by incubating an anti-CAT antibody coupled to digoxigenin, followed by an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to peroxidase. A colorimetric substrate was added, and the reaction was quantitated by measuring the optical density at 405 nm. Results were normalized with respect to protein concentration and transfection efficiency. Cells were cotransfected with a lacZ-reporter construct and the औ-galactosidase activity was dosed to assess the efficacy of transfection. AP-1 binding assays were realized using the kit Trans-AM AP-1 (Active Motif) and following the instructions given by the manufacturer. Briefly, nuclear extracts from NG108 cells or mice retinas were prepared by standard methods using the kit reagents. 10 ॖg of nuclear extracts was incubated on ELISA wells, where oligonucleotides containing the TRE had been precoated. Binding of AP-1 complexes to TRE was determined using a phospho c-Jun antibody, followed by a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase. A colorimetric substrate was then incubated, and the reaction was quantified by measuring the optical density at 450 nm. Fixed eyes were incubated overnight in PBS/307 sucrose and snap frozen on dry ice. 50-ॖm free-floating sections were blocked in PBS/0,37 Triton X-100/57 bovine serum albumin, washed in PBS, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies (Cy3- or Oregon Green-conjugated) diluted in PBS/57 bovine serum albumin. M3/6, HSP70, 1261, and 1C2 antibodies were diluted to 1/200 each. We asked whether expression of polyQ could result in a toxic cellular stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested whether stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) were activated in different polyQ models. COS cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding a FLAG-tagged version of the first 133 amino acids of huntingtin protein (htt133) with either a normal (15Steffan J.S. Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazantsev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) or mutated (125) number of glutamines. Western blot analysis performed on whole cell extracts with anti-activated JNK antibody (P-JNK) revealed that JNK was moderately phosphorylated in presence of mutated htt (Fig.1A). The activation was specific, because basal phosphorylation levels of other related kinases, p38/SAPK and ERK/MAPK, were not affected (Fig. 1A). The downstream target of JNK, c-Jun transcription factor, was also hyperphosphorylated in cells expressing mutated htt, as detected with an anti-phospho c-Jun antibody (P-c-Jun), which reveals N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 1A). We then wished to extend these results to a more physiological cell system. For this purpose, we expressed a FLAG-tagged truncated version of mutated htt (V125Q) in stable and inducible NG108 cell lines, which we differentiated into neurons for various days (32Lunkes A. Mandel J.-L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts analyzed by Western blot showed that both JNK and c-Jun were hyperphosphorylated in NG108 V125 cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in parental cells and in NG108 cells expressing the same truncated form of htt, but with 15Q, JNK and c-Jun were not hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 1B and not shown). Interestingly, JNK and c-Jun activation was concomitant to aggregation of mutated htt, which was detectable 5 days after induction (Fig. 1B). From day 5, aggregated htt remained in the stacking part of the SDS-PAGE gel. We then asked whether expression of polyQ could also lead to sustained activation of JNK in vivo. To address this, we analyzed R6/1 transgenic mice, which express expanded-exon 1 of htt in brain (4Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). To establish whether the molecular process of JNK activation could be common to other polyQ diseases, we included in the study transgenic mice expressing mutated ataxin-7, the protein involved in SCA7. The R7E mice we used express mutated ataxin-7 specifically in photoreceptors and have been shown to represent a good model of SCA7 retinal pathology (30Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that mutated exon 1 of htt is also expressed in photoreceptors of R6/1 animals (34Helmlinger D. Yvert G. Picaud S. Merienne K. Sahel J. Devys D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3351-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this observation and to compare both pathologies at the molecular level, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of JNK and c-Jun in retinas of R6/1 and R7E animals. R6/1 mice were sacrificed at 8 months, i.e. a few weeks before death, and R7E mice, for which disease progression is more severe, were sacrificed at both early and late time points after the onset of retinopathy (1 and 3 months). Control wild-type littermates as well as transgenic mice expressing the normal ataxin-7 (with 10Q, referred to as R7N) were included in the study (30Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Expression of mutated htt or ataxin-7 was controlled with the 1C2 antibody, which recognizes specifically expanded polyglutamine (29Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). JNK was hyperphosphorylated in retinas expressing mutated htt exon 1 and ataxin-7 (Fig. 1, C and D). Migration of part of the neuronal-specific JNK3 isoform was shifted to higher molecular weights, suggesting that JNK3 was itself a target of activation (Fig. 1D). c-Jun was also found hyperphosphorylated in R6/1 and R7E transgenic mice (Fig. 1,C and E). Hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun was already detectable in R7E mice of 1 month, which corresponds to the beginning of the pathology. This suggested that activation of the JNK pathway by polyQ is an early and persistent event. In conclusion, polyglutamine-expanded htt and ataxin-7 both induce activation of JNK and c-Jun proteins, indicating that the polyQ tract is sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, we show that activation of JNK by polyQ occurs in vivo in animal models. Thus, these data extend previous observations showing that overexpression of mutated htt in PC12 cells differentiated into neurons results in a cellular stress that leads to activation of JNK (35Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun regulates AP-1 activity (25Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar) and is involved in neuronal cell death (27Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 28Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether expression of polyQ in our different models would result in enhancement of AP-1 transcriptional activity. To test this, we coexpressed in cells mutated htt, c-Jun, and a reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing the AP-1 element (also named the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element or TRE). Expression of mutated htt in COS cells induced a 4-fold activation of the TRE reporter (Fig.2A). Similarly, stable expression of mutated htt in NG108 V125 cells differentiated for 3.5 and 6.5 days resulted in modest but progressive activation of the expression of the CAT gene (up to 2-fold, Fig. 2B). PolyQ did not increase transcription from other responsive elements, such as the serum-responsive element (not shown). Binding assays that allow testing the amount of active (i.e.phosphorylated) c-Jun bound to the TRE further supported these results. The principle of the new and sensitive technology we used is based on an ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nuclear extracts prepared from NG108 V125 cells differentiated for 7 days into neurons were tested by this method. Binding of AP-1 to TRE was significantly increased (about 3-fold) in extracts prepared from cells induced for expression of htt V125Q, compared with non-induced cells (Fig.2C). The binding was specific because the presence of free TRE-oligonucleotides abolished the ELISA signal when incubated with nuclear extracts (not shown). Next, we performed nuclear preparations from retinas of R6/1 mice of 8 months. Fig. 2D shows that binding of AP-1 to TRE was significantly augmented when extracts were from transgenic, versus normal mice. We also measured the binding capacity of AP-1 complexes derived from retinas of R7E and wild-type mice of 1 and 3 months (Fig. 2E). AP-1 binding was significantly increased in transgenic mice of 3 months. Thus, binding of active AP-1 to TRE is increased by polyQ. In conclusion, these results suggest that polyQ induces activation of AP-1-dependent gene expression. JNK is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases, including SEK-1/MKK4 and MKK7 (18Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 19Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of JNK is a reversible event, involving the action of JNK phosphatases. Whereas stresses such as UV irradiation or osmotic stress induce strong activation of kinases upstream of JNK (37Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar), protein-damaging stress such as heat shock induces an activation of JNK that is mainly mediated by inhibition of JNK phosphatases (16Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Zon L. Ganiatsas S. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We wished to investigate which mechanism was primarily implicated in polyQ-mediated activation of JNK. To test this, we examined the phosphorylation status of the JNK activator SEK-1, using an anti-phospho SEK-1 antibody. Expression of mutated htt in COS cells slightly induced the phosphorylation of SEK-1 (Fig. 3A). In retinas of R7E mice at 7 months of age, which corresponds to a very late pathological stage, SEK-1 was also moderately hyperphosphorylated (Fig.3D). However, the phosphorylation levels of SEK-1 were normal in neuronal NG108 V125 cells and in R6/1 and R7E mice of, respectively, 8 and 3 months (Fig. 3, B–D). These data suggest that early activation of JNK by polyQ mainly results from inactivation of JNK phosphatases and that a secondary event might further activate JNK through upstream kinases. To further investigate this hypothesis, we asked whether we could identify a JNK phosphatase that would be inactivated by polyQ. We focused on the mouse M3/6 dual-specificity JNK phosphatase, whose orthologue hVH5 in the human is highly expressed in the nervous system (38Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, upon protein-damaging stress, M3/6 solubility is decreased, which leads to its inactivation (21Palacios C. Collins M.K. Perkins G.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1439-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2387-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).

Bid is also cleaved at these sites by caspase 3 that is activated downstream of cytochrome c release after diverse apoptotic stimuli. In this context, tBid may amplify the apoptotic process. Bid is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinases that regulate its cleavage by caspase 8 (Desagher, S., Osen-Sand, A., Montessuit, S., Magnenat, E., Vilbois, F., Hochmann, A., Journot, L. Antonsson, A., and Martinou, J.-C. (2001) Mol. Cell8, 601–611). Using a Bid decapeptide substrate, we observed that phosphorylation at threonine 59 inhibited cleavage by caspase 8. This was also seen when recombinant Bid (rBid) and Bid isolated from murine kidney were incubated with casein kinase II. However, there were differences in the susceptibility of rBid and isolated Bid to cleavage by caspases 3 and 8. Caspase 8 cleaved rBid to generate two C-terminal products, p15 and p13 tBid, but produced only p15 tBid from isolated Bid. Contrary to rBid, isolated Bid was resistant to cleavage by caspase 3, yet was readily cleaved within the cytosolic milieu. Our data suggest that one or more distinct cellular mechanisms regulate Bid cleavage by caspases 8 and 3 in situ.

Two general mechanisms of activation are known: (a) enhanced expression due to transcriptional up-regulation and (b) post-translational modification of the protein by phosphorylation or cleavage. Bad provides the best characterized example of pro-apoptotic regulation via protein phosphorylation (2Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Ligation of death receptors such as Fas results in the assembly of an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)1 that activates the initiator caspase 8 (13Scaffidi C. Fulda S.

Whereas in type I cells DISC formation is very efficient, leading to rapid activation of caspase 8 and then of effector caspases such as caspase 3, in type II cells DISC formation proceeds slowly, and the activation of effector caspases requires amplification via the mitochondrial pathway (13Scaffidi C.

Caspase 8 cleaves human Bid at aspartate 60 to generate 15-kDa tBid that translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane. tBid is thought to promote the oligomerization of Bax or Bak at the mitochondrial surface to facilitates the release into the cytosol of cytochromec and other apoptogenic proteins (3Green D.R.

These observations suggested that mechanisms in addition to, or upstream of, caspase cleavage might regulate the mitochondrial action of Bid (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E.

Hickman J.A. Dive C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7268-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that this is indeed the case (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), because the phosphorylation status of Bid regulates its susceptibility to caspase 8-mediated cleavage. Specifically, treatment of murine Bid with casein kinases (CKs) affects its cleavage (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Bid phosphorylation may thus block cleavage by caspase 8, producing a safeguard mechanism to prevent the activation of this potent pro-apoptotic molecule in situations of basal caspase 8 activity (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).In addition to caspase 8-mediated cleavage at Asp-60 and Asp-75, rBid can also be cleaved by caspase 3 at both of these sites (6Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar, 23Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Given the greater catalytic capacity of caspase 3 compared with caspase 8 and its activation by wider range of apoptotic stimuli, it seems critical that Bid should be protected from activation by basal caspase 3 activity in healthy cells. We have thus tested whether endogenous Bid in primary tissues presents modifications that affect its cleavage by caspase 8 and/or caspase 3 and provide biochemical evidence for both common and different mechanisms that regulate Bid cleavage by these two caspases.DISCUSSIONCaspase cleavage is considered fundamental to the action of pro-apoptotic Bid, especially in the pathways of apoptosis triggered by death receptor ligation (3Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 4Wolter K.G. His Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechustan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J.

However, Bid is also cleaved during drug-induced apoptosis upstream or downstream of cytochromec release, dependent on cell type. In type II cells, Bid is cleaved by caspase 3 or by caspase 8 acting as an amplifying executioner caspase in drug-induced apoptosis (32Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Janicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4563-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In type I cells where drug treatment can induce formation of a DISC, Bid is cleaved by caspase 8 upstream of caspase 3 (33Fulda S. Meyer E. Freisen C. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1063-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, in certain scenarios, such as in the neuronal cell death that occurs in Huntington's disease, pro-caspase 8 can be activated independently of death receptor ligation (34Gervais F.G. Singaraja R. Xanthoudakis S. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Metzler M. Hackam A.S. Tam J. Vaillancourt J.P. Houtzager V. Rasper D.M. Roy S. Hayden M.R. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) to promote apoptosis via components of the death receptor signaling pathway, presumably including the cleavage of Bid. Thus, the events that regulate the susceptibility of Bid cleavage are important for apoptotic pathways engaged by a variety of stimuli. Given the potent action of tBid on mitochondria it would seem mandatory that constitutive mechanisms prevent tBid formation by basal caspase activities in cells that are responding appropriately to survival signals. The intracellular location and caspase cleavage of Bid are likely to be regulated by converging pathways of cell survival, as indicated by increasing, although indirect evidence (12Desagher S.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5865-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In this regard, the ability of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog (3-phosphoinositide phosphatase)) to sensitize to drug-induced apoptosis via a pathway dependent on the DISC component FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) provides another interesting link between the interruption of a survival signaling pathway and the cleavage of Bid to the promotion of apoptosis (36Yuan X.J. Whang Y.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Although it has been claimed that Bid is not phosphorylated in cultured cells (37Zha J.S. Weiler K. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), more recently it has been reported that Bid can be phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo, particularly by enzymes of the casein kinase family (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Given the limited information on the possible modification of endogenous Bid within primary tissues, we have focused our work on a comparison of the cleavage of endogenous Bid (either within or isolated from mouse kidney cytosol) and rBid by caspases 8 and 3.Our data provide novel evidence that endogenous Bid is phosphorylated (or otherwise modified) at sites influencing its cleavage by caspases. First, we demonstrated in a model system of Bid cleavage that phosphorylation of conserved residues such as Thr-59 (in the human Bid sequence), which surround the primary site of caspase cleavage (Fig.1 B), substantially diminished the proteolytic capacity of caspase 8 (Fig. 2). Second, we found that the Bid that was constitutively located (albeit at low levels) in kidney fractions other than cytosol (but including mitochondrial Bid) was resistant to proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3 (Fig. 6 B). This resistance was intrinsic to the protein in situ, because Bid isolated from the cytosolic extracts, contrary to rBid, was also resistant to caspase 3 cleavage (Figs. 5 and 6). Third, we found that dephosphorylation of endogenous Bid with PAP greatly facilitated its cleavage by caspases 3 and 8 (Fig. 7).Phosphorylation of residues around the cleavage site has been shown to prevent proteolysis by caspase 3 in other proteins, for example IκB-α (38Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 39Taylor J.A. Bren G.D. Pennington K.N. Trushin S.A. Asin S. Paya C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this case, phosphorylation confers specific protection toward proteolytic events that are associated with the execution phase of caspase-mediated death (38Barkett M. Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Gilmore T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29419-29422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 39Taylor J.A. Bren G.D. Pennington K.N. Trushin S.A. Asin S. Paya C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protection from caspase cleavage would affect both tBid action following the processing of pro-caspase 8 upstream of mitochondria and tBid involvement in the amplification of caspase cascades downstream of mitochondria. Our findings clearly indicate that physiological mechanisms are in place to allow efficient cleavage of Bid by upstream caspase 8 but not simultaneously by downstream caspases like caspase 3. What produces this differential specificity in Bid cleavage?Structural properties intrinsic to the Bid protein may partially account for differential cleavage by different caspases. Previous results (compare with Ref. 6Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar) showed that Bid is a better substrate for caspase 8 than for caspase 3, and our data indicate that this is particularly the case for the cleavage at the secondary site (Asp-75, compare with Fig. 5 B). The different efficiency of rBid cleavage by caspase 8 and 3 could simply derive from the fact that the protein region around the secondary cleavage site in Bid is much less flexible than that around the primary cleavage site (27McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and proteolytic enzymes like caspases prefer flexible peptides as substrates (31Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hence, even in the absence of Bid modification, local structural determinants would affect the reactivity of Asp-75 with caspase 3 but not with caspase 8. However, caspase 8 is essentially unable to produce p13 tBid when reacting with endogenous Bid isolated from kidney cytosol (Figs. 5 and 6). This implies that residues such as Ser-76, the only conserved hydroxyl amino acid lying around the secondary cleavage site (Fig. 1 B), may be modified in vivo to prevent proteolysis. Indeed, phosphate labeling was reported to be associated also with a peptide comprising Ser-76 afterin vitro phosphorylation and subsequent fragmentation of murine Bid (12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Post-translational modifications must be present also around the primary cleavage site of endogenous Bid to explain its strong resistance to caspase 3 cleavage (Figs. 5 and 6). The same modifications, however, cannot prevent Bid cleavage by caspase 8 (compare with Fig. 3). Given the discussion above and the evidence that phosphorylation incompletely inhibits caspase 8 cleavage of peptide substrates (Fig. 2) and rBid (Fig. 4 and results not shown, compare with Ref. 12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson A. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), this difference can be rationalized in terms of a superior catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity of caspase 8. It is increasingly evident that the exposed loop preceding the BH3 domain in Bid structure (residues 50–80, compare with Fig.1 B and Ref. 27McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) is susceptible to proteolysis by a variety of endogenous proteases. Besides caspase 8 (5Luo X.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30724-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Hence, the (poly)phosphorylation at residues 59, 62/65, and possibly also 76, may serve as a general mechanism for reducing the spontaneous degradation of Bid by these endogenous proteases.These modifications notwithstanding, endogenous Bid remains highly susceptible to cleavage by caspase 8, especially when compared with its resistance to cleavage by caspase 3 (Figs. 5 and 6). Consequently, phosphorylation (or other post-translational modifications around the caspase sites) could serve not only to stabilize the Bid protein but also to ensure its specific susceptibility to proteolysis by caspase 8. Our results (Figs. 6 and 7) lend support to this possibility, although other modifications, such as myristoylation (37Zha J.S. Weiler K. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), may also contribute to maintain a rigorous specificity for Bid cleavage toward activated caspase 8. In possible contradiction with this, our data also show that addition of exogenous (fully activated) caspase 3 leads to complete cleavage of cytosolic Bid (Fig. 6). However, this cleavage may derive from indirect reactions, including activation of cytosolic caspases like caspase 8, and caspase-mediated activation of protein phosphatases (42Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.-W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13119-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our study strengthens the contention that post-translational modifications alter Bid susceptibility to caspase cleavage and consequently its pro-apoptotic activation (12Desagher S.

https://openalex.org/W2019529259,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated angiogenic signal transduction relay is achieved by coordinated induction of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. These complex cellular processes are most likely controlled by activation of both cooperative and antagonistic signals by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs). Here, we investigated the contribution of tyrosine-phosphorylated residues of VEGFR-2/fetal liver kinase-1 to endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation and activation of signaling proteins. Mutation of tyrosine 1006 of VEGFR-2 to phenylalanine severely impaired the ability of this receptor to stimulate endothelial cell differentiation and tubulogenesis. Paradoxically, the mutant receptor stimulated endothelial cell proliferation far better than the wild-type receptor. Further analysis showed that tyrosine 1006 is responsible for phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) activation and intracellular calcium release in endothelial cells. Activation of PLCγ1 was selectively mediated by tyrosine 1006. Mutation of tyrosines 799, 820, 949, 994, 1080, 1173, and 1221 had no measurable effect on the ability of VEGFR-2 to stimulate PLCγ1 activation. Association of VEGFR-2 with PLCγ1 was mainly established between tyrosine 1006 and the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 1006 is essential for VEGFR-2-mediated PLCγ1 activation, calcium flux, and cell differentiation. More importantly, VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation is inversely correlated with the ability of VEGFR-2 to associate with and activate PLCγ1."

The manipulation of angiogenesis is an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic inflammation. Our results showed that ethanol stimulation altered the integrity of actin filaments and increased the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia in SVEC4–10 cells. Further experiments demonstrated that ethanol stimulation increased cell migration and invasion and induced in vitro angiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells. Mechanistically, ethanol stimulation activated Cdc42 and produced H2O2 a reactive oxygen species intermediate in SVEC4–10 cells. Measuring the time course of Cdc42 activation and H2O2 production upon ethanol stimulation revealed that the Cdc42 activation and the increase of H2O2 lasted more than 3 h, which indicates the mechanisms of the long duration effects of ethanol on the cells. Furthermore, either overexpression of a constitutive dominant negative Cdc42 or inhibition of H2O2 production abrogated the effects of ethanol on SVEC4–10 cells, indicating that both the activation of Cdc42 and the production of H2O2 are essential for the actions of ethanol. Interestingly, we also found that overexpression of a constitutive dominant positive Cdc42 itself was sufficient to produce H2O2 and to induce in vitroangiogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that ethanol stimulation can induce H2O2 production through the activation of Cdc42, which results in reorganizing actin filaments and increasing cell motility and in vitro angiogenesis. This report focuses on the identification of the molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced in vitroangiogenesis. The manipulation of angiogenesis is an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic inflammation. Our results showed that ethanol stimulation altered the integrity of actin filaments and increased the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia in SVEC4–10 cells.

High consumption of alcohol has been shown to enhance the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer, colon cancer, and liver cancer (1Maeda M. Nagawa H. Maeda T. Koike H. Kasai H. Cancer. 1998; 83: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Zhu Y. Lin H. Li Z. Wang M. Luo J. Breast Cancer Res.

Conversely, moderate alcohol consumption has also been shown to protect against the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (6Redmond E.M. Sitzmann J.V. Cahill P.A. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2000; 21: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of its pathogenic and protective effects are not fully established. Previous studies indicate that ethanol can induce angiogenesis (7Jones M.K. Itani R.M. Wang H. Tomikawa M. Sarfeh I.J. Szabo S. Tarnawski A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1345-G1355PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gu J.W. Elam J. Sartin A. Li W. Roach R. Adair T.H. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2001; 281: 365-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels out of pre-existing capillaries (9Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar), is a sequential event that involves (a) the disintegration of the basement membrane, (b) the migration of endothelial cells, (c) endothelial cell proliferation in cords with formation of new vascular channels, and (d) the formation of a new basement membrane (10Tomanek R.J. Schatteman G.C. Anat. Rec. 2000; 261: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These processes of angiogenesis are associated with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic inflammation. The manipulation of angiogenesis has great potential as an intervention for a number of diseases. The stimulation of angiogenesis could prevent and improve ischemic heart failure, whereas the inhibition of angiogenesis could potentially cure cancers and chronic inflammation (9Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major steps of angiogenesis is cell migration, which is pivotally governed by changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells. There are two different forms of actin, mono-actin (G-actin) and actin filaments (F-actin). Actin filaments are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell motility, cell cycle control, cellular structure, and cell signaling (11Krasilnikov M.A. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2000; 65: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). They function in cellular processes by undergoing dynamic structural reorganization or remodeling, leading to the formation of discrete structures at the cell periphery for attachment to the substratum in response to extracellular signals. These structures include focal adhesions, stress fibers, lamellipodia, filopodia, and membrane ruffles, which are involved in cell attachment, cell migration, and signal transduction (12Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K. Science. 1997; 276: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Because actin filaments play a critical role in cell migration, the remodeling of actin filaments may be essential for the process of angiogenesis. It has been found that insulin-stimulated glucose transport, gene expression, and alterations of cell morphology are dependent on the remodeling of actin filaments and that inhibition of the remodeling of actin filaments abrogates the induction of angiogenesis by insulin (13Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsiani E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The remodeling of actin filaments is essential for vascular endothelial growth factor-induced formation of tube-like structures and angiogenesis (14Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Actin filaments assemble to form bundle structures that are oriented along the axis of the tubes at the periphery of the cells during the formation of vessel tubes. Inhibition of the actin filament assembly blocks tube formation (13Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsiani E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The remodeling of actin filaments results in the increases in cell spreading, nuclear extension, and DNA synthesis (15Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The reorganization of actin filaments is also required for cultured rat hepatocytes to form three-dimensional structures or spheroids (16Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L. Hood J.D. Leng J. Cheresh D.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 915-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that ethanol directly remodeled or reorganized the structure of actin filaments, increased cell migration and cell invasion, and induced in vitro angiogenesis in endothelial cells. We further showed that activation of Cdc42 was important for ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis. Inhibition of Cdc42 activation in endothelial cells abrogated the effects of ethanol. In addition, we found that ethanol stimulation of endothelial cells induced the production of H2O2 through activation of Cdc42, and elimination of H2O2 production abolishes the effects of ethanol on these cells. Measuring the time course of Cdc42 activation and H2O2 production revealed that the Cdc42 activation and the increase of H2O2production lasted more than 3 h, which indicates the mechanisms of the long duration effect of ethanol on the changes in cell morphology, cell motility, and in vitro angiogenesis.

Transwell cell migration chambers were purchased from Corning Costar (Corning, NY). Matrigel-coated invasion chambers and Matrigel-coated in vitro angiogenesis plates were purchased from BD Biosciences. Carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein diacetate was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Both dominant positive Cdc42 (phEFdpCdc42V12) and dominant negative Cdc42 (phEFdnCdc42N14) were the gifts from Dr. Alan Hall (University College London, UK) and Dr. Wang Lu-Hai (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). pcDNA3.1/Neo(+)/GPX1 was a gift from Dr. Larry Oberley (University of Iowa). pGST-WASP-CRIB was a gift from Dr. Pontous Aspenstrom (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). SVEC4–10 cells, an immortal mouse endothelial cell line, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both phEFdpCdc42V12 and phEFdnCdc42N14 were transfected into SVEC4–10 cell with calphosphate kit (BD Biosciences), and the transfected cells were selected by G418 to make stable transfected cell lines. pcDNA3.1/Neo(+)/GPX1 was transiently transfected into SVEC4–10 cells with calphosphate kit (BD Biosciences). Because of the volatility of ethanol, a method utilizing sealed containers (17Luo J. Miller M.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used to maintain constant ethanol levels in the culture medium. 0.4% of ethanol was added directly to the culture medium in either tissue culture trays or dishes. The trays or dishes were then placed in sealed containers equipped with an ethanol-containing water bath in the bottom. The concentration of ethanol in the bath was the same as that in the culture medium. Ethanol from the bath evaporated into the air of the sealed container and maintained the ethanol concentration in the culture medium. A small volume of CO2 (60 cc) was injected into the container before sealing. The ethanol bath was changed daily to maintain the appropriated ethanol concentration. In control cultures, the water bath contained no ethanol. All containers were incubated at 37 °C. Previous studies show that this sealed container method accurately maintains ethanol concentrations in the culture medium (17Luo J. Miller M.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SVEC4–10 cells were grown on cover slides. After treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized as previously described (18Qian Y. Baisden J.M. Westin E.H. Guappone A.C. Koay T.C. Flynn D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) followed by labeling with FITC-phalloidin for 20 min and mounting to the slides with Fluoromount (Fisher). A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. Transwell migration assays were conducted using modifications of the method described by manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Briefly, the cells were stimulated with 0.4% ethanol in serum-free media overnight. The Transwells were coated with E-C-L cell attachment matrix (Upstate Biotechnology) at 20 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The top chambers of the Transwells were loaded with 4 × 105 cells/ml in 0.4% ethanol in serum-free media, and the bottom chambers were filled with 5% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media containing 0.4% ethanol. The 5% fetal calf serum served as an attractant for the cells. The Transwells were incubated in sealed chambers with 0.4% ethanol and 0.5% CO2 at 37 °C for 18 h. After the incubation, the cells that had migrated were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with Harris modified Fisher hematoxylin (Fisher), and mounted on slides. These cells were counted using phase contrast microscopy. Data given for migrating cells represent the average of five typical fields per each sample. The wound healing assays were performed according to the methods described by Meng et al.(4Meng Q. Gao B. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Fan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SVEC4–10 cells were grown on coverslips to 100% confluent monolayers and then scratched to form a 100-μm “wound” using sterile pipette tips. The cells were then cultured with 0.4% ethanol in serum-free media in sealed chambers for 18 h, fixed on coverslips with formalin, and stained with FITC-phalloidin. A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. Invasion assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). The cells were stimulated with 0.4% ethanol in serum-free media overnight. Cells (0.5 ml of 1.0 × 105 cells/ml) were loaded on pre-coated Matrigel 24-well invasion chambers (BD Biosciences). A 0.5-ml aliquot of 5% fetal calf serum medium containing 0.4% ethanol was added to the wells of the BD Falcon TC Companion plate to serve as the chemoattractant for the cells. The Matrigel invasion chambers were incubated in a sealed chamber with 0.4% ethanol and 0.5% CO2 at 37 °C for 22 h. After the incubation, the invading cells were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with Harris modified hematoxylin (Fisher), and mounted onto slides. The invading cells were counted and analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions. Cdc42 activation assays were performed according to the method described by Edlund et al.(19Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2. After the washing, the cells were lysed immediately with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A GST-WASP-CRIB fusion protein in glutathione S-transferase beads was added into the supernatants to pull-down active Cdc42 proteins, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min. After the incubation, the beads were washed 2 times with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The Cdc42 protein was eluted with sample buffer and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The Western blot analysis was performed using anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibody. Protein bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). An in vitroangiogenesis assay was performed with slight modification according to the methods described by Tang et al. (20Tang S. Gao Y. Ware J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1073-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were incubated in 0.4% ethanol in serum-free media overnight. Cells (2 ml of 1–2 × 105 cell/ml) were loaded on pre-coated Matrigel basement membrane matrix dishes (BD Biosciences) and cultured in serum-free medium containing 0.4% ethanol at 37 °C for 5 h followed by staining with Diff-Qick (Fisher) for 20 min. Images were taken using an Olympus inverted microscope. H2O2 was monitored using a Biotech H2O2-560 quantitative H2O2 assay kit (Oxis International, Inc., Portland, OR). The assay is based on the oxidation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) by H2O2 under acidic conditions. The ferric ion binds with an indicator dye, xylenol orange, to form a stable colored complex that can be measured at 560 nm using a PerSeptive Biosystems Cytofluor multiwell plate reader series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Measurements were made at 37 °C using 1 × 106 cells suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Student's t tests were performed using Sigma Stat programs. H2O2 assays in adherent cells were performed according to the methods described by Moldovan et al. (21Moldovan L. Moldovan N.I. Sohn R.H. Parikh S.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 0.4% ethanol for the different periods of time. At the end of the stimulation, carboxymethyl dichlorofluorescein diacetate was added at a final concentration of 5 μm for 30 min. After the incubation, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on coverslips. A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. Actin filaments mediate signal transduction in cells and undergo dynamic reorganization or remodeling in response to stimulation. Several activated forms of kinases remodel the structure of actin filaments to form the cell motile structures and change the structures of actin stress fibers. Here we sought to determine whether stimulation by ethanol has the capability to reorganize the structure of actin filaments in endothelial cells. SVEC4–10 cells, an immortal mouse endothelial cell line, were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 0.4% ethanol for the different periods of time. After stimulation, the cells were fixed immediately and stained with FITC-phalloidin followed by analysis using confocal microscopy. It was found that the actin stress fibers were well organized in the unstimulated SVEC4–10 cells, i.e. cells were evenly spread out, and few cell motile structures and rosette-like dots were found at the cell leading edges and within cell bodies (Fig.1 A). Upon stimulation with 0.4% ethanol for 3 min, actin filaments were remodeled and protruded the cell membrane at the leading edging to form cell motile structures such as lamellipodia and filopodia (Fig. 1 B). After stimulation with ethanol for 10 min, the actin stress fibers dissociated to form the rosette-like structures around the cell body, and a substantial number of cell motile structures were found at the cell leading edge, indicating that the integrity of actin filaments was reorganized upon the stimulation with ethanol (Fig. 1 C). The changes in the structure of actin filaments lasted for about 1 h and then began to recover (Fig. 1, D–G, and data not shown). Our data indicate that stimulation with ethanol altered the structure of actin filaments, which induced the dissociation of actin stress fiber structures to form actin rosette-like structures in the cell body and cell motile structures at the leading edges. The increase of lamellipodia and filopodia formation by ethanol stimulation suggests that small Rho GTPases may be activated in endothelial cells (Fig. 1). Cdc42 is involved in the formation of filopodia, and Rac is involved in the formation of lamellipodia (22Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). We sought to test whether Cdc42 and Rac were activated. SVEC4–10 cells were treated with 0.4% ethanol for various periods of time ranging from 3 min to 3 h. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays for Cdc42 and Rac were then performed. The results demonstrate that Cdc42 was activated upon stimulation with 0.4% ethanol for 3 min, the peak of Cdc42 activation was detected around 40 min after the stimulation, and the activation lasted for more than 3 h (Fig.2 A). In contrast, no activation of Rac was observed (data not shown). The increases in cell motile structure at the leading edge of cells indicate that ethanol may have the capability to increase cell migration and invasion. To test this possibility, wound healing assays were performed. SVEC4–10 cell were grown to 100% confluent monolayers on cover slips and were scratched to form a 100-μm wound with the sterile pipette tips. The cells were then incubated for 18 h with or without 0.4% ethanol stimulation. Ethanol-treated SVEC4–10 cells at the leading edges of the wound migrated and spread to cover the wound significantly faster than the unstimulated cells (Fig.2 B). We also utilized Transwell migration assays to test the ability of ethanol to increase the cell migration. The results are consistent with that of the wound healing assays (data not shown). Ethanol has been indicated to enhance the metastasis and invasiveness of several kinds of cancers. We used the Matrigel invasion assays to examine whether ethanol stimulation can increase the invasion of SVEC4–10 cells. The results demonstrated that ethanol stimulation significantly increases the invasiveness of SVEC4–10 cells (Fig.2 C). In the Matrigel assays, 22% of unstimulated SVEC4–10 cells crossed the gel barrier compared with 46% of the ethanol-stimulated cells (p < 0.01, n= 3). We then investigated whether the activation of Cdc42 was required for ethanol-induced remodeling of actin filaments and increases in cell migration and cell invasion. Dominant negative Cdc42 was stably expressed into SVEC4–10 cells to establish a stable cell line (SVEC-Cdc42DN) to inhibit the activities of Cdc42. We then treated SVEC-Cdc42DN cells with 0.4% ethanol to examine changes in the integrity of actin filaments, cell migration, and cell invasion. Fig.2 D shows that the integrity of actin filaments of SVEC-Cdc42DN cells exhibited only a minor change upon the stimulation of ethanol. The actin stress fibers were well organized, and there was no increase in the formation of actin rosette-like structures or cell motile structures, indicating that the activation of Cdc42 is required for ethanol-stimulated reorganization of actin filaments. Furthermore, the expression of SVEC-Cdc42DN decreased the ability of ethanol to increase the cell migration and cell invasion (Fig. 2, B,right panels, and C). These data demonstrate that the activation of small Rho GTPase Cdc42 is essential for ethanol-stimulated reorganization of actin filaments as well as increases in cell motility and cell invasion. The ability of ethanol to induce in vitroangiogenesis was tested. Fig.3 A shows the control without ethanol treatment. Untreated SVEC4–10 cells failed to form the tube-like structures and remained as individual cells on Matrigel up to 5 h of incubation (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, ethanol-treated SVEC4–10 cells formed extensive tube-like structures on Matrigel within the same incubation time (Fig. 3 B). Development of tube-like structures is characteristic of in vitro angiogenesis. The results indicate that ethanol stimulation induced in vitro angiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells. Next, we tested whether the overexpression of dominant negative Cdc42 would affect the ability of ethanol to induce in vitroangiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells. The results show that the expression of Cdc42 dominant negative protein in SVEC4–10 cells was sufficient to inhibit in vitro angiogenesis stimulated by ethanol (Fig.3 D), indicating that the activation of Cdc42 is involved in ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis. These results lead us to test whether the overexpression of dominant positive Cdc42 alone would induce in vitro angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Dominant positive Cdc42 was stably expressed into SVEC4–10 cells to create a stable cell line (SVEC-Cdc42DP). The results show that the expression of dominant positive Cdc42 was sufficient to induce in vitro angiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells within 5 h of incubation (Fig. 3 E), whereas neither SVEC4–10 cells nor SVEC-Cdc42DN cells were able to induce in vitro angiogenesis within the same period of time (Fig. 3, A and C). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that activation of Cdc42 alone has been demonstrated to be sufficient to induce in vitro angiogenesis. To investigate whether actin filaments are involved in ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis, we treated SVEC4–10 cells with an actin filament inhibitor, cytochalasin D, and examined its effects on ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis. Fig. 3 F shows that cytochalasin D preincubation completely blocked the process of ethanol-stimulatedin vitro angiogenesis, implying that the remodeling of actin filaments is essential for ethanol-stimulated in vitroangiogenesis. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the activation of Cdc42 is not only necessary to induce ethanol-stimulated in vitro angiogenesis but is sufficient to induce in vitroangiogenesis. It has been shown that reactive oxygen species play a major role in ethanol-induced tissue damage (23Mantle D. Preedy V.R. Adverse Drug React. Toxicol. Rev. 1999; 18: 235-252PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 is generated via dismuation of the superoxide radical (O2⨪). It can be converted to the hydroxyl radical (·OH) via Fenton-type reactions in the presence of metal ions. Thus, H2O2 is a key intermediate of reactive oxygen species. To investigate the role of H2O2 in ethanol-induced angiogenesis, we detected H2O2 formation from SVEC4–10 cells stimulated by ethanol. The results demonstrated that stimulation of the cells by ethanol increased H2O2 production (Fig. 4 A). Treatment with catalase, a specific scavenger of H2O2, reduced the H2O2 production to the control level (Fig.4 A). To further confirm the functional roles of ethanol in H2O2 production, glutathione peroxidase was transiently overexpressed in SVEC4–10 cells to determine whether it could inhibit ethanol-induced H2O2 production. Glutathione peroxidase is an important antioxidant enzyme that removes H2O2 from cells and protects against oxidant damage (24Li S. Yan T. Yang J.Q. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3927-3939PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that overexpression of glutathione peroxidase substantial decreased the production of H2O2 upon stimulation with ethanol (Fig.4 A). These results demonstrate that stimulation with ethanol induces the production of H2O2 in endothelial cells. To determine whether the production of H2O2upon stimulation with ethanol is regulated by Cdc42, SVEC4–10 cells expressing a dominant negative Cdc42 protein were stimulated with ethanol. The results showed that expression of dominant negative Cdc42 inhibited ethanol-induced H2O2 production (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, expression of dominant positive Cdc42 itself is sufficient to enhance H2O2 production (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that Cdc42 is important in ethanol-induced H2O2 production. To determine whether H2O2 mediated the effects of ethanol on SVEC4–10 cells, cells were pretreated with the H2O2 scavenger catalase for 2 h and subsequently stimulated with 0.4% ethanol. Immunofluorescence assays show that pretreatment with catalase blocked the ability of ethanol to induce remodeling of the structure of actin filaments in SVEC4–10 cells (Fig. 5 A). To further confirm the role of H2O2 in mediating ethanol-induced actin filament remodeling, SVEC4–10 cells were incubated with 1 mm peroxide for 5 min followed by the immunofluorescence analysis. The results showed that the addition of peroxide partially mimicked the effects of ethanol on the changes of actin filament integrity (Fig. 5 A, 4), indicating that H2O2 production is important in ethanol-induced actin filament remodeling. Both the cell invasion and the cell migration assays demonstrated that pretreatment with catalase inhibited the ability of ethanol to increase the migration and invasiveness in SVEC4–10 cell (Figs. 5, Band C). In vitro angiogenesis assays demonstrated that pretreatment with catalase abrogated the process of angiogenesis induced by ethanol (Fig. 5 D). Fig. 5 D also shows that overexpression of glutathione peroxidase had the same inhibitory effect as catalase did in ethanol-induced in vitroangiogenesis. These results indicate that the production of H2O2 mediates the ethanol-induced reorganization of actin filaments, the increase in cell migration and cell invasion, and in vitro angiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells. To further explore how the transient activation of Cdc42 can induce the reorganization of actin filaments in a relatively long period of time, the time course of H2O2 production upon ethanol stimulation were measured. SVEC4–10 cells were stimulated with ethanol for different periods of time ranging from 3 min to 3 h followed by the detection of H2O2 production using a confocal microscope. It was found that the increase of H2O2 production began in 3 min after ethanol stimulation and lasted for 3 h (Fig.6). Further experiments revealed that the pattern of increase of H2O2 production lasted about 24 h (data not shown). The results indicate that the activation of Cdc42 upon ethanol stimulation induces a profound effect on the production of H2O2, which keeps actin filament remodeling to lead to the increases in cell motility andin vitro angiogenesis. The ethanol concentration (400 mg/dl) applied here is relatively high but is physiologically relevant to the blood alcohol concentration of heavy alcoholics (25Church M.W. Gerkin K.P. Pediatrics. 1988; 82: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the concentrations of ethanol used for in vitro studies are higher than those required to produce similar effects in vivo. One example relates to the effects of ethanol exposure on cell proliferation. The duration of the cell cycle is increased by 29% in the telencephalic ventricular zone of rats with a blood alcohol concentration of ∼180 mg/dl (26Miller M.W. Nowakowski R.S. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the length of the cell cycle of cultured neuroblastoma cells (used as a model for proliferating neuronal cells) is prolonged (+37%) by treatment with 400 mg/dl of ethanol (27Luo J. Miller M.W. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 1186-1194PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that ethanol stimulation in endothelial cells could induce the remodeling of actin filaments, disrupt actin stress fibers, and induce the formation of cell motile structures. More importantly, the remodeling of the structure of actin filaments is concomitant with the increases in the cell motility and cell invasion. The reorganization of actin filaments is essential for cell signal transduction. It is a highly coordinated process that is regulated by cell signaling cascades. It has been shown that the reorganization of the structure of actin filaments is one of driving forces that cause the cell membrane to protrude forward to form the cell motile structures, which are involved in the increases in both actin filament polymerization and cross-linking (28Condeelis J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Roberts T.M. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Mogilner A. Oster G. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3030-3045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The reorganization of actin filaments plays a major role in the cell migration and invasion. It is essential in cell extension, attachment, contraction, and release during cell migration and cell invasion (31Sheetz M.P. Felsenfeld D. Galbraith C.G. Choquet D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that ethanol stimulation could promptly reorganize the structure of actin filaments to induce the formation of cell motile structures and the dissociation of actin stress fibers within several minutes. Interestingly, similar results are found in insulin-mediated signal transduction, in which the reorganization of actin filaments occurs within several minutes upon the stimulation with insulin (13Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsiani E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,32Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the fast response of actin filaments to stimulation with ethanol enables the cells to adapt to changes in the environment properly and to transfer and propagate the signals. Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and Rho play a central role in the reorganization of the structure of actin filaments. It has been demonstrated that Cdc42 regulates the formation of filopodia, Rac regulates the formation of lamellipodia, and Rho regulates the formation of stress fibers (22Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The morphological changes in the structure of actin filaments, primarily the increase in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, upon stimulation by ethanol implies that Cdc42 and Rac could be activated. Indeed, our results demonstrate that ethanol stimulation activated Cdc42 in SVEC4–10 cells. However, no activation of Rac was detected upon stimulation with ethanol in SVEC4–10 cells (data not shown). A literature search found that it was not unprecedented that Cdc42 remodeled actin filaments to form both filopodia and lamellipodia structures independent of the activation of Rac (19Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 33Brown M.D. Cornejo B.J. Kuhn T.B. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 43: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The observation that expression of dominant negative Cdc42 blocked the effects of ethanol indicates that the activation of Cdc42 is necessary to reorganize the structure of actin filaments and to increase the cell migration and cell invasion upon stimulation with ethanol. Cdc42 has been found to control signaling pathways, such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell transformation (34Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recently, Cdc42 was found to be essential in αVβ3 integrin-mediated angiogenesis. Inhibition of αVβ3integrin-dependent activation of Cdc42 results in the suppression of angiogenesis in vivo (35Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cdc42 was also found to mediate factor VIIa/tissue factor-induced angiogenesis (36Versteeg H.H. Hoedemaeker I. Diks S.H. Stam J.C. Spaargaren M. van Bergen En Henegouwen P.M. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28750-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutation of its downstream kinase p21-activated kinase is sufficient to block angiogenesis (37Kiosses W.B. Hood J. Yang S. Gerritsen M.E. Cheresh D.A. Alderson N. Schwartz M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that Cdc42 is essential for ethanol-induced in vitroangiogenesis in SVEC4–10 cells. More importantly, we found that the overexpression of dominant positive Cdc42 is sufficient to inducein vitro angiogenesis in mouse endothelial cells. This is the first time that the overexpression of a constitutively dominant active Cdc42 alone has been demonstrated to induce in vitroangiogenesis. Our results also indicate that the in vitroangiogenesis observed in this study may be mediated through the reorganization of actin filaments. Cytochalasin D is an actin filaments inhibitor (38Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), and preincubation of SVEC4–10 cells with cytochalasin D blocked both the dominant positive Cdc42 (data not shown) and ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis. Ethanol has been shown to induce in vitro angiogenesis through the activation of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (39Jones M.K. Sarfeh I.J. Tarnawski A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, ethanol has been found to activate the angiogenic stimulator vascular endothelial growth factor through HIF-1α and Ras (7Jones M.K. Itani R.M. Wang H. Tomikawa M. Sarfeh I.J. Szabo S. Tarnawski A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1345-G1355PubMed Google Scholar, 40Szabo I.L. Kawanaka H. Jones M.K. Pai R. Soreghan B.A. Baatar D. Husain S.S. Tarnawski A.S. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is unclear at this time whether the activation of Cdc42 upon stimulation by ethanol is related to those pathways. Further studies are needed to identify the connections among these signaling pathways in ethanol-induced in vitro angiogenesis. The results obtained from the present study show that H2O2 generated by ethanol-stimulated cells may play a key role in ethanol-induced angiogenesis and that Cdc42 is responsible for the H2O2 generation. The following experimental observations support these conclusions. (a) The generation of H2O2 upon stimulation by ethanol was visualized using confocal microscopy and detected by the change in fluorescence of scopoletin in the presence of horseradish peroxidase; (b) the increase of H2O2 production lasts a relatively long period of time; (c) catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, decreased its generation; (d) dominant negative Cdc42 cells generated a low level of H2O2 compared with wild type cells; (e) catalase prevented ethanol-induced remodeling of actin filaments, decreased in cell migration and cell invasion, and reduced angiogenesis; (f) the addition of peroxide extracellularly induced actin filament remodeling; and (g) overexpression of glutathione peroxidase decreased the H2O2formation inside the cells and inhibited ethanol-induced angiogenesis. It should be noted that H2O2, a key member of the reactive oxygen species family, plays a pivoted role in various cellular processes. Recently, it has been reported that chronic alcohol toxicity is mediated primarily through oxidative stress in liver, central nervous system, and other tissues (23Mantle D. Preedy V.R. Adverse Drug React. Toxicol. Rev. 1999; 18: 235-252PubMed Google Scholar). Electron spin resonance and the analysis of indirect makers of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation protein modification, and alternation in the levels of endogenous tissue antioxidants, lead to the hypothesis that oxidative stress is an important mediator of alcohol-induced cellular injury (23Mantle D. Preedy V.R. Adverse Drug React. Toxicol. Rev. 1999; 18: 235-252PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this hypothesis, therapeutic strategies have been developed for the treatment of alcohol toxicity by administration of antioxidants (23Mantle D. Preedy V.R. Adverse Drug React. Toxicol. Rev. 1999; 18: 235-252PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that H2O2 is an important mediator in ethanol-induced remodeling of actin filament integrity and in vitro angiogenesis, and Cdc42 is an upstream mediator of H2O2 generation. This study provides a molecular basis for the role of H2O2 in the ethanol-induced cell responses. Currently, we are actively identifying the downstream signals of H2O2 in mediating the effects of ethanol on SVEC4–10 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ethanol stimulation of endothelial cells has the ability to produce H2O2 through the activation of Cdc42, which induces the reorganization of actin filaments to lead to the increases in cell migration, cell invasion, and in vitro angiogenesis. Data also demonstrate that the overexpression of a constitutively dominant active mutant Cdc42 alone is sufficient to induce the formation of H2O2 and to cause in vitro angiogenesis. Our study identifies a novel signaling pathway that links the ethanol-induced changes in Cdc42, H2O2, actin filaments, and cell motility toin vitro angiogenesis. These observations may have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in general."

Most VEGF splice forms are distinguished by the presence or absence of the peptides encoded by exons 6 and 7 of the VEGFgene that code for two independent heparin-binding domains. VEGF121 lacks both exons and does not bind to heparin. VEGF165 contains the exon 7-encoded peptide, VEGF145 contains the peptide encoded by exon 6A, and VEGF189 contains both exon 6A and exon 7 (3Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Poltorak Z. Tessler S.

VEGF206 has a structure similar to that of VEGF189, except that it contains both exons 6A and 6B of the VEGF gene. However, the contribution of exon 6B to the biological properties of VEGF206 has not been studied. The amino acids encoded by exon 8 are present in most of the VEGF splice forms. However, it was recently found that in the novel VEGF form VEGF165b, the 6 amino acids encoded by exon 8 are replaced by 6 amino acids derived from a putative ninth exon to yield a VEGF form that probably inhibits angiogenesis (9Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar). In another recently described VEGF splice form, exon 8 is completely truncated to generate a 148-amino acid form (10Whittle C. Gillespie K. Harrison R. Mathieson P.W. Harper S.J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1999; 97: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently found that VEGF forms possessing an extended N termini of unknown function also exist (11Meiron M. Anunu R. Scheinman E.J. Hashmueli S. Levi B.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Most VEGF isoforms induce proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, induce angiogenesis, and cause permeabilization of blood vessels (8Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Recently, certain differences between some common VEGF splice forms have been reported. The neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 receptors function as receptors for axon guidance factors belonging to the semaphorin family (12Neufeld G. Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was found that both neuropilins also function as VEGF receptors that differentiate between various forms of VEGF (14Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF121 cannot bind to either of the neuropilins, whereas VEGF165 binds efficiently to both receptors, and VEGF145 binds well to neuropilin-2 but not to neuropilin-1 (16Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such differences are also reflected in the functional properties of the VEGF splice forms. It was found that mice expressing only VEGF121 do not develop properly (17Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Fruttiger M. Bouche A. Yuce A. Fujisawa H. Hermans B. Shani M. Jansen S. Hicklin D. Anderson D.J. Gardiner T. Hammes H.P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. D'Amore P.A. J. Clin.

Med. 1999; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) because the heparan sulfate-binding VEGF forms are required for correct branching of blood vessels during development (19Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Likewise, mice expressing only VEGF189 display impaired arterial development (17Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Fruttiger M. Bouche A. Yuce A. Fujisawa H. Hermans B. Shani M. Jansen S. Hicklin D. Anderson D.J. Gardiner T. Hammes H.P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. D'Amore P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), suggesting that each VEGF form possesses specific characteristics and that the various VEGF forms complement each other to achieve a balanced angiogenic response.Exon 6B was first identified in VEGF206 (Fig.1C), but the effect of exon 6B on the biological properties of VEGF206 had not been studied because VEGF206, like VEGF189, is not secreted into the medium of cells that produce these VEGF forms and is thus difficult to isolate and characterize. We report here the identification of a new exon 6B-containing form of VEGF expressed by A431 ovarian carcinoma cells. This VEGF form is 162 amino acids long (VEGF162). In this work, we have characterized the properties of VEGF162 and compared them with those of the closely related VEGF145 and those of VEGF138, an artificial exon 6B-containing VEGF form.DISCUSSIONVEGF206 was identified as a nonsecreted VEGF form in which alternative splicing in the region of exon 6 of the VEGF mRNA resulted in a 41-amino acid insertion relative to the more widely distributed VEGF165. The insertion included the 24 amino acids found in VEGF189 (2Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and 17 additional amino acids. These two different portions of exon 6 have become known as exons 6A and 6B. VEGF206 is a relatively rare form of VEGF that is not released into the conditioned medium of producing cells and is therefore difficult to study. The presence of exon 6B in VEGF206 indicated that exon 6B may be present in additional forms and that the properties of such forms may perhaps be studied more readily. We therefore set out to look for such forms.We have found that A431 squamous carcinoma cells contain mRNA encoding an additional exon 6B-containing VEGF form. This form is identical to VEGF145 (4Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), except for the added amino acids encoded by exon 6B that lead to the production of a 162-amino acid-long VEGF form. This form may have been wrongly identified as VEGF165 because the mass of VEGF162 and the size of the mRNA encoding VEGF162 closely resemble VEGF165. Recombinant VEGF162 was secreted from CHO DHFR− cells and was biologically active as determined by endothelial cell proliferation assays and by its ability to induce angiogenesis in vivo. In these properties, it does not appear to be significantly different from VEGF145. VEGF162 bound to a native basement membrane produced by corneal endothelial cells. It bound to the basement membrane less efficiently than VEGF145 but better than VEGF165, which binds to such matrices relatively inefficiently, despite the substantial affinity that it displays toward heparin (4Poltorak Z.

Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The synthetic VEGF form VEGF138, which contains exon 6B but lacks exon 6A, was not able to bind to this basement membrane, behaving very similarly in this respect to VEGF121 (4Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It can therefore be concluded that exon 6B does not contribute to VEGF binding to the extracellular matrix. Rather, exon 6B seems to interfere with the interaction of exon 6A with basement membrane components, leading to a decreased extracellular matrix binding ability as compared with VEGF145. However, the interaction of VEGF162 with the basement membrane is still somewhat stronger than that of VEGF165.The evidence gathered in the past decade indicates that apparently insignificant differences in the properties of the VEGF splice forms have turned out to be biologically meaningful. Mice expressing only VEGF120 or VEGF188 develop abnormally, even if these VEGF forms are expressed at levels comparable with the expression levels of all VEGF forms put together (17Stalmans I.

These changes are the result of differential affinities to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and extracellular matrix components, differential recognition of VEGF receptors, and differential susceptibility to reactive oxygen species (8Neufeld G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10816-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These differences imply that certain forms of VEGF may act more efficiently than other forms in specific microenvironments and suggest that the differential splicing of VEGF may be more tightly regulated than is currently appreciated. Some evidence supporting such tight regulation is already available. For example, it was found that progesterone selectively up-regulates the expression of VEGF189 in decidual cells (32Ancelin M. Buteau-Lozano H. Meduri G. Osborne-Pellegrin M. Sordello S. Plouet J. Perrot-Applanat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).To conclude, we have characterized a new, secreted, biologically active VEGF splice form. Whether this VEGF splice form has a biological role distinct from that of other VEGF forms is unclear at the moment, and it is not known whether there exist specific mechanisms that regulate the synthesis of the VEGF162 mRNA. Tools that allow easy discrimination between the expression patterns of VEGF162and the other splice forms will have to be developed to study thein vivo expression patterns of VEGF162. The elucidation of these questions, as well as the design of experiments aimed at the identification of the specific biological roles of VEGF162, will most likely be the focus for the continuation of the research in the near future. The various forms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 are generated by alternative splicing from a single gene (1Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C.

VEGF206 has a structure similar to that of VEGF189, except that it contains both exons 6A and 6B of the VEGF gene. However, the contribution of exon 6B to the biological properties of VEGF206 has not been studied. The amino acids encoded by exon 8 are present in most of the VEGF splice forms. However, it was recently found that in the novel VEGF form VEGF165b, the 6 amino acids encoded by exon 8 are replaced by 6 amino acids derived from a putative ninth exon to yield a VEGF form that probably inhibits angiogenesis (9Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar). In another recently described VEGF splice form, exon 8 is completely truncated to generate a 148-amino acid form (10Whittle C. Gillespie K. Harrison R. Mathieson P.W. Harper S.J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1999; 97: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently found that VEGF forms possessing an extended N termini of unknown function also exist (11Meiron M. Anunu R. Scheinman E.J. Hashmueli S. Levi B.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Most VEGF isoforms induce proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, induce angiogenesis, and cause permeabilization of blood vessels (8Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Recently, certain differences between some common VEGF splice forms have been reported. The neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 receptors function as receptors for axon guidance factors belonging to the semaphorin family (12Neufeld G. Cohen T. Shraga N. Lange T. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was found that both neuropilins also function as VEGF receptors that differentiate between various forms of VEGF (14Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF121 cannot bind to either of the neuropilins, whereas VEGF165 binds efficiently to both receptors, and VEGF145 binds well to neuropilin-2 but not to neuropilin-1 (16Gluzman-Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such differences are also reflected in the functional properties of the VEGF splice forms. It was found that mice expressing only VEGF121 do not develop properly (17Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Fruttiger M. Bouche A. Yuce A. Fujisawa H. Hermans B. Shani M. Jansen S. Hicklin D. Anderson D.J. Gardiner T. Hammes H.P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. D'Amore P.A. J. Clin.

Perriard J.C. Dewerchin M. Flameng W. Nagy A. Lupu F. Moons L. Collen D. D'Amore P.A. Shima D.T. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) because the heparan sulfate-binding VEGF forms are required for correct branching of blood vessels during development (19Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Likewise, mice expressing only VEGF189 display impaired arterial development (17Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R. Fruttiger M. Bouche A. Yuce A. Fujisawa H. Hermans B. Shani M. Jansen S. Hicklin D. Anderson D.J. Gardiner T. Hammes H.P. Moons L. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Carmeliet P. D'Amore P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), suggesting that each VEGF form possesses specific characteristics and that the various VEGF forms complement each other to achieve a balanced angiogenic response. Exon 6B was first identified in VEGF206 (Fig.1C), but the effect of exon 6B on the biological properties of VEGF206 had not been studied because VEGF206, like VEGF189, is not secreted into the medium of cells that produce these VEGF forms and is thus difficult to isolate and characterize. We report here the identification of a new exon 6B-containing form of VEGF expressed by A431 ovarian carcinoma cells. This VEGF form is 162 amino acids long (VEGF162). In this work, we have characterized the properties of VEGF162 and compared them with those of the closely related VEGF145 and those of VEGF138, an artificial exon 6B-containing VEGF form. DISCUSSIONVEGF206 was identified as a nonsecreted VEGF form in which alternative splicing in the region of exon 6 of the VEGF mRNA resulted in a 41-amino acid insertion relative to the more widely distributed VEGF165. The insertion included the 24 amino acids found in VEGF189 (2Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and 17 additional amino acids. These two different portions of exon 6 have become known as exons 6A and 6B. VEGF206 is a relatively rare form of VEGF that is not released into the conditioned medium of producing cells and is therefore difficult to study. The presence of exon 6B in VEGF206 indicated that exon 6B may be present in additional forms and that the properties of such forms may perhaps be studied more readily. We therefore set out to look for such forms.We have found that A431 squamous carcinoma cells contain mRNA encoding an additional exon 6B-containing VEGF form. This form is identical to VEGF145 (4Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), except for the added amino acids encoded by exon 6B that lead to the production of a 162-amino acid-long VEGF form. This form may have been wrongly identified as VEGF165 because the mass of VEGF162 and the size of the mRNA encoding VEGF162 closely resemble VEGF165. Recombinant VEGF162 was secreted from CHO DHFR− cells and was biologically active as determined by endothelial cell proliferation assays and by its ability to induce angiogenesis in vivo. In these properties, it does not appear to be significantly different from VEGF145. VEGF162 bound to a native basement membrane produced by corneal endothelial cells. It bound to the basement membrane less efficiently than VEGF145 but better than VEGF165, which binds to such matrices relatively inefficiently, despite the substantial affinity that it displays toward heparin (4Poltorak Z.

Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The synthetic VEGF form VEGF138, which contains exon 6B but lacks exon 6A, was not able to bind to this basement membrane, behaving very similarly in this respect to VEGF121 (4Poltorak Z. Cohen T.

It can therefore be concluded that exon 6B does not contribute to VEGF binding to the extracellular matrix. Rather, exon 6B seems to interfere with the interaction of exon 6A with basement membrane components, leading to a decreased extracellular matrix binding ability as compared with VEGF145. However, the interaction of VEGF162 with the basement membrane is still somewhat stronger than that of VEGF165.The evidence gathered in the past decade indicates that apparently insignificant differences in the properties of the VEGF splice forms have turned out to be biologically meaningful. Mice expressing only VEGF120 or VEGF188 develop abnormally, even if these VEGF forms are expressed at levels comparable with the expression levels of all VEGF forms put together (17Stalmans I.

These differences imply that certain forms of VEGF may act more efficiently than other forms in specific microenvironments and suggest that the differential splicing of VEGF may be more tightly regulated than is currently appreciated. Some evidence supporting such tight regulation is already available. For example, it was found that progesterone selectively up-regulates the expression of VEGF189 in decidual cells (32Ancelin M. Buteau-Lozano H. Meduri G. Osborne-Pellegrin M. Sordello S. Plouet J. Perrot-Applanat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether this VEGF splice form has a biological role distinct from that of other VEGF forms is unclear at the moment, and it is not known whether there exist specific mechanisms that regulate the synthesis of the VEGF162 mRNA. Tools that allow easy discrimination between the expression patterns of VEGF162and the other splice forms will have to be developed to study thein vivo expression patterns of VEGF162. The elucidation of these questions, as well as the design of experiments aimed at the identification of the specific biological roles of VEGF162, will most likely be the focus for the continuation of the research in the near future.

https://openalex.org/W2162180044,"Most Africans farm small plots of land that have the potential to feed one family and generate income but, until recently, seldom do. Low soil fertility and crop losses from pests and droughts have reduced harvests to below subsistence levels, and many families have remained in poverty, unable to pay for education or health care. Fortunately, their lives are now improving because of a science-based Doubly Green Revolution taking place in parts of Africa. It combines elements of ecological agriculture with crop varieties designed to perform well under low-input and stress conditions, uses inorganic inputs very judiciously, and engages farmers themselves in analyzing their needs and adapting new varieties and agronomic practices to their own conditions. Greater commitments and new partnerships are needed to sustain and expand this revolution in agriculture to small-scale farming families all across Africa."

Anchorage-independent growth exhibited by Notch-repressed NIH 3T3 cells may result from prolonged FGFR stimulation caused by both an increase in the expression of prototypic and oncogenic FGF gene family members and the nonclassical export of FGF1 into the extracellular compartment. Interestingly, FGF exerts a negative effect on Notch by suppressing CSL (CBF-1/RBP-Jk/KBF2 in mammals, Su(H) inDrosophila and Xenopus, and Lag-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans)-dependent transcription, and the ectopic expression of constitutively active forms of Notch1 or Notch2 abrogates FGF1 release and the phenotypic effects of FGFR stimulation.

We have reported previously that suppression of endogenous Notch signaling mediated by the ectopic expression of either an extracellular and soluble form of Jagged1 (sJ1)1 or dominant-negative mutants of Notch1 (dnN1) or Notch2 (dnN2) induces dramatic changes in the NIH 3T3 cellular phenotype in comparison with NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the empty vector (vector control). These changes in cellular phenotype include chord formation on collagen matrices; increased Src activation and enhanced phosphorylation of the Src substrate, cortactin; a decrease in the formation of actin filaments and focal adhesion sites; impaired migratory ability; and increased survival at high cell densities (11Small D.

In contrast, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing either constitutively active mutants of Notch1 (caN1) or Notch2 (caN2) display a phenotype similar to that exhibited by the vector control cells (11Small D.

Our initial interest in Notch originated from our observation that Jagged1 was an FGF response gene in human endothelial cells undergoing differentiation on fibrin clots (26Zimrin A.B. Pepper M.S.

Because several of the phenotypic characteristics displayed by Notch-repressed cells were dependent on the activity of the FGFR effector molecule Src (11Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L.

Whereas several studies report that the expression of Notch and/or its ligands is correlated with activation of the FGFR signaling pathway (27Bongarzone E.R. Byravan S. Givogri M.I. Schonmann V.

Development. 1999; 126: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about how interactions between these two important and ubiquitous pathways influence cellular phenotype, including growth. To address this question, we examined the effects of FGFR stimulation in combination with Notch repression or activation in NIH 3T3 cells. We decided to study these interactions in the NIH 3T3 cell because we had already identified phenotypic characteristics associated with the down-regulation of Notch signaling (11Small D. Kovalenko D.

We report that antagonistic interactions between the Notch and FGFR signaling pathways regulate anchorage-independent growth in murine fibroblasts. Stimulation of the FGFR pathway by exogenous FGF1 causes Notch-repressed cells to grow as detached spheroids in tissue culture and to aggressively form colonies in soft agar, phenotypic characteristics associated with cellular transformation (reviewed in Ref. 35Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The transformed phenotype exhibited by Notch-repressed cells may be attributed to their maintenance of FGFR-generated signals generated by an increase in both the expression and release of FGF family members. Furthermore, FGF1 has an inhibitory effect on Notch/CSL-dependent transcription. In contrast, the expression of caN1 or caN2 protects the NIH 3T3 cell from FGF-induced anchorage-independent growth and suppresses the release of FGF1 under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that cross-talk between the Notch and FGFR signaling pathways may represent an important autoregulatory mechanism that is involved in the regulation of cell growth. Stable NIH 3T3 transfectants for vector control, sJ1, dnN1, dnN2, caN1, and caN2 were obtained and screened for expression as described previously (11Small D. Kovalenko D. Kacer D. Liaw L.

Clonal populations of NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with vector control, sJ1, caN1, caN2, dnN1, dnN2, hst-β(FGF4):FGF1, or caRas were plated on 6-cm tissue culture dishes with 0.5% agar in an overlay containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% bovine calf serum (BCS; Hyclone), and 0.33% agar at 1.5 × 103 cells/dish. As indicated, some dishes were also treated with 1 μm of the FGFR1-specific inhibitor, PD166866 (Ref. 36Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Dahring T.K. Batley B.L. Connolly C. Hamby J.M. Brown K.J. J. Pharmacol.

Cells were fed with 0.5 ml of media with or without FGF1 and/or the FGFR1-specific inhibitor every 3 days as indicated. Twenty days after plating, colonies were stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma) for visualization. Quantitation of colony formation was achieved by counting all p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet-stained colonies consisting of more than 4 cells under a Zeiss Stemi SVII Apo dissecting microscope. Clonal populations of NIH 3T3 stable transfectants were resuspended and grown in media containing 10% BCS, 10% BCS plus 1 μmPD166866, 10% BCS plus 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1 and 10 units/ml heparin, or 10% BCS plus 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1, 10 units/ml heparin, and 1 μm PD166866 as indicated in the figure legend. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were plated per well (6-well dish), and 3 days after plating, phase-contrast micrographs of the cells were taken. hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 stable transfectants were transduced with either adenovirus expressing lacZ, dominant negative FGFR, caN1, or caN2 as described below. After 24 h, the cells were plated on 6-well dishes at a concentration of 105cells/well, and 3 days after plating, phase-contrast micrographs of the cells were taken. For colony formation in the soft agar assay, the hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 transfectants were transduced with the indicated recombinant adenoviral vectors and plated into 0.33% agar 24 h after the transduction. Two weeks after plating, colonies were visualized by staining with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet. Total RNA from vector control, sJ1, caN1, and dnN1 stable transfectants was isolated using Tri ReagentTM(Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was obtained from 5 μg of total RNA with SuperScriptTM(Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase using an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen).

PCR amplification was performed for 45 cycles as follows: 40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 50 °C (for FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, and FGFR3) or at 55 °C (for FGF1, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, FGF9, FGF10, FGFR1, and FGFR2), and 1 min at 72 °C. For FGF5, RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (37Ozawa K. Suzuki S. Asada M. Tomooka Y. Li A.J. Yoneda A. Komi A. Imamura T. J. Biol.

Adenovirus vector expressing lacZ, FGF1, caN1, dnN1, caN2, or dnN2 was prepared as described previously (38Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a titer of ∼1012 viral particles/ml. For adenoviral transduction, NIH 3T3 stable transfectants were incubated in serum-free medium with ∼103 viral particles/cell in the presence of poly-d-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma) (5 × 103 molecules/viral particle) for 2 h at 37 °C, after which the adenovirus-containing medium was removed and replaced with serum-containing medium (10% BCS) for an additional 24 h. The transduced cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and seeded for the heat shock experiments as described previously (39Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After heat shock, the conditioned media from cells exposed to either 37 °C (normal conditions) or 42 °C (heat shock conditions) were treated with 0.1% dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C, adsorbed to heparin-Sepharose, and eluted from the column with 1.5 mNaCl. The eluants were resolved by 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and evaluated by FGF1 immunoblot analysis as described previously (39Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated (10 μg/cm2) 12-well tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected at ∼80% confluency with 500 ng of a luciferase construct activated by four tandem copies of the CSL (CBF1) response element (40Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), 100 ng of the TK Renilla (Promega) construct as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and 500 ng of either vector control, sJ1, or caN1 constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of caN1 activity in the background of NIH 3T3 stable lines, vector control, caN1, sJ1, and hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 stable transfectants were plated onto fibronectin-coated (10 μg/cm2) 12-well tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected with 500 ng of the CSL-luciferase construct, 100 ng of the TK Renilla (Promega) construct as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and 200 ng of caN1. For all experiments, the medium was replaced 24 h after transfection with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% BCS or with 10% BCS containing 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1 and 10 units/ml heparin as indicated in the figure legend. The cells were harvested 48 h after the media change, and luciferase/Renilla activity was measured using Promega's Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The efficiency of transcription was measured and normalized in relationship to the activity of pRL-TK Renilla, and the activity is reported as the ratio of luciferase/Renilla activity. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and error bars represent the S.E. Vector control, sJ1, caN1, Jagged1, hst-β(FGF4):FGF1, and sJ1:caN1 stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were plated on tissue culture dishes in either normal growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen), 10% BCS (Hyclone), or normal growth media containing 10 ng/ml recombinant FGF1 and 10 units/ml heparin. Cells were harvested at confluence (based on the status of vector control cells grown in normal growth media). Because hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 stable transfectants and the sJ1 transfectants grown in FGF1-containing media form spheroids, all cells were harvested by scraping in the presence of the growth media, and then the cells/growth media were collected into sterile 15-ml conical tubes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were pelleted, and the supernatant containing soluble proteins was removed. Samples were normalized for protein concentration using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal protein loads were resolved by 8% acrylamide (w/v) SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond C (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with the Jagged1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Jagged1 was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against goat IgG (Sigma) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In an effort to further our understanding of how interactions between the Notch and FGFR signaling pathways regulate cellular processes, we examined the response of Notch-activated and Notch-repressed NIH 3T3 cells to the addition of recombinant FGF1 to the growth media (Fig.1). Surprisingly, NIH 3T3 cells in which endogenous Notch signaling was repressed (sJ1 and dnN1) formed multicellular, spheroid-like structures similar to those observed in NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing an oncogenic mutant of FGF1 engineered with the FGF4 signal peptide sequence (hst-β(FGF4):FGF1) to force constitutive secretion of FGF1 through the conventional ER-Golgi pathway (31Forough R. Xi Z. MacPhee M. Friedman S. Engleka K.A. Sayers T. Wiltrout R.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2960-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells contained within the spheroid structures were viable because they continued to proliferate over time and also grew as a monolayer when replated onto fresh tissue culture dishes in the absence of recombinant FGF1 in the growth media (data not shown). In contrast, vector control and caN1 NIH 3T3 cell stable transfectants did not form spheroids but instead continued to grow as a monolayer in the presence of recombinant FGF1. Spheroid formation was a specific response to FGF1 because treatment with the FGFR1-specific inhibitor PD166866 (36Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Dahring T.K. Batley B.L. Connolly C. Hamby J.M. Brown K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 569-577PubMed Google Scholar) completely abolished FGF1-induced spheroid formation in sJ1, dnN1, and hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 stable transfectants. Cellular proliferation despite detachment from the extracellular matrix is indicative of anchorage-independent growth in most cell types and is an in vitro signature of the NIH 3T3 cell transformed phenotype (34Shih C. Shilo B.Z. Goldfarb M.P. Dannenberg A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5714-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined our Notch-activated and Notch-repressed cell lines for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar in both the presence and absence of exogenously added recombinant FGF1 (Fig. 2, A andB). Although we have previously reported (25Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that sJ1 NIH 3T3 stable transfectants do not form colonies in soft agar when plated at low seed densities (100 cells/6-cm dish) in growth media containing 10% BCS, we have found during the course of these studies that sJ1and dnN1 transfectants do form small, pinpoint-sized colonies in soft agar when plated at seed densities greater than 1,500 cells/6-cm dish. The addition of FGF1 to the growth media greatly exaggerated the size of the colonies formed by sJ1 and dnN1 transfectants so that they were clearly visible to the eye, although the number of colonies did not significantly increase. Indeed, the intensity of the transformed phenotype induced by FGF1 in the Notch-repressed NIH 3T3 cells resembled that exhibited by NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing either an oncogenic Ras construct (caRas) or an oncogenic mutant of FGF1 (hst-β(FGF4):FGF1). Interestingly, the size of the colonies also increased at seed densities of 5,000–10,000 cells/6-cm dish, even in the absence of exogenously added recombinant FGF1 (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of FGF1 had either no effect or only resulted in the formation of sparse and very small colonies in the caN1 and vector control transfectants. These transfectants also do not form colonies, regardless of plating concentration, in the absence of FGF1. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing dnN2 but not caN2 also formed small colonies whose size was dramatically increased in the presence of FGF1 (data not shown). Similar to spheroid formation, FGF potentiation of soft agar growth in NIH 3T3 cells was a specific response to FGFR stimulation because the addition of the FGFR1 inhibitor PD166866 substantially reduced FGF1-mediated colony formation in sJ1, dnN1, and the hst-β(FGF4):FGF1 transfectants but had no effect on colony formation in the caRas cells. Treatment with PD166866 also inhibited small colony growth exhibited by sJ1 and dnN1 in the absence of FGF1. These data suggest that repression of endogenous Notch signaling sensitizes the NIH 3T3 cell to FGFR-mediated cellular transformation and that activation of the Notch signaling pathway may protect the NIH 3T3 cell from abnormal growth. To further explore the possibility that Notch signaling may protect the NIH 3T3 cell from FGF-mediated anchorage-independent growth, we assayed the ability of sJ1 NIH 3T3 stable transfectants cotransfected with caN1 to form colonies in both the presence and absence of FGF1. Expression of caN1 in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 background dramatically inhibited, in terms of both number and size, colony formation that occurred in the presence or absence of FGF1. Indeed, the number of colonies formed by the sJ1:caN1 cotransfectants was similar to that observed in vector control and caN1 stable lines (Fig. 2, A and B). Unlike sJ1 single transfectants, sJ1:caN1 cotransfectants did not form spheroids in the presence of FGF1. However, these cells were less adherent to the tissue culture dish than the vector control or caN1 cells (Fig. 1). Altho"
https://openalex.org/W2070542410,"Fusion proteins between heptahelical receptors (GPCR) and G protein α-subunits show enhanced signaling efficiency in transfected cells. This is believed to be the result of molecular proximity, because the interaction between linked modules of one protein chain, if not constrained by structure, should be strongly favored compared with the same in which partners react as free species. To test this assumption we made a series of fusion proteins (type 1 and 4 opioid receptors with Go and β2adrenergic and dopamine 1 receptors with GsL) and some mutated analogs carrying different tags and defective GPCR or Gα subunits. Using cotransfection experiments with readout protocols able to distinguish activation at fused and non-fused α-subunits, we found that both the GPCR and the Gα limb of one fusion protein can freely interact with non-fused proteins and the tethered partners of a neighboring fusion complex. Moreover, a bulky polyanionic inhibitor can suppress with identical potency receptor-Gα interaction, either when occurring between latched domains of a fused system or separate elements of distinct molecules, indicating that the binding surfaces are equally accessible in both cases. These data demonstrate that there is no entropy drive from the linked condition of fusion proteins and suggest that their signaling may result from the GPCR of one complex interacting with the α-subunit of another. Moreover, the enhanced coupling efficiency commonly observed for fusion proteins is not due to the receptor tether, but to the transmembrane helix that anchors Gα to the membrane. Fusion proteins between heptahelical receptors (GPCR) and G protein α-subunits show enhanced signaling efficiency in transfected cells. This is believed to be the result of molecular proximity, because the interaction between linked modules of one protein chain, if not constrained by structure, should be strongly favored compared with the same in which partners react as free species. To test this assumption we made a series of fusion proteins (type 1 and 4 opioid receptors with Go and β2adrenergic and dopamine 1 receptors with GsL) and some mutated analogs carrying different tags and defective GPCR or Gα subunits. Using cotransfection experiments with readout protocols able to distinguish activation at fused and non-fused α-subunits, we found that both the GPCR and the Gα limb of one fusion protein can freely interact with non-fused proteins and the tethered partners of a neighboring fusion complex. Moreover, a bulky polyanionic inhibitor can suppress with identical potency receptor-Gα interaction, either when occurring between latched domains of a fused system or separate elements of distinct molecules, indicating that the binding surfaces are equally accessible in both cases. These data demonstrate that there is no entropy drive from the linked condition of fusion proteins and suggest that their signaling may result from the GPCR of one complex interacting with the α-subunit of another. Moreover, the enhanced coupling efficiency commonly observed for fusion proteins is not due to the receptor tether, but to the transmembrane helix that anchors Gα to the membrane.

However, the interpretation of experiments in which fusion proteins are used as investigational probes requires an understanding of how receptor and G proteins interact in such chimeric proteins.The underlying assumption is that the proximal GPCR unit in each fused assembly can interact with the distal tethered α-subunit. Thus, what is normally an intermolecular binding reaction between separate partners is believed to become, by fusion, an intramolecular interaction between flanked domains of the same protein. This assumption comes from thermodynamic considerations. If the binding surfaces of the receptor and the Gα subunit can establish contacts in the fusion construct, molecular proximity should make this intrinsic interaction strongly favored over any other.The validity of such assumption was never tested however.

However, this is not proof that interactions occur intramolecularly in the fusion protein, since it may simply mean that the receptor of one fusion protein can interact with the α-subunit of another. In fact, there are data suggesting, to our view, that intramolecular interactions may not be likely; for example, the finding that receptors of the fusion proteins interact with endogenous α-subunits (21Burt A.R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we address the question of whether the intrinsic interaction between receptor and the α-subunit of a fusion protein is entropically favored over the extrinsic interaction with fused or non-fused partners.We prepared a number of fusion proteins consisting of a receptor sequence (β2-adrenergic, D1-dopamine, δ-opioid, and nociceptin receptors) chained through a short 15-mer peptide to the amino-terminal of a G protein α-subunit (GαsL and Gαo). Fusions between mutated analogues of either the receptor or the α-subunit were also engineered in a similar fashion. Using such constructs and cotransfection experiments to distinguish the activation of tethered and non-tethered forms of Gα subunits, we find that both components of one fusion protein freely interact with non-fused units or the fused elements of another.This indicates that there is no preferential interaction between the tied units enclosed in one fused assembly and suggests that signaling at these chimeric proteins is more likely the result of cross-interactions between receptor and α-subunits located in neighboring molecular assemblies.DISCUSSIONWe show in this study that the fusion between GPCR and α-subunit, although ensuring their expression as tethered units in the plasma membrane, does not force their interaction to the 1:1 stoichiometry that molecular proximity would imply. This conclusion is based on a variety of diverse experimental evidences. (a) We found that agonists acting through a fused GPCR can activate with identical EC50 both fused and endogenous α-subunits, which suggests that the receptor of the fusion protein can bind to either α-subunit with equal efficiency. (b) The characteristic enhancement of GTPγS stimulation observed in fusion proteins could be mimicked when a non-fused GPCR and a α-subunit tethered to a single transmembrane polypeptide are co-expressed in the membrane, which indicates that this enhanced stimulation does not require molecular proximity but simply that the α-subunit be inserted in the membrane via a transmembrane handle. (c) Similarly, the GPCR-tethered α-subunit of a fusion protein can be activated by a second non-tethered GPCR receptor cotransfected in the same membrane, and the effects are not additive when both agonists at saturating concentrations are present. This means that tethered and not GPCR can compete for the same receptor-linked α-subunit. (d) Moreover, we found extensive cross-reactions between the GPCR of one fusion protein and the α-subunit of another, when cotransfected in the same membrane. This cross-reaction was observed regardless of whether in one of the cotransfected pair of fusion proteins the α-subunit was made inactive or constitutively active. It was also verified by individually measuring Gα activation in two Gs-attached co-expressed receptors. (e) Finally, the fact that a bulky polyanionic inhibitor blocks with identical potency receptor and G protein reacting as fused or as separate partners is additional evidence that the interacting surfaces are equally accessible in both cases.Taken collectively, these data provide compelling evidence that when GPCR and the α-subunit are linked into one protein, interactions can occur with equal chance within the same or between separate macromolecules. Therefore, the improved “coupling efficiency” generally observed for fusion proteins (1Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Seifert R. Seifert-Wenzel K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol.

Methods. 2001; 45: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) does not result from the tethered status of the reactants. These results are surprising and suggest two equally possible but radically different interpretations.One interpretation comes from the same intuitive argument that leads us to assume 1:1 stoichiometry of interaction for the fused construct: the reaction between receptor and Gα linked by a covalent bond should be thermodynamically favored over that between unattached molecules. Since it is not so, it means that when GPCR and the α-subunit are part of the same polypeptide backbone their binding surfaces cannot easily make contact. Hence, binding to partners belonging to adjacent molecules is just as possible or even predominant, and the interactions between fused and non-fused species appear equally probable simply because they are intermolecular in both cases. While this a rational explanation, the reason why the fused status would exert hindrance to intramolecular but not to intermolecular contacts is, however, not obvious.A trivial consideration is that the peptide bond between the α-subunit and the receptor carboxyl terminus may significantly reduce the degree of freedom of Gα, compared with its native lipid-tethered status. This may impose enough rotational constraints to make the proper alignment of the electronegative binding surfaces of Gα with the footprint of its tethered GPCR difficult, without however limiting its orientation with respect to a neighboring GPCR molecule. As long as orientation is a crucial factor for receptor-Gα interaction, this is a sound explanation. Alternatively, it may be the binding to βγ that makes the interactions within the fused construct unfavorable. We have verified, in agreement with others (1Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Wise A. Carr C. Milligan G. Biochem.

Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), that GPCR-tethered α-subunits can interact with βγ, and do so just as effectively as purified α-subunits, when judged by ADP-ribosylation. There is ample evidence that the binding surface of the G protein for the receptor comprises residues from both α- and βγ-subunits (42Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-213402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. Vandort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol.

It is possible that the formation of the heterotrimer with membrane-attached βγ attracts the tethered α-subunit away from its intramolecular GPCR and facilitates the interaction with that of a nearby molecules, thus largely offsetting the entropic advantage of their tied condition. Unfortunately, we have not been able to design an experiment capable of distinguishing between these two possibilities, although a fusion protein that includes a GPCR and both β- and α-subunits, if still signaling-competent, might help.To question the occurrence of intramolecular coupling in fusion proteins, Small et al. (12Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that the signaling properties of β2AR-Gs expressed at physiological levels in cells were not consistent with a significant shift of the intrinsic equilibrium of the receptor toward the active form. Yet, if the covalently linked α-subunit could interact with the tethered GPCR, that propensity should induce a high degree of constitutive activation (12Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).A second possible interpretation of the results is that the supramolecular architecture that organizes the interaction between receptors and G proteins in the membrane (47Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) plays such a dominant role in driving their reaction, that the effect of a covalent linkage between interacting partners is irrelevant. A variety of diverse experimental evidences suggests that the interaction between receptor and G proteins occurs between preassembled units rather than between random encounters floating long distances within the plane of the lipid bilayer (47Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 48Rodbell M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is not known yet what mechanism ensures efficient “precoupling” of receptor and G proteins in the membrane. However, data suggesting the formation of stable oligomeric forms for either Gα subunits (48Rodbell M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and GPCR (49Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 50Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), including opioid (51Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and β2-adrenergic (52Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, have been reported. This process may represent a primary mechanism of concentrating interactions for such signaling macromolecules. If receptors and α-subunits interact normally as dimeric or higher order oligomeric forms, and if the assembly of oligomers is not disturbed by the covalent linkage between GPCR and α-subunit, the spatial proximity that such an arrangement can generate may render the effect of fusion virtually unnoticeable.Apart from what inhibits exclusive interactions between the tethered members of RG fusion proteins, an additional question concerns the enhancement of signaling efficiency generally observed with such constructs. If there is no entropic gain in the interaction of covalently linked receptor and α-subunit why do they appear to react more efficaciously than the cotransfected native molecules?We found that the cotransfection of non-fused receptor with αο tethered to a transmembrane polypeptide (but not with native αο) can reproduce the enhancement of agonist-induced nucleotide exchange observed when the same GPCR and α-subunit are expressed as a fusion protein. Similar observations were made following the cotransfection of β2AR or D1R with a single transmembrane domain-tethered form of Gs (53Lee T.W. Seifert R. Guan X. Kobilka B.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13801-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is the α-helical anchored status of the α-subunit, not fusion to the receptor, which causes the increase in receptor coupling. Yet, the reason for this enhancement remains unclear.Restricted membrane mobility, enhanced hydrophobic interactions with receptor transmembrane domains, improved cytoskeletal interactions (53Lee T.W. Seifert R. Guan X. Kobilka B.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13801-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), or prevention of Gα release from the membrane (2Seifert R. Seifert-Wenzel K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13801-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) are all possible mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the enhanced coupling efficiency of transmembrane-tethered α-subunits. Here we offer an additional suggestion. Unlike native G proteins, either V2TM-αo (22Guzzi F. Zanchetta D. Chini B. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 323-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the OP1R and β2AR-tethered α-subunits used in this study 2M. C. Gro and T. Costa, manuscript in preparation. were found excluded from low density Triton-resistant vesicles, representing cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane (54Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Kubler E. Koleske A.J. Sargiacomo M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that a docked GPCR provides the sole means of membrane insertion for the otherwise cytosolic acylation-defective mutants of α-subunits (55Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24673-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. Windh R.T. Chen C.A. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37435-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, an interesting possibility is that the transmembrane anchor of the α-subunits, by targeting such molecules to the plasma membrane outside of the caveolin-rich rafts where they are naturally located, can shield them from a constitutive inhibitory influence and favor receptor interactions. Fusion genes between a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 and the corresponding G protein α-subunit are not found in nature, but have been generated in several laboratories over the past years. First shown by Bertinet al. (1Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, what is normally an intermolecular binding reaction between separate partners is believed to become, by fusion, an intramolecular interaction between flanked domains of the same protein. This assumption comes from thermodynamic considerations. If the binding surfaces of the receptor and the Gα subunit can establish contacts in the fusion construct, molecular proximity should make this intrinsic interaction strongly favored over any other. The validity of such assumption was never tested however. Bacterial toxin inactivation of endogenous G proteins (3Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol.

However, this is not proof that interactions occur intramolecularly in the fusion protein, since it may simply mean that the receptor of one fusion protein can interact with the α-subunit of another.

https://openalex.org/W2074312049,"The difference in hormone selectivity between the human follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (hFSH-R) and human luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (hLH-R) is determined by their ∼350 amino acid-long N-terminal receptor exodomains that allow the mutually exclusive binding of human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) and human luteinizing hormone (hLH) when these hormones are present in physiological concentrations. The exodomains of each of these receptors consist of a nine-leucine-rich repeat-containing subdomain (LRR subdomain) flanked by N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich subdomains. Chimeric receptors, in which the structural subdomains of the hFSH-R exodomain were substituted with those of the hLH-R, showed a similar high responsiveness to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and hLH as long as they harbored the LRR subdomain of the hLH-R. In addition, these chimeric receptors showed no responsiveness to hFSH. The LRR subdomains of the gonadotropin receptor exodomains are predicted to adopt a horseshoe-like conformation, of which the hormone-binding concave surface is composed of nine parallel β-strands. Receptors in which individual β-strands of the hFSH-R were replaced with the corresponding hLH-R sequences revealed that hCG and hLH selectivity is predominantly determined by hLH-R β-strands 3 and 6. A mutant receptor in which the hFSH-R β-strands 3 and 6 were substituted simultaneously with their hLH-R counterparts displayed a responsiveness to hCG and hLH similar to that of the wild type hLH-R. Responsiveness to hFSH was not affected by most β-strand substitutions, suggesting the involvement of multiple low-impact determinants for this hormone.

Huhtaniemi I.T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 551-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some species, chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is also able to stimulate the LH-R. The coordinated interplay between the complementary and specific actions of FSH and LH(/CG) is required to guarantee successful reproduction. The interaction between these gonadotropins and their respective receptors is highly specific, and there is virtually no cross-reactivity between hormones and heterologous receptors (i.e. high receptor selectivity) except for LH and CG, which both act on the LH-R (2Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 3Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The FSH-R and LH-R, together with the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, represent the structurally unique glycoprotein hormone receptor (GpHR) subfamily of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Characteristically, GpHRs are composed of two approximately equally sized but functionally distinct domains: an extracellular N-terminal half (exodomain), which is responsible for the selective recognition and high-affinity binding of its corresponding hormone, and a typical G protein-coupled receptor domain, consisting of seven transmembrane α-helices, which transduces the specific signal of hormone binding to the exodomain across the membrane to activate intracellular signaling pathways (4Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The GpHR exodomain is subdivided into three structural subdomains: an N-terminal cysteine-rich subdomain (NCR subdomain) followed by a nine contiguous imperfect leucine-rich repeat-containing subdomain (LRR subdomain) and a C-terminal cysteine-rich subdomain (CCR subdomain; see Figs. 1 and2 A).Figure 2Cell surface expression and ligand-induced cAMP production of wild type hFSH-R, wild type hLH-R, and chimeric hFSH-Rs transiently expressed in HEK-T 293 cells.

Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analyses of some of these LRR-containing proteins, such as the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (6Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and Listeria internalins (7Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), revealed that each LRR forms a right-handed structural unit that is composed of a short β-strand and a helical segment, which are positioned nearly antiparallel to each other and are linked by short loops. Tandem arrays of LRR units form a one- to three-quarter donut-like structure with the consecutive β-strands forming a parallel β-sheet at the concave surface, whereas the alternating helices are aligned next to each other to form the convex side of the structure. The concave surface of the ribonuclease inhibitor interacts with ribonucleases using multiple contact points (6Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, the exodomains of GpHRs have been structurally modeled using the crystal structure of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (8Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1147-1159PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the β-sheet at the inner circumference of the curved exodomain of GpHRs has been proposed to form the main hormone-binding site, with some additional hormone contact sites situated outside the LRR subdomain (11Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

Each of the LRR β-strands is composed of a highly conservedX 1 X 2 LX 3 LX 4 X 5motif (Fig. 1), in which Xindicates any amino acid and L refers to leucine, isoleucine, or other hydrophobic residues (5Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The side chains of the conserved L residues are directed toward the helical segment and form the hydrophobic core of the LRR structure, whereas the side chains of the X residues are exposed to the surface of the presumed ligand-binding site (13Song Y.S.

Studies using chimeric receptors revealed that the sequence NCR-LRR6 of the LH-R is important to confer LH/CG selectivity to the receptor, whereas the sequence NCR-LRR3 of the FSH-R, in conjunction with the FSH-R sequence LRR7-CCR, is important for FSH binding specificity (2Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 3Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Myers R.V. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang X. Nature. 1994; 368: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, these results may be somewhat biased because the junctions of these chimeric proteins were introduced arbitrarily, depending mainly on the presence of common endonuclease restriction sites rather than considering the exact structural borders within the exodomain. Taking advantage of the current knowledge of the structural conformation of the exodomain of GpHRs, we examined in more detail the contribution of the NCR, LRR, and CCR subdomains of the human LH-R (hLH-R) exodomain in conferring human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and/or human LH (hLH) selectivity when placed in the context of a human FSH-R (hFSH-R) background. Furthermore, the contribution of individual (and combinations of) hLH-R β-strands in directing hCG and hLH (hCG/hLH) selectivity to the receptor was studied systematically with mutant receptors generated by introducing hLH-R β-strands into the hFSH-R. Human recombinant FSH (hFSH, Org32489E), human recombinant LH (hLH, 99M7019), and human recombinant chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 01MZ010) were kindly provided by Dr. W. G. E. J. Schoonen (Organon Inc., Oss, The Netherlands). The high-affinity monoclonal anti-HA antibody and goat anti-rat IgG peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. The cDNAs encoding the human FSH-R and LH-R, kindly provided by Dr. T. Minegishi (Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan) and Dr. E. Milgrom (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France), respectively, were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). To quantify receptor cell surface expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an HA epitope (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala; derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin) was introduced between the C termini of the signal peptide sequences and the N termini of the mature FSH-R (i.e. between Gly17 and Cys18) and the mature LH-R (i.e. between Leu29 and Arg30). HA epitope tagging did not significantly influence the ligand binding and signaling properties of the receptors compared with their wild type counterparts (data not shown). HA-tagged receptor cDNAs were used as templates to generate hFSH-R and hLH-R exodomain chimeras using a fusion PCR-based method (16Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′- and 3′-cDNA fragments were generated using overlapping primers (Invitrogen and Isogen) in combination with specific primers demarcating the cDNA insert. These PCR fragments were then fused in a self-primed PCR taking advantage of the introduced overlapping sequence. The fusion products were then PCR-amplified using the specific primers demarcating the cDNA insert. All PCRs were performed using the Advantage-HF PCR kit (Clontech). Four different exodomain chimeras (Fig.2 A) were generated in which particular hFSH-R domains were substituted with either the entire exodomain of the hLH-R (generating the chimera LLL-hFSH-R), or with the LRR subdomain in combination with either the NCR subdomain or the CCR subdomain of hLH-R (LLF-hFSH-R and FLL-hLH-R), or with only the LRR subdomain of the hLH-R (FLF-hFSH-R). In a similar way, a set of mutant receptors was generated in which the residues indicated with X, and unique to the β-strand motifs (X 1 X 2 LX 3 LX 4 X 5) of the hLH-R, were introduced to replace residues on the homologous position in the hFSH-R (see Tables II, III, and V for the details of which residues were replaced). All cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector and sequenced on automated ABI PRISM 310 and 377 DNA sequencers using Dye Terminator cycle sequencing chemistry in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems).Table IISummary of the ligand-induced intracellular cAMP production in HEK-T 293 cells transiently transfected with wild type hFSH-R, the chimeric LLL-hFSH-R (see Table I), and mutant hFSH-R constructsReceptor constructsWild type XXLXLXXMutantXXLXLXXhCG EC50EC50wt/muthFSH EC50EC50wt/mutng/mlng/mlWild type hFSH-R397 ± 22.6a1.000.106 ± 0.019e1.00LLL-hFSH-R0.603 ± 0.086b658NDNDhFSH-R/Lβ1IELRFVLTRLSFAYNDND280 ± 63.2f0.0003hFSH-R/Lβ2EKIEISQIKIEISQ568 ± 64.3a0.700.088 ± 0.030e1.20hFSH-R/Lβ3HEIRIEKSEILIQN6.55 ± 1.46c600.064 ± 0.011e1.66hFSH-R/Lβ4QYLILSNKYLSICN>30002-iLigand efficacy was too low to calculate EC50values; therefore, the estimated mean EC50 values are presented.<0.151.53 ± 0.102g0.07hFSH-R/Lβ5VLLDIQDFILEICD>20002-iLigand efficacy was too low to calculate EC50values; therefore, the estimated mean EC50 values are presented.<0.200.232 ± 0.025e0.46hFSH-R/Lβ6VILWLNKVTLKLYG3.88 ± 0.383c1020.145 ± 0.008e0.73hFSH-R/Lβ7DELNLSDTSLELKENDND13.7 ± 2.37h0.0077hFSH-R/Lβ8VILDISRKTLDISS773 ± 179a0.500.533 ± 0.232g0.20hFSH-R/Lβ9KKIRARSQRLIATS151 ± 22.5d2.600.073 ± 0.018e1.45hFSH-R/Lβ3,Lβ6HEIRIEKSEILIQNVILWLNKVTLKLYG0.589 ± 0.106b6730.186 ± 0.031e0.57hFSH-R/Lβ4,Lβ5QYLILSNKYLSICNVLLDIQDFILEICD354 ± 75.3a,d1.120.322 ± 0.093e0.33hFSH-R/Lβ4-C133SQYLILSNKYLSISN824 ± 332a0.480.133 ± 0.006e0.80hFSH-R/Lβ5-C158SVLLDIQDFILEISD1491 ± 949a0.260.116 ± 0.010e0.91Cyclic AMP production upon stimulation with hCG, hLH, and hFSH was measured in HEK-T 293 cells, transiently cotransfected with various receptor constructs and a plasmid containing a β-galactosidase gene under control of a promoter containing five cAMP-response elements (pCRE/β-gal).

Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously (17Vischer H.F. Bogerd J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transfection the cells were stimulated for 6 h with various concentrations of hFSH, hCG, and hLH in 25 μl of Hepes-modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (all from Sigma). Ligand-induced changes in β-galactosidase activity (conversion ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside intoo-nitrophenol) were measured at 405 nm and related to the forskolin-induced changes (10 μm) in each 96-well plate. Therefore, the results are expressed as arbitrary units related to the forskolin-induced cAMP-mediated reporter gene activation. All experiments were repeated at least three times using cells from independent transfections, each performed in triplicate. Competition ligand binding assays were carried out on purified cell membranes from HEK-T 293 cells expressing (mutant or chimeric) receptors. Two days after transfection, HEK-T 293 cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), subsequently harvested in ice-cold Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2·6 H2O, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 200 × gat 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer containing 250 mm sucrose and homogenized by 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C, and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in Tris buffer. Cell membranes (∼50 μg of protein) were incubated for 18–20 h in 300 μl of Tris buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature with 10,000 cpm of [125I]hFSH (i.e. NEX 173 with a specific activity of 163 μCi/μg; purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG or hFSH. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of ice-cold Tris buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g at room temperature for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the radioactivity in the membrane pellet was determined in an LKB γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All binding studies were performed in triplicate in two independent experiments. Aliquots of the cells used for signal transduction experiments were used for cell surface receptor quantification by ELISA, essentially as described previously (19Blomenröhr M. Heding A. Sellar R. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Eidne K.A. Willars G.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transfection, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the samples were blocked with 1% nonfat dried milk in 0.1 mNaHCO3 at room temperature for 4 h and subsequently incubated with anti-HA high-affinity antibodies (a 1:200 dilution in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the samples were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:500 dilution in 1% nonfat dried milk in 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 2 h. The peroxidase activity was then visualized using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (Sigma) for ∼10 min. Absorbance values (at 450 nm) of mock transfected cells were subtracted, and mutant or chimeric receptor expression values were expressed as the percentage of the wild type hFSH-R expression. All experiments were repeated at least three times using cells from independent transfections, each performed in duplicate. The ligand concentrations that induce half-maximal stimulation (i.e. EC50 values) were calculated by fitting the cAMP data to sigmoidal dose-response curves using GraphPad PRISM3 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Ligand binding affinities (K i ) were calculated from one-site competition curves using GraphPad PRISM3. All data shown in Tables I,II, IV, and V are presented as the calculated mean ± S.E. based on observations derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed on the log(EC50) or log(K i ) values using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test using GraphPad PRISM3.Table ISummary of the ligand-induced intracellular cAMP production in HEK-T 293 cells transiently transfected with wild type hFSH-R, wild type hLH-R, and chimeric hFSH-R constructsReceptor constructshCG EC50EC50wt/muthFSH EC50EC50wt/mutng/mlng/mlWild type hFSH-R397 ± 22.6a1.000.106 ± 0.019e1.00Wild type hLH-R0.536 ± 0.093b740NDNDLLL-hFSH-R0.603 ± 0.086b658NDNDLLF-hFSH-R0.354 ± 0.031b1121NDNDFLL-hFSH-R27.1 ± 17.3c14.6NDNDFLF-hFSH-R1.71 ± 0.275d231NDNDCyclic AMP production upon stimulation with hCG, hLH, and hFSH was measured in HEK-T 293 cells, transiently cotransfected with various receptor constructs and a plasmid (pCRE/β-gal) containing a β-galactosidase gene under control of a promoter containing five cAMP-response elements.

The expression of CYP2F1 is highly tissue-selective; the highest expression is observed in the lung with little or no hepatic expression. The objective of these studies was to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the unique tissue-specific regulation of CYP2F1. Cosmid and bacterial artificial chromosome clones were screened and sequenced to identify a gene that spanned 14 kbp containing 10 exons, including an untranslated exon 1. Primer extension analysis and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were used to identify the transcription start site. Several sequences homologous to known cis-elements were identified in the 5′-upstream region of the CYP2F1 promoter. Transient transfection studies with luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated a significant functional lung cell-specific CYP2F1 promoter region (from position −129 to +115). DNase footprinting analysis of 1.6 kbp of the upstream sequence with nuclear extracts from human lung tissues revealed one strong DNA-protein complex at −152 to −182. This nuclear protein (called lung-specific factor, LSF) was present only in lung but not liver or heart tissues. Competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays characterized a DNA consensus site, within the LSF-binding domain, that was highly similar to two E box motifs, but no known “E box” trans-factors were identified.

However, for many foreign compounds cytochrome P450 metabolism produces “bioactivated” metabolites, which are highly reactive with endogenous proteins and DNA, causing cell death and gene mutations (1Guengerich F.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1993; 21: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 expression, which can be important for organ-specific functions, can also lead to tissue-selective bioactivation and toxicity of drugs and other xenobiotic compounds. Cytochrome P450-mediated bioactivation of toxicants is a particularly relevant process to lung diseases because the lungs are exposed directly to environmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke. Characterizing the mechanisms that regulate tissue-selective P450 expression is vital to understand organ-specific toxicity and individual differences in susceptibility to environmental pollutants and drugs (2Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Due to the propensity of human lung to bioactivate procarcinogens and other xenobiotics, several screening processes have been performed to identify new P450s that are potentially involved in population susceptibility to cancers caused by cigarette smoke and other environmental pollutants. A cDNA library screen from human lung tissue identified a P450 gene, designated CYP2F1, that was sequenced and mapped to chromosome 19 (3). Expression of recombinant CYP2F1 showed that this enzyme bioactivates two prototypical pneumotoxicants, naphthalene and 3-methylindole. CYP2F1 metabolizes naphthalene to its highly pneumotoxic intermediate, naphthalene-1,2-oxide, and 3-methylindole to its dehydrogenated pneumotoxic product, 3-methyleneindolenine (4Thornton-Manning J. Appleton M.L. Gonzalez F.J. Yost G.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lanza D.L. Yost G.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 950-953PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lanza D.L.

CYP2F1 can also bioactivate styrene to its carcinogenic epoxide (8Nakajima T. Elovaara E. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Raunio H. Pelkonen O. Vainio H. Aoyama T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The expression of P450 enzymes is controlled by diverse regulatory mechanisms such as inducible transcriptional activation by ligand-activated receptors and constitutive expression by tissue-enriched transcription factors, each of which generally bind to specific regulatory elements in the 5′-upstream regions of genes. It is not known which regulatory factors are responsible for expression of P450 genes in pulmonary tissues or whether these factors might be involved in population susceptibility to lung cancers. However, it has been shown that many P450 genes, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP2F1, CYP2S1, CYP3A5, and CYP4B1, are transcribed in lung tissues (9Willey J.C. Coy E.L. Frampton M.W. Torres A.

Despite the extensive knowledge of chemically induced changes in P450 expression, little is known about the transcription factors responsible for constitutive or tissue-selective induction of P450 enzymes. Hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors have been the most extensively studied mechanisms of tissue-selective P450 gene expression, whereas mechanisms of pulmonary-selective gene expression have only received minimal attention (2Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). One elegant example used transgenic mice with the ratCYP2B1 promoter to drive reporter gene expression in a pulmonary specific manner (18Skarin T. Becher R. Bucht A. Duvefelt K. Bohm S. Ranneberg-Nilsen T. Lilleaas E.M. Schwarze P.E. Toftgard R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Additional studies (19Cassel T.N. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that C/EBP proteins in pulmonary epithelium controlled CYP2B1gene expression. Other superb studies (20Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J. Zhang Q.Y. Guo J. Zhou Y. Ding X. J. Biol.

Although there are no examples of endogenous substrates of CYP2F1, its expression appears to be under tight transcriptional control that confines expression predominantly to lung tissues. Therefore, CYP2F1 is an ideal model to elucidate the mechanism of tissue-selective transcription of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes in lung tissues should provide relevant information regarding tissue-selective toxicity, individual susceptibility to lung cancers, and basic knowledge of constitutive transcriptional mechanisms in lung tissues, where little is known.

Anti-E47 and anti-E12 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The pGL3 luciferase reporter vectors and dual-luciferase reporter assay system were purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Marathon-Ready cDNA and Advantage cDNA PCR kits were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Superscript II reverse transcriptase, the TOPO cloning kits, the double-stranded DNA cycling system, Taq polymerase, cell culture media, restriction enzymes, and all other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. BEAS-2B, A549, and HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). BEAS-2B cells were cultured in the serum-free medium, LHC-9 (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). For sub-culturing, cells were trypsin-dissociated and plated onto fibronectin/collagen-coated culture plates (22Lechner J.F. LaVeck M.A. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1985; 9: 43-48Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A549 cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 were cultured on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm sodium pyruvate. Cosmid clones F15749, R20003, F16767, R28543, and ED7850 (average insert size of 40 kbp) that hybridized to CYP2F1 (23Hoffman S.M. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. Mohrenweiser H.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 894-900PubMed Google Scholar) were cleaved withHindIII for Southern blot verification of CYP2F1using a 298-bp EcoRI/KpnI pUC9-2F1 cDNA fragment as a probe. Positive clones were subsequently sequenced (see below). In addition, BAC clones were identified by screening the CITB human BAC DNA library (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) using “whole cell” PCR (24Kim U.J. Birren B.W. Slepak T. Mancino V. Boysen C. Kang H.L. Simon M.I. Shizuya H. Genomics. 1996; 34: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) with primers designed from the cDNA to amplify exon regions of CYP2F1. The CITB BAC library represents a 13–17× coverage of the human genome, and BAC clones contain an average insert size of 100–150 kbp. Positive BAC clones identified during the library screening and others purchased based on sequence comparisons with the human genome had plate addresses that corresponded to the following clones: CITB-HSP-D 2356P16 (GenBankTM accession number AC008962), CITB-HSP-C 490E21 (GenBankTM accession number AC008537), and CITB-HSP-D 2415I10. All positive clones were sequenced using primers designed based on putative CYP2F1 exonic sequences. All sequencing was performed at the University of Utah core sequencing facility using fluorescent DNA sequencing methods and automated ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems) sequencers. The vector pUC9-2F1 (3Nhamburo P.T. Kimura S. McBride O.W. Kozak C.A. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5491-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was sequenced to confirm the nucleotide sequence of the CYP2F1 cDNA. First strand cDNA synthesis for reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of total cellular RNA isolated from confluent BEAS-2B cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and a QIAshredder microspin homogenizer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR amplification utilized primers designed to amplify 1726 bp, which spans the entire coding region. The primers were 5′-GCA TCC CAG CCA GTG CTC C-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA AAG GGC GTG CCA TAG AAC AAG-3′ (antisense), designed for selective binding to the CYP2F1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number J02906) using the OLIGO 5.0 program (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO). The PCRs were performed using 2 μl of cDNA reaction, 2.5 units ofPfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 0.2 μm each primer, and water to a final volume of 50 μl. PCR conditions were to denature at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of melting at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, extending at 72 °C for 2 min, and a 10-min final extension. The PCR product was cloned using Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Clones were sequenced on both strands to verify the sequence of the cDNAs. To identify the transcription start site (TSS) of CYP2F1, primer extension analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) were performed. Donor human lung tissue was used to isolate total RNA using an RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (5 μg) was hybridized to a32P-end-labeled primer (5′-GGC TGT GCT TAT GCT GTC CAT-3′) and extended using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (as above). The cDNA product was denatured and analyzed by electrophoretic fractionation on an 8% polyacrylamide gel along with products from a sequencing reaction generated using the same primer and a 10-bp DNA standard ladder. The TSS was determined by comparing the size and sequence of the product with the sequence of the CYP2F1gene. Human lung Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) was used for 5′-RACE analysis. Briefly, PCR amplification was performed using the gene-specific primer (GSP1) 5′-CAG GAG ACA CTG GCT GGG ATG-3′, the nested gene-specific primer (GSP2) 5′-GGC TGT GCT TAT GCT GTC CAT-3′, and an adapter primer (AP1) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The 5′-RACE products were cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing using the m13 forward and m13 reverse primers. The resulting sequence was compared with the sequence of the CYP2F1 gene obtained from the BAC clone (CITB-HSP-D 2356P16), which was the only BAC clone to contain the full-length CYP2F1 gene. In addition, analysis of the 5′-upstream region was performed using Matinspector version 2.2 and the TRANSFAC 4.0 matrices to identify putative transcription regulatory-binding motifs (25Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify functional promoter regions.CYP2F1 reporter constructs were produced using PCR amplification with multiple primers that introduced a 5′-SacI at positions −1681, −1468, −1299, −1168, −992, −893, −748, −493, and −129 paired with a single 3′-antisense primer that generated a 3′-BglII restriction site at position +115. After digestion with SacI/BglII, the fragments were cloned into the pGL3 basic vector. Reporter constructs, the pGL3SV40 positive control, and the pGL3 basic negative control vectors were used for transient transfection studies. To verify the basic promoter region, the pGLE vector that contains a strong SV40 enhancer element was used to construct pGLE-129 (−129 to +115). To investigate the functionality of the putative lung-specific transcription factor (LSF), the pGLP vector that contains the SV40 promoter without any enhancers was used to construct pGLP-LSF (−182 to −152). Two human lung epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B and A549, and one human liver cell line, HepG2, were transfected with 0.1 μg of the reporter constructs and 0.001 μg of pRL-SV40 using a 3:1 ratio of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemical) in 96-well plates. Cells were lysed 36 h post-transfection, and luciferase activities were assayed using the dual luciferase assay (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using Renillaluciferase activity (pRL-SV40) and expressed as fold luminescence over the activity observed with the promoter-less pGL3 basic vector. The data are presented as mean fold luminescence ± S.E. for three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Human lung nuclear extracts were prepared using a combination of the protocols described by Ueno and Gonzalez (26Ueno T. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4495-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Dignam (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). All solutions were at 4 °C throughout the procedure and contained a 1:1000 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture solution (1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.2 mg/ml bestatin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mg/ml E-64) (Sigma). Ten grams of minced tissue was suspended in 100 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 msucrose, 10% glycerol) and homogenized using a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer. Tissue homogenate was layered over four 10-ml cushions of the same buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 24,000 rpm and 4 °C in an SW28 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). After discarding the supernatant fraction, the nuclear pellets were combined, washed with a low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and collected by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 10 min. After determining the volume of the nuclear pellet, it was resuspended in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with the same low salt buffer. The nuclear proteins were extracted by addition of an equal volume of the same buffer, adjusted to 1.2 m KCl. The resulting suspension was shaken gently on ice for 30 min and centrifuged in a Ti 50 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 18,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was dialyzed against 500 volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 4 h on ice to reduce the KCl concentration to 100 mm. After dialysis, the extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 rpm to remove precipitated material. The supernatant fraction was aliquoted into working volumes, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Additional human lung, liver, and heart nuclear extracts were purchased from Geneka Biotechnology (Montreal, Canada). Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with addition of the protease mixture solution. Protein concentrations of all nuclear extracts were calculated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit I. Interactions of 5′CYP2F1 upstream sequence (position −1,681 to +115) with human lung nuclear proteins were identified using the Core Footprinting System (Promega) with slight modification (20Zhang J. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23454-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Binding reaction mixtures (50 μl), which were preincubated on ice for 10 min, contained 20–30 μg of human lung nuclear extract in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 7 μm ZnSO4, and 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments (∼2 ng, 40,000–50,000 cpm). An equal volume of DNase reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I was added (0.3 units to probe without protein and 3 units to probe with protein), and the DNase digestion was allowed to proceed for 90–120 s at room temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of DNase stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast RNA) provided in the Core Footprinting System. DNA was recovered from the reaction mixture by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation, washed with cold 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of gel dye loading buffer (1:2 NaOH/formamide (v/v), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The DNA samples were denatured at 90 °C for 4 min, quickly placed on ice, and analyzed by electrophoretic fractionation on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea DNA sequencing gel. DNA sequence ladders of the same DNA were prepared by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (28Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) and fractionated simultaneously for identification of the DNA-protein-binding site. EMSA was performed using the gel shift assay system from Promega, essentially as described by the manufacturer. Binding reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 10 min. The mixtures contained 4 μl of nuclear extract (4 μg for lung tissue and 6 μg for cells) and 2 μl of 5× binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) in a total volume of 10 μl. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated for 15 min with nuclear extract prior to the addition of 1 μl of 32P-labeled double-stranded probe (0.005–0.01 pmol). The mixtures were incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. Before electrophoresis, gel loading dye (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 4% glycerol) was added to all binding reaction mixtures. The DNA-protein complexes and unbound probes were separated by electrophoresis using 4% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. OCT1, AP1, Sp1, and NFκB double-stranded oligonucleotides were included in the gel shift assay system (Promega). All other oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Sequences of the synthesized DNA probes are listed in Table I. EMSA supershift assays were performed with antibodies to AP4, and the E box factors E47, E12, and δEF1 as described previously (29Aranburu A. Carlsson R. Persson C. Leanderson T. Biochem.

Library screening and sequencing was used to identify one full-length CYP2F1 gene and one pseudogene. Sequencing was performed by walking upstream and downstream from within each exon, using primers based on the published cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number J02906). Three cosmid clones, F16767, F15749, R20003, and one BAC clone, CITB-HSP-D 2356P16, were used to sequence the full-length CYP2F1 gene. Two other cosmid clones (ED7850 and R28543) and the two BAC clones (CITB-HSP-C 490E21 and CITB-HSP-D 2415I10) all appeared to contain a pseudoCYP2F1 gene, missing exons 1–4, with mutated exons 5–10, and were not used for further sequencing. Sequencing ofCYP2F1 revealed a disparity from what was originally identified as the genomic localization of CYP2F1 (23Hoffman S.M. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. Mohrenweiser H.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 894-900PubMed Google Scholar). Two functional and one pseudo CYP2F1 gene loci were proposed, but our sequencing identified two genes with identity to the CYP2F1 cDNA, one with an incomplete sequence at the centromeric end of theCYP2 family gene cluster (middle of intron 4 through exon 10, CYP2F1P), and the full-length sequence at the telomeric end of the cluster (CYP2F1) in opposite orientations. This information has subsequently been confirmed by the completion of the human genome and reconstruction of the CYP2 family gene cluster (30Hoffman S.M. Nelson D.R. Keeney D.S. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The full-length CYP2F1 gene was deduced and found to span ∼14 kbp and contain 10 exons (Fig. 1). The CYP2F1 gene structure, which contains 10 exons and 9 introns, is unique from all genes of the CYP2 family, which have been shown to contain 9 exons and 8 introns (31Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The structure described here recognizes an additional 5′-untranslated (UTR), exon 1, separated from exon 2 by 1685 bp, which was missing from theCYP2F1 gene structures reported earlier (3Nhamburo P.T.

Do CNGCs also play a role in the axons and/or nerve terminals of ORNs? We find that the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP can both facilitate and depress synaptic transmission between olfactory nerve fibers and their targets in olfactory bulb glomeruli. Cyclic nucleotides increase intracellular Ca(2+) in ORN terminals and enhance spontaneous transmitter release; at higher concentrations, cyclic nucleotides depress evoked transmission by altering olfactory nerve excitability. Cyclic nucleotides have no effect on transmission or nerve excitability, however, in mice lacking olfactory CNGCs. Taken together, our results identify a novel role for presynaptic CNGCs in modulating neurotransmission."

Strand transfer in highly structured nucleic acid species from the U3 3′ long terminal repeats,gag-pol frameshift region, and Rev response element were strongly enhanced by NC. In contrast, weakly structured templates from the env and pol-vif regions transferred well without NC and showed lower enhancement. The lack of strong polymerase pause sites in the latter regions demonstrated that non-pause driven mechanisms could also promote transfer. Assays conducted using NC zinc finger mutants supported a differential role for the two fingers in strand transfer with finger 1 (N-terminal) being more important on highly structured RNAs.

This process is initiated from a nucleoprotein complex in the virion core that is primarily composed of the dimerized diploid RNA genome coated with nucleocapsid protein (NC)1 (1Karpel R.L.

In addition the viral enzymes such as reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) are present along with host tRNA molecules. RT carries out DNA synthesis during reverse transcription whereas NC serves as a co-factor in this process and others (see below). Nucleocapsid protein is a highly basic, positively charged protein, comprised of 55 amino acid residues. It is derived by proteolysis of the gag andgag-pol precursor polyprotein (3Tritch R.J.

Previous studies have demonstrated that one or more of this array of functions enables NC to enhance strand transfer (a process that leads to recombination) during HIV replication (35Johnson P.E.

Strand transfer involves the switching of DNA being synthesized on one RNA template (referred to as “donor”) to homologous regions on the same or on a second RNA template (referred to as “acceptor”) where the synthesis continues. There are two obligatory strand transfers that occur at the termini of the viral RNA (38Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 39Hu W.S. Temin H.M.

These are integral steps without which the viral replication cannot proceed to completion. In addition to these vital events, the virus can also undergo strand transfers at internal regions of the RNA template that can potentially occur at any position along the genome and during the syntheses of both minus and plus DNA strands (41Jetzt A.E.

Virol. 1994; 68: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NC promotes strand exchange between double-stranded and single-stranded molecules. Others (15DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16350-16356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NC facilitates strand exchange between donor and acceptor RNAs using model retroviral replication intermediates. A number of other nucleic acid-binding proteins have been shown to facilitate melting and annealing reactions in a similar fashion. Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) causes a reduction in the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged DNA, melts out intramolecular structures, and hence enhances renaturation (54Christiansen C. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins like heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 also accelerate annealing and strand exchange (55Pontius B.W. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13815-13818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Though a majority of earlier reports on strand transfer have elaborated upon the activity of NC in highly structured RNA templates, relatively little is known about the effects on RNA templates with weak or no structure. In this report we set out to address two specific questions. (i) Presuming that strand transfers occur all along the genome (41Jetzt A.E. Yu H. Klarmann G.J. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), does NC exhibit a consistent or a differential influence on strand transfer along the length of the viral genome? For example, in regions with strong secondary structures, NC may be required to unwind these structures to facilitate association of the nascent DNA and acceptor RNA, whereas in regions relatively devoid of stable structures, NC may exert only a minimal influence on strand transfer. (ii) Do the zinc fingers of NC contribute equally or differentially toward strand transfer on various regions of the genome? This question stems from the apparent functional non-equivalence of the two HIV NC zinc fingers noted above. To understand these aspects of NC, strand transfers in five different regions of the HIV genome were analyzed; three of these regions were highly structured whereas two had relatively weak structures. Two of the highly structured regions, thegag-pol frameshift region and Rev response element (RRE), are important HIV regulatory sites. Results demonstrated that even in the absence of NC a relatively high rate of strand transfer occurred in regions with little structure compared with more structured regions. However, NC markedly stimulated the latter in comparison to the former. To evaluate the contributions made by the zinc fingers, the activity levels of mutant NC proteins containing duplicate copies of finger 1 (N-terminal zinc finger) or finger 2 (C-terminal zinc finger) on high or low structure RNA was tested. Results were consistent with finger 1 possessing a larger portion of the protein's helix-destabilizing activity. Overall, this report establishes the differential effect of NC on strand transfer on various regions of the HIV genome. Plasmid pNL4–3 obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program contains a complete copy of the HIV-1 genome derived from strains NY5 and LAV (56Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Recombinant HIV-RT was graciously provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This enzyme has a specific activity of ∼40,000 units/mg (one unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37 °C using oligo(dT)-poly(rA) as primer-template). The enzyme contained very low levels of single-stranded nuclease activity, which was found to be inhibited by including 5 mm AMP in the assays (57DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this concentration, the AMP did not affect the polymerase or RNase H activity of RT. Aliquots of HIV-RT were stored frozen at −70 °C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. HIV NC clone was a generous gift from Dr. Charles McHenry (University of Colorado). NC was purified according to the protocol described (58You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was evaluated using Coomassie Blue staining of 17.5% SDS-PAGE gels (59Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Quantification was by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 8350 cm−1m−1 (58You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of NC were stored frozen at −70 °C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. NC finger mutants 1.1 and 2.2 were a gift from Dr. Robert Gorelick (SAIC, Frederick, MD). These proteins were expressed and purified as described by Bushman and co-workers (60Carteau S. Gorelick R.J. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by amino acid analysis on a Beckman Systems 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Taq polymerase was from Eppendorf. SP6 RNA polymerase, DNase I-RNase-free, and RNase-DNase-free were from Roche Diagnostics. RNase inhibitor was from Promega. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Proteinase K was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Radiolabeled compounds were as follows: [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Sephadex G-25 spin columns were from Amika Corp., and all other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Five different sets (four primers per set) of PCR primers were specifically designed to yield donor and acceptor RNAs that shared homology over a 150-base region and amplified DNA from five different areas of the pNL4–3 plasmid (see Table I). An SP6 promoter sequence was included on some of the primers to allow transcription of the DNA by SP6 RNA polymerase. PCR reactions were performed according to the enzyme manufacturer's protocol using the provided buffer. One hundred pmol of each primer was used. The following cycling parameters were used: 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension at temperatures of 94, 50, and 72 °C, respectively, for 1 min each, one cycle of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified on 8% native polyacrylamide gels (29:1) (acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and used to prepare RNA as described below.Table IPrimers used in PCR amplification of various segments of the HIV-1 genomeRegionBase numbers1-aRefers to sequence numbering of plasmid pNL4–3 that contains an almost complete copy of the HIV-1 genome derived from strains NY5 and LAV.Primer sequences1-bThe primer sequences used to prime the pNL4–3 plasmid.

Open table in a new tab Run-off transcription (performed according to the enzyme manufacturer's protocol) was conducted using ∼5 μg of the purified PCR DNAs and SP6 RNA polymerase enzyme to generate donor RNA transcripts of 175 nucleotides and acceptor RNA transcripts of 177 nucleotides. The transcription reactions were treated with 0.4 units/μl of DNase I-RNase-free enzyme for 15 min to digest away the template DNA. Then they were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water, loaded onto hydrated Sephadex G-25 spin columns, and processed according to the manufacturer's directions. The amount of recovered RNAs was determined spectrophotometrically from optical density. DNA primers that bound specifically to the donor RNA transcripts were 32P-labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each of the five donor RNAs was hybridized to a complementary labeled primer by mixing primer:transcript at an ∼5:1 ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Donor RNA-primer DNA hybrids (2 nm final concentration of RNA) were preincubated for 3 min in the presence or absence of 10 nm acceptor RNA template and NC (as indicated) in 42 μl of buffer (see below) at 37 °C. Two molecules of NC per nucleotide were used in the reactions, i.e. final concentrations of 1.16 and 0.27 μm of NC were used in reactions with or without acceptor RNA templates, respectively. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 8 μl of HIV-RT at a final concentration of 2.5 units/μl. The following reagents at the indicated final concentrations were also included in the reaction mixtures: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 6 mmMgCl2 (53Dib-Hajj F. Khan R. Giedroc D.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), 100 μm dNTPs, 5 mm AMP (pH 7.0), 25 μm ZnCl2, and 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to incubate for time points of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min at 37 °C. At these time points, a 6-μl aliquot of each reaction was terminated by mixing with 4 μl of a solution containing 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.5 ng of RNase-DNase-free enzyme and allowed to digest for 20 min at 37 °C. Two μl of proteinase K at 2 mg/ml in 1.25% SDS, 15 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) was then added to the above mixture, which was placed at 65 °C for 1 h. Finally, 12 μl of 2× formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to the mixture, and the samples were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Similar reactions were conducted during the analysis of mutant NC proteins (1.1 and 2.2). In the NC titration experiments the total reaction volume was reduced to 12.5 μl, the amount of NC in the reactions was varied as indicated in Fig. 7, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 32 min. Extended DNA products were quantified by phosphorimager analysis using a GS-525 phosphorimager from Bio-Rad. Denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels (19:1) (acrylamide:bisacrylamide), containing 7 m urea, and native 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) (acrylamide:bisacrylamide) were prepared and subjected to electrophoresis as described (59Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The general approach used to test for strand transfer in the different regions of the HIV genome is depicted in Fig. 1. This assay is designed to simulate internal strand transfer events occurring during minus strand DNA synthesis. The donor (template on which DNA synthesis initiates) and acceptor (template to which DNAs initiating on the donor can potentially transfer) represent the two strands of viral genomic RNA in the virion. DNA synthesis is initiated from a 5′ end-labeled DNA primer that was specifically designed to bind only to the 3′ end of the donor RNA. Strand transfer can occur over the transfer zone, which is the region of homology between the donor and acceptor RNAs. Primer extension to the end of the donor produces a 175-base full-length donor-directed DNA product. Strand transfers result in 197-base transfer DNA products that includes the additional non-homologous bases at the 5′ end of the acceptor RNA. The 5′ end of the donor outside the transfer zone is not homologous to the acceptor, which prevents DNAs extended to this region from transferring. This limits the system to analysis of internal transfer events between the donor and acceptor rather than events occurring from the template termini. The difference in the lengths of the two DNA products allowed us to quantify strand transfer events in donor-acceptor pairs from five different regions of the HIV genome (Figs. 2). It is also possible for strand transfer to occur between two donor RNAs in the reaction. This type of transfer was not quantified in the experiments. However, it probably represents only a small amount of the total transfer, because reactions included a 5-fold excess of acceptor over donor and also many of the donors would not be available, because they are used for DNA synthesis.Figure 2Predicted secondary structures of highly and weakly structured donor RNA templates. RNAdraw and Zuker's RNA folding programs (see “Results”) were used to predict the secondary structures of donor RNA templates (at a temperature of 37 °C, using program default settings) derived from three regions of the HIV genome. The structures show 155 bases of the donor templates excluding the 20 bases that bind to the primer. The base that is encircled in two ringsis the 5′ end. The probabilities for particular base pairs are indicated by the thickness of the lines between them withthicker lines representing base pairs with greater probabilities of formation. The pause sites shown here were identified by time course reactions and mapped by sequencing reactions as explained under “Results.” A, the U3 3′LTR donor template is shown (bases 9096–9265, ΔG = −49.30 kcal/mol).65 marks the position of a m"

Many different, evolutionary unrelated, lectin families have been identified. The legume lectin family has proven to be a very useful model system to study protein carbohydrate interactions. Their highly variable carbohydrate specificity makes them ideal to study the structural basis of carbohydrate specificity. Because they are often expressed in high yields in legume seeds, they can easily be purified in amounts suitable for experimental approaches that require large amounts of protein such as microcalorimetry and x-ray crystallography. Indeed, the crystal structures of 22 legume lectins and three other family members without lectin activity have been determined by x-ray crystallography. For most of these, complexes with one or more carbohydrates have been studied (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys.

The seed lectin from the tropical legume Pterocarpus angolensis (bloodwood tree) belongs to the mannose/glucose specificity group that contains several well studied members such as concanavalin A and the lectins from Lathyrus ochrus,Lens culinaris, Pisum sativum, and Dioclea grandiflora as well as several other Canavalia andDioclea species. Although they share a common monosaccharide specificity, all these lectins differ in the details of their specificity for oligosaccharides. In the current paper we present the crystal structures of the complexes of Pterocarpus angolensis lectin (PAL)1with glucose, sucrose, and turanose, which were shown to inhibit the hemagglutination activity of this lectin. 2R.

Often oligosaccharide complexes of legume lectins that have been crystallized have provided the only crystal structures of the carbohydrates involved. Indeed, oligosaccharides are notoriously difficult to crystallize. Consequently only very few carbohydrates larger than a disaccharide are present in the Cambridge structural database. The current structures provide further evidence for the conformational preference of sucrose and provide the first structure of pyranose form of turanose. Crystallization conditions were screened using the hanging drop method with the Hampton Research Crystal Screen kit. Large single crystals of the methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside complex were obtained by equilibrating drops consisting of 5 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) and 10 mm sugar in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.45, and 5 μl of reservoir solution against 1 ml of reservoir solution (200 mm calcium acetate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 20% (w/v) PEG8000). Complexes of the lectin with sucrose and turanose were obtained by transferring the crystals of the methyl-α-d-glucose complex to artificial mother liquor (200 mm calcium acetate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 20% (w/v) PEG8000) containing increasing concentrations of the desired ligand (100 mm final concentration reached in four steps of a 5-min incubation). All x-ray data were collected at room temperature on the EMBL beamlines of the DESY synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). Data were integrated with DENZO, merged with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Rounds of slow cool-simulated annealing and restrained B-factor refinement using all available data were alternated with manual fitting in electron density maps using TURBO (31Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphic Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 71-78Google Scholar). At the end of the refinement simulated annealing was abandoned in favor of conventional positional refinement and water molecules were fitted into the electron density. A water molecule was added if the difference density was at least 3 ς, and at least one reasonable hydrogen bond was formed with the protein and no further unfavorable interactions were introduced. Waters were removed again if their temperature factors raised above 60 Å2 or no 2Fo − Fc density remained present above 1 ς. The structures of the PAL-sucrose and PAL-turanose complexes were solved by isomorphous substitution using the coordinates of the glucose complex as the starting model. Refinement and model building was performed as for the glucose complex. The refinement statistics for all three complexes are given in TableI. Energy maps of the disaccharides of interest have been calculated with the MM3 program (34Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). Starting conformations were taken from the crystal structure of the complex with the lectin. All hydrogen atoms have been added. Energy maps are calculated as a function of Φ and Ψ defined as: Φ = O5g–C1g–O1g–C3f and Ψ = C1g–O1g–C3f–C4f for turanose and Φ = O5g–C1g–O1g–C2f and Ψ = C1g–O1g–C2g–O5f for sucrose. The driver option of MM3 was selected, allowing for optimization of the disaccharide at each point of the grid. The dielectric constant was set to 78.0 to mimic water environment. Calculations of the binding energy were performed on the crystal structure of the complex after adding all hydrogen atoms and assigning atom types and partial charges according to the Pérez-Imberty-Mazeau parameterization (33Imberty A. Bettler E. Karababa M. Mazeau K. Petrova P. Pérez S. Vijayan M. Yathindra N. Kolaskar A.S. Perspectives in Structural Biology.

Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). Geometry optimization of the hydrogen atoms of the protein recognition site was performed with either the ligand in the site or placed 50 Å away. The crystal structure of the PAL complexes with glucose, sucrose, and turanose were determined at resolutions between 2.2 and 2.0 Å. The overall structure of the PAL is shown in Fig. 1. The legume lectin fold has been described in detail many times by other authors and will not be repeated here (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The electron density map is continuous and of high quality for residues 1–238. Tyr-239 was also fitted into the density, but the B-factors for this residue remain high. The bound carbohydrates also display clear electron densities in each of the complexes (Fig. 2). Weak density is also seen for residues 240 and 241. The N terminus was clearly identified as a cyclic glutamine and contributes to dimer formation. Excess electron density extends from the side chain of Asn-118 in both molecules in the asymmetric unit of all structures, suggesting a covalent modification. The most likely modification is glycosylation, as Asn-118 lies in a glycosylation consensus sequence (NX(T/S)). The observed electron density is, however, not sufficiently well defined to allow fitting of a glycan.Figure 2Electron densities of the sugar residues in the binding site of PAL. methyl-α-d-glucose (a), sucrose (b), Glcα1–3Fruf (c), and Glcα1–3Frupβ (d). In each case anFo − Fc electron density map was calculated from the refined structure with the corresponding sugar omitted. All maps are contoured at 3 ς. Glcα1–3Fruf is taken from molecule A in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, which is involved in lattice contacts.

It is the most commonly observed association mode within this protein family and is also seen in family members with different monosaccharide specificity, either as such or as part of a tetramer (8Loris R.

Biol. 2000; 304: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Like other legume lectins, the carbohydrate binding site of PAL consists of belonging to five loops (termed A–E according to Sharma and Surolia (41Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), Fig.3). These loops vary to different degrees between lectins with different specificities. Loops A and B contain an essential aspartate (invariantly preceded by a cis-peptide bond) and backbone NH group (usually from a glycine), respectively. The conformations of these two loops do not vary much among different lectins. In the current structures, this picture is confirmed. Loop C is the metal binding loop and wraps around the structurally important calcium and manganese ions. In the known crystal structures, two versions of this loop can be found. All earlier crystal structures of Man/Glc- and Gal/GalNAc-specific lectins contained the short version of this loop, which is also the most common (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The long version was until now observed only in two sialyllactose-specific lectins from Maackia amurensis (20Imberty A. Gautier C. Lescar J. Pérez S. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17541-17548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and in the chitobiose-specific lectin II from Ulex europaeus (18Loris R. De Greve H. Dao-Thi M.H. Messens J. Imberty A. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In both cases, the specificity of these lectins was attributed in part to this loop. The current structure, on the other hand, shows that the backbone conformation of both loop versions is not a determinant for monosaccharide specificity. Specific side chains on this loop, on the other hand, do influence the nature of the sugar that can be accommodated in the binding site (see below). In contrast to loops A–C, loop D does not interact directly with the structural calcium ion. It is highly variable in length, conformation, and sequence and is often referred to as the monosaccharide specificity loop (8Loris R. Hamelryck T. Bouckaert J. Wyns L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 9-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is thought to be the prime determinant for monosaccharide as well as oligosaccharide specificity. In the PAL structure, the conformation adopted by this loop is identical to that found in all other known crystal structures of Man/Glc-specific lectins (19Hamelryck T.W. Moore J.G. Chrispeels M.J.

Finally, loop E is found to interact with a bound carbohydrate in only a few cases: M. amurensis leukoagglutinin in complex with sialyllactose (20Imberty A. Gautier C. Lescar J. Pérez S. Wyns L.

Shown in Fig. 4, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (Glc(α1)Me) binds to the primary binding site in the same way as has repeatedly been observed for other Man/Glc-specific lectins such as concanavalin A,L. ochrus lectin and lentil lectin (42Loris R.

Indeed the monosaccharide binding site of these lectins is very similar, and all side chain and main chain entities that interact with the glucose residue are conserved. These comprise hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of Asp-86, the backbone NH groups of Gly-106, Glu-221, and Gln-222 and the side chain amino group of Asn-138 as well as van der Waals interactions with Phe-132 (Table II and Fig. 4).Table IIHydrogen bonds between sugar and protein in the different complexesAtoms involved in hydrogen bondDistance (in Å)Glucose Me-αGlcSucrose Glc(α1–2)FrufTuranose Glcα1–3FrufTuranose Glcα1–3FrupβGlc O3Gly-106 N2.71/2.853.12/2.782.802.96Glc O4Asp-86 OD12.56/2.643.31/2.702.522.63Glc O4Asn-138 ND23.01/2.922.44/2.933.153.06Glc O5Glu-221 N2.90/3.093.38/3.153.203.23Glc O6Asp-86 OD22.69/2.752.90/2.762.822.72Glc O6Gln-222 N3.05/3.202.78/3.093.063.22Fru O1Gln-222 NE2−/−−/−2.562.68Fru O1Wat (→ Glu-221 OE2)−/−3.01/−——Fru O2Ser-137 OG−/−3.25/3.373.143.17Fru O2Asp-136 OD2−/−−/−2.62—Fru O2Wat (→ Asp-136 OD1/OD2)−/−−/−—2.85Fru O3Ser-137 OG−/−2.63/2.94——Fru O5Wat (→Glu-221 OE2)−/−2.92/−——Fru O4Glu-221 OE2−/−−/−2.67—A dash indicates that no equivalent hydrogen bond exists. Open table in a new tab A dash indicates that no equivalent hydrogen bond exists. When comparing the two molecules present in the asymmetric unit, only minor differences are observed. These are a slightly different conformation of the side chain of Glu-221 and a small shift in the backbone conformation of residues Ser-137 to Asn-138. Molecule A in the asymmetric unit is involved in packing interactions while molecule B is not, and these small differences are entirely due to the differences in packing environment. Indeed, when one superimposes molecules B of the sucrose and turanose or sucrose complexes (see below), no relevant differences in the binding site residues are seen. Sucrose is bound to PAL with its glucose moiety in the primary binding site. The fructose residue makes only few interactions with the protein (Fig.5 a and Table II). A strong hydrogen bond is made between O3-f and Ser-137(OG) in addition to a weaker one between O1-g (the oxygen of the glycosidic linkage) and the same side chain. The binding mode of the sucrose molecule is very similar to that observed in the complex with lentil lectin (48Casset F. Hamelryck T. Loris R. Brisson J.R. Tellier C. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Poortmans F. Pérez S. Imberty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25619-25628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that in the present structure there is a direct interaction between the fructose residue and the protein. Lentil lectin has a shorter metal binding loop, and hence there is no structural equivalent for Ser-137 of PAL (Fig. 5 b). Interestingly, OG of Ser-137 is mimicked by a water molecule in lentil lectin (Wat1 in Fig.5 b). Similar to Ser-137(OG), this water molecule not only hydrogen bonds to fructose but also to the side chain NH2group of Asn-125 (Asn-138 in PAL). Sucrose in the crystalline state adopts a folded conformation with two intramolecular hydrogen bonds (49Brown G.M. Levy H.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1973; 29: 790-797Crossref Google Scholar, 50Hanson J.C. Sieker L.C. Jensen L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1973; 29: 797-808Crossref Google Scholar). This conformation is known to deviate significantly from the experimentally determined one in solution (51Hervé du Penhoat C. Imberty A. Roques N. Michon V. Mentech J. Descotes G. Pérez S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3720-3727Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 52Poppe L. van Halbeek H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1092-1094Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) as well as from theoretical prediction from molecular modeling (53Tran V.H. Brady J.W. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, a series of sucrose-containing oligosaccharides have been crystallized, and rather different conformations of the αGlc1–2Fruf linkage have been observed (54Pérez S. Gautier C. Imberty A. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: a Comprehensive Handbook. Wiley/VCH, Weinheim, Germany2000: 969-1001Google Scholar). These experimental data have been reported on the energy map of the sucrose molecule together with the lowest energy conformation (Fig.6 a). The lentil lectin-sucrose complex was the first protein-sucrose complex to be determined by x-ray crystallography. The conformation observed in the lentil lectin complex (Φ = 107 °, Ψ = −58 °) is rather similar to the one in the sucrose crystal structure (Φ = 108 °, Ψ = −45 °), albeit with no intramolecular hydrogen bond. In this complex, the sucrose molecule is directly involved in crystal packing interactions. The conformation observed in the sucrose-PAL complex (Φ = 118 °, Ψ = −47 °) belongs to the same conformational family as the one observed in the lentil lectin complex. A key feature of the lentil lectin-sucrose complex was a water bridge between Glc(O2) and Fru(O3) (Wat2 in Fig.5 b) This bridging water was also observed in a molecular dynamics simulation of sucrose in explicit water (55Engelsen S.B. Pérez S. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 56Engelsen S. Hervé du Penhoat C. Pérez S. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 13344-13351Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The PAL-sucrose complex does not show this water, despite that it would sterically be possible to fit one. The reason for this can be 2-fold. The resolution of the PAL-sucrose complex (2.1 Å) is not as good as the resolution of the lentil lectin-sucrose complex (1.9 Å). More important is probably the crystal environment. In the lentil lectin-sucrose structure, the sugar is tightly packed in crystal lattice interactions including a well defined water network. Lattice interactions in monomer A of the PAL-sucrose complex are less abundant, and they are completely absent for the binding site of monomer B. It is thus possible that the bridging water is indeed present a fraction of the time (as was suggested by the molecular dynamics study (55Engelsen S.B. Pérez S. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 56Engelsen S. Hervé du Penhoat C. Pérez S. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 13344-13351Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar)), but to be observed in the crystal it needs to be stabilized by additional interactions. Turanose, or Glc(α1–3)Fru, occurs in solution in three major isomeric forms that are in equilibrium via the open chain form of the fructose residue: αGlc1–3αFruf (20%), αGlc1–3βFruf (41%), and αGlc1–3βFrup(39%) (57Doddrell D. Allerhand A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2779-2781Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 58Angyal S.J. Adv. Carb. Chem. Biochem. 1984; 42: 15-68Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the pyranose form of turanose is known (59Neuman A. Avenel D. Gillier-Pandraud H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1978; 34: 242-248Google Scholar). As for the furanose form, it has not been crystallized as a disaccharide but only as a fragment of the melezitose trisaccharide (60Avenel D. Neuman A. Gillier-Pandraud H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1976; 32: 2598-2605Crossref Google Scholar, 61Becquart J. Newman A. Gillier-Pandraud H. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 111: 9-21Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, turanose is bound as αGlc1–3βFruf in the binding site of molecule A and as αGlc1–3βFrup in the binding site of molecule B. In both cases, the fructose interacts with the protein via hydrogen bonds (Table II and Fig. 7). In its pyranose form, the fructose ring adopts a 2C5conformation, whereas in its furanose form, the ring shape is an2E envelope that corresponds to the lowest energy region as defined by molecular mechanics study (62French A.D. Tran V. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1599-1611Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The conformations observed at the glycosidic linkage are plotted on the corresponding energy maps (Fig. 6, b and c). The conformational analysis of turanose in its pyranose form has been performed earlier (63Dowd M.K. Reilly P.J. French A.D. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1993; 12: 448-457Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the potential energy surface was very similar to the one reported here. As for the turanose in its furanose form, the energy map was not calculated earlier and it does not present major differences from the pyranose form. In both forms, the conformation observed in the crystal binding site belongs to the same conformational family as the calculated global minimum although with some differences in the value of the Ψ torsion angle. The electron densities in both sites are very clear (Fig. 2,c and d) and suggest that at least 80% of the sugar is in the αGlc1–3βFruf and αGlc1–3βFrup isomer, respectively. In absence of other factors, the reason for this phenomenon can only be the difference in crystal environment. In monomer B the binding site is not involved in lattice contacts. It may thus be assumed that the lectin prefers the pyranose form over the furanose one in solution. To better understand the selection for the furanose and pyranose isomers, modeling calculations were performed with αGlc1–3βFruf and Glcα1–3βFrup in the binding sites of molecules A and B, with and without taking into account crystal lattice contacts. The results of these calculations are shown in Table III. There are no meaningful differences between the calculated interaction energies ΔHinter for the furanose and pyranose form in site B. However, in site A, the additional symmetry-related contacts indeed seem to stabilize the furanose form.Table IIICalculated interaction energies for the recognition of Glcα1–3Fruf and Glcα1–3Frupβ in the binding sites of molecules A and BSiteFormLattice contextΔHinterΔΔHtotMonomer AFuranoseIsolated−35.1−34.3Monomer APyranoseIsolated−33.6−32.9Monomer BFuranoseIsolated−31.1−30.7Monomer BPyranoseIsolated−31.5−31.0Monomer AFuranoseIncluding crystallographic neighbours−42.1−36.5Monomer APyranoseIncluding crystallographic neighbours−39.1−35.1ΔHinter represents the calculated binding energy between the sugar and the protein, whereas ΔΔHtot is calculated as the difference between the potential energy of the complex and the one of the two species when not in interaction.

The PDGFs are members of the cystine knot family of growth factors, which presently consists of at least 10 members (i.e. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (VEGF-A), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E from the VEGF family; PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C, and PDGF-D from the PDGF family); and placenta growth factors PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 (reviewed in Ref. 6Iyer S. Acharya K.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Common to these factors is the cystine knot domain that contains at least eight cysteine residues perfectly conserved between the two chains (7Joukov V. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Pajusola K.

Two or three intramonomeric disulfide bonds exist in each monomer, and the factors dimerize in an antiparallel side-by-side mode by using two additional intermonomeric disulfide bonds (8Haniu M.

An N-terminal CUB domain extends from residue 46 to 163 (15Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal growth factor domain (GFD) showing homology with PDGFs and VEGFs extending from residue 235 to 345. These two domains are separated by a linker region that includes a predicted protease cleavage site at the N-terminal side of the GFD. The CUB domain of PDGF-C shows highest homology to the CUB domain of neuropilins and BMP-1, which are coreceptors for certain VEGF and VEGF-B isoforms (16Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar,17Makinen T. Olofsson B. Karpanen T. Hellman U. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Eriksson U. Alitalo K.

It seems to block for receptor binding and is proteolytically cleaved off, making an active PDGF-C of the latent growth factor (3Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M.

It has been proposed that the isolated CUB domain of PDGF-C exhibits a mitogenic activity on human coronary artery smooth cells, suggesting a possible biological activity of the CUB domain in addition to its role in maintaining latency of the GFD (18Dijkmans J. Xu J. Masure S. Dhanaraj S. Gosiewska A. Geesin J. Sprengel J. Harris S. Verhasselt P. Gordon R. Yon J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A dominant negative form of the full-length PDGF-C was recently shown to inhibit growth of cultured Ewing tumor cell (19Zwerner J.P. May W.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating the PDGF-C to be an important growth factor for these tumor cells. The GFD of PDGF-C (GFD-PDGF-C) shows 27–357 similarity with corresponding regions of PDGFs and VEGFs containing the conserved pattern of eight invariant cysteine residues involved in inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds similarly to the other members of the cystine knot family (3Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition, GFD-PDGF-C has four extra cysteines (Cys52, Cys59, Cys64, and Cys107), three located between invariant cysteines 3 (Cys48) and 7 (Cys103) and one located two residues C-terminal to the eighth conserved cysteine (Cys105). The GFD-PDGF-C, but not the full-length PDGF-C protein, activates both the PDGFR α-form (3Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat.

Although there is a high degree of sequence identity between PDGF-C and VEGF (257), no evidence that PDGF-C (either the full-length protein or the isolated GFD domain) binds to VEGF receptors exists (3Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat.

Although previous studies have failed to show increased expression of PDGF-C in tumor cell lines (18Dijkmans J. Xu J. Masure S. Dhanaraj S. Gosiewska A. Geesin J. Sprengel J. Harris S. Verhasselt P. Gordon R. Yon J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we have shown elevated levels of PDGF-C mRNA in human thyroid papillary carcinoma (2Fluge O. Bruland O. Akslen L.A. Varhaug J.E. Lillehaug J.R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 862Google Scholar). In this paper, we present results on the use of a prokaryote expression system to express GFD-PDGF-C on a large scale in an active, soluble form. In order to obtain information on the structure and the conformational stability of this domain, we have studied the recombinant protein by CD, fluorescence, NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and molecular modeling. The biological activity of the GFD-PDGF-C was verified by assaying the stimulation of phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a kinase downstream from the PDGFRs, by a cell growth assay ([methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation) and by a modified in vitro “wound assay.” The coding sequence for the growth factor domain of PDGF-C (GFD-PDGF-C) encoding the amino acid residues 235–345 of the full-length PDGF-C and a His10 sequence added to the N-terminal was cloned into the pET 19b expression vector (Novagen) containing a T7 promoter, and positive clones were verified by sequencing. Large scale protein expression was performed using the BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) grown at 37 °C using the pET 19b expression vector. Expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-thio-औ-d-galactoside atA600 = 0.6 and cultured for an additional 3–6 h. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl (TEN buffer) (3 ml/g of bacteria cells), containing 0.8 mg of lysozyme and 4 mg of sodium deoxycholate (per g of bacteria) and French pressed (3 × 900 p.s.i.) using a French® pressure cell press (SLM-AMINCO®). Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (3,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was washed twice with 6 ml of TEN buffer/g of cells and centrifuged again. The inclusion bodies were then dissolved in 7 m urea in either TEN buffer or in 25 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 4.0, as indicated, and incubated at 50 °C for 40 min. Unsolubilized material was discarded by centrifugation, and the solution was adjusted to either 1 mm DTT or 10 mm औ-mercaptoethanol, as indicated. The protein was refolded by dialysis and stepwise removal of urea followed by an overnight dialysis step in the absence of urea. Aggregated protein was removed by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C). When indicated, the renatured protein sample was dialyzed against and stored on 2.5 mm KAc, 0.1 m KCl, pH 4.3. Solubilization and purification of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE run at constant voltage of 200 V for 35 min in 14.57 (w/v). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The oligomeric state was analyzed by both SDS-PAGE in the absence of treatment of the protein samples with औ-mercaptoethanol and by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.6 × 60 cm) at a flow rate of 23 ml/h (20Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Blotting was performed as described using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot System (21Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5916) Google Scholar,22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFD-PDGF-C/VEGF (4544g) (BioGenes, Berlin, Germany) or anti-His (sc-803) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used to detect the GFD-PDGF-C. The blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The Ellman assay (23Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 24Janatova J. Fuller J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3612-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the concentration of free thiols in urea-denatured and refolded GFD-PDGF-C by spectroscopically determining the formation of nitrothiobenzoate (ε412(nitrothiobenzoate) = 14,290m−1·cm−1). The content of disulfide bonds was determined after reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco 423S Peltier element for temperature control. Protein samples (25 ॖm) were prepared in different buffers as indicated. The data were analyzed using the Standard Analysis program provided with the instrument. The amount of secondary structure elements was estimated by the CDNN program that applies a neural network procedure (25Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm) were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 luminescence spectrometer with a constant temperature cell holder and 1-cm path length quartz cells. The excitation and emission slits were 3 and 5, respectively. All spectra were corrected for blank emission. The samples were prepared on 2.5 mm KAc, 0.1 m KCl, pH 4.3. Spectra were recorded in a Nicolet Magna II 550 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector, using a demountable liquid cell (Harrick Scientific, Ossining, NY) with calcium fluoride windows and 50-ॖm spacers. Samples (4 mg/ml) were lyophilized in 2.5 mm KAc, 0.1 m KCl, pH 4.3, and prior to IR measurements they were resuspended in deuterium oxide and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material (20 min at 15,000 × g). Deconvolution of the original amide I band has been described previously (26Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Thermal analysis was performed in the rapid scan mode within the temperature interval 20–80 °C, using a scan rate of 1 °C/min and recording one spectrum every 1 °C. A tungsten-copper thermocouple was placed directly onto the window, and the cell was placed into a thermostated cell mount. Lyophilized samples of GFD-PDGF-C for 1H NMR experiments were dissolved in 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.0, containing 50 mm NaCl, 107 D2O (1.2 mm protein; 0.5 ml). NMR spectra were also taken of protein samples containing 0.2–0.4 mm dimer at pH 7.5. The pH of the samples was checked with a glass microelectrode and was not corrected for isotope effects. NMR experiments were acquired on a Bruker AMX-600 pulse spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz for the proton at a probe temperature of 298 K. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were run with water suppression by Pulse Sculpting (27Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Res. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) and “W5” pulse train (28Liu M.L. Mao X.A. Ye C.H. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Res. 1998; 132: 125-129Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Following parameters were set: 2-s delay time, 150-ॖs “W5” pulse train parameter, 7183.908 Hz spectral width. 32 scans were acquired. Data were processed using XWIN-NMR (Bruker) on an SGI work station. Structural models for GFD-PDGF-C were prepared by sequence alignment modeling using the Homology module of InsightII 2000 (Accelrys). The biological activity of GFD-PDGF-C was assayed both by a cell growth assay ([methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation) and by mediation of phosphorylation of p44/22 MAPK downstream of the PDGF receptors, as well as by an in vitro “wound assay.” In the cell growth assay of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation, confluent cultures of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were starved in serum-free DCCM-1 medium (Biological Industries, Kibbutz, Israel) for 24 h upon stimulation with equal amounts of either the recombinant GFD-PDGF-C or PDGF-AA (Sigma). Triplicate wells were used for each agent tested and also for the wells not stimulated with any agents. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (1 ॖCi/ml) and cold thymidine (1 ॖm final concentration) were added to each well 8, 10, and 24 h before termination of each experiment. At the end of the labeling period, DNA was collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (29Male R. Lillehaug J.R. Djurhuus R. Pryme I.F. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 1367-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was determined using a scintillation counter. The biological activity of the recombinant GFD-PDGF-C was then tested for mediation of phosphorylation of p44/42, MAPK. Serum-starved mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were stimulated with the recombinant refolded GFD-PGDF-C and with PDGF-AA and epidermal growth factor (both from Sigma) in comparable amounts. Stimulation was carried out for 15–60 min. Total cell protein was then isolated, separated on a 12.57 SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. The effect of stimulation was verified by assaying induction of MAPK phosphorylation using anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and anti-Erk1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The anti-Erk1 polyclonal antibody was used as a control for equal amounts of protein loaded in each well. In thein vitro wound assay (30Goodman S.L. Newgreen D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2769-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), cell monolayers were wounded by scratching a line with a plastic scriber, and after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 0.17 bovine serum albumin and with or without refolded GFD-PDGF-C. The cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa stain. Several small scale experiments were performed in order to achieve an optimum expression level and to obtain maximal GFD-PDGF-C solubility. In the absence of denaturant, there was no soluble recombinant GFD-PDGF-C in the supernatant of French press-treated bacterial suspensions (cleared cell lysate) (Fig. 1A). Approximately 60–707 of the recombinant protein present in inclusion bodies was soluble in 7 m urea, and the solubilized protein solution was almost free from proteins other than GFD-PDGF-C (Fig.1A). For large scale purification, two equally effective protocols were used to generate refolded GFD-PDGF-C from solubilized inclusion bodies. First, the recombinant His10-tagged GFD-PDGF-C was purified and refolded under denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid silica resin (Qiagen). The solubilized protein in TEN buffer, containing 7m urea and 10 mm औ-mercaptoethanol, was bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and refolding was performed by gradient dilution of urea (7 to 1 m gradient) and औ-mercaptoethanol (10 to 0 mm gradient). After extensive washing at pH 6.2, the refolded protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in TEN buffer. The purified, refolded GFD-PDGF-C was soluble, as determined by centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 20 min) (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, the GFD-PDGF-C was solubilized in NaH2PO4, pH 4.0, buffer supplemented with 7 m urea and 1 mm DTT (see “Experimental Procedures”) and refolded by dialysis at room temperature with the stepwise removal of urea followed by an overnight dialysis in the absence of urea. As seen by electrophoresis performed at nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1C) and Western blot analysis (data not shown), the refolded protein is mainly dimeric, with a monomeric apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa due to the additional N-terminal His10 tag. GFD-PDGF-C contains only one methionine residue (Met1), and the N-terminal His10 tag was easily removed by CNBr cleavage (31Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar) (data not shown). At nonreducing conditions, the monomer contained 3.52 (∼4) free cysteines, and 8.48 (∼8) -SH groups were in an oxidized state. Thus, our results are compatible with a protein homodimer having two intersubunit disulfide bonds, four free sulfhydryls, and three intrasubunit S–S bonds (see below). Additional proof for the dimeric structure of the protein and the absence of aggregated or misfolded forms in the refolded preparation was obtained by gel filtration chromatography analysis on a HiLoad Superdex 200TM column. Recombinant GFD-PDGF-C shows an elution volume of 92 ml in runs performed on 25 mmNaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 4.0–6.0, which corresponds to the elution volume of carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) in the calibrating runs of the column (data not shown). The biological activity of refolded GFD-PDGF-C was determined by assaying GFD-PDGF-C-mediated phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK, a kinase downstream from the PDGFRs. Serum-starved 3T3 cells were treated with recombinant renatured GFD-PDGF-C or with commercially available PDGF-AA and epidermal growth factor, and a strong increase in p44/42 phosphorylation was obtained with each of the three factors (Fig. 2), thus identifying a biological signal transduction activity of the expressed and renatured GFD-PDGF-C preparation. Also, when GFD-PDGF-C activity was assayed by a modified in vitro “wound assay” (30Goodman S.L. Newgreen D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2769-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a well defined migratory activity into the cell-free space was observed. Similarly, a significant increase in [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation (5–8-fold over untreated controls, compared with 7–10-fold for PDGF-AA added at equal amounts) into DNA was observed in 3T3 cells stimulated with the recombinant protein (data not shown), indicating cell proliferation, increased motility, and DNA synthesis and providing evidence of biological active GFD-PDGF-C. The purified and urea-solubilized GFD-PDGF-C shows a far UV CD spectrum with a minimum at around 215 nm, and after renaturation of the protein by elimination of the urea, the spectrum shows an even broader minimum with slightly decreased ellipticity (Fig. 3A). Similar spectra are obtained in the pH range 4.0–7.5. As estimated by the CDNN neural network procedure (25Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), this spectrum corresponds to a content of secondary structure of ∼6 ± 17 α-helix, 52 ± 47 औ-sheet, 17 ± 17 औ-turn, and 25 ± 27 random coil. The near-UV CD spectrum of the renatured protein shows a broad positive transition centered at about 260 nm in Fig. 3B, which most probably corresponds to disulfide bonds in a strained conformation,i.e. with a CऔSS torsion angle deviating significantly from 90° (32Woody R.W. Dunker A.K. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 112-113Google Scholar). The positive signal around 260 nm diminishes on incubation with 5 mm DTT at 25 °C and almost disappeared when the GFD-PDGF-C was reduced with 5 mm DTT for 5 min at 95 °C (Fig. 3B). Upon heating the protein at 95 °C in the absence of DTT, the strained orientation of the S–S bonds is preserved in the protein, indicating a high conformational stability. The high stability of GFD-PDGF-C is also manifested by the elevated midpoint melting temperature (>100 °C) of the renatured protein in the pH range 4.0–7.5 (Fig. 3C). Indeed, both the far-UV and the near-UV spectra of the heat-treated (95 °C) protein at nonreducing conditions were similar to the spectra of the renatured protein at 25 °C (Fig. 3, A and B). The presence of urea in the protein samples decreases its thermal stability, and, in fact, the renaturation of the protein achieved by the removal of urea parallels the increase in thermal stability of the protein (Fig. 3C). GFD-PDGF-C contains one Trp residue at position 39, which is conserved in PDGF-B (Trp40). The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of the recombinant renatured GFD-PDGF-C (excitation at 295 nm) shows a maximum at 342 nm (Fig. 4A) and a quantum yield of 0.09, indicative of a solvent-exposed residue. Fluorescence studies also showed that this residue is solvent-exposed in PDGF-B (emission maximum at 347 nm) and that denaturation of the protein results in a large red shift (the emission maximum increases to 356 nm) (33Clements J.M. Bawden L.J. Bloxidge R.E. Catlin G. Cook A.L. Craig S. Drummond A.H. Edwards R.M. Fallon A. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In an attempt to obtain structural information on the GFD-PDGF-C in solution, preliminary NMR experiments were performed. At concentrations of about 1 mm GFD-PDGF-C, pH 3.0–4.0, and temperatures between 25–50 °C, the line widths of the NMR resonances were too broad, indicating some aggregation of the protein at these conditions. A significant improvement of the spectral quality was obtained when the pH of the sample was changed to pH 7.5 by dialysis, lyophilization, and resuspension in 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 1007 D2O, pH 7.5, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.2–0.5 mm (Fig. 4B). Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra could be recorded at this slightly alkaline pH (7.5), but they were not of enough quality to attempt a complete assignment of the signals. Future NMR investigations of the three-dimensional structure of GFD-PDGF-C will require isotopic labeling of the protein. Nevertheless, some structural information can be inferred from the NMR spectrum, since most of the signals appearing between 6.0 and 5.0 ppm probably correspond to low field shifted Hα protons, indicating a positive differential shift (i.e. δ Hαsample− δ Hαcoil > 0), characteristic of proteins with high औ-sheet content. The original and the deconvolved spectra of GFD-PDGF-C are shown in Fig.5A. The conformationally sensitive amide I band, 1700–1600 cm−1, displays an intense band component at 1625 cm−1 that has been assigned to औ-structures (34Khurana R. Fink A.L. Biophys.

Treatment of the cells with sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, led to the dose-dependent induction of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C. Trichostatin A, another inhibitor of histone deacetylase, also induced nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C. Induction of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C in response to these histone deacetylase inhibitors was attenuated by mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding to GC-rich DNA sequences. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide alone had no effect on basal nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C expression, but attenuated butyrate-mediated induction of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C. The effects of lipopolysaccharide were mimicked by the nitric oxide donors sodium nitroprusside and spermine NONOate, suggesting a role for nitric oxide in the lipopolysaccharide-mediated down-regulation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C induction. This was supported by experiments with the inducible nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor 1400W, which partially blocked the lipopolysaccharide-mediated attenuation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain induction. 8-Bromo-cGMP had no effect on nonmuscle myosin heavy chain induction, consistent with a cGMP-independent mechanism for nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-C induction.

This ubiquitously distributed class of myosins has been shown to be present in all vertebrate cells including smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle cells where, similar to the more highly expressed isoforms of myosin II, they consist of a hexamer containing two heavy chains (200 kDa) and two pairs of light chains (20 and 17 kDa). Two isoforms of the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC),1 termed NMHC II-A and II-B, were identified several years ago (1Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Shohet R.V. Conti M.A. Kawamoto S. Preston Y.A. Brill D.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The genes encoding these myosin heavy chains are located on different chromosomes (4Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and the tissue distributions of the isoforms differ (4Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), although there is considerable overlap, with most cells and tissues expressing both isoforms to a greater or lesser degree. Recently, completion of the sequencing of the human genome revealed the presence of a third nonmuscle myosin, NMHC II-C, which again, has a distinct chromosomal location compared with the other two isoforms (6Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).In hematopoietic cells, NMHC II-A is believed to be the predominant NMHC isoform; for example, in the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell line, NMHC II-B was shown to be absent (7Choi O.H. Park C.S. Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. Beaven M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We were, therefore, interested in whether NMHC II-C is expressed in hematopoietic cells. Here we demonstrate that expression of NMHC II-C is low or absent in undifferentiated macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. However, treatment of the cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sodium butyrate or trichostatin A, which have been shown to lead to differentiation of a wide range of cell types, results in induction of NMHC II-C. Moreover, induction of NMHC II-C is attenuated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide in an NO-dependent but cGMP-independent fashion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRAW 264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Sodium butyrate, trichostatin A, mithramycin, and lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8) were purchased from Sigma. Sodium nitroprusside, 1400W, 8-bromo-cGMP, and spermine NONOate were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies to sequences near the carboxyl-terminal end of human NMHC II-C (RQVFRLEEGVASDEEAEE) and near the amino-terminal of mouse NMHC II-C (VTMSVSGRKVASRPGP) were produced in rabbits and affinity purified against the corresponding peptides. An antibody to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody to iNOS was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Nitrate and nitrite were measured using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN).Immunoblotting and ImmunoprecipitationCells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm orthovanadate, lysed by addition of lysis buffer, and the cells were scraped from the plate with a plastic scraper. Lysis buffer consisted of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin at 4 °C. Cell lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and Triton-insoluble material pelleted at 14,000 × g for 10 min. After taking an aliquot for protein determination (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) to permit equal protein loading of gel lanes, samples were heated in SDS sample buffer (70 °C, 10 min) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted using standard methods. Bound secondary antibody was detected using luminol blotting reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the signal captured on Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Films were scanned using a laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences) and bands were quantified using ImageQuant software. For immunoprecipitation, following centrifugation of lysates and determination of protein content, aliquots of the lysates were rocked for 1 h with the COOH-terminal NMHC II-C antibody. Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added, and the mixture was rocked overnight at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed 4 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above.RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out on 2 μg of RNA using Superscript II and random primers (Invitrogen). PCR was then carried out using Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen), with the cycle number adjusted to keep product formation in the linear range. For HPRT, 25 cycles were used and for NMHC II-C, 35 cycles. The primers for the NMHC II-C PCR were: 5 prime, 5′-gccgaacgaagtttctcag-3′; 3 prime, 5′ tcattggggtgtggcagg-3′. The product is a 618-bp fragment corresponding to the last 205 amino acids and the termination codon.RESULTSWe first investigated whether NMHC II-C was expressed in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Immunoblotting of RAW 264.7 cell lysate with an antibody specific for NMHC II-C demonstrated the myosin isoform to be present at a very low concentration in the macrophages (Fig.1A). In contrast, NMHC II-C was expressed more abundantly in PC12 and COS cells. Treatment of the RAW 264.7 cells with sodium butyrate for 24 h led to the dose-dependent induction of NMHC II-C expression (Fig.1B). A time course of NMHC II-C induction using 10 mm butyrate is shown in Fig. 1C; significant induction of NMHC II-C was detectable by 10 h of stimulation. Induction of NMHC II-C was reversible, because removal of butyrate after 3 days of induction led to a decline in NMHC II-C levels (Fig.1D). To confirm the identity of the 225-kDa band identified by the antibody to the COOH terminus of NMHC II-C, immunoblotting was performed with a second antibody that recognizes a different epitope, close to the amino terminus of NMHC II-C (see “Experimental Procedures”). A similar induction of the 225-kDa band was observed (Fig. 1E), supporting the identity of the induced band as NMHC II-C.Analysis of NMHC II-C mRNA expression by RT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA level was very low in untreated cells, but was increased at 6 h and maximal at 10–16 h butyrate treatment (Fig.2A). RT-PCR of HPRT mRNA was used as a control, showing that similar mRNA amounts were used. Induction of NMHC II-C mRNA was not dependent on de novoprotein synthesis, because cycloheximide in the presence of butyrate did not inhibit induction (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and6). In fact, cycloheximide alone induced NMHC II-C mRNA expression (lanes 3 and 4) and appeared to enhance butyrate-mediated induction (lanes 5 and6). Cycloheximide was, however, effective at preventing induction of NMHC II-C protein expression, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Induction of NMHC II-C mRNA in response to butyrate.A, time course of induction of NMHC II-C mRNA.

B, effect of cycloheximide on induction of NMHC II-C mRNA. Cells were treated with cycloheximide, 3.6 or 36 μm, for 30 min and then incubated with or without sodium butyrate, 10 mm, for 16 h before preparation of RNA and RT-PCR as above. C, effect of cycloheximide on induction of NMHC II-C protein. Cells were incubated with or without cycloheximide, 36 μm, for 30 min before incubating in the presence or absence of butyrate, 10 mm, for 24 h. Cells were then lysed and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for NMHC II-C. Note the absence of signal in lane 4 compared with lane 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sodium butyrate has been shown to inhibit HDAC and the resultant histone hyperacetylation and chromatin rearrangement have been proposed as the mechanism by which butyrate activates transcription (9Kruh J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 42: 65-82PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of HDAC inhibition in NMHC II-C induction, cells were treated with trichostatin A (TSA), which is also known to inhibit HDAC. TSA stimulation led to the induction of NMHC II-C and the extent of induction was similar to that obtained with butyrate (Fig.3).Figure 3Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with trichostatin A induces NMHC II-C.A, time course of NMHC II-C induction in response to TSA, 100 ng/ml (lanes 1–5). Induction in response to 10 mm butyrate for 24 h is shown in lane 6. B, dose response for induction of NMHC II-C in response to TSA.

Non-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells do not express NMHC II-B (7Choi O.H. Park C.S. Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. Beaven M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and NMHC II-C is also undetectable (Fig.4A). However, treatment with butyrate led to a robust induction of expression of NMHC II-C (Fig.4A). Expression of NMHC II-C is also absent in non-stimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). Extended treatment for 72 h with high dose butyrate (10 mm) led to a very modest induction of NMHC II-C, much lower than that found in the hemopoietic macrophage and mast cell lines. A second slower migrating band was also recognized by the COOH terminus NMHC II-C antibody (Fig.4B); however, immunoprecipitation of NMHC II-C with the carboxyl terminus antibody followed by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitate with the mouse NH2 terminus antibody showed only a single band induced by butyrate at 225,000, suggesting that the higher molecular weight band is probably nonspecific (Fig. 4C).Figure 4Butyrate induces NMHC II-C in RBL-2H3 but only marginally in HeLa cells. RBL-2H3 (A) and HeLa cells (B) were treated with the indicated concentrations of butyrate for 72 h before preparation of cell lysates and immunoblotting for NMHC II-C. An equal loading of lysate from RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with butyrate (10 mm) was loaded in the right-hand lane for comparison. For RBL-2H3 cells, detached cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and lysed after pooling with attached cells. An additional band migrating more slowly than NMHC II-C was observed in the HeLa experiments. C, immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from HeLa cells treated with or without butyrate, 10 mm, for 72 h was performed using the carboxyl terminus NMHC II-C antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a second NMHC II-C antibody to an amino terminus epitope. A single band at 225 kDa was observed, consistent with the slower migrating band in panel B being nonspecific.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The transcription factor Sp1 has been implicated in butyrate-mediated gene regulation (10Nakano K.

To address the possible role of Sp1 in butyrate-mediated induction of NMHC II-C, RAW 264.7 cells were preincubated with the antibiotic mithramycin, which binds to GC-rich DNA and inhibits Sp1 binding (14Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mithramycin inhibited induction of NMHC II-C in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5, A and B), consistent with a role for Sp1 in butyrate-mediated NMHC II-C induction. A similar mithramycin-mediated inhibition was observed when TSA was used to induce NMHC II-C (results not shown). Measurement of NMHC II-C mRNA by RT-PCR demonstrated a similar pattern of inhibition by mithramycin (Fig. 5C), indicating that the inhibitor was acting at the transcriptional level.Figure 5NMHC II-C induction is attenuated by the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin.A, cells were pretreated with mithramycin, 10 nm to 10 μm, for 30 min before incubation with sodium butyrate, 10 mm, for 20 h.

Ogawa H. Sato S. Matsuno S. Digestion. 1998; 59: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to determine whether there was any interaction between butyrate and LPS in modulating NMHC II-C isoform expression. Treatment of naive RAW 264.7 cells with LPS induced expression of iNOS as expected (Fig.6A, lower blot,lane 2), but had no effect on expression of NMHC II-C (upper blot). However, when LPS was added in combination with butyrate, 2 or 10 mm, induction of NMHC II-C (upper blot, lanes 4 and 6) was attenuated. The effects of LPS on NMHC II-C induction are summarized in Fig. 6B. As reported previously (15Chakravortty D. Koide N. Kato Y. Sugiyama T. Mu M.M. Yoshida T. Yokochi T. J. Endotoxin.

Sodium nitroprusside, 0.25 mm (Fig.7A), and spermine NONOate, 0.2 mm (Fig. 7B), attenuated NMHC II-C expression in response to butyrate. The results are summarized in Fig. 7C. Conversely, the inhibition of butyrate-mediated NMHC II-C induction by LPS was attenuated by inhibition of iNOS with the specific inhibitor 1400W (Fig. 8).

Evidence has been obtained previously for transcriptional regulation of both NMHC II-A and II-B expression. A 100-bp region in intron 1 ofMYH9, the gene encoding human NMHC II-A, located 23 kb downstream from the transcriptional start site, has been shown to activate transcription in a cell-type and differentiation-specific manner (18Beohar N. Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9168-9178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This region contains a binding site for Sp1 or Sp3, a site for USF1 or USF2, and a novel site (18Beohar N. Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9168-9178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Induction of NMHC II-A was demonstrated during differentiation of HL-60 myeloid cells and U-937 promonocytic cells to a more monocytic phenotype (19Toothaker L.E. Gonzalez D.A. Tung N. Lemons R.S. Le Beau M.M. Arnaout M.A. Clayton L.K. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 1826-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For NMHC II-B, the homeobox protein Hex has been demonstrated to induce transcription in a cAMP-response element-dependent manner, although Hex binds to a specific homeodomain-binding sequence rather than cAMP-response element (20Sekiguchi K. Kurabayashi M. Oyama Y. Aihara Y. Tanaka T. Sakamoto H. Hoshino Y. Kanda T. Yokoyama T. Shimomura Y. Iijima H. Ohyama Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NMHC II-B is also down-regulated in cells transformed by a variety of oncogenes (21Yam J.W. Zheng J.Y. Hsiao W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Here we demonstrate using mouse macrophages that expression of NMHC II-C can be regulated by a physiologically relevant stimulant, sodium butyrate. In contrast, this treatment had no effect on the expression of II-A, which is abundant in these cells. NMHC II-B, which is not expressed in these cells, similar to RBL-2H3 cells, was only minimally up-regulated (data not shown). Butyrate is produced in large quantities by bacterial fermentation of fiber and its intracolonic concentration is typically in the 5–15 mm range (22Topping D.L. Clifton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1031-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). Stimulation with this short chain fatty acid has been shown to lead to differentiation in a wide range of cell types and, in many cases, can also cause apoptosis. A diverse range of gene products have been shown to be induced by butyrate, including the G-protein Gαi2 (13Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol.

Induction of NMHC II-C was found both in hematopoietic cell lines, the macrophage line RAW 264.7 and basophilic leukemia line RBL-2H3, and in non-hematopoietic HeLa fibroblasts. However, HeLa cells were much less sensitive to butyrate than the hematopoietic lines.The induction of NMHC II-C mRNA expression does not requirede novo protein synthesis, because cycloheximide, at concentrations that abolished induction of NMHC II-C protein expression, tended to increase butyrate-mediated NMHC II-C mRNA expression. Cycloheximide alone was also able to induce increased amounts of NMHC II-C mRNA. The induction of specific mRNAs in response to cycloheximide treatment is often interpreted to indicate regulation of mRNA expression by a labile regulatory protein (26Chesnokov V.N. Mertvetsov N.P. Biokhimiya. 1990; 55: 1276-1278PubMed Google Scholar). However, other mechanisms by which cycloheximide can act include stabilization of mRNA (27Ikeda K. Lu C. Weir E.C. Mangin M. Broadus A.E. J.

Cooperation between cycloheximide and TSA in inducing histone H1 mRNA was proposed to involve a cycloheximide-mediated rearrangement of chromatin leading to general transcriptional de-repression (30Cesari M.

https://openalex.org/W1980143176,"Site-specific mutagenicity oftrans-opened adducts at the exocyclicN2-amino group of guanine by the (+)-(7R,8S,9S,10R)- and (−)-(7S,8R,9R,10S)-enantiomers of a benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide (7-hydroxyl and epoxide oxygen are trans, BPDE-2) has been determined in Chinese hamster V79 cells and their repair-deficient counterpart, V-H1 cells. Four vectors containing single 10S-BPDE-dG or 10R-BPDE-dG adducts positioned at G0 or G−1 in the analyzed 5′-ACTG0G−1GA sequence of the non-transcribed strand were separately transfected into the cells. Mutations at each of the seven nucleotides were analyzed by a novel primer extension assay using a mixture of one dNTP complementary to the mutated nucleotide and three other ddNTPs and were optimized to quantify levels of a mutation as low as 1%. Only G → T mutations were detected at the adducted sites; the 10Sadduct derived from the highly carcinogenic (+)-diol epoxide was 40–50 and 75–140% more mutagenic than the 10R adduct in V79 and V-H1 cells, respectively. Importantly, the 10S adducts, but not the 10R adducts, induced separate non-targeted mutations at sites 5′ to the G−1 and G0lesions (G0 → T and C → T, respectively) in both cell lines. Neither the T 5′ to G0 nor sites 3′ to the lesions showed mutations. Non-targeted mutations may enhance overall mutagenicity of the 10S-BPDE-dG lesion and contribute to the much higher carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of (+)-BPDE-2 compared with its (−)-enantiomer. Our study reports a definitive demonstration of mutations distal to a site-specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adduct."
