https://openalex.org/W2151067616,"Three new neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutations have been detected and characterized. Pulsed-field gel and Southern blot analyses reveal the mutations to be deletions of 190, 40, and 11 kb of DNA. The 11 kb deletion does not contain any of the previously characterized genes that lie between two NF1 translocation breakpoints, but it does include a portion of a rodent/human conserved DNA sequence previously shown to span one of the translocation breakpoints. By screening cDNA libraries with the conserved sequence, we identified a number of cDNA clones from the translocation breakpoint region (TBR), one of which hybridizes to an approximately 11 kb mRNA. The TBR gene crosses at least one of the chromosome 17 translocation breakpoints found in NF1 patients. Furthermore, the newly characterized NF1 deletions remove internal exons of the TBR gene. Although these mutations might act by compromising regulatory elements affecting some other gene, these findings strongly suggest that the TBR gene is the NF1 gene."

https://openalex.org/W1994261508,"GABA-gated chloride channels were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells following transfection of cDNAs encoding the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits of the rat GABAA receptor (GABAR). Functional properties were determined using patch-clamp techniques in the whole-cell and outside-out configurations. Large whole-cell currents were observed in cells expressing the alpha 1 beta 2, alpha 1 gamma 2, and alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subunit combinations. The unique characteristics of GABAR channels consisting of these subunit combinations depended upon the presence or absence of beta 2 and gamma 3 subunits. GABA-activated currents in cells expressing GABARs with the beta 2 subunit desensitized faster and showed greater outward rectification, and the channels had a shorter mean open time than GABARs composed of alpha 1 gamma 2 subunits. When the gamma 2 subunit was present the resulting GABAR channels had a larger conductance. The slope of the concentration-response curve was significantly steeper for GABARs composed of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subunits compared with GABARs consisting of alpha 1 beta 2 or alpha 1 gamma 2 subunit combinations."

https://openalex.org/W1979253402,"Although the oncogene product of CT10 virus, P47gag-crk, does not itself phosphorylate proteins at tyrosine residues, it elevates phosphotyrosine in transformed cells. The P47gag-crk oncoprotein contains SH2 and SH3 domains, which are conserved in several proteins involved in signal transduction, including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. P47gag-crk bound in vitro to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from crk-transformed cells and from cells transformed by oncogenic tyrosine kinases. The association between P47gag-crk and p60v-src, a phosphotyrosine-containing protein, was abolished by dephosphorylation of p60v-src. This suggests that the SH2 and SH3 regions function to regulate protein interactions in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2093810191,"Small synthetic peptides that correspond to different portions of the 65-kilodalton mycobacterial heat shock protein (Hsp65) were used to identify a putative antigenic epitope for gamma delta cells. Weaker gamma delta responses to the equivalent portion of the autologous homolog, mouse Hsp63, were also seen. The stimulatory epitope overlaps with an epitope recognized by arthritogenic alpha beta T cell clones. The data suggest that gamma delta cells have a role in autoimmune disorders and imply that these cells recognize ligands by a mechanism similar to that of alpha beta T lymphocytes, that is, in the form of small processed protein fragments bound to antigen-presenting molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2042827525,"Superantigen-MHC complexes are known to stimulate T cells primarily via the V beta element of the T cell receptor. In this paper we identify a number of amino acid residues that define the region of a particular V beta element interacting with one of the self-superantigens, MIs-1a. These residues are predicted to lie on a beta-pleated sheet of the T cell receptor, away from the complementarity determining regions of the receptor, which are thought to interact with complexes of conventional peptide antigens and MHC. In support of this prediction, mutations affecting MIs-1a activity have no effect on the response to conventional antigen and MHC."
https://openalex.org/W2057267741,"The BNLF-1 gene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes the latent membrane protein (LMP), one of the putative oncogene products of the virus. This gene has been expressed from two different enhancer-promoter constructs in transgenic mice, to determine its biological activity and possible contribution to oncogenesis. While transgenic mice expressing LMP in many tissues demonstrated poor viability, expression of LMP specifically in the epidermis induces a phenotype of hyperplastic dermatosis. Concomitant with the expression of LMP in this tissue (and in the esophagus) is an induction of the expression of a hyperproliferative keratin, K6, at aberrant locations within the epidermis. The epithelial hyperplastic phenotype caused by the LMP-encoding transgenes implies that the LMP plays a role in the acanthotic condition of the tongue epithelium in the human EBV- and HIV-associated syndrome oral hairy leukoplakia, as well as possibly predisposing the nasopharyngeal epithelium to carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2128972342,"Maxicircle-encoded guide RNAs (gRNAs) for cytochrome b and maxicircle unidentified reading frames 2 and 3 (MURF2 and MURF3) were isolated by hybrid selection and sequenced. All three gRNAs contained nonencoded 3' oligo(U) tails 5-24 nucleotides in length, with a mean length of approximately 15 nucleotides. Secondary structure calculations indicate a functional role of the 3' oligo(U) tail in stabilizing the initial hybrid formed between the gRNA and the preedited mRNA, and allowed the identification of potential mRNA recognition sites for an editing complex. In addition, isolated MURF2 gRNA-II could be 5' capped with [alpha-32P]-GTP and guanylyltransferase, suggesting that at least some gRNAs represent primary transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2136915225,"The trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI). The GPI is synthesized as a precursor, glycolipid A, that is subsequently linked to the VSG polypeptide. The VSG anchor is unusual, compared with anchors in other cell types, in that its fatty acid moieties are exclusively myristic acid. To investigate the mechanism for myristate specificity we used a cell-free system for GPI biosynthesis. One product of this system, glycolipid A', is indistinguishable from glycolipid A except that its fatty acids are more hydrophobic than myristate. Glycolipid A' is converted to glycolipid A through highly specific fatty acid remodeling reactions involving deacylation and subsequent reacylation with myristate. Therefore, myristoylation occurs in the final phase of trypanosome GPI biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2075608929,"Minor histocompatibility (H) antigens can be peptides derived from cellular proteins that are presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. This is similar to viral antigens, because in both cases cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize artificially produced peptides loaded on target cells. Naturally processed minor H peptides were found to be similar to those artificial CTL-epitopes, as far as size and hydrophobicity is concerned. The peptides studied were isolated from a transfectant that expressed a model CTL-defined antigen, Î²-galactosidase, from male cells that express H-Y, which has been known operationally since 1955, and from cells that express H-4, known since 1961."

https://openalex.org/W1581398592,"In the mouse embryo, early organogenesis is characterized by the formation of a functional cardiac muscle, such that 9-day embryos exhibit beating, although not fully developed hearts. In light of this observation, we found it intriguing that mouse embryoid bodies (EB), which can develop in vitro from totipotential embryonic stem cells, undergo spontaneous contractile activity. To determine if these cells are capable of recapitulating aspects of cardiogenesis, a cDNA library was prepared from beating EB and screened with a chicken skeletal myosin heavy chain cDNA. We found that the predominant myosin transcripts in the library encode the alpha- and beta-cardiac isoforms. In addition, an embryonic skeletal myosin cDNA was isolated. The myosin heavy chain transcripts in both EB and 9-day embryonic hearts were found to be the same. Transcript-specific primers were prepared, and polymerase chain reaction analyses on single EB were carried out. The data show that a single EB is capable of expressing both the alpha- and beta-isoforms as well as very low amounts of the embryonic skeletal transcript. These data indicate that EB transcribe the appropriate tissue- and developmental stage-specific myosin heavy chain genes and therefore serve as a model system for studying early cardiogenic processes at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1562527853,"Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) is a glycoprotein carrying one O-linked sugar chain. To clarify the role of the oligosaccharide in hG-CSF, some biological and physicochemical properties of the deglycosylated hG-CSF and the intact factor were compared. Recombinant hG-CSF produced in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells was sequentially digested with neuraminidase and endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The deglycosylated hG-CSF was one-third as active as the intact form in the colony-forming assay, but it was almost as active as the intact hG-CSF in the cell proliferation assay using NFS-60 cells (NFS-60 bioassay). Inactivation of the deglycosylated hG-CSF was also found by NFS-60 bioassay after incubation for 2 days at pH values from 7 to 8 and at 37 degrees C. This inactivation was accompanied by polymerization of the factor which did not occur with the glycosylated factor. Circular dichroic and calorimetric analyses demonstrated that the deglycosylated hG-CSF is more sensitive to heat denaturation than the intact form and that the inactivation of both forms of hG-CSF was accompanied by conformational change of the proteins. From these results, it was concluded that the O-linked sugar chain of hG-CSF contributes to the stability of the factor by suppressing polymerization and/or its conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1578946246,"We discovered an enzyme in human platelets that deamidates substance P and other tachykinins. Because an amidated carboxyl terminus is important for biological activity, we purified and characterized this deamidase. The enzyme, released from human platelets by thrombin, was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by chromatography on an octyl-Sepharose column and chromatofocusing on PBE 94. The purified enzyme exhibits esterase, peptidase, and deamidase activities. The peptidase activity (with furylacryloyl-Phe-Phe) is optimal at pH 5.0 while the esterase (benzoyl-tyrosine ethyl ester) and deamidase (D-Ala2-Leu5-enkephalinamide) activities are optimal at pH 7.0. With biologically important peptides, the enzyme acts both as a deamidase (substance P, neurokinin A, and eledoisin) and a carboxy-peptidase (with bradykinin, angiotensin I, substance P-free acid, oxytocin-free acid) at neutrality, although the carboxypeptidase action is faster at pH 5.5. Enkephalins, released upon deamidation of enkephalinamides, were not cleaved. Gly9-NH2 of oxytocin was released without deamidation. Peptides with a penultimate Arg residue were not hydrolyzed. Some properties of the deamidase are similar to those reported for cathepsin A. The deamidase is inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, inhibitors of chymotrypsin-type enzymes, and mercury compounds while other inhibitors of catheptic enzymes, trypsin-like enzymes, and metalloproteases were ineffective. In gel filtration, the native enzyme has an Mr = 94,000 while in non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the Mr = 52,000 indicating it exists as a dimer. After reduction, deamidase dissociates into two chains of Mr = 33,000 and 21,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate labeled the active site serine in the Mr = 33,000 chain. The first 25 amino acids of both chains were sequenced. They are identical with the sequences of the two chains of lysosomal which, in turn, has sequence similarity to the KEX1 gene product and carboxypeptidase Y of yeast. This protective protein complexes with beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase in lysosomes and is vitally important in maintaining their activity and stability. A defect in this protein is the cause of galactosialidosis, a severe genetic disorder. The ability of physiological stimuli (e.g. thrombin or collagen) to release the deamidase from platelets indicates that it may also be involved in the local metabolism of bioactive peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1534643095,"RNA editing is a novel RNA processing event of unknown mechanism that results in the introduction of nucleotides not encoded in the DNA into specific RNA molecules. We have examined the post-transcriptional addition of nucleotides into the mitochondrial RNA of Trypanosoma brucei. Utilizing an isolated organelle system we have determined that addition of uridines to edited RNAs does not require ongoing transcription. Trypanosome mitochondria incorporate CTP, ATP, and UTP into RNA in the absence of transcription. GTP is incorporated into RNA only as a result of the transcription process. Post-transcriptional CTP and ATP incorporation can be ascribed to known enzymatic activities. CTP is incorporated into tRNAs as a result of synthesis or turnover of their 3' CCA sequences. ATP is incorporated into the 3' CCA of tRNAs and into mitochondrial messenger RNAs due to polyadenylation. In the absence of transcription, UTP is incorporated into transcripts known to undergo editing, and the degree of UTP incorporation is consistent with the degree of editing occurring in these transcripts. Cytochrome b mRNAs, which contain a single editing site near their 5' ends, are initially transcribed unedited at that site. Post-transcriptional labeling of cytochrome b mRNAs in the organelle with [alpha-32P]UTP results in the addition of uridines near the 5' end of the RNA but not in a 3' region which lacks an editing site. These results indicate that RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process in the mitochondria of trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1973984294,"Animal lines selected for differences in drug sensitivity can be used to help determine the molecular basis of drug action. Long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice differ markedly in their genetic sensitivity to ethanol. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference, mRNA from brains of LS and SS mice was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the ethanol sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)- and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated ion channels was tested. Ethanol facilitated GABA responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from LS mice but antagonized responses in oocytes injected with mRNA from SS animals. Ethanol inhibited NMDA responses equally in the two lines. Thus, genes coding for the GABAA receptor or associated proteins may be critical determinants of individual differences in ethanol sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1571303653,"The structure of CR2, the human C3d,g/EBV receptor (CR2/CD21) consists of 15 or 16 60-70 amino acid repeats called short consensus repeats (SCRs) followed by a transmembrane and a 34-amino acid intracytoplasmic domain. Functions of CR2 include binding the human complement component C3d,g when it is covalently attached to targets or cross-linked in the fluid phase. In addition, CR2 binds the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and mediates internalization of EBV and subsequent infection of cells. In order to explore functional roles of the repetitive extracytoplasmic SCR structure and the intracytoplasmic domain of CR2, we have created truncated CR2 (rCR2) mutants bearing serial deletions of extracytoplasmic SCRs and also the intracytoplasmic tail. We then stably transfected these rCR2 mutants into two cell lines, murine fibroblast L cells and human erythroleukemic K562 cells. Phenotypic analysis of these expressed mutants revealed that 1) The C3d,g- and EBV-binding sites are found in the two amino-terminal SCRs of CR2, 2) expression of SCRs 3 and 4 is further required for high affinity binding to soluble cross-linked C3d,g, 3) the intracytoplasmic domain of CR2 is not required for binding C3d,g or EBV but is necessary for internalization of cross-linked C3d,g as well as for EBV infection of cells, 4) monoclonal anti-CR2 antibodies with similar activities react with single widely separated epitopes, and 5) no functional roles can yet be clearly assigned to SCRs 5-15, as rCR2 mutants not containing these SCRs show no major differences from wild-type rCR2 in binding or internalizing cross-linked C3d,g or mediating EBV binding and infection."

These G proteins are not integral membrane proteins, yet are membrane associated. The processing and function of the Î³ subunit of the yeast G protein involved in mating-pheromone signal transduction was found to be affected by the same mutations that block ras processing. The nature of these mutations implied that the Î³ subunit was polyisoprenylated and that this modification was necessary for membrane association and biological activity. A microbial screen was developed for pharmacological agents that inhibit polyisoprenylation and that have potential application in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1503927377,"Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) can modulate the mitogenic and metabolic effects of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). IGFBP-3 protein levels are developmentally regulated and influenced by a number of hormonal stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. As a first step toward understanding how hormonal and developmental factors regulate IGFBP-3 production, we are characterizing the human IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter. Southern analysis demonstrates a single copy of the IGFBP-3 gene in the human genome. This gene spans 8.9 kilobases; the protein-coding region is divided into four exons while a fifth exon contains the 3'-untranslated region. Primer extension studies locate the IGFBP-3 mRNA cap site 132 base pairs 5' to the ATG translation initiation codon. On the chromosomal gene, this cap site is located 30 base pairs 3' to the start of a TATA box and 97 base pairs 3' to a consensus GC upstream promoter element, an organization common to many eukaryotic promoters. When this potential IGFBP-3 promoter region is placed upstream to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, it directs high-level production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in transfected COS-1 cells. These observations suggest an uncomplicated organization for the IGFBP-3 chromosomal gene and promoter in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1518374344,"The action of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (N3dTTP) on DNA strand elongation catalyzed by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase was evaluated in comparison with human DNA polymerase alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-independent DNA polymerase delta. Sequencing gel analysis demonstrated that the human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase preferentially incorporated N3dTTP into the T sites of the growing DNA strands and caused chain termination in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was observed even when the N3dTTP concentration was 0.3 microM, 100-fold less than dTTP. Studies with reverse transcriptases from avian myeloblastosis virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus showed that N3dTTP was also efficiently incorporated into DNA by these enzymes and terminated DNA strand elongation. In contrast, human DNA polymerases alpha and delta did not incorporate detectable amounts of N3dTTP into the DNA and were not inhibited by 300 microM N3dTTP. The selective incorporation of the chain-terminating nucleotide by the viral reverse transcriptases appears to be a molecular basis for the positive therapeutic index of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine."
https://openalex.org/W2061266262,"At the replication origin of ColE1 plasmid, a persistent hybrid is formed between the primer precursor (RNA II) and its template DNA. The wild-type sequence in the region 13 to 20 bp upstream (-20 region) of the origin is required to form this persistent hybrid. While the template strand for transcription of this region, containing a stretch of six dC residues, is needed, the nontemplate strand can be deleted. Certain mutations in far upstream regions that prevent hybrid formation are suppressed by the nontemplate strand deletion. In RNA II that is forming a persistent hybrid, the region about 265 nucleotides upstream of the origin (-265 region) can also form a hybrid with the template DNA. The -265 region of RNA II that consists of a stretch of six rG residues probably interacts with the dC stretch of the -20 region in the template strand to promote hybrid formation."
https://openalex.org/W2169995876,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding proteins (BPs) bind IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity. They are present in extracellular fluids and modulate the interactions of their ligands with the type 1 IGF cell surface receptor. These studies utilized IGF-I analogs that have reduced binding affinity for either the type 1 IGF receptor or binding proteins to study the ligand specificity of IGF-BP-1 and the role of IGF-BP-1 in modulating the biological activity of IGF-I. The data indicate that the regions of IGF-I which are responsible for binding to IGF-BP-1 and to human serum-binding proteins are distinct but overlapping and are clearly distinct from the type I receptor binding sites. In the absence of exogenously added IGF-BP-1, the analogs with reduced affinity for IGF-BP-1 are more potent than IGF-I in stimulating DNA synthesis by porcine aortic smooth muscle cells. In contrast, when cells are concomitantly exposed to IGF-BP-1, two of the analogs with reduced affinity for binding protein give only 40-65% of the maximal IGF-I response. [Leu24, 1-62]IGF-I, which has a 100-fold reduced affinity for the type 1 IGF receptor, gave a value that was 62% of the maximal IGF-BP-1 potentiated response. A second biological response, that of stimulating binding protein secretion by IGF-I, was also examined. [Leu24, 1-62]IGF-I is more potent than IGF-I whereas the activity of the analogs with lower affinity for IGF-BP-1 is significantly reduced. Thus, the ability to activate DNA synthesis and binding protein secretion maximally in the presence of IGF-BP-1 is dependent on the affinity of IGFs for both type 1 receptors and binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574971610,"DNA ligase I is the major DNA ligase activity in proliferating mammalian cells. The protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from calf thymus. It has a monomeric structure and a blocked N-terminal residue. DNA ligase I is a 125-kDa polypeptide as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and by gel chromatography under denaturing conditions, whereas hydrodynamic measurements indicate that the enzyme is an asymmetric 98-kDa protein. Immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the enzyme revealed a single polypeptide of 125 kDa in freshly prepared crude cell extracts of calf thymus. Limited digestion of the purified DNA ligase I with several reagent proteolytic enzymes generated a relatively protease-resistant 85-kDa fragment. This domain retained full catalytic activity. Similar results were obtained with partially purified human DNA ligase I. The active large fragment represents the C-terminal part of the intact protein, and contains an epitope conserved between mammalian DNA ligase I and yeast and vaccinia virus DNA ligases. The function of the N-terminal region of DNA ligase I is unknown."

Na(+)-dependent uptake of phosphate and sulfate was stimulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner up to 20-fold as compared to water-injected controls. After fractionation of the mRNA on a sucrose gradient (or by preparative gel electrophoresis), two neighboring fractions were identified to stimulate Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake (average size: 3.4 kilobases) and Na(+)-dependent sulfate uptake (average size: 3.7 kilobases). The two transport systems can be discriminated by their inhibition by thiosulfate, which reduced sulfate uptake, but not phosphate uptake. Kinetic characterization of the expressed Na(+)-dependent transport activities results in properties similar to those described for transport activity in renal brush-border membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1536670202,"The receptor for alpha 2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes (alpha 2MR) was purified recently, and its binding of ligand was shown to depend on calcium ions (Moestrup, S. K., and Gliemann, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15574-15577). This paper shows that the 440-kDa human placental alpha 2MR is a cysteine-rich glycoprotein with high affinity calcium binding sites important for receptor conformation; and the relationship between Ca2+ concentration and receptor function is presented. Autoradiography showed 45Ca2+ binding to the 440-kDa alpha 2MR blotted onto nitrocellulose from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. alpha 2MR immobilized on nitrocellulose in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate bound 45Ca2+ in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+, and 2-3 microM unlabeled Ca2+ was required to displace half of the bound 45Ca2+. The calcium concentration dependence showed upward concave Scatchard plots, and the number of binding sites was estimated to be approximately eight/alpha 2MR molecule. Binding of calcium did not change in the pH range 6.5-8.0 but decreased at lower pH values. Addition of Ca2+ to the medium was necessary for receptor binding of the alpha 2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex, and half of the maximal binding capacity was obtained with about 16 micrograms Ca2+ at pH 7.8. The requirement for calcium was increased at lower pH values, and half of the maximal 125I-alpha 2M-trypsin binding was obtained with about 30-40 microM Ca2+ at pH 7.0. Monoclonal antibodies were produced against alpha 2MR, and one of them distinguished between the Ca2(+)-occupied and nonoccupied forms. Like Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ elicited ligand binding affinity and competed for binding with 45Ca2+ in the order Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+. In conclusion, calcium ions bind specifically to alpha 2MR with high affinity, and it is likely that several sites on the alpha 2MR molecule have to be occupied to elicit the conformation recognizing the ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1595215626,"C1 inhibitor (C1INH), the major plasma inhibitor of activated C1, kallikrein, and activated Hageman factor, may be an important factor in limiting inflammatory injury mediated by the complement and contact systems. C1INH is thought to be synthesized primarily in the liver; however, the regulators of hepatic C1 inhibitor synthesis are completely unknown. In this report, we analyze the regulation of C1INH synthesis by hepatocyte stimulating factors in human hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. Interleukin-6 and interferon gamma increase C1INH production in both hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. These cytokines stimulate de novo synthesis of functional C1INH, acting at a pretranslational level as assessed by Northern blotting. The stimulatory effects of interleukin-6 and interferon gamma on C1INH synthesis are separate and are differentially modulated by interleukin-1. These results establish that hepatic C1INH synthesis is regulated by hepatocyte stimulating factors and reveal novel interactions between these factors."
https://openalex.org/W1490475005,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of A-431 cells potentiates up to 5-fold the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation induced by isoproterenol, cholera toxin, forskolin, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). EGF potentiates cAMP accumulation in several epithelial cell lines which overexpress the EGF receptor including A-431 cells, HSC-1 cells, and MDA-468 cells, and in the A-431-29S clone which expresses a normal complement of EGF receptors. Although EGF potentiates cAMP accumulation, EGF by itself does not measurably alter the basal level of cAMP. EGF rapidly enhances cAMP accumulation (within 1 to 3 min) in A-431 cells treated with these cAMP-elevating agents. EGF potentiation of cAMP accumulation does not reflect enhancement of beta-adrenergic receptor activation and is not a consequence of intracellular cAMP elevation or the concomitant activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Since EGF potentiates accumulation of both intracellular and extracellular cAMP in isoproterenol-treated A-431 cells, EGF does not potentiate intracellular cAMP accumulation by inhibition of cAMP export. EGF potentiation of cAMP accumulation is pertussis toxin-insensitive and does not result from EGF inhibition of cAMP degradation in A-431 cells. These results demonstrate that EGF transmembrane signaling includes an interaction with a component of the adenylate cyclase system and that this interaction stimulates cAMP synthesis resulting in enhancement of cAMP accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1621022166,"The ability of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) to increase class II major histocompatibility complex (class II MHC) gene products in murine macrophages involves activation of Na+/H+ exchange (Prpic V., Yu, S. F., Figueiredo, F., Hollenbach, P. W., Gawdi, G., Herman, B., Uhing, R. J., and Adams, D. O. (1989) Science 244, 469-471). The ability of IFN gamma to increase class II MHC gene product expression is inhibited by a variety of agents. In the present studies, the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in modulating IFN gamma-induced expression of MHC gene products and the mechanism of regulation were assessed in macrophages treated with agents which activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase by different molecular mechanisms. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produced a rapid (within 30 s) dose-dependent elevation of cAMP which was paralleled by the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The elevation of cAMP by PGE2 was still evident at 1 h and maintained through a 4-h incubation. Concentrations of PGE2 which activated the protein kinase produced a dose-dependent inhibition of surface expression of I-A and transcription of class II MHC genes. Inhibition of IFN gamma-induced class II MHC gene product expression was also observed in macrophages treated with agents which activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase by postreceptor mechanisms. Dibutyryl-cAMP (0.01-1 mM), 25 microM forskolin, 0.1 micrograms/ml cholera toxin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1-1 mM) each suppressed IFN gamma-induced cell surface I-A expression, class II MHC gene transcription, and 22Na+ influx. The results are consistent with the suggestion that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulates an early transductional event initiated by IFN gamma, perhaps Na+/H+ exchange, which is involved in regulating transcription of class II MHC genes and their subsequent expression."

Antibody PK6 was subtyped IgG1,k and had an apparent Kass of 6.8 +/- 0.44.10(8) M-1 for prekallikrein. Functional analyses revealed that PK6 does not interfere with prekallikrein activation by activated Hageman factor (beta-F XIIa), and has no effect on the kininogenase function of activated kallikrein. Monoclonal antibody PK6 but none of the other anti-heavy chain antibodies completely prevented complex formation of prekallikrein with H-kininogen, and readily dissociated preformed complexes of prekallikrein and H-kininogen. Likewise, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments of PK6 blocked H-kininogen binding to prekallikrein. A synthetic peptide of 31 amino acid residues encompassing the entire prekallikrein binding region of H-kininogen effectively competed with PK6 for prekallikrein binding indicating that the target epitope of PK6 is juxtaposed to, if not incorporated in the H-kininogen-binding site of prekallikrein. Extensive cross-reactivity of PK6 with another H-kininogen-binding protein of human plasma, i.e. factor XI, suggested that the structure of the target epitope of PK6 is well conserved among prekallikrein and factor XI, as would be expected for the kininogen-binding site shared by the two proteins. It is anticipated that monoclonal antibody PK6 will be an important tool for the precise mapping of the hitherto unknown kininogen-binding site of prekallikrein."
https://openalex.org/W1608530644,"Antibodies were raised against Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1 and its NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments, and their specificity was demonstrated by a variety of immunological techniques. These antibodies were then used to investigate the location of protein S1 and its NH2- and COOH-terminal domains on the surface of the 30 S ribosomal subunit by immunoelectron microscopy. In order to prevent dissociation of the protein during the experiments, S1 was cross-linked to 30 S subunits with dithiobis(succinimidyl-propionate); cross-linking yield was 100%. Epitopes of the NH2-terminal domain of S1 were localized at the large lobe of the 30 S ribosomal subunit, close to the one-third/two-thirds partition on the side which in the 70 S ribosome faces the cytoplasm. Experiments with monovalent Fab fragments specific for the COOH-terminal part of S1 provide evidence that the COOH-terminal domain forms an elongated structure extending at least 10 nm from the large lobe of the small subunit into the cytoplasmic space."

https://openalex.org/W1698613332,"The ultrastructure of embryonic chick cartilage proteoglycan core protein was investigated by electron microscopy of specimens prepared by low angle shadowing. The molecular images demonstrated a morphological substructural arrangement of three globular and two linear regions within each core protein. The internal globular region (G2) was separated from two terminally located globular regions (G1 and G3) by two elongated strands with lengths of 21 +/- 3 nm (E1) and 105 +/- 22 nm (E2). The two N-terminal globular regions, separated by the 21-nm segment, were consistently visualized in well spread molecules and showed little variation in the length of the linear segment connecting them. The E2 segment, however, was quite variable in length, and the C-terminal globular region (G3) was detected in only 53% of the molecules. The G1, G2, and G3 regions in chick core protein were 10.1 +/- 1.7 nm, 9.7 +/- 1.3 nm, and 8.3 +/- 1.3 nm in diameter, respectively. These results are similar to those described previously for proteoglycan core proteins isolated from rat chondrosarcoma, bovine nasal cartilage, and pig laryngeal cartilage (Paulsson, M., Morgelin, M., Wiedemann, H., Beardmore-Gray, M., Dunham, D., Hardingham, T., Heinegard, D., Timpl, R., and Engel, J. (1987) Biochem. J. 245, 763-772). However, a significant difference was detected between the length of the elongated strand (E2) of core proteins isolated from chick cartilage, E2 length = 105 +/- 22 nm, compared to bovine nasal cartilage, E2 length = 260 +/- 39 nm. The epitope of the proteoglycan core protein-specific monoclonal antibody, S103L, was visualized by electron microscopy, and the distance from the core protein N terminus to the S103L binding site was measured. The S103L binding site was localized to the E2 region, 111 +/- 20 nm from the G1 (N terminus) domain and 34 nm from the G3 (C terminus) domain. cDNA clones selected from an expression vector library of chicken cartilage mRNA also show this epitope to be located near the C-terminal region (R. C. Krueger, T. A. Fields, J. Mensch, and B. Schwartz (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12088-12097)."
https://openalex.org/W1667700085,"Mouse F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells differentiate in monolayer cultures in the presence of retinoic acid, dibutyryl cAMP, and isobutyl methylxanthine. This differentiation is associated with a marked increase in the synthesis rates and mRNA concentrations of basement membrane proteins such as type IV collagen. We report here that the differentiation also involves an increase of up to 50-fold in the concentrations of the mRNAs for the alpha and beta subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the enzyme required for the cotranslational and post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues in collagens. The time courses and magnitudes of increases in these two mRNA concentrations were similar to those observed in the same experiments for the mRNA of the alpha chain of type IV collagen. In the differentiated F9 cells the concentration of the alpha subunit mRNA was about 30% of the beta subunit mRNA concentration. Northern blot analyses indicated that the sizes of the alpha and beta subunit mRNAs in the differentiated mouse F9 cells are similar to those in human skin fibroblasts. The F9 cell differentiation system appears to provide a useful model for studies on the regulation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041551189,"When serotonergic Retzius (R) neurons of the leech contact pressure-sensitive (P) neurons in culture, P cells selectively lose a protein kinase C-dependent cationic response to serotonin and the R cell reforms the inhibitory, chloride-dependent synapse seen in vivo. In P cells not contacted by R cells, cell-attached patches contained single cation channels sensitive to serotonin and phorbol ester with characteristic properties and high incidence (present in about one-half of the patches). P cells paired with R cells had a cation channel with similar biophysical properties and incidence, but channel activity was not stimulated by serotonin and phorbol ester. These results suggest that the early clearing of the non-synaptic (excitatory) response to serotonin is due to the loss of activation by protein kinase C (and not the number) of cation channels as a prelude to inhibitory synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W1541595681,"Stimulation of phagocytic cells with micromolar concentrations of extracellular ATP primes the production of toxic oxygen metabolites in response to chemoattractants and independently activates a secretory response in vitro. It is hypothesized that extracellular ATP derived from platelet storage granules and damaged endothelium at sites of localized tissue damage or infection may potentiate the pro-inflammatory effects of phagocytic cells in vivo. ATP-dependent functional responses in the phagocyte appear to be due to stimulation of putative P2 purinoreceptors that are coupled to the activation of a phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. The existence in nature of at least four subtypes of P2 purinoreceptors has been proposed based on the rank order of potency of nucleotide analogs of ATP studied in a variety of cell types. However, no studies involving the structural identification and characterization of the putative receptors have been reported. We have used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to demonstrate acquired adenosine 5'-(thio) triphosphate (ATP gamma S) responsiveness in oocytes injected with mRNA from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 by measuring the accelerated efflux of intracellular calcium. Two peaks of ATP gamma S responsiveness (Peak I and Peak II) were detected in sucrose gradient fractionated RNA that corresponded to transcript sizes of 4 and 6 kilobases and that were distinct from a third peak previously shown to be enriched in formyl peptide chemoattractant receptor activity. Peak I and Peak II RNA endowed receptor activity in the oocyte that was pharmacologically indistinguishable: ADP and AMP were inactive whereas UTP and ITP exhibited activity that was similar in potency to that of ATP gamma S. Both Peak I and Peak II ATP gamma S-dependent activity was inhibited by pertussis toxin. These data strongly support the concept of phagocytic cell receptors for extracellular nucleotide triphosphates whose ligand specificity is distinct from all other previously described P2 purinoreceptor subtypes, with the exception of the P2 receptor described in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, by virtue of the ineffectiveness of ADP as a stimulus. These receptors are most likely composed of a single polypeptide chain that can be expressed in the Xenopus oocyte in a functional form regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein."

https://openalex.org/W1985572439,"In the present work, I describe an antiserum that specifically stains all neurons in C. elegans. This probe should facilitate developmental studies in this organism in the same way as anti-horseradish peroxidase has in Drosophila. The antiserum was raised against an 8 amino acid peptide representing part of an insect neuropeptide precursor, but there are no indications that this cross-reactivity reflects evolutionary homology. The antiserum allows the whole nervous system of C. elegans, including all cell bodies and processes, to be brightly stained. The subcellular staining pattern suggests that a cytoskeletal component is recognized. I have also isolated a mutation (e2481) that abolishes staining in all but 7 neurons, the 6 microtubule cells and 1 cell in the tail. Finally, I show that the pattern of staining in the nematode P. redivivus is similar to that seen in animals carrying the e2481 mutation."
