https://openalex.org/W2119336577,"MDEG1 is a cation channel expressed in brain that belongs to the degenerin/epithelial Na+channel superfamily. It is activated by the same mutations which cause neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans if present in the degenerins DEG-1, MEC-4, and MEC-10. MDEG1 shares 67% sequence identity with the recently cloned proton-gated cation channel ASIC (acid sensing ion channel), a new member of the family which is present in brain and in sensory neurons. We have now identified MDEG1 as a proton-gated channel with properties different from those of ASIC. MDEG1 requires more acidic pH values for activation and has slower inactivation kinetics. In addition, we have cloned from mouse and rat brain a splice variant form of the MDEG1 channel which differs in the first 236 amino acids, including the first transmembrane region. This new membrane protein, which has been called MDEG2, is expressed in both brain and sensory neurons. MDEG2 is activated neither by mutations that bring neurodegeneration once introduced in C. elegansdegenerins nor by low pH. However, it can associate both with MDEG1 and another recently cloned H+-activated channel DRASIC to form heteropolymers which display different kinetics, pH dependences, and ion selectivities. Of particular interest is the subunit combination specific for sensory neurons, MDEG2/DRASIC. In response to a drop in pH, it gives rise to a biphasic current with a sustained current which discriminates poorly between Na+and K+, like the native H+-gated current recorded in dorsal root ganglion cells. This sustained current is thought to be required for the tonic sensation of pain caused by acids.

It is a member of the degenerin/epithelial Na+channel superfamily which includes sodium-permeable ion channels such as the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; ASIC, acid sensing ion channel; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G571-G587PubMed Google Scholar), and the FMRFamide-activated Helix aspersa channel FaNaC (9Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), involved in neurotransmission. It also includes the degenerins ofCaenorhabditis elegans, involved in mechano-transduction (10Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Rat MDEG did not display detectable currents after expression in Xenopus oocytes or HEK cells (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, a large sodium-selective current was observed in cells that expressed mutated MDEG (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The mutations correspond to substitution of a glycine,i.e. a small amino acid for a large amino acid, such as a valine or a phenylalanine, just before the second hydrophobic region. These mutations are equivalent to those which in the C. elegans degenerins cause cell swelling and neuronal death (10Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 12Hall D.H. Gu G. Garcı́a-Añoveros J. Gong L. Chalfie M. Driscoll M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDEG shares 67% sequence identity with the recently cloned ASIC channel (for acid sensing ion channel), another member of the ENaC/FaNaC/degenerin family (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). ASIC expression yields a transient amiloride-sensitive inward current in response to a rapid drop in extracellular pH, that is mostly carried by Na+ ions (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). It is found in both the central and peripheral nervous system (3Garcı́a-Añoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). More recently, a second H+-gated Na+ channel, called DRASIC, was found to be expressed specifically in dorsal root ganglion cells (14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Expression of DRASIC in either Xenopusoocytes or COS cells gives rise to a H+-inducible current with a dual time course comprising a rapidly inactivating current, followed by a slowly activating and sustained current (14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Both components are essentially Na+ currents. Fast drops in extracellular pH have been shown to activate transient sodium currents in peripheral sensory neurons (15Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 2325-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and various central neurons (16Grantyn R. Perouansky M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Lux H.D. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 49: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Ueno S. Nakaye T. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whereas the proton-gated current in brain neurons consists of a single rapidly inactivating component, a dual current is found in polymodal nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons (18Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In these neurons, the transient H+-induced Na+current is followed by a sustained component. This sustained current is most likely the base element in the perception of non-adaptive painful stimuli (19Bevan S. Geppetti P. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 509-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Steen K.H. Steen A.E. Reeh P.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3982-3989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biphasic kinetics closely resemble those of the DRASIC channel, differences remain concerning the selectivity of the sustained component of the current, the native one being a non-selective rather than a Na+-selective current. In this study we will show that MDEG (now designated as MDEG1) expressed in COS cells corresponds to a proton-gated cation channel with properties different from ASIC or DRASIC. We will also describe the molecular cloning, localization, and functional expression of a splice variant of the MDEG1 subunit, MDEG2, which has major structural differences with MDEG1. MDEG2 is not active by itself, but it can associate with either MDEG1 or DRASIC, modifying their properties. In particular it will be demonstrated that this splice variant confers non-selectivity to the late H+-induced current. A fragment of the expressed sequence tag (GenBank accession number W50528) was amplified by PCR and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene). A clone of 3062 base pairs was sequenced on both strands. It displays an open reading frame of 1689 nucleotides preceded by stop codons. The rat cDNA was obtained by PCR with the Expand High fidelity PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) using a primer flanking the start codon (GCCTCGGGCTGAATGAATG) and a primer positioned 223 base pairs downstream from the stop codon (GTTAGTTCTTGGACAGTTC). After subcloning in pBluescript SK−vector (Stratagene), two independent clones were sequenced on both strands. All nucleic acid positions in the text refer to the rat nucleic acid sequence submitted to EMBL (accession numbers Y14635 for the rat clone and Y14634 for the mouse clone). MDEG2 rat cDNA in pBluescript vector was cut by BamHI, blunt ended, ligated with EcoRI linkers, and cut again byEcoRI and AccI. TheEcoRI/AccI part of the wild-type or mutated MDEG1 cDNAs in pBSK-SP6-globin vector (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was replaced by the previously prepared EcoRI/AccI fragment of the MDEG2 cDNAs. For expression in mammalian cells, the MDEG2 cDNA was excised from the pBluescript vector by XbaI andAccI. MDEG1 cDNA in pBSK-SP6-globin was cut byXhoI, blunt ended, and cut again by AccI. The fragment was subcloned with the MDEG2 XbaI/AccI fragment into the XbaI/SmaI-digested PCI expression vector (Promega). Human multi-tissue Northern blots containing about 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane (normalized for identical β-actin expression) were purchased fromCLONTECH. For the blots with RNAs from rat, total RNA was isolated as described (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA in each lane were separated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membranes. The probes were random primed 32P-labeled and correspond to bases 276 to 585 for the MDEG2 5′ probe, bases 154 to 612 for the MDEG1 5′ probe, bases 217 to 1363 for the rat, and bases 1 to 1308 for the human MDEG1 probe overlapping MDEG2. The human blots were hybridized overnight at 65 °C in 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml fish sperm DNA, washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 70 °C and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 3–5 days at −70 °C. The rat blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml fish sperm DNA, 50% formamide, washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and subsequently analyzed with a Fuji PhosphorImager according to the manufacturer procedures. Experiments were performed on adult Wistar rats using standard procedures (22Heurteaux C. Bertaina V. Widmann C. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9431-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Brains were fixed in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.4) for 8 h, and then immersed overnight at 4 °C in a 20% sucrose, PBS solution. Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica) at −25 °C, collected on 3-aminopropylethoxysilane-coated slides, and stored at −20 °C until use. Two antisense synthetic oligonucleotides, complementary to the rat cDNA sequence of MDEG2 (B1 and B2) or MDEG1 (V and VI) were used to detect MDEG2 and MDEG1 transcripts. The sequences of the used oligonucleotides were the following: B1, 5′-ACATGTGCCGCAGCCCGTGCAATTTAGTGCGACTCAG-3′ (nucleotides 196–232); B2, 5′-ACTCACGGTGCACTCGTGTGTGTGACGGGAAGCTGA-3′ (nucleotides 350–385); V, 5′-TCCTCTGAATTCTGCTTAAACCTTGGCATTCAAGGCAG-3′ (nucleotides 53–90); VI, 5′-ATACACGAAGATGTGGCGGATGCCATGGAGAGTGGA-3′ (nucleotides 223–258). Probes were 3′-end-labeled with [α-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals) by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase to an average specific activity of 1–2 × 109 dpm/μg. Sections were treated consecutively with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min, PBS for 3 min, 5 μg/ml proteinase K diluted in 0.1 m Tris, 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min at 37 °C, 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min. Slides were then rinsed 10 min in PBS, acetylated for 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1m triethanolamine, and dehydrated. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 37 °C in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1% Denhardt, 5% Sarcosyl, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaPO4 in 2 × SSC, and the radiolabeled probe (at 0.2 ng/ml with specific activities of 8 × 108 dpm/μg). After hybridization, slides were washed in 1 × SSC at room temperature for 30 min before dehydration, drying, and apposition to Hyperfilm βmax (Amersham) for 6 days. Slides were then dipped in Ilford K5 nuclear emulsion (diluted 1:1 with water) and exposed 4 weeks. Sections were then stained with cresyl violet and coverslipped. The specificity of labeling was verified by in situ hybridization using cold displacement of the radioactive probe with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and by the use of two specific oligonucleotide probes targeted to non-conserved regions. MDEG2 expression in dorsal root ganglia was obtained from in situhybridization with the double-stranded cDNA corresponding to bases 276–585 labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP or/and fluorescein-12-dUTP with PCR. Probe labeling, prehybridization, and immunological detection of digoxigenin transcripts with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies was carried out following the protocols from Boehringer-Mannheim. The MDEG1 and DRASIC coding sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned in the PCI Vector (Promega) as described previously (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). COS7 cells, at a density of 200,000 cells/35-mm diameter Petri dish, were co-transfected with the ASIC subunits and an expression vector containing the CD8 receptor cDNA (ratio 5:1) using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1–3 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to fix CD8 antibody-coated beads (23Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Ion currents were recorded using either the whole cell or outside-out patch-clamp technique and stored on hard disk for later off-line analysis. The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 120, NaCl 30, MgCl2 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2). For the “0 Na” pipette solution, NaCl was replaced by KCl. The bath solution contained in mm: NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10 (pH 7.3). Changes in extracellular pH were induced by shifting one out of six outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell or patch. Test solutions having a pH of less than 6 were buffered with 10 mm MES rather than HEPES, but were identical in all other respects. Experiments were carried out at 22 ± 2 °C (room temperature). One partial cDNA sequence from mouse embryo similar to that of MDEG1 cDNA was found in the data base of expressed sequence tags (GenBank accession number W50528). A fragment of this sequence was amplified by PCR from adult mouse brain cDNA and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library. Several positive clones were isolated and the longest one (3057 base pairs) was completely sequenced. It contains an open reading frame of 1689 base pairs preceded by stop codons and codes for a protein of 563 amino acids. Cloning by PCR of the rat cDNA (Fig. 1) reveals differences at only four amino acids when compared with the mouse sequence (Ala-30, Arg-46, Glu-47, and Ile-494 in the mouse were replaced by respectively Val, Pro, Ala, and Leu in the rat). The part of the sequence from amino acid 236 to the end of the protein is totally identical to the rat MDEG1 sequence (Fig. 1). Sequence identity was also found at the nucleic acid level starting from nucleotide 722 and including the analized 3′ non-coding sequence. The point of divergence between MDEG1 and MDEG2 cDNAs contains a potential splice junction. This strongly suggests alternative splicing that generates from a single gene, two transcripts coding for MDEG1 and the new protein MDEG2. The first 236-amino acid sequence of MDEG2 encoded by separate exon(s) shows significant similarities with MDEG1 (31% identity and 48% similarity). MDEG2 also possesses two putative transmembrane regions, one identical to MDEG1 (the C-terminal one) and one different from MDEG1 (the N-terminal one) (Fig. 1). Thus this protein has all the hallmarks of the ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC/degenerin family,i.e. two hydrophobic domains flanking a large region including a cysteine-rich domain that was shown to be extracellular for the epithelial Na+ channel (24Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed on human tissues and on rat brain tissue with a probe overlapping the common region of MDEG1 and MDEG2 and/or with two probes specific of each splice variant (Fig.2). The two mRNAs of 4.2 and 2.9 kilobases labeled by the common probe in human and rat brain (also shown by 1–3) correspond to each splice variant, the shorter transcript corresponding to the MDEG1 form and the longer transcript corresponding to the MDEG2 form (Fig. 2, B andC). Of the tissues examined by Northern blot analysis, both splice variant forms are only expressed in brain (Fig. 2 A). A more precise localization of MDEG1 and MDEG2 in the nervous system was assessed by in situ hybridization. Analysis of the distribution of MDEG1 and MDEG2 mRNA was performed on x-ray film images and emulsion-coated sections of adult rat brains cut in sagittal and coronal planes (Fig.3). The pair of 33P-labeled MDEG2 or MDEG1 oligonucleotides revealed identical labeling profiles within MDEG2 or MDEG1 experiments, respectively, and provided evidence of the signal specificity. MDEG2 transcripts were found in the majority of the neuronal perikarya but were not detected in glial cells. Higher expression levels appeared in the main olfactory bulb, neo- and allo-cortical regions, hippocampal formation, habenula, basolateral amygdaloid nuclei, and cerebellum (Fig. 3 A, upper). In the olfactory system (Fig. 3 B), cells expressing MDEG2 mRNA were localized in the glomerular cell layer, the internal granular layer, and the mitral and internal plexiform cell layers. Within the glomerular layer, transcripts were restricted to the periglomerular cells. In contrast, weak labeling was observed in the external plexiform layer and the olfactory nerve layer. In the neocortex, the large pyramidal neurons were strongly labeled in all cortical layers as well as in the small cells corresponding to oligo-, astro-, or micro-glia cells. In the hippocampal formation (Fig. 3 C), MDEG2 mRNAs were highly expressed in dentate granule cells and hilar neurons, as well as in pyramidal cells of CA1-CA3 subfields. In addition, intense hybridization signals were observed in large interneurons located in stratum oriens and radiatum of all subfields. Within the thalamus, the medial and lateral habenula showed moderate levels of MDEG2 mRNAs. In the cerebellar cortex (Fig.3 D), Purkinje cells and granule cells displayed high levels of MDEG2 expression. The molecular layer was weakly labeled except in small neurons with a size and distribution similar to stellate and basket cells. No expression was seen in the large neurons of all deep cerebellar nuclei. A diffuse expression was observed over most other regions including thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, striatum, and globus pallidus of the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla. MDEG2 transcripts were expressed at low levels in choroid plexus. MDEG2 was localized in exactly the same brain areas as MDEG1 (Fig. 3 A, upper and lower parts), raising the possibility that the two forms can be present in the same neurons and can interact with each other. High MDEG2 mRNA expression was also observed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 3,E and F), while MDEG1 was not detected (not shown). Mutations that cause gain of function in the C. elegansdegenerins and neurodegeneration are able to activate MDEG1 (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These mutations are located just before the second hydrophobic region,i.e. in a region where MDEG1 and MDEG2 sequences are the same (Figs. 1 and 2 C). The two mutations G481F and G481K were introduced in MDEG2. While these mutations are able to activate MDEG1 (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), corresponding MDEG2 mutants were not active after expression in Xenopus oocytes (not shown). Thus, differences in the N-terminal part of MDEG1 and MDEG2 which includes the first 236 amino acids and the first transmembrane domain have produced drastic differences between the properties of the two MDEG proteins. The relatively high level of sequence identity between MDEG1 or MDEG2, and ASIC (67 and 55% respectively) raised the possibility that MDEGs are proton-gated ion channels. Indeed, transfection of COS cells with MDEG1 yielded a proton-gated Na+ current with properties different from both ASIC and DRASIC (Fig.4, A and C). MDEG1 requires more acidic pH values for activation and starts to open at pH 4.5, a pH where ASIC and DRASIC are already maximally activated (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar,14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The inactivation kinetics of MDEG1 (τinact = 3.15 ± 0.51 s, n = 22) are slower than for ASIC (τinact = 1.4 ± 0.05 s, n= 129; p < 0.001). Transfection of COS cells with MDEG2 did not yield a proton-gated current, even at the very low pH of 3 (not shown). MDEG2 is inactive by itself. Since MDEG2 and ASIC are present in the same tissues, i.e.brain and dorsal root ganglion cells, coexpression of the two proteins in COS cells was then assayed. It gave H+-gated currents that were not significantly different from those recorded with ASIC alone (not shown). Conversely, cotransfection of MDEG2 and MDEG1 lead to a new current that activated when the pH was shifted from 7.3 to 5 (Fig. 4 B). The MDEG1/MDEG2 current induced by the acid shift to pH 5 displayed a slowly inactivating component that was not seen on expression of MDEG1 alone (Fig. 4 A). Even after a period of 30 to 60 s following the change of pH, a small but persistent current could still be recorded from most cells expressing the MDEG1/MDEG2 mixture. Larger pH variations induced larger currents and at pH 3 the MDEG1/MDEG2 peak current had not attained its maximal value (Fig. 4 C). This is in contrast with the MDEG1 current which saturated at a pH between 4.5 and 4 (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that MDEG2 interacts with MDEG1 to form heteromultimers with new properties. As the intensity of the MDEG1/MDEG2 peak current measured at pH 4.5 is only one-fifth of the MDEG1 peak current activated at the same pH (Fig. 4 C), it is clear that most, if not all channels are expressed in the heteromultimeric form in cells transfected with both MDEG1 and MDEG2. No difference in steady-state inactivation of the peak current was noticed between MDEG1 and MDEG1/MDEG2 currents (Fig. 4 D). Unitary currents were recorded from outside-out patches excised from MDEG1-transfected cells and from MDEG1/MDEG2-cotransfected cells. In both cases it was found that besides a main conductance state, subconductance states could be recorded (Fig. 4, E andF). The unitary currents reversed at 30 ± 2 mV for both MDEG1 (n = 8) and MDEG1/MDEG2 (n = 11) (Na+ equilibrium potential = +40.1 mV) (Fig.4 I), indicating that the main MDEG1 and MDEG1/MDEG2 conductance states are mainly permeable to Na+. The slope conductance between −40 and +40 mV is 13.4 ± 2 pS for MDEG1 and 13.7 ± 2 pS for MDEG1/MDEG2 (Fig. 4 I). Outside-out patches excised from COS cells were exposed to a drop in pH from the resting pH of 7.3 to pH 4. Na+ was absent from the pipette solution and patches were clamped at +40 mV (Fig. 4,G and H). While the MDEG1 current remained inward during the pH pulse, the MDEG1/MDEG2 current gradually became outward. This result indicates that channel selectivities of the early transient component and of the delayed MDEG1/MDEG2 component are different. Both current components expressed by the MDEG1/MDEG2 association are completely inhibited by 0.5 mm of the epithelial Na+ channel blocker, amiloride (Fig. 4 H). It has been shown previously that the DRASIC current, like the native proton-gated current in dorsal root sensory neurons, consists of two components: a rapidly inactivating current followed by a sustained current (14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, unlike the native current, the two DRASIC components reverse at the same membrane potential of +32 ± 3 mV (n = 5) (Fig. 5,A and D). As MDEG2 is present in dorsal root ganglion cells, we tested the possibility that cotransfection of DRASIC and MDEG2 would yield a late non-selective current, while retaining an initial transient sodium-selective current. Fig. 5, B andC, show that coexpression of the two different subunits yielded a current which at first sight looked like a DRASIC-like current. The transient peak current produced by activation of DRASIC/MDEG2 reversed at +40 mV with 30 mm Na+in the pipette (n = 10) (Fig. 5, B andE), while it reversed at a value well above +80 mV in the absence of intracellular Na+ (n = 5) (Fig.5, C and F). Hence the initial transient current is mostly carried by Na+. The steady-state current, however, reversed close to 0 mV in the absence or presence of Na+, indicating that it is not a Na+-selective current. It has been shown previously that the pH for half-maximum activation of the DRASIC current is at pH0.5 = 6.5 (14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It was found that coexpression with MDEG2 did not change the pH dependence of the peak current (not shown). The fact that the sustained DRASIC/MDEG2 current reversed very close to 0 mV, independent of the Na+ gradient, indicated that the sustained non-selective current due to the heteromultimeric assembly was probably not much contaminated by the presence of the homomultimeric DRASIC sustained current. It follows that the initial transient Na+ peak current recorded from DRASIC/MDEG2 transfected cells must be a current resulting from the formation of a heteromultimeric channel. Hence, as in the case of the MDEG1/MDEG2 current, both the Na+-specific and the non-selective cationic current flow through heteromultimeric channels. A situation where a single channel protein displays two different ion selectivities is not without precedents. It has been described previously for the purinergic P2X7 receptor (28Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). What is the molecular basis for the capacity of the MDEG1/MDEG2 and the DRASIC/MDEG2 heteromultimers to generate 2 different types of currents? A first possibility is that a single channel species could gradually change its selectivity with time. Alternatively, the association of the different subunits could lead to different stoichiometric arrangements producing different types of channels, one “transient” and one “sustained.” Another possibility would be that the 2 different types of channel expression could be related to differences in phosphorylation states. To see if the non-selective channel could be distinguished from its Na+-selective counterpart by its unitary conductance, we systematically measured for the MDEG1/MDEG2 heteromultimer all well resolved conductance states as a function of membrane potential. Fig.4 J shows the presence of many subconductance states that cannot be easily separated into two independent channel species, although it appears that in the range between 0 and +40 mV, both a Na+-selective and a non-selective conductance might be present. These data do not permit a clear conclusion. However, since it was shown that the main 13.7 pS conductance is selective for Na+, it seems likely that the non-selective current is associated with a channel of lower unitary conductance. In the DRASIC case, no systematic correlation could be found between the amplitudes of the peak and sustained current. In some cells the sustained current was almost absent (in 35 out of 85 cells, the sustained component was less than 10% of the peak current) while in others (8 out of 85 cells), the sustained component was at least 60% of the peak current. This observation might plead in favor of the hypothesis involving the formation of 2 different channels. As for other ligand-gated ion channels (29Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased diversity in the H+-gated channel family can be reached by alternative splicing and heteromultimeric assembly. MDEG2 is present in sensory neurons where it modulates the expression of DRASIC. Coexpression of the two proteins yields a H+-gated current that now contains a non-selective sustained component. Thus, it seems very probable that these two units constitute at least part of the native proton-gated cationic channel of nociceptive neurons (18Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The expression of acid sensing ion channels is not restricted to sensory neurons. Like ASIC (14Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), both MDEG1 and MDEG2 are well expressed in the brain and MDEG1 is in fact only present in the brain. Because significant changes in extracellular pH have been shown to be associated with neuronal activity (30Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), the possibility that brain acid-sensitive ion channels are involved in neurotransmission or neuromodulation does exist. However, the fairly acid threshold for activation of MDEG1 by pH does not seem to be readily compatible with a physiological role as an acid sensor. The MDEG1/MDEG2 heteromultimer also is only activable at very acidic pH. It is not known whether MDEG1 channels or MDEG1/MDEG2 heteromultimers in their native environment can associate with other subsidiary subunits or can be modified by factors such as phosphorylation to bring their pH sensitivity closer to pH ∼7. Therefore, the possible functions of MDEG1 and/or MDEG1/MDEG2 channels in the brain remain unclear. Both MDEG1 and MDEG1/MDEG2 channels can probably be activated in pathophysiological situations such as ischemia and epileptic seizures which produce large acidifications of the extracellular medium (31Kraig R.P. Ferreira-Filho C.R. Nicholson C. J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 49: 831-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In such cases, the opening of these particular channels and especially the long lasting non-selective cation current produced by the MDEG1/MDEG2 heteromultimer would certainly have very deleterious effects contributing to neuronal cell death.

In many cell types, activation of a Gq-protein coupled receptor leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCh, carbachol; [Ca2+] i , cytosolic Ca2+concentration; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; HPSS, HEPES-buffered saline solution; M5 receptor, M5 muscarinic receptor; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay; TG, thapsigargin; Trp, transient receptor potential; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCh, carbachol; [Ca2+] i , cytosolic Ca2+concentration; HA, hemagglutinin antigen; HPSS, HEPES-buffered saline solution; M5 receptor, M5 muscarinic receptor; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay; TG, thapsigargin; Trp, transient receptor potential; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s). by phospholipase C activation followed by a biphasic increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ). The first phase is due to IP3 that causes the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The second phase is caused by a continuous Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (for review, see Refs. 1Putney Jr., J.W.

Depending on the cell of study, Ca2+ entry has been activated either without stimulation of the receptor-G protein-phospholipase C pathway, by simply depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores by treatment with thapsigargin (TG) or other sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase Ca2+ pump inhibitors (also known as capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE)) (reviewed in Refs. 1Putney Jr., J.W.

For example, Ca2+ entry had been described as the mediator of G-protein independent regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (8Cooper D.M.F. Yoshimura M. Zhang Y. Chino M. Mahey R. Biochem.

Also, a primary T-cell immunodeficiency has been described in which blood cells lack Ca2+ entry, although Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular stores appears to be normal (13Partiseti M.

Visual signal transduction in flies and other invertebrates is similar to mammalian Gq-protein coupled signaling (reviewed in Refs. 15Hardie R.C. Minke B.

Visual signal transduction is abnormal in the Drosophila mutanttrp, for transient receptor potential (17Hardie R.C. Minke B.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and so was Dtrp-like, a Drosophilacalmodulin-binding protein similar in amino acid sequence to Dtrp (20Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the open reading frames of Dtrp and Dtrp-like predicted six to eight putative transmembrane domains of which some have a limited sequence similarity with the voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channel transmembrane segments, with the exception that the charged residues thought to represent the voltage sensors, are absent from the putative S4 of dTrp and dTrpl proteins. Electrophysiological records from wild-type fly photoreceptor shows a light-induced conductance highly permeable to Ca2+. This Ca2+ conductance is absent in trp flies, leaving a non-selective cation conductance (21Suss E. Barash S. Stavenga D.G. Stieve H. Selinger Z. Minke B. J. Gen.

When dTrp protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and their Ca2+ stores were depleted by TG, this induced a novel Ca2+ selective current (23Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of dTrpl in Sf9 cells, in contrast, induces a non-selective cation current activated by stimulation of a Gq-coupled receptor, but not by store depletion (23Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y.

As dTrp and dTrpl appeared to be related to some mammalian ion channels and are involved in Ca2+ entry upon stimulation of a phosphoinositide mobilizing receptor and Ca2+ store depletion, it was suggested that a vertebrate homologue of Trp should exist and that this homologue could be involved in vertebrate Ca2+ entry (17Hardie R.C.

Here, we report the cloning and expression of a novel cDNA from the mouse brain, which we call mTrp6. This protein is highly similar to hTrp3. Its transient expression in COS cells increases Ca2+entry in response to stimulation of a Gq-protein-coupled receptor. However, Ca2+ entry due to TG treatment was unchanged by mTrp6. HEK 293 cells expressing mTrp6 in stable form display a non-selective cation conductance that is absent in control HEK cells. A library for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was prepared from mouse brain mRNA using the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH). Total RNA for RT-PCR was isolated from mouse brain using a guanidine-HCl extraction (38Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). For the RT-PCR, the first strand DNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamers as primers. The PCR reaction mixture contained first strand cDNA or cDNA of a RACE library, 0.25 mm dNTP, 0.4–1 μm specific primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units/ml Ampli-Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). 30–35 cycles of PCR were carried out in a Thermal Controller (MJ Research Inc.) set to 94 °C for 1 min, to an annealing temperature between 58 and 68 °C for 1 min, and to 72 °C for 1–3 min, ending with 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pCRII or pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). The specific oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of mTrp6(nt 2337–2567) were GB1 (sense: 5′-AAGACACTGTTCTGGGCTATATT-3′) and GB3 (antisense: 5′-TGCACCAGATTGAAGGGAACAGG-3′). For amplification of mTrp6(nt 1616–2490), the oligonucleotide primers used were DO1 (sense: 5′-A(C/A)(G/A)CCNTT(C/T)ATGAA(G/A)TT-3′) and GB12 (antisense: 5′-CCACTCCACGTCCGCATCATCC-3′). The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of mTrp6(nt 677–1755) were DO0 (sense: 5′-AAT(G/A)TNAA(C/T)TG(T/C)(G/C)TNGA-3′) and GB40 (antisense: 5′-TGAGCATCTCCATCCATGAGAAAC-3′). The specific oligonucleotide primers used for primary RACE-PCR amplification of the 3′ end of the mTrp6 cDNA were GB23 (sense: 5′-GACACTGTTCTGGGCTATCTTTGG-3′) and AP1 (adaptor-ligated primer 1 provided by the manufacturer). The primary 3′-RACE PCR was followed by a nested-PCR amplification using GB14 (sense: 5′-ATCGGCTACGTTCTGTATGGTGTC-3′) and AP3 (antisense: 5′-GCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′, made on the basis of the Marathon cDNA adaptor sequence (CLONTECH)). The specific oligonucleotide primers used for primary RACE-PCR of the 5′ end of the mTrp6 cDNA were GB47 (antisense: 5′-ATTGCCTCCACAATCCGTACATAACC-3′) and AP1 followed by a nested-PCR amplification using GB46 (antisense: 5′-AAAGCATCCCCAACTCGAGACAGG-3′) and AP3 or using GB57 (antisense: 5′-TCGGGCTCTGGCTCATGGCACAGT-3′) and AP3. All cDNA sequences were obtained from double-stranded DNA templates using the dideoxynucleotide termination method with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The sequences of both strands were confirmed by isolating overlapping partial cDNAs made directly from mouse brain total RNA by RT-PCR with multiple sets of specific primers derived from the mTrp6 sequence. The resulting cDNA was 3261 nt long, had an open reading frame of 930 codons preceded by 290 nt of 5′-untranslated sequence, terminated by a TAG stop codon and followed by 180 nt of 3′-untranslated sequence. The cDNA has an in-frame TGA stop codon at nt −69 (A of initiator ATG = nt 1). The nucleotide sequence of mTrp6 has been deposited into the GenBank data base with accession number U49069. Using PCR-based approaches we introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) after amino acid 930 at the C terminus of mTrp6. The untagged mTrp6 cDNA, a SpeI(nt −191)/end(nt 3261) fragment and the epitope-tagged mTrp6(HA) cDNA, aSpeI(nt −191)/end(nt 3083 + HA epitope) fragment were subcloned into pcDNA3 Invitrogen, to give pcDNA3-mTrp6 and pcDNA3-mTrp6(HA) plasmids.

Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was prehybridized for 3 h at 65 °C in 500 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% sodium lauryl sulfate, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA and then hybridized in the same buffer with 107 cpm/ml32P-labeled probe for 16 h at 65 °C (42Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). The filter was washed twice with 1.0 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and twice with 0.2 × SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. The probe was made from the 2.1-kilobasePflMI fragment of the mTrp6 cDNA labeled by random prime labeling with [α-32P]dCTP. COS.M6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine shock method (38Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) as described (32Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were plated onto 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 1.50 to 1.75 × 105 cells/well. 20–24 h after plating, the cells were overlaid with 200 μl of transfection mixture containing 200 ng of M5 muscarinic receptor cDNA (pcDNA3 with coding region of cDNA) and 600 ng of mTrp6 cDNA (or, for the control cells, mouse luteinizing hormone receptor cDNA). For immunoprecipitation, cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106cells/10-cm dish 20–24 h before being transfected with 800 μl of mixture containing 3.2 μg of mTrp6(HA) cDNA or mouse luteinizing hormone receptor cDNA. The transfection efficiency was between 35 and 50% as measured by the β-galactosidase assay (43MacGregor G.R. Mogg A.E. Burke J.K. Caskey C.T. Som. Cell Mol. Gen. 1987; 13: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or by the proportion of cells that have a CCh-induced Ca2+release. HEK-t6 cell lines expressing mTrp6 in stable form were obtained by transfecting HEK 293 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) with 10 μg of pcDNA3-Trp6(HA) using the calcium phosphate/glycerol shock method of Ref. 44Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar. The day after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Serial dilution (1:2) of the cells were transferred into 96-well plates, and G418-resistant cell clones, referred as HEK-t6 clones, were picked after 20 days, expanded, and frozen. Expression of Trp6(HA) protein in HEK-t6 cells was confirmed by the presence, in N-glycosidase F-treated cell extracts of metabolically labeled cells, of an immunoprecitable protein with apparent M r of about 100,000, that was absent in untransfected HEK cells or in HEK cells stably expressing other proteins (not shown). HEK cells stably expressing the human V1a vasopressin receptor, transfected and cloned by the same procedure as described for preparation of mTrp6-expressing HEK cells were a gift from Drs. Hamid Sadeghi and Mariel Birnbaumer. The method used to measure [Ca2+] i was described previously (32Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after transfection, cells attached to coverslips were washed twice with HPSS (120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)) and loaded with fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes, 5 μm in HPSS) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing and incubating in fresh HPSS for 30 min at room temperature to achieve de-esterification, the coverslips were inserted into a circular open-bottom chamber and placed onto the stage of a Zeiss Axovert microscope fitted with an Attofluor Digital Imaging and Photometry System (Attofluor Inc., Rockville, MD). 20–30 isolated fura 2-loaded cells were selected and [Ca2+] i in these cells was measured by fluorescence videomicroscopy at room temperature using alternating excitation wavelengths of 334 and 380 nm and monitoring emitted fluorescence at 520 nm. Free [Ca2+] i was calculated from 334/380 fluorescence ratios following the method of Ref. 45Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. All reagents were diluted to their final concentrations in HPSS and applied to the cells by surface perfusion. The duration of exposure to each reagent mixture is indicated by the horizontal lines above the graphs depicting the changes in [Ca2+] i as a function of time. The system allows data acquisition from up to 99 user-defined variably sized regions of interest per field of view. Data from 8 to 15 cells per coverslip that have a CCh-induced Ca2+ release were collected per experiment and experiments were repeated to give the total number of cells shown on the figures. Ensemble averages were calculated after transfer into Microsoft Excel 5.0. Data acquisition was typically at 3.2-s intervals and lasted for 400–900 s. Cells (2 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm Petri dishes as described for transfection as described above. After 40 h, the proteins were labeled and immunoprecipitated as described in Ref. 46Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly, after a starvation period of 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN), the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 2 ml of the same medium containing 50 μCi of35S-Express Protein Labeling Mix (NEN Life Science Products)/ml followed by a chase period of 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum albumin. The cells were washed twice and scraped from the plate in the presence of 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2/MgCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was homogenized (47Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

The homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min and homogenized a second time and then centrifuged for 30 min at 18,500 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant were clarified by an incubation of 30 min with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of prewashed protein A-Sepharose in RIPA buffer. Prewashed protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was prepared by treatment for 1 h with 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in RIPA buffer followed by two washes with RIPA buffer alone. After a centrifugation of 5 min, 5 μl of crude ascites (containing the monoclonal antibody 12CA5) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with shaking. The antigen-antibody complexes were separated from the mixture by incubating with prewashed Protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and washed four times with RIPA buffer at room temperature and recovered each time by centrifugation. The proteins were eluted by incubation with 50 μl of RIPA buffer containing 100 μm HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature. The crude ascites was prepared following methods described by Ref. 48Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies; A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar using 12CA5 hybridoma cells. The eluates, containing mTrp6(HA), were treated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals) or endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 10 μl and the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 20% β-mercatoethanol). The proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by exposure of the dried gels to Kodak BioMax film. Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were voltage-clamped using the perforated patch-clamp technique using nystatin (49Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The pipette solution was composed of the following (in mm): KOH 130, KCl 10, CaCl2 0.5, MgCl2 2.0, EGTA 5.0, Na-HEPES 5.0 (pH 7.2) with methanesulfonic acid (∼280 mosm). Nystatin was diluted to a final concentration of 25–50 μm from a 50 mg/ml stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. All patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The bath solution was (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 5.0, CaCl21.8, MgCl2 1.0, glucose 10, HEPES 15 (pH 7.4) (∼305 mosm). Carbachol (CCh) was diluted into the bath solution from a stock solution dissolved in water. Voltage ramps were given from −80 mV to +40 mV over 250 ms. Ramps were given once every 2.5 s and the membrane was held at −60 mV in the duration between. The data were digitally sampled 2 kHz and filtered at 400 Hz. Reversal potentials of evoked currents were evaluated by subtracting currents recorded during voltage ramps obtained under control conditions from currents measured after bath application of 100 μm CCh. An average made from 6 to 11 consecutive ramps in both conditions was used to obtain the subtracted current-voltage relationship. To identify new members of the Trp family, we used a PCR-based strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2033104365,"α-Crystallin, the major protein in the mammalian lens, is a molecular chaperone that can bind denaturing proteins and prevent their aggregation. Like other structurally related small heat shock proteins, each α-crystallin molecule is composed of an average of 40 subunits that can undergo extensive reorganization. In this study we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the rapid exchange of recombinant α-crystallin subunits. We labeled αA-crystallin with stilbene iodoacetamide (4-acetamido-4′-((iodoacetyl)amino)stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid), which serves as an energy donor and with lucifer yellow iodoacetamide, which serves as an energy acceptor. Upon mixing the two populations of labeled αA-crystallin, we observed a reversible, time-dependent decrease in stilbene iodoacetamide emission intensity and a concomitant increase in lucifer yellow iodoacetamide fluorescence. This result is indicative of an exchange reaction that brings the fluorescent αA-crystallin subunits close to each other. We further showed that the exchange reaction is strongly dependent on temperature, with a rate constant of 0.075 min−1 at 37 °C and an activation energy of 60 kcal/mol. The subunit exchange is independent of pH and calcium concentration but decreases at low and high ionic strength, suggesting the involvement of both ionic and hydrophobic interactions. It is also markedly reduced by the binding of large denatured proteins. The degree of inhibition is directly proportional to the molecular mass and the amount of bound polypeptide, suggesting an interaction of several αA-crystallin subunits with multiple binding sites of the denaturing protein. Our findings reveal a dynamic organization of αA-crystallin subunits, which may be a key factor in preventing protein aggregation during denaturation. α-Crystallin, the major protein in the mammalian lens, is a molecular chaperone that can bind denaturing proteins and prevent their aggregation.

Our findings reveal a dynamic organization of αA-crystallin subunits, which may be a key factor in preventing protein aggregation during denaturation. α-Crystallin, the major lens protein of the mammalian eye, is a member of the small heat shock protein family (1Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 2Nene V. Dunne D.W. Johnson K.S. Taylor D.W. Cordinley J.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Like other small heat shock proteins, α-crystallin is a high molecular mass complex consisting of a large number of subunits. The two polypeptides of α-crystallin found in the lens of the mammalian eye, αA and αB, are encoded by evolutionarily related genes and share more than 50% identity in amino acid sequence (3$$Google Scholar, 4Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). For many years, α-crystallin was thought to be lens-specific. However, recent advances in detection methods have revealed much wider non-lenticular tissue distributions in heart, thymus, skin, lung, retina, and brain (5Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys.

In the past, α-crystallin was considered to play only a structural role in maintaining the transparency of the lens. Recent studies have demonstrated that α-crystallin can prevent the thermally induced aggregation of a diversity of denaturing proteins (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings suggest that α-crystallin possesses chaperone-like property that prevents aggregation of denatured lens proteins, thus preserving the transparency of the lens and reducing the probability of developing cataract (15Rao P.V. Huang Q.-L. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Its protective function is further supported by the detection of an elevated amount of αB-crystallin under heat and hypertonic stress (16Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc.

However, the exact physiological role of α-crystallin in these diseases is still unclear. α-Crystallin is normally isolated as an oligomeric complex with an average of 40 subunits and a molecular mass of 8 × 105 Da (3$$Google Scholar). However, its size distribution can vary from 3 × 105 to 1.5 × 108 Da, depending on the age of the tissue from which it is isolated (24Spector A. Freund T. Li L.-L. Augusteyn R.C. Investig.

Visual Sci. 1972; 11: 905-915Google Scholar). Moreover, calf lens α-crystallin that was separated into five subpopulations with distinct molecular masses has been shown to rapidly return to its original distribution upon mixing (34Siezen R.J. Owen E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 749: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Exchange of subunits between native and phosphorylated forms of α-crystallin has also been detected by isoelectric focussing (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the subunits of α-crystallin are capable of freely associating and dissociating to form large multimeric protein complexes. In this study we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer method to monitor the exchange of recombinant αA-crystallin subunits. Using this technique, we have determined the effect of pH, Ca2+, and ionic strength on the rate of subunit exchange. We further found a strong dependence of subunit exchange on temperature, with an activation energy of 60 kcal/mol. Binding of large denatured proteins to αA-crystallin markedly reduced the exchange rate, indicating an association of the polypeptides with several αA-crystallin subunits. The multiple interactions may explain why the binding of denatured proteins to αA-crystallin is irreversible.

Ovotransferrin, α-lactalbumin, insulin, and melittin were obtained from Sigma. They were used in the experiments without further purification.

Bhat, Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA. cDNA of aα-crystallin was obtained from the rat lens epithelial λgt-11 cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction amplification using sense primer 5′-TCACCATCCAGCACCCTTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCAGGACGAGGGTGCCGAG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction reaction was carried out in a 25-μl volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTP, 1.0 μm primers, 1 μl of cDNA library, and 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase. Amplification was performed for 35 cycles with conditions for denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 54 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The 525-base-long polymerase chain reaction product was gel-purified, ligated into pT7 blue vector, and subsequently subcloned into the pET 20b+ expression vector. This construct introduced a conservative substitution of Val-3 → Phe near the amino terminus. Comparison of the DNA sequence of our construct with that of the published rat sequence (36Bhat S.P.

Both errors were subsequently corrected by mutagenesis. BL21DE3 cells containing the pET 20b+αA-crystallin plasmids were grown in 500 ml of LB broth to a cell density between 0.6 and 1.0 A at 600 nm and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA and lysed by sonication. The cell particulates were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, followed by filtration through a 0.2 μm filter. Polyethyleneimine was then added to the filtrate with rapid stirring to form a 0.12% solution. After incubation on ice for 2 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to remove the precipitated DNA. The supernatant was adjusted with DTT to a final concentration of 10 mm and applied onto a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing recombinant αA-crystallin were concentrated and applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9. Fractions containing purified αA-crystallin were pooled, concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and stored frozen at −20 °C. Recombinant αA-crystallin (20 mg/ml) was diluted to 1 mg/ml with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmMOPS, pH 7.9. Solid AIAS was then added to a final concentration of 3.2 mm, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 12 h at room temperature (22 °C) in the dark. Unreacted AIAS was separated from the fluorescently labeled αA-crystallin on a G-25 Sephadex desalting column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). αA-Crystallin was covalently labeled with LYI at a final concentration 8.4 mm under the same conditions, except that the reaction was extended for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence energy transfer was employed to determine the rate of subunit exchange. The exchange reaction was initiated by mixing an equal volume of 0.4 mg/ml AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin and 0.4 mg/ml LYI-labeled αA-crystallin at 37 °C in buffer A. At time 0, 10, 25, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and diluted 100 × with the same buffer. The emission spectrum of the sample excited at 335 nm was recorded using an Perkin-Elmer LS-5 spectrofluorometer, and the intensity at 415 nm was determined. The rate of subunit exchange was calculated from the equationF(t) = C 1 +C 2 e −kt , whereF(t) is the fluorescence intensity at 415 nm andk is the rate constant of subunit exchange. The constants,C 1 and C 2 were determined using the conditions where C 1 +C 2 = 1 at time 0 and C 1is fluorescence intensity at time ∞. The rate constant was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the data using the Biomedical Statistical Package program. The effect of pH on subunit exchange was determined using the same procedure, except that the measurements were carried out either in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.0, or in 50 mmsodium borate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 9.2. To determine the effect of ionic strength or Ca2+, the αA-crystallin solution was exhaustively dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, and adjusted with 2 m NaCl or 1 m CaCl2solution to the ion concentration as indicated in the figure legends. The fluorescence intensity of the sample was determined immediately and at 15 min after mixing an equal volume of 0.4 mg/ml AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin and 0.4 mg/ml LYI-labeled αA-crystallin at 37 °C. The rate of subunit exchange in these experiments is defined as the change in relative fluorescence intensity at 415 nm in 15 min. The effect of bound polypeptides on subunit exchange were determined with four different proteins that are known to bind tightly to α-crystallin under denaturing conditions. The binding was performed by incubating different concentrations of protein with either 0.4 mg/ml AIAS-labeled or LYI-labeled αA-crystallin. The denaturing conditions were as follows: melittin, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 30 min (37Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); insulin, 20 mm DTT, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at room temperature for 60 min (36Bhat S.P. Nandy P. Srinivasan A. Cheng D. Sitay A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); α-lactalbumin, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 90 min; ovotransferrin, 20 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, at 42 °C for 90 min. After binding, equal amounts of AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin containing the bound polypeptide were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the relative fluorescence intensity of the preparation was determined as described in the previous section. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Blue binding (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins was performed by the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The concentrations of LYI and AIAS were determined from their absorption spectra using molar extinction coefficients of 13,000 cm−1m−1at 435 nm and 35,000 cm−1m−1 at 335 nm, respectively. αA-Crystallin cDNA was constructed in vector pET 20b+ carrying a strong bacteriophage T7 promotor. The resulting expression construct was used to transform E. coli BL21DE3 cells containing a chromosomal copy of the inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene. The level of expression of αA-crystallin in this system was greater than 50% that of the total proteins. When the cell lysate was separated into soluble and particulate fractions by centrifugation, more than 90% of the recombinant αA-crystallin was found in the soluble fraction (data not shown). The high expression level of αA-crystallin in the soluble fraction allowed purification of the recombinant protein to greater than 95% purity by successive Mono-Q ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Purified recombinant αA-crystallin and native lens αA-crystallin were equally effective in preventing the thermally-induced aggregation of proteins. Their conformations, as determined by circular dichroism, were identical (data not shown). They also interacted to form a multimeric subunit complex of 800 kDa, which is similar in size to native α-crystallin isolated from lens. Recombinant αA-crystallin contains a single cysteine residue at position 131 that can be used to attach a sulfhydryl-specific fluorophore. Fig. 1shows the absorption spectra of AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin (upper panel) and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin (lower panel) obtained by the method given under “Experimental Procedures.” Calculations based on the molar extinction coefficent at 335 nm for AIAS and 435 nm for LYI revealed an average of 1 mol of fluorophore/mol of αA-crystallin subunit, suggesting the covalent attachment of the fluorophore to a single site at Cys-131. The modification of Cys-131 did not appear to perturb the conformation or the interaction of the αA-crystallin subunits. Fig.2 shows a comparison of the gel filtration profiles between unlabeled αA-crystallin and AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin. Their average molecular masses were both 800 kDa, and their size distribution ranged from 300 to 1,000 kDa. Similar size distribution was obtained with LYI-labeled αA-crystallin. The emission spectra of AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin excited at 335 nm (upper panel), and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin excited at 435 nm (lower panel) are shown in Fig. 1. The emission maxima of AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin were at 415 and 525 nm, respectively. The significant overlap of the emission spectrum of the AIAS fluorophore with the absorption band of the LYI fluorophore indicates that they are an excellent donor-acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Both AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin were very stable at 37 °C, with no significant change in fluorescence intensity over a period of 12 h. If the oligomeric complex of αA-crystallin is static and subunit exchange does not occur after mixing the two populations of labeled αA-crystallin, the fluorescence intensity will remain the same, since the donor and the acceptor are far apart. However, the fluorescence intensity was markedly altered upon mixing of the two populations of labeled αA-crystallin (Fig.3). The time-dependent decrease in AIAS emission intensity at 415 nm and a concomitant increase in LYI fluorescence at 525 nm were indicative of energy transfer due to the close proximity of the two fluorophores. The quenching of the fluorescence was completed in 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 4), resulting in approximately 40% decrease of the original AIAS fluorescence intensity.Figure 4Time-dependent changes in emission intensity due to subunit exchange. Upper panel, decrease in relative fluorescence intensity at 415 nm as a function of time after mixing an equal amount of AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin. Lower panel, increase in relative fluorescence intensity at 545 nm due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer from AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin to LYI-labeled αA-crystallin. The curves represent the best statistical fit of the data to the exponential function F(t) = C 1 +C 2 e −kt . The rate constants determined by curve fitting were 0.075 min−1 for data shown in the upper panel and 0.069 min−1 for data shown in the lower panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate of subunit exchange can be obtained by measuring either the decrease in donor fluorescence or the increase in acceptor fluorescence. The upper panel of Fig. 4 shows a plot of the emission intensity of AIAS at 415 nm as a function of time after the mixing of the two populations of labeled αA-crystallin. An exchange rate constant of 0.075 min−1 was obtained by fitting the data to the exponential function F(t) =C 1 +C 2 e −kt . The same exchange rate was determined by measuring the increase in LYI fluorescence intensity at 545 nm (lower panel). Since both measurements gave essentially the same rate constant, all subsequent measurements were obtained by monitoring only the quenching of the AIAS fluorescence. Fig.5 shows that the AIAS fluorescence at 415 nm rapidly recovered upon the addition of unlabeled αA-crystallin to a pre-mixed population of AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin at 37 °C. This result demonstrates that the subunit exchange reaction is reversible. The effect of pH on the subunit exchange of αA-crystallin at 37 °C is shown in Fig.6. For this experiment, the rate of subunit exchange was determined by the change in relative fluorescence intensity in 15 min after mixing an equal amount of AIAS-labeled αA-crystallin and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin. Except for a small decrease in the relative fluorescence intensity at pH 6.5, the subunit exchange rate at pH 7.5, 8.0, and 9.2 were the same. Calcium ions have been shown previously to change the subunit organization of α-crystallin (33Jedziniak J.A. Kinoshita J.H. Yates E.M. Hocker L.O. Benedek G.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1972; 11: 905-915Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that calcium chloride concentration in the range of 0–50 mm had no effect on subunit exchange. The effect of NaCl on the subunit exchange of αA-crystallin is more complex (Fig. 8). Increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.1 m resulted in an increase in subunit exchange, as indicated by a decrease in relative fluorescence intensity at 15 min. However, at 1.0 m NaCl, a small decrease of the exchange rate was observed. These results suggest that the multimeric subunit organization of αA-crystallin may be stabilized by both ionic interaction and hydrophobic interactions. The rate of subunit exchange was highly temperature-dependent. The AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin exchanged at a rate 4.2-fold higher at 42 °C than at 37 °C (Fig. 9, upper panel), and the exchange took only 21 min to complete. In contrast, when the temperature was reduced to 3 °C, subunit exchange was not detectable over a period of 6 h. Fig. 9 (lower panel) shows the Arrhenius plot of the subunit exchange reaction. The activation energy for subunit exchange, as determined from the slope of the plot of ln(k)versus 1/T in degrees K was 60 kcal/mol. αA-Crystallin has been shown to bind irreversibly to a number of denatured proteins and prevent their aggregation (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 10Horwitz J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 10-22PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jakob U.

What is the effect of bound polypeptide on the rate of subunit exchange? To answer this important question, AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin were incubated separately with different amounts of proteins under denaturing conditions. After binding, the rate of subunit exchange was determined, and the changes in exchange rate were then plotted as a function of the protein concentration during denaturation. Fig.10 shows a comparison of the exchange rate of αA-crystallin containing either bound melittin, insulin B chain, α-lactalbumin, or ovotransferrin. Binding of short polypeptides such as melittin (2.6 kDa) and insulin B chain (3.0 kDa) to αA-crystallin either did not alter the exchange rate or had only a small effect at high concentrations. In contrast, binding of a large polypeptide such as ovotransferrin (40 kDa) markedly reduced the rate of subunit exchange. The degree of inhibition is proportional to the amount of bound ovotransferrin, with a 35% decrease in exchange rate at a 2:1 molar ratio of αA-crystallin subunit to ovotransferrin. There is also a close correlation between the size of the bound polypeptide and the inhibition of subunit exchange. Bound α-lactalbumin (14 kDa) was found to be more effective than insulin but less effective than ovotransferrin in inhibiting subunit exchange. These results suggest the association of larger polypeptides with several αA-crystallin subunits, effectively cross-linking them together and preventing them from exchanging. In this study we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (40Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 347-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 41Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar) to monitor the rapid exchange of αA-crystallin subunits. We demonstrated that the exchange can be fit to a simple exponential function with a rate constant of 0.075 min−1 at 37 °C and reached a complete equilibrium within 4 h (Fig. 4). Our results are similar but not identical to those of van den Oetelaaret al. (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), who measured the mixing of isolated bovine αA- and αB-crystallins by isoelectric focussing (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this earlier study, a prolonged exchange reaction between αA- and αB-crystallins that did not completely terminate until after 24 h was observed. This difference can be accounted for by a number of contributing factors. First, the exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin subunits may be intrinsically slower, a hypothesis that we are currently investigating. Second, the α-crystallin preparations may be crucial to the subunit exchange measurement. The native bovine αA-crystallin used in the earlier study of van den Oetelaar et al. (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was prepared in urea, which may change the conformation of αA-crystallin. In addition, post-translational modifications or binding of pre-existing proteins may significantly slow down subunit exchange. Similarly, the exchange rate could be accelerated in our AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled αA-crystallin by the modification of the cysteine residue. Finally, the assay conditions may also have an effect on the kinetics of the exchange reaction. For example, we have found that the rate of subunit exchange is noticeably slower (Fig. 8) under the lower ionic strength conditions used in earlier experiments (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Of all the biochemical parameters we have examined, temperature has the most pronounced effect on subunit exchange of αA-crystallin. The exchange rate increased markedly upon increasing the temperature from 37 to 42 °C (Fig. 9). This result is important in light of the potential roles of α-crystallin in transcriptional regulation. Although α-crystallin does not have a definitive nuclear localization sequence, it has been shown to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of NIH 3T3 cells under heat shock conditions (16Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin has also been found to bind specifically downstream of the transcription initiation site on the γ-crystallin promoter (42Pietrowski D. Durante M.J. Liebstein A. Schmitt-John T. Werner T. Graw J. Gene. 1994; 144: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). How does α-crystallin, which has an average molecular mass of 800 kDa, cross the nuclear membrane with an exclusion limit of approximately 70 kDa (43Miller M. Park M.K. Hanover J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 909-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Paine P.L. Moore L.C. Horowitz S. Nature. 1975; 254: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar)? We propose that the dissociation of α-crystallin into smaller subunits at high temperatures may explain its entry into the nucleus. Under normal physiological condition, subunit dissociation is largely prevented by the high activation energy barrier of 60 kcal/mol for the subunit exchange reaction, which would explain why nuclear localization is predominantly observed only at higher temperatures (16Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The interaction of αA-crystallin subunits most likely involves both ionic and hydrophobic interactions, since we have observed a decrease in the exchange rate under either very low salt or very high salt conditions. The effect of ionic strength on subunit exchange was not detected previously by isoelectric focussing (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The negative result can be readily explained by the fact that these earlier experiments were all performed at low salt conditions to produce sharply focused protein bands. As a result, only a relatively narrow range of salt concentrations has been tested, which falls outside the region where the ionic interaction becomes significant. Surprisingly, although changes in pH have been implicated to have a considerable effect on the subunit organization of α-crystallin (30Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licino P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,31Siezen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we have found that the exchange rate is constant at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 9.2 (Fig. 7). Our result is in agreement with van den Oetelaar et al. (35van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), who also showed that subunit exchange is independent of pH. Ca2+ is another biochemical parameter that we thought would have an influence on subunit exchange, since previous studies have reported the detection of large light scattering aggregates of α-crystallin when bovine lens is incubated in solution containing 4–8 mm Ca2+ (33Jedziniak J.A. Kinoshita J.H. Yates E.M. Hocker L.O. Benedek G.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1972; 11: 905-915Google Scholar, 45Spector A. Rothschild C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1973; 12: 225-231Google Scholar). Instead, we found that the exchange rate is independent of Ca2+ at concentrations as high as 50 mm (Fig. 7). It is not clear why α-crystallin in the lens is more susceptible to Ca2+-induced aggregation. One possible explanation is a change in subunit-subunit interaction due to post-translational modifications as the lens ages (46Spector A. Adams D. Krul K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1974; 13: 982-990Google Scholar, 47Fein M. Pande A. Spector A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1979; 18: 761-765PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that is absent with recombinant αA-crystallin. Which region of the αA-crystallin molecule is involved in subunit exchange? Although several mutational analyses of α-crystallin have been reported, very little is known about the contact sites between its subunits (48Merck K.B. De Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 49Bova M.P. Fung B.K-K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 38: 251Google Scholar). Based on the high activation energy of 60 kcal/mol relative to other exchange reactions (50Parker K.C. Strominger J.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we speculate that the subunit-subunit interactions may involve multiple binding sites. Recently, a stretch of 35 amino acid residues of Hsp42 has been implicated in subunit-subunit interaction (51Wotton D. Freeman K. Shore D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2717-2723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of αA-crystallin to that of Hsp42 suggests residues 112–147 may be involved in the same function. Site-directed mutagenesis of αA-crystallin is currently under way to answer this question. α-Crystallin has been shown to possess chaperone-like property that prevents protein aggregation during denaturation (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 10Horwitz J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 10-22PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jakob U.

Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that subunit exchange is not significantly affected by the binding of small polypeptides such as melittin or insulin B chain. In contrast, when α-lactalbumin or ovotransferrin bind to αA-crystallin, the subunit exchange rate is markedly reduced. This result implicates an association of larger polypeptides with several αA-crystallin subunits, effectively cross-linking them together and preventing them from dissociating. The multiple interactions may explain why the binding of denatured proteins to αA-crystallin is so strong and irreversible (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 52Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of chaperone-like activity is still not clear, it is tempting to speculate that α-crystallin most likely recognizes certain structures that are transiently exposed during unfolding of the protein. The domains for binding denatured protein and for subunit-subunit interaction are distinct, since α-crystallin containing bound proteins retains its multimeric subunit organization (37Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 52Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, α-crystallin is known to bind insulin B chain at room temperature (37Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), under which subunit exchange is largely inhibited (Fig. 9). If protein binding and subunit-subunit contact sites are located in a different part of the α-crystallin molecule, is there a relationship between subunit exchange and chaperone function? It is tempting to speculate that the rearrangement of α-crystallin subunits is essential for covering the unfolded polypeptides, thus shielding them from aggregation. This hypothesis would explain why the subunit exchange reaction (Fig. 9) and chaperone-like activity are markedly enhanced at high temperature (53Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Small heat shock proteins have been shown to protect cells from stress (54Mehlen P. Briolay J. Smith L. Diaz-Latoud C. Fabre N. Pauli D. Arrigo A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 55Arrigo A.-P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell.

Their ubiquitous tissue distribution, overexpression in a number of pathological states, and stress-induced cellular redistribution argue for their importance in safeguarding many important cellular processes. A hallmark of small heat shock proteins like α-crystallin is the large multimeric subunit organization (58Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J.

Sur2p is required for the hydroxylation of C-4 of the sphingoid moiety of ceramide, and Scs7p is required for the hydroxylation of the very long chain fatty acid. Neither SCS7 nor SUR2 are essential for growth, and lack of the Scs7p- or Sur2p-dependent hydroxylation does not prevent the synthesis of mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide, the mature sphingolipid found in yeast. Deletion of either gene suppresses the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype ofcsg2Δ mutants, which arises from overaccumulation of inositolphosphorylceramide due to a defect in sphingolipid mannosylation.

Characterization of scs7 andsur2 mutants is expected to provide insight into the function of ceramide hydroxylation. Sphingolipids, essential components of eukaryotic plasma membranes, consist of a hydrophilic head attached to a ceramide. Ceramides contain a fatty acid attached to a sphingoid base through an amide linkage (Fig. 1). They can be classified according to their level of hydroxylation (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar); both the sphingoid and the fatty acid moieties are found with different levels of hydroxylation (Fig. 1). In mammals, the sphingoid moiety is mostly sphingosine, which is desaturated at C-4,5; however, some is phytosphingosine that is hydroxylated at C-4, or dihydrosphingosine, which is neither desaturated at C-4,5 nor hydroxylated at C-4 (2Karlsonn K.-A. Steen G.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aeberson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the C-4 is mostly hydroxylated (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid that is attached to the sphingoid base is either un-, mono-, or dihydroxylated (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the first hydroxylation of the fatty acid moiety occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the second hydroxylation is in the Golgi apparatus (4Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and requires Cu2+ and the Golgi copper transporter encoded by CCC2 (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the different hydroxylation states is not known. Hydroxylation of ceramide and sphingolipids may alter their cellular location, their effect on the physical properties of membranes, and their interaction with proteins either as a substrate or regulator. Identification of the genes and proteins required for the hydroxylation reactions will facilitate the investigation of the function of the hydroxyl groups. The S. cerevisiae protein Scs7p is required for the first hydroxylation of the ceramide fatty acid moiety (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme belongs to a family of desaturase/hydroxylase enzymes that contain an oxo-diiron domain (Fe-O-Fe) (7Fox B. Shanklin J. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12776-12786Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 8Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This domain consists of four transmembrane segments. The loop between the second and third transmembrane segments has a histidine-containing motif (HX 3,4HX 8–31HX 2,3HH). Another histidine-rich motif (HX 2,3HH or HX 2,3HX 13–39HX 2,3HH) follows the fourth transmembrane segment. Sur2p also contains the oxo-diiron motif (9Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The SUR2 gene was initially identified in a screen for suppressors of rvs161 mutants (10Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rvs161p is required for endocytosis (11Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar), correct actin localization (12Revardel E. Bonneu M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and viability upon nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur starvation (13Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M. Yeast. 1991; 7: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is similar to amphiphysin, a neuronal protein found in synaptic vesicles that is the autoantigen in stiff-man syndrome (14David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The molecular function of Rvs161p and the basis of suppression by mutations in the SURgenes have not been identified. However, other SUR genes have been found to function in sphingolipid synthesis. SUR1is allelic to CSG1, a gene required for mannosylation of sphingolipids (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin CE J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The genetic relationship betweenSUR2, SUR1, and SUR4 suggests thatSUR2 may also be involved in sphingolipid synthesis. Based on the homology of Sur2p with Scs7p, required for hydroxylation of the fatty acid of sphingolipids (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and the genetic relationship between SUR2 and other sphingolipid synthesis genes, the possibility that SUR2 is required for hydroxylation of C-4 on the long chain base (LCB) found in sphingolipids was investigated. The yeast strains used in this study were TDY2037 (Matα lys2 ura3-52 trp1Δleu2Δ), TDY2038 (Matα lys2 ura3-52 trp1Δleu2Δ csg2::LEU2), 2037scs7Δ (Matα lys2 ura3-52 trp1Δ leu2Δscs7::LEU2), and 6715b (Matα lys2 ura3-52 trp1Δ leu2Δ csg2::LEU2 scs7::LEU2). SUR2 was disrupted in these strains as described below. Media were prepared, and cells were grown using standard procedures (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and sphingosine were purchased from Sigma and added to the growth medium at 25 μm in 1% Tergitol. In an unrelated study we isolated a YCp50-based plasmid containing a fragment of yeast DNA that included the amino terminus (through to a Sau3A site at codon 120) of the SUR2 gene. A restriction fragment extending from the HindIII site 367 base pairs upstream of the start codon of the SUR2 gene to the SaII site in YCp50 was subcloned from this plasmid into pUC19. The resulting plasmid was linearized at the PstI site in codon 9 of theSUR2 gene, treated with Bal-31 to remove about 100 base pairs, and incubated with dNTPs, Klenow fragment, ligase, andXhoI linkers. A candidate plasmid with a XhoI linker at the deletion junction that was missing about 50 base pairs from each side of the original PstI site was used to construct the disrupting plasmid. A SalI fragment carrying the TRP1 gene was ligated into the XhoI site, theSUR2-disrupting fragment was cut out of the pUC19 plasmid with PvuII and used in a one-step gene replacement (18Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). The disruption of SUR2 was confirmed using a polymerase chain reaction. Cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium containing 12 nm inositol and 1 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol for several generations (fromA 600 0.01 to A 600 1.0). Cells (about 5 A 600 units) were pelleted and washed with 4 mm sodium azide. Lipids were extracted into 600 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) by vortexing with glass beads, removing the CHCl3:MeOH to a fresh tube and washing the cell pellet and beads with 600 μl of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (10:10:3). The pooled extract was dried, alkali-treated, and BuOH-desalted as described previously (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates using CHCl3:MeOH:AcOH:H2O (16:6:4:1.6) as the developing solvent (4Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic medium at 26 °C, spun down, and washed once with H2O. The cells were vortexed with glass beads in hexane:EtOH (95:5) at 40 A 600/ml. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, the pellet and beads were washed with hexane:EtOH, and the pooled extract was dried. The lipids from 60 A 600 units of cells were alkali-treated by suspending in 1 ml of EtOH:H2O:Et2O:pyridine (15:15:5:1) and adding KOH to 0.1 m followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h (21Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After neutralizing with 1 mAcOH, the sample was dried, BuOH-desalted (20Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dried again. Ceramides were analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates using CHCl3:MeOH:AcOH (95:4.5:0.5) as the developing solvent (22Imokawa G. Abe A. Jin K. Higaki Y. Kawashima Hidano A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Plates were sprayed with 10% copper sulfate in 8% orthophosphoric acid and heated for 20 min at 180 °C to char the ceramides (22Imokawa G. Abe A. Jin K. Higaki Y. Kawashima Hidano A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The arsenite and borate treated silica gel plates were supplied by Analtech (Newark, DE). Ceramides were purified and separated by TLC as described above. The ceramides were visualized by ultraviolet light after spraying the plates with 0.01% 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid. The silica gel was scraped off the plate, and the ceramides were eluted by repeated sonication (five times for 10 min each) in 2 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Sphingolipids were extracted from 600A 600 units of cells by vortexing with glass beads in 100 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The extract was dried, alkali-treated, and BuOH-desalted as described previously (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was spotted in a line on a silica gel plate and developed using CHCl3:MeOH:AcOH (95:4.5:0.5). In this system, fatty acids and ceramides migrate while sphingolipids remain at the origin. The material left at the origin was subjected to acid methanolysis for analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and LCBs as described below. Ceramides and sphingolipids were purified by silica gel TLC as described above. The purified ceramides or sphingolipids were subjected to acid methanolysis by resuspending in 2 ml of HCl:MeOH:H2O (3:29:4) and incubating at 78 °C for 18 h (23Bertello L.E. Goncalvez M.F. Colli W. de Lederkremer R.M. Biochem J. 1995; 310: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The FAMEs were recovered by extracting 3 times with 2 ml of hexane (24Hung C.-Y. Ko Y.-G. Thompson G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The extracts were pooled, dried, and subjected to TLC using petroleum ether:Et2O (17:3) as the developing solvent (24Hung C.-Y. Ko Y.-G. Thompson G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Plates were sprayed with 10% copper sulfate in 8% orthophosphoric acid and heated for 20 min at 180 °C to char the FAMEs. The LCBs were recovered from the hydrolyzed ceramides or sphingolipids by adjusting the pH of the acid hydrolysate (after extraction of FAMEs) to 11.5 using 1 m NaOH and extracting three times with 2 ml of Et2O (24Hung C.-Y. Ko Y.-G. Thompson G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The pooled extracts were dried, and the LCBs were separated by silica gel TLC using CHCl3, MeOH, 2.5m NH4OH (40:10:1) as developing solvent (24Hung C.-Y. Ko Y.-G. Thompson G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Plates were sprayed with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and incubated at 100 °C for 5–10 min to visualize the amine-containing LCBs. The main purpose of this study was to determine if SUR2encodes the enzyme that hydroxylates C-4 of the sphingoid moiety of sphingolipids. The sur2Δ mutant was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sphingolipid synthesis in a sur2Δ mutant was compared with that of wild-type. Cells were grown for several generations in synthetic minimal medium containing 12 nm inositol with 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. [3H]Inositol was incorporated into phosphatidylinositol, inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC), mannosylinositolphosphorylceramide (MIPC) and mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C). These lipids were extracted out of the cell, alkali-treated to remove phosphatidylinositol, and separated by TLC (Fig.2). The sphingolipid composition of thesur2Δ mutant cells differs from that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2, lane 1 and 3). The predominant sphingolipid in wild-type cells is MIPC-C (lane 1,MC) along with its precursor IPC-C (C). IPC-D (D) containing dihydroxyl fatty acid is also observed (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). The major sphingolipids in sur2Δ mutants (lane 3) differ from those of wild-type cells. These sphingolipids are named MIPC-A and MIPC-B′ (lane 3, MA andMB′) for reasons discussed below. Sphingolipid synthesis in a sur2Δcsg2Δ double mutant (lane 6) was compared with that in acsg2Δ mutant (lane 2). The csg2Δ mutants are defective in mannosylation of inositolphosphorylceramide (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), therefore the sphingolipids in a csg2Δ mutant are IPC-C and IPC-D (lane 2, C and D). Thesur2Δcsg2Δ double mutant accumulates two sphingolipid species IPC-A and IPC-B′ (lane 6, Aand B′) that are not found in wild-type cells. IPC-A and IPC-B′ are more hydrophobic than is IPC-C (lane 6). The two sphingolipids found in a sur2Δ single mutant, MIPC-A and MIPC-B′, (lane 3, MA and MB′) are the mannosylated forms of the sphingolipid species seen in asur2Δcsg2Δ double mutant, IPC-A and IPC-B′ (lane 6, A and B). The LCB species present in the inositolphosphorylceramides fromsur2Δcsg2Δ mutants (IPC-A and IPC-B′) was determined. Polar lipids were extracted and alkali-treated to hydrolyze the glycerol-based phospholipids, and the sphingolipids were isolated by preparative TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sphingolipids were subjected to acid methanolysis to hydrolyze both the phosphodiester bond between the inositol and the ceramide, and the amide bond between the sphingoid moiety and the VLCFA. The LCB was extracted and analyzed by TLC (Fig.3 A). The LCB in the sphingolipids from the sur2Δ mutant cells (lanes 3 and 5) is exclusively dihydrosphingosine, while the sphingolipids from cells with a wild-type SUR2 gene (lanes 1, 2, and 4) contain primarily phytosphingosine. The FAMEs released by methanolysis were also analyzed using a TLC system which resolves unhydroxylated very long chain fatty acid methyl esters (NVLCFAME) and hydroxylated very long chain fatty acid methyl esters (HVLCFAME). The sphingolipids fromsur2Δcsg2Δ mutant cells (lane 3) contain both hydroxylated and unhydroxylated fatty acids (Fig.3 B). Because sur2Δcsg2Δ mutant cells synthesize two sphingolipids, IPC-A and IPC-B′, these results indicate that IPC-A contains unhydroxylated fatty acids, whereas IPC-B′ contains hydroxylated fatty acids. The hydroxylation of the VLCFA is dependent on Scs7p (Fig.3 B). Cells lacking both Scs7p and Csg2p synthesize an IPC-B species (Fig. 2, lane 7) (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains mostly phytosphingosine as the LCB (Fig. 3 A, lane 4) and an unhydroxylated VLCFAME (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Like IPC-B′, IPC-B can be mannosylated if Csg2p is present (Fig. 2,lane 4, MB) (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a sur2Δscs7Δcsg2Δ triple mutant where hydroxylation of C-4 of the LCB is blocked by deletion ofSUR2, hydroxylation of the VLCFA is blocked by deletion ofSCS7, and mannosylation is blocked by deletion ofCSG2, the only sphingolipid synthesized is the very hydrophobic IPC-A (Fig. 2, lane 8, A). The IPC-A species can be mannosylated if Csg2p is present (Fig. 2, lane 5, MA). The sur2Δ mutants accumulate some IPC-A or MIPC-A even when Scs7p is present (Fig. 2, lanes 3and 6, MA and A) suggesting that phytosphingosine-containing substrates are preferred by Scs7p over dihydrosphingosine-containing substrates. These data (summarized in the model shown in Fig. 1) support the proposal that Sur2p is the hydroxylase that converts dihydroceramide to phytoceramide. S. cerevisiae cells can incorporate exogenous phytosphingosine into sphingolipids (25Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As would be predicted if Sur2p is required for hydroxylation of C-4 on the LCB, exogenous phytosphingosine, but not dihydrosphingosine, restores synthesis of IPC-C to a sur2Δcsg2Δ mutant (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and9). A sur2Δscs7Δcsg2Δ triple mutant, that normally makes IPC-A, makes IPC-B in the presence of phytosphingosine (data not shown). These observations provide further evidence that the altered sphingolipids that accumulate in thesur2Δcsg2Δ andsur2Δcsg2Δscs7Δ mutants (IPC-B′ and IPC-A, respectively) differ from the sphingolipids incsg2Δ and csg2Δscs7Δ mutants (IPC-C and IPC-B, respectively) in the LCB. Addition of phytosphingosine to the scs7Δcsg2Δ mutant does not result in any IPC-C synthesis (Fig. 4, lane 11), because the IPC-B that accumulates in the scs7Δ mutant arises from failure to hydroxylate the VLCFA (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The IPCs are synthesized by the transfer of phosphoinositol from phosphatidylinositol to ceramide. Comparison of ceramides isolated from the sur2Δcsg2Δ,scs7Δcsg2Δ and thesur2Δscs7Δcsg2Δ mutants with ceramides from wild-type or csg2Δ mutant cells demonstrates that the altered mobility of the sphingolipids arises from differences in the ceramide moiety of the sphingolipids. Yeast ceramides were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 5). The predominant ceramide in wild-type and in csg2Δ mutant cells (lanes 3 and 4), labeled “C” (for C-ceramide) because it is the ceramide of IPC-C, migrates slower in this TLC system than the bovine hydroxylated ceramide standard (Sigma type IV, lane 2) which consists of sphingosine and a hydroxylated fatty acid. Analysis of the LCB and VLCFA of the C-ceramide by TLC following methanolysis confirms that it contains phytosphingosine (Fig. 6 A,lanes 5 and 6) and a HVLCFA (Fig. 6 B,lanes 6 and 7) (1Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Saf R. Hummel K. Paltauf F. Daum G. Eur J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The slower mobility of yeast ceramide compared with hydroxylated bovine ceramides is expected, since it contains an additional hydroxyl group (phytosphingosineversus sphingosine).Figure 6The LCBs and the FAMEs from A-, B′-, B-, and C-ceramides were analyzed by silica gel TLC. Ceramides purified from 100 A 600 units of cells (see Fig. 5) were subjected to acid methanolysis, and FAMEs and LCBs were extracted for analysis as described in Fig. 3. A, the LCBs were separated by silica gel TLC. Standards were the LCB derived from acid methanolysis of 4 μg of Sigma type III bovine ceramide (lane 1) and 10 μg of sphingosine (S), dihydrosphingosine (DS), and phytosphingosine (PS). The LCBs were visualized by spraying with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and heating at 100 °C for 5–10 min. B, the FAMEs were also separated by TLC. Standards were the FAMEs derived from acid methanolysis of Sigma type III and type IV bovine ceramides (4 μg) (lanes 1 and2), and 10 μg of C18 FAME, C24 FAME, and hydroxylated C24 FAME (lanes 3–5). The plate was sprayed with 10% copper sulfate in 8% orthophosphoric acid and heated for 20 min at 180 °C to char the FAMEs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major ceramide from sur2Δ mutant cells (B′-ceramide) has a mobility similar to the hydroxylated bovine ceramide standard. Ceramides having dihydrosphingosine might be expected to have similar hydrophobicity to those having sphingosine. The LCB from the B′-ceramide is dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 6 A, lane 7) and the VLCFA is hydroxylated (Fig. 6 B, lane 8). The B-ceramide that accumulates in the scs7Δ mutant cells contains phytosphingosine (Fig. 6 A, lane 8) and unhydroxylated VLCFA (Fig. 6 B, lane 9). The mobility of the ceramide in scs7Δ mutant cells is quite distinct from that in sur2Δ mutant cells (Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 6). Either hydroxylation of the VLCFA increases the hydrophilicity of the ceramide less than does the hydroxylation of the LCB, or these species interact differently with the silica gel matrix. The A-ceramide that is present in thesur2Δscs7Δ double mutant (Fig. 5, lane 7) migrates with the unhydroxylated bovine ceramide standards as would be expected if it lacks hydroxyl groups on both C4 of the LCB and on the VLCFA (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 7). The LCB of the A-ceramide is dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 6 A, lane 9) and the VLCFA is unhydroxylated (Fig. 6 B, lane 10). The absence of vicinal hydroxyl groups (C-3 and C-4 of phytosphingosine) on ceramide from sur2Δ mutants is also indicated by the effect of the glycol-complexing ions arsenite and borate on the chromatographic behavior of the B′- and A-ceramides (Fig.7). The complex between vicinal hydroxyl groups with arsenite increases their mobility on silica gel, while the borate complex decreases their mobility (27Karlsson A.-A. Pascher I. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 466-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morris L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1963; 12: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mobility of C-ceramide (from wild-type and csg2Δ mutant cells) and B-ceramide (from csg2Δscs7Δ mutant cells) is greatly increased by addition of NaAsO2 to the silica gel (compare Fig. 7, B to A, lanes 1,2, and 4) and reduced by addition of Na2B4O7 (Fig. 7 C,lanes 1, 2, and 4), indicating that these ceramides contain the C-3,4 vicinal hydroxyl groups of phytoceramide. The mobility of the B′-ceramide (fromcsg2Δsur2Δ mutant cells) and A-ceramide (fromcsg2Δsur2Δscs7Δ mutant cells) is much less affected by arsenite or borate, consistent with the conclusion that they have dihydrosphingosine instead of phytosphingosine as the LCB. Cells lacking the CSG2 gene are defective in mannosylation of inositolphosphorylceramides and therefore accumulate the inositolphosphorylceramide, IPC-C (Fig. 2, lane 2) (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overaccumulation of IPC-C or a related metabolite confers Ca2+-sensitivity. Mutations in a variety of genes required for the synthesis of IPC-C suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of the csg2 mutants. For example, deletion of SCS7, which encodes the enzyme that hydroxylates the VLCFA suppresses the Ca2+ sensitivity of the csg2 mutant (Fig. 8) (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar,19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of deletion of SUR2 on the Ca2+ sensitivity of the csg2Δ mutant was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, deletion of the SUR2 gene reverses the Ca2+ sensitivity of a csg2mutant. The effect of deleting SUR2 on the hydroxylation of C-4 on the LCB of ceramide and sphingolipid and the sequence similarity between Sur2p and a family of desaturases/hydroxylases indicate that Sur2p catalyzes the hydroxylation of C-4. The LCB of ceramides and sphingolipids in sur2Δ mutants is dihydrosphingosine instead of the phytosphingosine predominantly found in wild-type cells. Exogenous phytosphingosine restores synthesis of sphingolipids with a phytosphingosine LCB in sur2Δ mutants. The substrate (dihydrosphingosine or dihydroceramide) for Sur2p has not been identified. Since hydroxylation of C-4 is not required for ceramide or sphingolipid synthesis, either dihydrosphingosine or phytosphingosine can serve as substrate for ceramide synthase, and either dihydroceramide or phytoceramide can serve as substrate for IPC synthase. S. cerevisiae cells contain both dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine, and inhibition of ceramide synthase by fumonisin B1 causes the accumulation of both LCBs (29Wu W.-I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether phytosphingosine comes fromde novo synthesis or from turnover of ceramide and sphingolipid. Scs7p is also a member of this family of hydroxylases/desaturases, but it is responsible for hydroxylation of the VLCFA rather than the LCB. Failure to hydroxylate C4 of the LCB decreases the Scs7p-catalyzed hydroxylation of the VLCFA, indicating hydroxylation occurs subsequent to ceramide formation. Furthermore, the ceramides fromSCS7 + cells are hydroxylated, while those fromscs7Δ mutant cells are not suggesting that the substrate for Scs7p is ceramide. However, it is not yet known whether most of the free ceramides in the cell arise from de novo synthesis or from turnover of sphingolipid, so it remains to be determined whether the substrate for Scs7p is free ceramide or inositolphosphorylceramide. Martin and co-workers (16Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin CE J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) recently reported that cells lacking the elongase encoded by ELO3/SUR4 accumulate relatively high levels of hydroxylated C16 fatty acids. We have found thatelo3 mutant cells incorporate fatty acids with shorter than normal chain lengths into ceramide. 2D. Haak, K. Gable, T. Beeler, and T. Dunn, unpublished observations. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether the hydroxylated C16 fatty acids in the mutants arise from Scs7p-catalyzed hydroxylation of the (shorter than normal) fatty acids on the ceramide. Ceramide and IPC-C are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (4Puoti A. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) which appears to be the location of Scs7p and Sur2p as well. Both Scs7p and Sur2p contain C-terminal sequences (KMKYE and VKKEK), matching a consensus sequence specifying retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, all five proteins that are members of the oxo-diiron family appear to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Along with Sur2p and Scs7p, these are δ-9 fatty acid desaturase (Ole1p), C-4 sterol methyl oxidase (Erg25p), and C-5 sterol desaturase (Erg3p). The oxo-diiron centers in these enzymes are believed to receive electrons from either cytochromeb 5 or a cytochromeb 5-like domain. Scs7p and Ole1p contain cytochrome b 5-like domains at their N and C termini respectively (6Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 5 may function to transfer electrons to Sur2p and the other two enzymes. Cytochrome b 5 reductase may catalyze the reduction of both cytochrome b 5 and the cytochrome b 5-like domains on Scs7p and Ole1p. The Ca2+ sensitivity of csg2 mutants is suppressed by deletion of SUR2. Other mutations in sphingolipid biosynthetic genes (subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase,LCB1, SCS1/LCB2; ceramide hydroxylase,SCS7; fatty acid elongases, ELO2/SUR5/FEN1,ELO3/SUR4; and fatty acid synthetase, FAS2) also suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of csg mutants. These mutations either decrease the rate of sphingolipid synthesis or alter the sphingolipids that are synthesized. The CSG2 andCSG1 genes are required for mannosylation of IPC to form MIPC. In the absence of mannosylation, IPC-C overaccumulation is observed. It appears that decreasing the accumulation of IPC-C or a related metabolite or altering its structure (to IPC-B, IPC-B′, or IPC-A?) reverses the Ca2+ sensitivity. It is hoped that continued analysis of suppressor mutants will identify more genes that function in sphingolipid synthesis and identify the Ca2+target that triggers cell death. The genetic relationship between suppressors of the csg2Δ mutant and suppressors of the rvs161 mutant suggest a role for sphingolipid in some Rvs161p-dependent process. Three genes (SUR1, SUR2, and SUR4) (12Revardel E. Bonneu M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that mutate to suppress rvs161 mutants (10Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are related toCSG1 and CSG2 or to genes that mutate to suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg1Δ andcsg2Δ mutants. The sur1, sur2, andsur4 mutants have altered phospholipid compositions and abnormal morphologies in stationary phase (10Desfarges L. Durrens P. Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SUR1, which is allelic to CSG1 (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), is a high copy suppressor ofcsg2Δ mutants (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen.

Both SUR1/CSG1 andCSG2 are required for mannosylation of IPC (5Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).SUR2 encodes the enzyme that hydroxylates C-4 of dihydroceramide. SUR4/ELO3 and SUR5/ELO2/FEN1encode fatty acid elongases required for the synthesis of the C26 fatty acids found in ceramide and sphingolipids (16Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin CE J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The physiological function of Sur2p- and Scs7p-mediated hydroxylation is not known. Growth of S. cerevisiae cells does not depend on hydroxylation of either the C-4 of the LCB or the VLCFA moieties of ceramides and sphingolipids. Cells lacking serine palmitoyltransferase can utilize exogenous dihydrosphingosine or phytosphingosine but not sphingosine, the main long chain base in mammals (25Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sincesur2Δ mutants do not synthesize phytosphingosine, it is not the lack of a C-4 hydroxyl group that precludes sphingosine from substituting as the LCB in ceramide synthesis. Deletion of SUR2 greatly increases the resistance of cells to the Pseudomonas syringae cyclic lipodepsipeptide syringomycin (33Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and to the morpholine fungicide fenpropimorph,2 an inhibitor of several enzymes in the ergosterol synthesis pathway. As discussed above, deletion ofSUR2 also suppresses the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2Δ mutants and the pleiotropic effects ofrvs161 mutations. Elucidation of the mechanism by which blocking hydroxylation of the LCB C-4 increases the ability of cells to tolerate syringomycin, fenpropimorph, and high Ca2+concentrations after CSG2 deletion, and RVS161deletion may provide clues as to how C-4 hydroxylation affects the functional properties of the LCB, ceramide, and sphingolipids. In addition, the sur2Δ mutant can be used to identify genetically related genes that encode proteins whose functional properties are effected by C-4 hydroxylation. We thank Ann Moser for the protocol for visualizing ceramides using 8-anilino-1-napthalene sulfonic acid, and Alan Akers (BASF) for the gift of fenpropimorph."
https://openalex.org/W2091040535,"Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are classified functionally, based on whether calmodulin binding is Ca2+-dependent (cNOS) or Ca2+-independent (iNOS). This key dichotomy has not been defined at the molecular level. Here we show that cNOS isoforms contain a unique polypeptide insert in their FMN binding domains which is not shared with iNOS or other related flavoproteins. Previously identified autoinhibitory domains in calmodulin-regulated enzymes raise the possibility that the polypeptide insert is the autoinhibitory domain of cNOSs. Consistent with this possibility, three-dimensional molecular modeling suggested that the insert originates from a site immediately adjacent to the calmodulin binding sequence. Synthetic peptides derived from the 45-amino acid insert of endothelial NOS were found to potently inhibit binding of calmodulin and activation of cNOS isoforms. This inhibition was associated with peptide binding to NOS, rather than free calmodulin, and inhibition could be reversed by increasing calmodulin concentration. In contrast, insert-derived peptides did not interfere with the arginine site of cNOS, as assessed from [3H]N G-nitro-l-arginine binding, nor did they potently effect iNOS activity. Limited proteolysis studies showed that calmodulin's ability to gate electron flow through cNOSs is associated with displacement of the insert polypeptide; this is the first specific calmodulin-induced change in NOS conformation to be identified. Together, our findings strongly suggest that the insert is an autoinhibitory control element, docking with a site on cNOSs which impedes calmodulin binding and enzymatic activation. The autoinhibitory control element molecularly defines cNOSs and offers a unique target for developing novel NOS activators and inhibitors.

Nitric oxide is a ubiquitous cell-signaling molecule, with protean roles in physiology and pathophysiology (1Nathan C. Xie Q.W.

Encoded by distinct genes, mammalian NO synthases (NOSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric oxide synthase; cNOS, calcium-dependent NOS, iNOS, calcium-independent NOS; eNOS, the endothelial isoform of cNOS; nNOS, the neuronal isoform of cNOS; CaM, calmodulin, SCR, structurally conserved region; CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric oxide synthase; cNOS, calcium-dependent NOS, iNOS, calcium-independent NOS; eNOS, the endothelial isoform of cNOS; nNOS, the neuronal isoform of cNOS; CaM, calmodulin, SCR, structurally conserved region; CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol. comprise a family of three calmodulin-dependent biopterohemoflavoproteins that are functionally distinguished by their modes of regulation (4Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two constitutively expressed isoforms of NOS (cNOSs), first identified in neuronal cells (nNOS) and endothelial cells (eNOS), remain dormant until calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) binding is actuated by transient elevations in intracellular Ca2+. This Ca2+-dependent mode of regulation provides pulses of NO for moment-to-moment modulation of vascular tone and neurosignaling. In contrast, activity of the immunostimulant-induced isoform of NOS (iNOS) is Ca2+-independent, providing continuous high output NO generation for host defense. A remarkably high affinity for CaM, even at basally low levels of intracellular calcium, is responsible for the Ca2+ independence of iNOS (5Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Whether a given NOS isoform binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent or -independent manner has been assumed to be a property solely of the amino acid sequence specified by a 20–25-amino acid CaM binding site. However, this restrictive view is challenged by findings that chimeric eNOS and nNOS, which have had their CaM binding sequences replaced with the corresponding sequence from iNOS, still require Ca2+ for full activity (6Venema R.C.

Because regulation of enzyme systems by Ca2+/CaM typically involves displacement of an intrinsic autoinhibitory polypeptide (8Jarrett H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the binding of Ca2+/CaM to cNOSs may similarly trigger activation by displacing a control element. Here we identify a multiple amino acid insertion which serves as a control element unique to cNOSs and which molecularly defines Ca2+-dependent isoforms of NOS. Molecular modeling of the FMN binding module of nitric oxide synthase isoforms was done using the Insight and Homology programs from Biosym (BIOSYM/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) running on a silicon graphics Indigo2 workstation. After alignment of NOS sequences with homologous FMN binding proteins of known structure (see “Results”), structurally conserved region (SCR) boxes were created corresponding to conserved regions of secondary structure and regions involved directly in FMN binding. These regions were characterized by high positive scores as evaluated by Dayhoff's mutation matrix (10Dayhoff M.O. Hunt W.C. Hunt L.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 524-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). After assignment of coordinates in the SCR regions, the loop regions between the SCR boxes were modeled by searching the Brookhaven protein data base. The crude model structure was relaxed to a sterically and energetically reasonable state using the Discover program (BIOSYM/Molecular Simulations) for molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. This includes splice repair to remove unrealistic structural features at SCR-loop junctions, end repair to assign reasonable structures to C-terminal and N-terminal extensions, and structural optimization to remove steric overlaps and to reduce the structure to a energetic minimum. Energy minimizations were begun using the steepest descent method; this was replaced by conjugate gradient method as convergence was approached. Rat neuronal cNOS (nNOS) and bovine endothelial cNOS (eNOS) were purified from Escherichia coli harboring pGroELS and pCW vector expression systems for nNOS and eNOS, as described previously (11McMillan K.

Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks at passage 10–15. Cells were stimulated for 16 h in culture medium containing a combination of lipopolysaccharide (30 μg/ml) and rat recombinant interferon-γ (50 ng/ml), washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested with a Teflon cell scraper into an additional 10 ml of iced phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 800 × gfor 10 min, resuspended in 100 μl/75-cm2 culture flask of ice-cold distilled H2O containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (pepstatin 10 μg/ml, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 100 μm) and lysed by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a 37 °C water bath. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatants were stored at −70 °C until use. NOS activity was measured in 96-well microtiter plates at 25 °C based on the kinetics of NADPH consumption or the oxidation of Fe2+-myoglobin to Fe3+-myoglobin, as described previously (14Gross S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For NADPH consumption measurements, incubation mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.60), 100 μmCaCl2, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 500 μm NADPH, 500 μml-arginine, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm calmodulin, pH 7.6, and the indicated concentration of peptide in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 pmol of nNOS, 10 pmol of eNOS, or 15 μg of rat iNOS-rich cytosol. NADPH consumption was determined from the rate of decrease in A 340, measured at 15-s intervals for a period of 30 min in a kinetic microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices; Menlo Park, CA). The rate of decline in A 340 measured when NOS was omitted from incubates was subtracted from all values. Samples in which iNOS activity was measured based on Fe2+-myoglobin oxidation were prepared as above, but additionally contained 15 μg of rat iNOS-rich cytosol and a final concentration of 40 μmFe2+-myoglobin. Preparation of Fe2+-myoglobin and spectrophotometric measurement of its rate of oxidation to Met-myoglobin by NO, was as described earlier (14Gross S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin was labeled with 125I to a specific activity of 25–150 μCi/g, using the Bolton-Hunter method (15Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar).125I-Calmodulin binding assays were performed in triplicate using 96-well microfiltration plates with GFB filter bottoms (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Before use, filters were preincubated for 1–2 min with 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm CaCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml β-lactoglobulin; buffer was then removed by vacuum filtration. Binding reactions were comprised of: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml β-lactoglobulin, 100 μm CaCl2, 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 1 nm125I-CaM (2500–5000 cpm) and 1–2 pmol of NOS in a 100-μl total volume. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C, and binding was quickly terminated by vacuum filtration. Filters were washed twice with 100 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 100 μm CaCl2 and air-dried. Scintillation mixture was added to each well (25 μl; OptiPhase SuperMix, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and plates were counted in a Microbeta Plus liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Inc.). Nonspecific binding was determined in samples that additionally contained 10 mm EGTA. In studies of the effect of inhibitory effect of peptide inhibitors on125I-CaM binding to NOS, blank binding was determined in the presence of peptide and absence of NOS. Dissociation of125I-CaM was similarly monitored in 96-well filtration plates. 125I-CaM·nNOS complexes were first produced by incubation of 2 pmol of nNOS, 1 nm of 125I-CaM, 100 μm CaCl2, 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml β-lactoglobulin for 15 min (23 °C). To initate dissociation, a 3000-fold excess of unlabeled CaM (3 μm) was added at time 0, with or without simultaneous addition of the indicated concentration of bovine eNOS607–634. Assays of [3H]N G-nitro-l-arginine binding were performed in 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride microfiltration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (16Nishimura J.S. Martasek P. McMillan K. Salerno J. Liu Q. Gross S.S. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), using 5 pmol of nNOS and the indicated concentrations of NOS-derived peptides. Activity of the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) was monitored in a 96-well kinetic microplate spectrophotometer at 37 °C, based on rate of hydrolysis of the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (17Takai A. Mieskes G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 nm bovine brain calmodulin, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 400 μmCaCl2, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol in a 100-μl total volume. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 pmol of calcineurin, and activity was monitored continually atA 405 for 60 min at 15-s intervals. Assay blanks additionally contained 10 mm EGTA, resulting in >90% inhibition of activity. Limited proteolysis was performed on incubates containing 40 pmol of recombinant nNOS purified from stably transfected HEK-293 cells (11McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) or 50 pmol of recombinant eNOS purified from E. coli (12Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Samples were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min in a 100-μl volume containing: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 10 μmCaM, 100 μm CaCl2, with or without 10 mm EGTA. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 20 microunits of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-immobilized trypsin (Sigma) per pmol of NOS. Samples (25 μl) were collected after 0, 5, 10, and 20 min, and proteolysis was terminated by boiling with an equal volume of 2 × SDS gel-loading buffer. Peptide products were resolved on an 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Accurate molecular mass determination of tryptic fragments was performed by mass spectrometry at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Biotechnology Center, using matrix-assisted laser desorption and time of flight detection (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). For N-terminal sequence analysis, tryptic digests were prepared as above and subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but then electrotransfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. Synthetic peptides were obtained from SynPep (Dublin, CA) and other commercial suppliers. Purity was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy and exceeded 80% in all cases with typical purity ≈90%. Predominant impurities differed from the desired products by one amino acid residue, resulting from incompletely coupled synthesis. Rat recombinant interferon-γ, RPMI culture medium, and cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Radioisotopes were from Dupont NEN, lipopolysaccharide (E. coli serotype 0111:B4), chemicals, andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-immobilized trypsin were obtained from Sigma, calmodulin was from Calbiochem, and tetrahydrobiopterin was from Schirks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Enzymes were purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Promega, or New England Biolabs. Nitric oxide synthases are large multidomain enzymes in which a series of gene fusion events has resulted in the incorporation of modules showing significant homology to smaller ancestral proteins (18Masters B.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,19Liu Q. Gross S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 311-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOSs can be coarsely dissected into an N-terminal oxygenase domain and a C-terminal reductase domain, bridged by a canonical binding sequence for CaM (20Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin binding initiates electron transfer between the reductase and catalytic domains, thereby activating catalysis (21Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The oxygenase domains have binding sites for substrate (arginine), heme, and tetrahydrobiopterin, whereas the reductase domain has binding sites for FAD, FMN, and NADPH. Bredt et al. (22Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) were first to reveal the homology between the C-terminal half of NOS and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), noting conserved regions corresponding to FMN, FAD, and NADPH binding domains. The FMN-binding modules of NOS isoforms and CPR are in turn highly homologous to the flavodoxins, which are small FMN-binding proteins that function as electron carriers in bacteria (23Porter T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The FAD and NADPH binding domains are closely related to chloroplast ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and other related proteins. Five flavodoxins have been crystallized and solved by x-ray diffraction (24Watenpaugh K.D. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Three regions in these flavodoxins are involved in binding the FMN prosthetic group; the first of these is close to the N terminus, and is immediately proceeded by the initial β strand of the structure. Although only one of these FMN binding regions was identified in nNOS by Bredt et al. (22Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), each of them has a corresponding homolog in NOSs. The first step in alignment of the NOS FMN binding domain with the flavodoxins was the identification of these regions in each NOS isoform. This was followed by the identification of conserved secondary structural elements in NOS, primarily by their homology to the corresponding elements in flavodoxins by mutation matrix criteria (10Dayhoff M.O. Hunt W.C. Hunt L.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 524-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows alignment of a select set of NOS, CPR, and bacterial flavodoxin sequences, illustrating the conservation of regions involved in FMN binding. It is obvious that a major insertion of ≈45 amino acids has occurred in mammalian cNOSs. A corresponding insert is also found in the FMN binding region of the cloned invertebrate cNOSs from Rhodnius prolixus (25.TM accession no., U59389, Yuda, M. (1996) GenBankTM accession no., U59389.Google Scholar) andDrosophila melanogaster (26Regulski M. Tully T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); these inserts are somewhat larger (54–63 amino acids), but contain regions of marked homology to mammalian cNOS inserts. Expanding this alignment to include dozens of known flavodoxins and related FMN-containing flavoproteins reveals that only cNOSs exhibit such an insertion. Moreover, the corresponding region of iNOS sequences closely resemble flavodoxin sequences but lack an insert anywhere within the FMN binding domain. Therefore, occurrence of the amino acid insertion correlates with Ca2+/CaM control. This insertion represents the single most prominent difference between cNOSs and iNOS amino acid sequences, considered over their entire length. The cNOS FMN module insertions are notably rich in charged residues and have an excess of positive charge. This is especially true of the eNOS isoform, which contains the motif RRKRK. Considerable homology exists between the cNOS insertions, particularly toward their N termini. It is also apparent that some structural reorganization has taken place during evolution, which may allow the two or three positively charged residues (depending on species) in the nNOS equivalent of the RRKRK region to recognize a similar binding site. The pattern of conservation suggests that eNOS and nNOS insertions contain at least two motifs. The availability of solved x-ray crystal structures for flavodoxins allows us to position the insertion in three dimensions relative to the calmodulin binding site. Homology-based molecular models have been constructed for the FMN binding domains of cNOSs, iNOS, and CPR, which could be relaxed to a sterically and energetically reasonable state. After relaxation of these FMN binding domain models, no steric overlaps were present, and energies were approximately −300 kcal, comparable or lower than that of reference flavodoxin crystal structures. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper left), the backbone structure of iNOS and CPR are virtually superimposable on the backbone of Desulfovibrio vulgarisflavodoxin, the closest solved structural homolog of the FMN binding modules of the NOS isoforms. 2Recently, the crystal structure of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase has been reported at 3.0 Å resolution (27Kim J.-J. Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Stevenson K.J. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Alberta, Canada1996: 455-462Google Scholar). The FMN-binding module bears striking homology toD. vulgaris flavodoxin. The structure, a Rossmann fold motif (28Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), is a five stranded parallel β-sheet with the FMN binding site along one edge. Homology predicts that two aromatic residues in murine iNOS, Phe587 and Tyr625, are in contact with the FMN ring system; Tyr625 serves as a shielding residue. Fig. 2 (upper right) shows the corresponding backbone structure of eNOS; nNOS is extremely similar but not shown. Most of the eNOS backbone can be superimposed on homologs shown in Fig. 2(upper left), with the insertion projecting from the upper edge of the sheet opposite the FMN binding site. Structurally, it corresponds to the replacement of a tight 5–10 residue α → β loop with an ≈50-residue structure about one-third the size of the entire FMN binding module. We are unable to propose a conformation for the insertion because we lack a solved homolog; the structure shown is merely intended to convey relative position and size. The CaM binding site is immediately adjacent to the N-terminal edge of the FMN binding domain (painted white in Fig. 2, upper left). With CaM bound, the CaM recognition site would predictably be in a helical conformation (29O'Neil K.T. De Grado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 30Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); steric constraints suggest that it extends almost directly away from the FMN binding domain. Thelower panels of Fig. 2 show models of the FMN binding domains of iNOS (left) and eNOS (right) with CaM (yellow ribbon; based on Vorherr et al. (30Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) positioned above the N-terminal strand of the FMN domain. There are 7–8 residues between the end of the CAM recognition site proper and the start of the initial strand of the β-sheet; 2–3 residues at each end of this short linker are needed to clear the van der Waals surfaces of CaM and the FMN domain. This leaves 2–3 residues that are conformationally unrestricted, and, hence, there are uncertainties about the exact position above the β-sheet of CaM and the orientation of the axis of the CaM recognition site. The position of CaM relative to the FMN domain is unspecified with respect to rotations about they axis of Fig. 2 by available information (corresponding to the axis of the CaM-binding helix of lower panels). It is notable that calmodulins (molecular mass ≈ 17 kDa) are larger than the entire FMN-binding module. Although the insertion is midway through the sequence of the FMN-binding module, in three dimensions the model predicts it to be directly adjacent to the CaM binding site. The model predicts also that CaM binding would be sterically hindered by the insertion, suggesting that the insertion can exist in more than one physiologically relevant conformation. Two aspects of this model strongly suggest that the insert functions as a control element, 1) the correlation between Ca2+/CaM control and the presence of the insertion and 2) the proximity of the CaM binding site to the insertion and the probable steric interactions which would ensue. An attractive potential role for the insert is that of an inhibitory polypeptide which is displaced by CaM binding. It differs from inhibitory polypeptides common to other CaM-dependent enzymes, and CaM itself, in its lack of acidic and hydrophobic amino acids; this makes direct binding of the insertion to CaM sites in NOS isoforms unlikely. Nonetheless, CaM could conceivably displace the polypeptide insert from a neighboring site by binding domain overlap or through allosteric effects. Functional significance of the putative autoinhibitory insert of cNOSs was evaluated using a series of synthetic polypeptide fragments. Polypeptides corresponding to promising recognition sites such as the RRKRK motif of the eNOS insert were synthesized in lengths ranging from 6 to 33 residues, as shown in Table I. Both eNOS- and nNOS-derived peptide fragments were evaluated; effects on NOS activity are summarized in TableII. At concentrations of 50–100 μm, several polypeptide fragments of the cNOS insertions profoundly inhibited eNOS and nNOS activity. The most effective inhibitory polypeptides were from the eNOS insertion and contained the RRKRK motif (Table II and Fig.3 A). Human nNOS-derived polypeptides weakly inhibited eNOS, but were without effect on nNOS. While all peptides were less potent on iNOS, significant inhibition was obtained with eNOS601–633 and eNOS607–634. Notably, inhibition of iNOS activity by these peptides was rapid and apparently complete within one minute of addition. Because CaM is very tightly bound to iNOS and has a remarkably slow off-rate, with little dissociation occurring even after boiling (5Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), inhibition probably occurs without CaM displacement.Table IPeptide derivation and compositionDesignationDerivation1-ah, human; b, bovine, r, rat.SequenceeNOS628–633bWRRKRKeNOS626–636bSSWRRKRKESSnNOS835–845hQEERKSYKVRFeNOS604–615hRPEQHKSYKIRFeNOS601–633bSSPRPEQHKSYKIRFNSVSCSDPLVSSWRRKRKeNOS607–634bQHKSYKIRFNSVSCSDPLVSSWRRKRKEnNOS851–864rSDSRKSSGDGPDLRnNOS835–864hQEERKSYKVRFNSVSSYSDSQKSSGDGPDLSequence and derivation of polypeptides excerpted from the insert in the FMN binding domain of cNOSs and tested for effects on NOS activity and binding.1-a h, human; b, bovine, r, rat.

A similar inhibitory effect was also observed for crm1 +. Cells overproducing either hCRM1 or S. pombe Crm1 were distinctly larger than uninduced cells and contained compacted and fragmented nuclei. Furthermore, calcofluor staining demonstrated that most of these cells formed two septa per cell and accumulated a large amount of chitin or its related polysaccharides around the septa. Closely similar phenotypes between hCRM1- and S. pombe Crm1-induced cells indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional homolog ofS. pombe crm1 +. Northern blot analyses with RNAs isolated from synchronized mammalian cells showed that the expression of mammalian CRM1 was initiated in late G1 and reached a peak at G2/M, although its protein level unchanged during the cell cycle. Transient expression of hCRM1 fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in NIH3T3 cells showed that hCRM1 was localized preferentially in the nuclear envelope and was also detectable in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.

All of these data suggest that CRM1 is a novel cell-cycle regulated gene that is essential for the nuclear export signal-dependent nuclear export of proteins. The structure of eukaryotic chromatin, which is folded and packed into the nucleus, dynamically changes during the cell cycle. In the M phase, the chromatin is highly condensed to become mitotic chromosomes with higher order structures. The condensed higher order structure of chromatin is also present in the interphase, which is postulated to be involved in transcriptional silencing related to position effect variegation and dosage compensation, etc. (1Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These structures contain the solenoid, also called the 30-nm fiber consisting of about six nucleosomes per turn of the 10-nm fiber, and an ordered network consisting of chromatin loops (2Reeves R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 343-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although various classes of nuclear proteins are proposed to be involved in forming and maintaining the higher order chromosome structures (3Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Reuter G. Spierer P. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5Chuang P.-T. Albertson D.G. Meyer B.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 459-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), little is known about the functions of these proteins. Crm1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one of the proteins required for maintaining the chromosome structures, which was identified as the protein encoded by crm1 + that could complement the crm1 mutation of S. pombe(6Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cold-sensitive crm1 mutants were isolated during visual screening by means of DAPI staining, which showed deformed filamentous or fragmented nuclear structures at the restrictive temperature. Thecrm1 + gene encodes a 115-kDa protein that is essential for proliferation of S. pombe and is localized in the nucleus or its periphery. Crm1 is involved in the regulation of not only nuclear structure but also specific gene activity; thecrm1 mutants produced an increased amount of p25 whose expression is regulated by an AP-1-like transcription factor. Genetic analysis demonstrated that Crm1 was a negative regulator for Pap1, theS. pombe AP-1 homolog (7Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M. Kyogoku Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5474-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Kumada K. Yanagida M. Toda T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously cloned a mutant gene of crm1 + (crm1-N1) as a gene that confers resistance to leptomycin B on wild-type S. pombe from a gene library of an leptomycin B-resistant mutant ofS. pombe (9Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leptomycin B is a Streptomycesmetabolite causing growth arrest of S. pombe and mammalian cells at G1 and G2 phases and is considered to be a clinically important antitumor drug (10Hamamoto T. Gunji S. Tsuji H. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1983; 36: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Hamamoto T. Seto H. Beppu T. J.

Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The wild-typecrm1 + gene could also give resistance to leptomycin B when introduced into the cells of the wild-type background with a multicopy vector. In contrast, the cold-sensitive mutantcrm1–809 showed hypersensitivity to leptomycin B at the permissive temperature. Furthermore, treatment of wild-type S. pombe with leptomycin B caused abnormal nuclear morphology and p25 overproduction, which were almost identical to the terminal phenotypes of crm1 mutants (9Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, we have proposed that Crm1 or its regulatory cascade is the cellular target of leptomycin B. Recently, Wolff et al. (15Wolff B. Sanglier J.-J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) reported that leptomycin B inhibited nuclear export of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein and Rev-dependent mRNA. Since Crm1 is suggested to be highly conserved in all eukaryotes by detecting a protein reactive with an anti-Crm1 antibody in HeLa cells (6Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it seems possible that mammalian CRM1 is involved in nuclear export of proteins and that the cell cycle arrest of mammalian cells by leptomycin B is ascribable to inhibition of the mammalian CRM1 function. In this paper, we describe cDNA cloning of a functional mammalian homolog of Crm1. The cloned cDNA, named human CRM1 (hCRM1), was able to complement the S. pombe crm1 mutation and cause growth inhibition and morphological abnormalities in S. pombe when overproduced. The mammalian CRM1 gene was ubiquitously transcribed in all the tissues tested and its transcription level in cultured cells was regulated during the cell cycle. hCRM1 expressed in mammalian cells localized preferentially in the nuclear envelope and the S. pombe crm1 mutant was defective in the NES 1The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; ORF, open reading frame; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; GFP, green fluorescent protein. -dependent nuclear export of proteins. These results suggest that CRM1is a novel cell cycle-regulated gene that may be involved in nuclear export of proteins in eukaryotes. The S. pombestrains used in this study were: 972 (h −), JY266 (h+ leu1–32), AC1 (h − leu1–32 crm1-809), and TP108-3C (h − leu1–32 ura4 pap1::ura4 +). pDB248′ (16Beach D. Piper M. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 187: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81 were used for transformation of S. pombe cells. pREP1 plasmid contains the wild-type nmt1promoter, which can strongly direct transcription when thiamine is absent in the medium (17Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). pREP41 and pREP81 possess mutations in their promoter sequences, which result in the moderate and weak promoter activities, respectively (18Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). pDHC1 containing hCRM1 cDNA was constructed as follows. Multiple restriction sites were introduced into a 5′-region adjacent to the initiation codon of hCRM1 using polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 5′-portion of the ORF. The amplified fragment was sequenced and replaced by the corresponding 5′-region of hCRM1 cDNA on pBluescript SK− (Stratagene), resulting in pBHC1. pDHC1 was constructed by inserting the BamHI fragment of pBHC1 into the BamHI site of pDB248′ in such an orientation that the ORF was under the control of the vector-originated cryptic promoter (19Tanaka K. Davey J. Imai Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To construct pR1HC1, pR41HC1, and pR81HC1, hCRM1 ORF excised from pBHC1 by BamHI and NdeI that includes the initiation codon was introduced into pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81, resulting in constructions of pR1HC1, pR41HC1, and pR81HC1, respectively. The crm1 + ORF with multiple restriction sites at the 5′-end of the ORF was similarly introduced into pBluescript SK− (pBPC1) and was used for constructing pDPC1 of a pDB248′ derivative, pR1PC1, pR41PC1, and pR81PC1 as described for pREP-hCRM1. pYA284 (6Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) containing the wild-typecrm1 + gene was used for control experiments of complementing the crm1 mutation. To observe nuclear import or export of proteins in S. pombe, we constructed pR1GsvNLSF1 and pR1GrevNESF1 which can produce GST-SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS)-EGFP and GST-Rev nuclear export signal (NES)-EGFP fusion proteins, respectively, in S. pombe. pGEX-NLS-GFP and pGEX-NES-GFP were supplied from Y. Yoneda, Osaka University, and the sequence encoding GFP was replaced by that for EGFP from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). pR1GsvNLSF1 and pR1GrevNESF1 were constructed by inserting the fragments corresponding to GST-NLS-EGFP and GST-NES-EGFP into pREP1, respectively. S. pombe strains were grown in complete YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose) or minimal medium (20Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Meijer L. Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. The Role of RB in Cell Cycle Control. 1. Plenum Press, New York1995: 9-19Google Scholar) was used for plasmid selection and induction of the nmt1 promoters. For suppression of thenmt1 promoter of pREP plasmids, thiamine hydrochloride was added to minimal medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Standard genetic work was carried out according to Guts et al. (21Gutz H. Heslot H. Leupold U. Loprieno N. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar). S. pombe was transformed by the lithium acetate protocol of Itoet al. (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). General DNA manipulation techniques were described by Maniatis et al. (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). To isolate cDNA encoding the human homolog of Crm1, we first searched nucleotide data bases for randomly sequenced human cDNAs (EST) showing significant similarity to yeast Crm1 protein. We synthesized two oligonucleotides (5′-TTCAATCTCTGGTAATCTATGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GACTTGGGTTATCTGTCCACTAGAG-3′) on the basis of the sequences of clones 10 h09 (GenBank accession number H26490) and H2CBU81 (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD), performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification with total RNA isolated from K562 cells, and obtained a 0.6-kb fragment. This 0.6-kb fragment was identified to be part of a putative Crm1 homolog by sequencing. A cDNA library of K562 mRNA constructed with the λZAP vector (Stratagene) was screened for cDNA clones encoding hCRM1 using the 0.6-kb fragment as probe. The nucleotide sequence of the 4088-base pair cDNA containing the entire ORF of hCRM1 was determined on both strands by the dideoxy method using a DNA sequencer model 4000L (LI-COR, Inc.). The viability during induction of hCRM1 or S. pombe Crm1 by the nmt1promoter was determined as colony forming units. S. pombeJY266 cells transformed with pREP1, pR1HC1 containing hCRM1 cDNA, and pR1PC1 containing crm1 + ORF were grown in minimal medium with 10 μg/ml thiamine at 30 °C and transferred into minimal medium lacking thiamine at time 0. Cells in cultures at the initial cell density of 1.6 × 105 cells/ml were taken at intervals, counted, and plated on minimal medium containing thiamine. Colonies formed were counted and the colony forming units were determined. Data are the mean of duplicated assays. S. pombe JY266 transformants grown in minimal medium containing thiamine were transferred into medium lacking thiamine at time 0, as described above.S. pombe AC1 cells exponentially grown in YPD at 30 °C were placed at 20 °C at time 0. These cells were further cultivated for 24 h, harvested, and fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were observed under a light microscope (Olympus BHS-323N Nomarski differential interference microscopy) or a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135). The fixed cells were washed several times with PBS and stained with DAPI or calcofluor (fluorescent blightener 28, Sigma) as described (24Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). For propidium iodide/calcofluor double staining, fixed cells were washed three times with 50 mmsodium citrate (pH 7.0), incubated with 1 mg/ml RNase A for 2 h at 37 °C, and then washed with PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4). The cells were resuspended in PEM containing 0.5 mg/ml calcofluor for 30 min at room temperature. After the cells had been washed three times with PEM, they were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame CA) containing 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide and then observed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. A human myeloma cell line K562 was cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, a murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line F4NW0, and a rat embryonic fibroblast cell line transformed withras and p53Val135, clone 6, were maintained in culture at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. MEL cells were synchronized in G1 phase by cell fractionation. Briefly, cells (1–4 × 108) in the exponentially growing culture were collected by centrifugation (200 × g, 7 min). The pellets were pooled and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS. Cells at various stages of the cell cycle were prepared by centrifugal elutriation in PBS, with a Beckman JE-6 elutriator rotor. From each 50-ml fraction, a portion was fixed (0.1% glutaraldehyde, 15 min at room temperature) and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells in the first two fractions (100 ml) were counted, centrifuged, seeded at 6 × 105cells/ml, and then cultured for 0–8 h. At different times, cells were taken for cell cycle analysis and RNA preparation. Clone 6 cells were synchronized in G1 phase by a temperature shift to 32 °C. Briefly, cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml and grown for 24 h, and then placed at 32 °C for arresting the cell cycle in G1. In the cell cycle resumption experiments, cells arrested at 32 °C were placed at 37 °C again. Cells were taken at various times after the temperature shift for RNA preparation and cell cycle analysis. Tissue distribution of hCRM1 mRNA was analyzed with multiple tissue Northern blots purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and 1.7-kbSacI-HindIII fragment containing a C-terminal half of hCRM1 ORF. The blots were rehybridized with a 2.0-kb human β-actin cDNA probe. All the probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Shuzo, Japan). Total RNAs of MEL and clone 6 cells were prepared using a Trireagent (Sigma) according to the furnished instructions. RNA pellets were washed twice by reprecipitation with ethanol and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Five μg each of total RNA was fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel, followed by RNA blotting and hybridization with a 0.8-kb EcoRI-NotI fragment of clone ID 313609 of IMAGE consortium (GenBank accession number W10968) encoding part of a mouse CRM1 homolog (mCRM1). The EST clone includes an N-terminal region of mCRM1, corresponding to 1–110 amino acids of hCRM1, that has 95 and 100% identity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. Clone 6 cells were collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and sonicated. Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred into a membrane. The membrane was washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 10% skim milk and 0.3% Tween 20. The membrane was then rinsed and incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2% Tween 20, and a 1/500 dilution of the anti-CRM1 antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids (Glu1024-Arg1043). After the membrane had been washed with PBS containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100, the CRM1 protein was detected using ECL system (Amersham). Flow cytometry was used for determination of cellular DNA and CRM1 contents. Cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells (MEL and clone 6) were stained with the DNA-specific fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed with a FACStar+ (Becton-Dickinson). For double staining, the fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), then incubated with anti-CRM1 antiserum, diluted to 1/200 in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. The detailed protocol was described by Khochbin et al. (25Khochbin S. Chabanas S. Albert P. Lawrence J.J. Cytometry. 1989; 10: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The second fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Lab. After immunolabeling, the cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The background fluorescence (ranging from channel 1 to 100, not shown) was measured by analyzing the fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence of cells incubated with non-immune serum, instead of the anti-CRM1 antiserum, during the immunostaining procedure. The hCRM1 expression plasmids for mammalian cells were constructed using pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), which allow transient expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused at either the C or N terminus of hCRM1. Transfection into NIH3T3 cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the furnished instructions. The cellular distribution of GFP-fused proteins was observed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescent microscope. pR1GsvNLSF1 and pR1GrevNESF1 were introduced into both S. pombe JY266 and AC1 possessing thecrm1–809 mutation. The fused proteins were expressed by cultivating the transformants in the absence of thiamine for 12 h at 30 °C, and the effect of the crm1 mutation on distribution of the fused proteins was observed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescent microscope after an additional 6-h incubation at 30 or 18 °C. We used sequence information of the EST data bases and polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to identify and clone mammalian homologs of S. pombe crm1 +. A 0.6-kb fragment corresponding to the 5′-region of a putative Crm1 homolog was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA mixture made from total RNA of the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, using synthetic primers based on clones 10h09 (GenBank accession number H26490) and H2CBU81 (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD). The amplified fragment was used as a probe to isolate a cDNA encoding the entire ORF of putative Crm1 homolog from a cDNA library of K562. Because of its characteristics described below, we refer to the gene product as the human homolog of Crm1 (hCRM1). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that hCRM1 consists of 1071 amino acids with a calculated relative molecular mass of 123,384 Da (Fig. 1). The entire amino acid sequence showed significant similarities to those of S. pombe crm1 + (51.6% identity) and S. cerevisiae CRM1 (45.8% identity). No other protein with significant homology with hCRM1 was found through a data base search. hCRM1 contained no known motif or region that allows us to predict its function. Northern blot analysis probed with the C-terminal region of hCRM1 cDNA revealed a major 5.6-kb transcript that was expressed in all human tissues tested except for kidney (Fig.2). Overexposure of the blot showed the presence of the 5.6-kb transcript as well as a smear signal around 3-kb in kidney mRNA (data not shown). The biological importance of the low level of the 5.6-kb hCRM1 mRNA in kidney is unknown. The high similarity between the amino acid sequences of hCRM1 and S. pombe Crm1 suggests that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional homolog corresponding to yeast Crm1. To examine this possibility, we introduced hCRM1 cDNA into S. pombe crm1–809 mutant cells with a multicopy vector pDB248′ and expressed it using the promoter activity present in the vector (19Tanaka K. Davey J. Imai Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, hCRM1 cDNA weakly suppressed the cold sensitivity of the crm1–809 mutation. S. pombe wild-type crm1 + also partly complemented the mutation when expressed with the promoter of the pDB248′ vector. These results suggest that the cloned human cDNA is capable of functioning in S. pombe. Since expression ofcrm1 + under the authenticcrm1 + promoter (pYA284) fully complemented the mutation, the weak ability of both hCRM1 cDNA andcrm1 + on pDB248′ to support the growth at the nonpermissive temperature may be due to the insufficient expression level by the promoter of pDB248′. We next controlled their expression levels by a series ofnmt1 (no message in thiamine) promoters, whose transcription is induced only in the absence of thiamine (17Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). pREP1 contains the wild-type nmt1 promoter with very potent transcriptional activity, thereby causing overproduction. pREP41 and pREP81 possess mutations in their promoter sequences, which result in the moderate and weak promoter activities, respectively (18Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, we could not evaluate the ability of hCRM1 or crm1 + expressed under the nmt1 promoters in the crm1–809 mutant, since neither wild-type crm1 + of pYA284 nor hCRM1 cDNA on pREP1 could rescue the mutant cells at the nonpermissive temperature when the minimal medium was used for complementation assay (Fig. 4, 18 °C MM ± thiamine). When hCRM1 was overexpressed with pREP1 in the crm1–809 mutant at the permissive temperature, cell growth was strongly inhibited (Fig. 4, 30 °CMM−thiamine). The deleterious effect of the hCRM1 overproduction was also observed in the wild-type background, which was dependent on its expression level (Fig.5 A); the inhibitory effect of hCRM1 was alleviated by the moderate expression from the pREP41 promoter, and was almost undetectable when expressed with pREP81. Surprisingly, overproduction of wild-type S. pombe Crm1 caused similar growth inhibition in a promoter activity-dependent manner. Cell viability upon induction of the hCRM1 or S. pombe Crm1 expression was analyzed by determining their colony-forming abilities. The colony-forming abilities of cells overproducing either hCRM1 or S. pombeCrm1 with pREP1 were dramatically reduced 15 h after the induction, indicating that overproduction of these proteins was lethal for cells (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Growth suppression of S. pombe by overexpression of hCRM1 or crm1 +. A, effects of overexpression of hCRM1 or crm1 + bynmt1 promoters on growth of S. pombe. The expression level was controlled by a series of nmt1promoters, pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81, as described under “Materials and Methods.” S. pombe JY266 was transformed with the following plasmids: pR1HC1, hCRM1 cDNA on pREP1; pR41HC1, hCRM1 cDNA on pREP41; pR81HC1, hCRM1 cDNA on pREP81; pR1PC1,crm1 + ORF on pREP1; pR41PC1,crm1 + ORF on pREP41; and pR81PC1,crm1 + ORF on pREP81. The transformants selected were grown on minimal medium plates in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml thiamine. B, effects of overexpression of hCRM1 orcrm1 + on viability of S. pombe. Viability of S. pombe JY266 transformed with pREP1 (•), pR1HC1 containing hCRM1 cDNA (○), and pR1PC1 containingcrm1 + ORF (▴) were examined by determining the colony-forming units after thiamine depletion. At time 0, the transformants grown in minimal medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamine were transferred into medium lacking thiamine. The percentage of viable colonies was calculated against the CFU of S. pombe JY266 transformed with pREP1 at time 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We compared the terminal phenotypes between the cells producing hCRM1 and S. pombe Crm1. Light microscopic observation showed that both the arrested cells were distinctly enlarged, elongated, and misshapen in comparison with the uninduced cells or the parental cells (Fig. 6). Fluorescent microscopy of cells stained with DAPI showed that the nuclei of the cells overexpressing hCRM1 were highly compacted and fragmented in contrast to the diffused and decondensed nuclei of crm1–809 mutant cells arrested at the nonpermissive temperature. The nucleus was often abnormally located in the cell body; localization near the pole, cell wall, and the septum was observed. The nuclear morphology of the cells overproducingS. pombe Crm1 was essentially the same as that of the hCRM1-producing cells but was more severely fragmented. These results suggest that Crm1 is involved in chromosome compaction and nuclear positioning. Visualization of the septum by calcofluor (fluorescent blightener 28) staining that allows detection of chitin or its related materials revealed that most of the hCRM1-producing cells contained two septa (or the septum-like structures) per cell. In some cases, a thin third septum was formed between the two septa or a single thick septum was produced around the growing apex. The amount of chitin in the cell was extremely larger than that in the cell with"

(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 23363-23367). Here we identified an IQGAP1-interacting molecule with molecular mass of 43 kDa (p43) from bovine brain cytosol, using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IQGAP1 affinity column chromatography. The amino acid sequencing of the protein revealed that p43 was identical to beta- and gamma-actin. IQGAP1 was cosedimentated with filamentous actin (F-actin). The amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-216) of IQGAP1 was responsible for the interaction with F-actin. Falling ball viscometry assay revealed that IQGAP1 cross-linked the F-actin. This IQGAP1 activity was further enhanced by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS).GST-Cdc42 but not by GDP.GST-Cdc42. The gel filtration analysis of IQGAP1 revealed that IQGAP1 appeared as oligomers and that GTPgammaS.GST-Cdc42 but not GDP.GST-Cdc42 enhanced the oligomerization of IQGAP1. These results strongly suggest that IQGAP1, acting downstream of Cdc42, can cross-link the actin filament through its oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2049260737,"Knowledge of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaegenes and proteins necessary for sphingolipid biosynthesis is far from complete. Such information should expedite studies of pathway regulation and sphingolipid functions. Using the Aur1 protein sequence, recently identified as necessary for synthesis of the sphingolipid inositol-P-ceramide (IPC), we show that a homolog (open reading frameYDR072c), termed Ipt1 (inositolphosphotransferase1) is necessary for synthesis of mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide (M(IP)2C), the most abundant and complex sphingolipid in S. cerevisiae. This conclusion is based upon analysis of an ipt1-deletion strain, which fails to accumulate M(IP)2C and instead accumulates increased amounts of the precursor mannose-inositol-P-ceramide. The mutant also fails to incorporate radioactive precursors into M(IP)2C, and membranes prepared from it do not incorporate [3H-inositol]phosphatidylinositol into M(IP)2C, indicating a lack of M(IP)2C synthase activity (putatively phosphatidylinositol:mannose-inositol-P-ceramide phosphoinositol transferase). M(IP)2C synthase activity is inhibited in the micromolar range by aureobasidin A, but drug sensitivity is over 1000-fold lower than reported for IPC synthase activity. An ipt1-deletion mutant has no severe phenotypic effects but is slightly more resistant to growth inhibition by calcium ions. Identification of the IPT1 gene should be helpful in determining the function of the M(IP)2C sphingolipid and in determining the catalytic mechanism of IPC and M(IP)2C synthases.

Sphingolipids along with cholesterol and phosphoglycerolipids are the three major types of lipids found in biological membranes. The sphingolipids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are primarily located in the plasma membrane (1Patton J.L. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hechtberger P.

At present, we have only a general outline of the steps in S. cerevisiae sphingolipid biosynthesis (Fig.1) and know nothing about how the concentration of the intermediates and complex sphingolipids is regulated.

By using the S. cerevisiae genome sequence data base, we have now identified another sphingolipid biosynthetic gene, YDR072c, and renamedIPT1(inositolphosphotransferase1). This gene is necessary for synthesis of mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide (M(IP)2C 1The abbreviations used are: M(IP)2C, mannose-(inositol-P)2-ceramide; IPC, inositol-phosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannose-inositol-P-ceramide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. ; Ref.8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar), the terminal and most abundant S. cerevisiaesphingolipid (Fig. 1). Sphingolipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae begins with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to yield 3-ketosphinganine. This essentially irreversible reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (3-ketosphinganine synthase (EC 2.3.1.50); for review, see Ref. 9Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), a pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme. Further reactions convert 3-ketosphinganine to the long chain base sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine), which is N-fatty-acylated to yield dihydroceramide. Dehydrogenation of dihydroceramide in animals yields ceramide with the long chain base sphingosine, which is rapidly converted to sphingolipids by the addition of polar components to the 1-hydroxyl group. Most ceramides in fungi and plants containN-α-hydroxyfattyacylphytosphingosine (8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar), formed by undefined hydroxylation reactions. Phytosphingosine lacks the 4,5-double bond found in sphingosine and has instead an hydroxyl group at the 4-position. Molecular species with the same head groups have been recognized (8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar) that differ in hydroxylation of the long chain base and the fatty acid. The most abundant species, designated 3,e.g. M(IP)2C-3, contains phytosphingosine and αOH-hexacosanoic acid. A common modification to phytoceramide in S. cerevisiae and other fungi is addition of myoinositol phosphate to the 1-hydroxyl to form IPC, which is then mannosylated to yield mannose-inositol-P-ceramide (MIPC). The terminal step in S. cerevisiae sphingolipid synthesis is addition of inositol-P to MIPC to yield the major sphingolipid M(IP)2C. The later steps in sphingolipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae (Fig.1) are tentative because the enzymes have not been purified, the reaction requirements are poorly defined, and the stoichiometry has not been determined (reviewed in Ref. 8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). We recently identified a gene, AUR1, necessary for phosphatidylinositol:ceramide phosphoinositol transferase (IPC synthase) activity (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The gene most likely encodes the IPC synthase enzyme or a subunit of the enzyme whose subunit structure is unknown. IPC synthase appears to catalyze a reaction very similar to the one catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol:mannose-inositol-P-ceramide phosphoinositol transferase (M(IP)2C synthase), since both transfer inositol-P from phosphatidylinositol to ceramide or a ceramide-containing compound. This similarity suggested that there might be a protein in S. cerevisiae with similarity to the Aur1 protein. Using the Aur1 protein as a query, we found a protein in the S. cerevisiae genome data base, encoded byIPT1, that appeared to be related to the Aur1 protein. We show here that IPT1 is indeed necessary for M(IP)2C synthase activity and for synthesis of M(IP)2C. Strain RCD113 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ipt1-Δ1) was derived from strain YPH250 (10Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by gene transplacement of the YDR072c (IPT1) open reading frame with the ipt1-Δ1 allele, made by replacing the coding region of IPT1 with the HIS3 gene using the polymerase chain reaction as described by Baudin et al.(11Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Correct gene transplacement was verified by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). The composition of defined and complex media has been described previously (12Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in shaker flasks at 30 °C unless indicated otherwise in the text. Cells were cultured for 21 h (initial A 650 = 0.1) at 30 °C in a medium consisting of 1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.05% Tergitol, 1% KH2PO4, 0.05 m sodium succinate, pH 5.5, 1 μg/ml inositol, 4% glucose, and 20 μCi/ml [2-3H]myoinositol (American Radiochemicals, Inc., 20 Ci/mmol). Cells (5 ml) were treated with trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% and chilled for 15 min on ice. After twice washing with water, cells were extracted with 2 ml of Solvent E, diethylether/95% ethanol/water/pyridine/concentrated ammonia (5:15:15:1:0.018), v/v) for 60 min at 60 °C (13Hanson B.A. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 309-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 0.5-ml portion of the Solvent E lipid extract was dried under nitrogen and deacylated by treatment with 0.5 ml of monomethylamine reagent (14Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by evaporation to dryness. The dried sample was resuspended in 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5), and 10-μl samples of the neat and deacylated lipid extracts were subjected to high performance TLC on 20-cm Whatman HP-K plates developed with chloroform/methanol/4.2 n ammonia (9:7:2); each lane also contained a mixture of yeast sphingolipids, IPC-3, IPC-4, MIPC-3 (2 μg each), and 1.2 μg of M(IP)2C-3 (8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by using a BioScan apparatus, and the sphingolipid standards were detected after spraying the TLC plate with 10% CuSO4·5H2O in 8% phosphoric acid, followed by charring at 160 °C (15Fewster M.E. Burns B.J. Mead J.F. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 43: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sphingolipids in the deacylated lipid extract were also detected after thin layer chromatography of larger samples (125 μl) on 20-cm Whatman K5 plates developed with the same solvent as above. The plate was first treated with orcinol reagent (16Skipski V.P. Barclay M. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 545-546Google Scholar) to detect the carbohydrate-containing sphingolipids, MIPC and M(IP)2C, and then treated with the CuSO4/phosphoric acid reagent as above. Membranes were prepared as described previously (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Lipid additions, [3H]phosphatidylinositol (2 × 106 dpm), MIPC-3 (50 nmol), and aureobasidin A were dried in a tube and treated in a sonic water bath after addition of the following (final concentrations): CHAPS (2 mm), KPO4 (50 mm, pH 7.0), and water. Membranes (0–120 μg of protein) were added, and the mixture (final volume, 100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 50 mm disodium EDTA, 0.64 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and 2.25 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5). After centrifugation, the supernatant fluid was added to a 1-ml column of AG4-X4 resin (200–400-mesh, Bio-Rad), packed using water in a Pasteur pipette, washed sequentially with six volumes of 3 n acetic acid, five volumes of water, and then with methanol followed by equilibration with chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5). After sample addition, the column was washed to remove the bulk of the phosphatidylinositol with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5), 3 ml of 0.005 m ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5), 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5). The M(IP)2C as well as some remaining phosphatidylinositol were eluted with 3 ml of 0.4 mammonium hydroxide in chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5), dried under nitrogen, deacylated with 0.5 ml monomethylamine reagent (14Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 50 °C, dried under nitrogen, and dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (16:16:5). For quantification, samples were chromatographed on EDTA-treated silica gel-impregnated paper (Whatman SG81) by using chloroform/methanol/4.2 n ammonia (9:7:2, v/v) (17Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). M(IP)2C migrated to an R F of 0.3, and the water-soluble products, mainly glycerophosphoinositol, remained near the origin. Each lane was cut into 1-cm zones, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For qualitative analysis, samples were chromatographed on high performance silica gel plates (Whatman HP-K) with the solvent chloroform/methanol/4.2n ammonia (9:7:2, v/v). Radioactivity was determined by using a Bioscan apparatus. Each sample contained approximately 1 μg of M(IP)2C-3, which was detected by charring the plate at 160 °C (15Fewster M.E. Burns B.J. Mead J.F. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 43: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural homologs of the Aur1 protein were searched for in the S. cerevisiaegenome data base by using the FASTA algorithm (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Only one putative homolog, Ipt1 (YDR072c, GenBank accession no. Z46796x5), was identified. No function had been attributed to the predicted Ipt1 protein, which shows 27% amino acid identity to the Aur1 protein over a region of 365 amino acids (Fig. 2). To determine if IPT1 is necessary for synthesis of M(IP)2C, sphingolipids were radiolabeled by growing cells long term in the presence of [3H]myoinositol. Extracted radioactive sphingolipids were either subjected to or not subjected to alkali-catalyzed deacylation, separated by high performance TLC, and located by using a BioScan apparatus. Comparison of the scans (Fig.3) to the authentic S. cerevisiae sphingolipid internal standards shows that theipt1-deletion strain RCD113 lacks the radioactive fraction representing the alkali-stable M(IP)2C species present in the scans of the lipids isolated from wild type YPH250 cells. Mutant strain RCD113 shows an increase in radiolabeled MIPC-3 (Fig. 3), indicating that this species of sphingolipid accumulates. Mutant cells carrying the SLC1–1 suppressor gene and unable to make sphingolipids when a long chain base is withheld from the culture medium, accumulate inositol-containing lipids in which the ceramide is replaced with diacylglycerols containing a C26-fatty acid (19Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No such lipids are evident in RCD113 cells (Fig. 3, bottom). To verify the absence of M(IP)2C and an increase in MIPC-3 in strain RCD113, non-radioactive deacylated lipid extracts were again analyzed by TLC and the plate was treated with the orcinol reagent to detect carbohydrates (mannose) and then charred to detect all the carbon-containing polar head groups. This analysis shows that M(IP)2C is not present in strain RCD113 and that the concentration of MIPC is elevated (Fig.4). The identity of these lipids was confirmed by their reaction with the orcinol reagent. M(IP)2C synthase activity was measured in membranes prepared from YPH250 and ipt1-mutant RCD113 cells by the incorporation of radiolabeled inositol into M(IP)2C from [3H-inositol]phosphatidylinositol. The reaction catalyzed by M(IP)2C synthase is not well characterized (8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar) but is believed to use MIPC and phosphatidylinositol as substrates. The [3H]M(IP)2C produced in the reaction was first analyzed by thin layer chromatography to verify that the correct product was being made. Membranes prepared from YPH250 but not from the mutant RCD113 cells make [3H]M(IP)2C, as judged by its co-migration with the internal M(IP)2C standard (Fig.5). Reactions conditions were then examined in more detail. Membranes from YPH250 cells produced [3H]M(IP)2C linearly with time and with the protein concentrations examined. No production of [3H]M(IP)2C was observed with membranes from RCD113 cells (Fig. 6). Omission of exogenous MIPC from the reaction mixture (TableI) reduces product formation by about 65%, consistent with this lipid being a substrate for the enzyme. We conclude from these data that RCD113 cells lack M(IP)2C synthase activity.Figure 6M(IP)2C synthase activity in membranes from strains YPH250 and RCD113 as a function of time and protein concentration. Membranes prepared from YPH250 and RCD113 cells were incubated with [3H]phosphatidylinositol, and the amount of [3H]M(IP)2C produced was quantified after paper chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIn vitro M(IP) 2 C synthesis: MIPC dependence, inhibition by aureobasidin AChanges in basal assay conditions[3H]M(IP)2C formedpmolNone40.5 ± 6Minus MIPC14.2 ± 1Plus aureobasidin A (0.1 μm)40.4 ± 2.6Plus aureobasidin A (0.5 μm)23.0 ± 6Plus aureobasidin A (1.0 μm)21.2 ± 2.1Plus aureobasidin A (5.0 μm)11.9 ± 3.8Synthesis of radioactive M(IP)2C by membranes (101 μg of protein) prepared from YPH250 cells in the presence of [3H-inositol]phosphatidylinositol was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” over a 2-h incubation period.

The data represent the average of duplicates. IPC synthase activity, presumably encoded by AUR1, is strongly inhibited by the antifungal drug aureobasidin A (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Since the Ipt1 protein is related to the Aur1 protein and each is required for expression of the IPC and M(IP)2C synthases, respectively, and since both enzymes utilize phosphatidylinositol as one of their substrates, catalyzing a similar phosphoinositol transfer, it was logical to examine the inhibition of M(IP)2C synthase by aureobasidin A. The data presented in Table I show that aureobasidin A strongly inhibits M(IP)2C synthase in the micromolar range, with 50% inhibition (IC50) at 0.5–1 μm. To begin to understand the function of M(IP)2C, we compared the behavior of RCD113 mutant and wild type YPH250 cells grown under a variety of conditions. Examination of mutant and wild type cells in log and stationary phase growth by light microscopy showed no difference in their size or morphology. Growth in a complex medium at 30 °C showed that RCD113 mutant cells grew as rapidly as parental YPH250 cells and to the same density during the course of this experiment (Fig.7), indicating that the lack of M(IP)2C had no adverse effect upon growth rate during log phase and early stationary phase growth nor upon the ability of cells to grow to a fairly high density. We had shown previously (21Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that one or more sphingolipids are necessary for S. cerevisiae cells to grow under stress conditions including incubation at 37 °C, in the presence of 0.75m NaCl, and at low pH. To determine if M(IP)2C is necessary for growth under these stress conditions, RCD113 mutant cells were tested for growth on PYED complex medium plates incubated at 37 °C, containing 0.75 m NaCl and incubated at 30 °C, or having a pH of 4.1 and incubated at 30 °C (12Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCD113 cells grew as well as wild type cells under all conditions (data not shown). Thus, M(IP)2C is not necessary for responding to these stresses. We have also observed that mutant yeast cells lacking sphingolipids (21Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are unable to be induced for what has been termed induced thermotolerance, in which survival at an elevated temperature (greater than about 45 °C) can be enhanced by preincubation at an intermediate temperature, generally 37 °C (reviewed in Ref. 22Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Loboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar). To determine if M(IP)2C lipids play a role in induced thermotolerance, early log phase RCD113 and YPH250 cells were incubated at 25 °C or 37 °C for 30 min and transferred to 52 °C, and surviving cells were measured at 0, 20, and 40 min. Survival was the same for both strains, and both survived the 52 °C treatment better after preincubation at 37 °C, indicating that thermotolerance had been induced (data not shown). We conclude from these data that induction of thermotolerance does not require M(IP)2C lipids. Sphingolipids are believed to reach the plasma membrane by the protein secretory pathway. Most sphingolipids would initially be in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane with their polar head group pointed toward the yeast cell wall. To determine if the absence of M(IP)2C in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and the consequent loss of negative charge affected the cell wall, we compared the sensitivity of mutant RCD 113 and wild type cells to lysis after digestion with a glucanase as described previously (12Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay has been shown to be a measure of the integrity of the mannoprotein layer on the exterior of the cell wall (23van der Vaart J.M. Caro L.H.P. Chapman J.W. Klis F.M. Verrips C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3104-3110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCD113 mutant cells were found to be as resistant to digestion as wild type cells (data not shown), indicating that the outer mannoprotein layer of the wall was not altered by the absence of M(IP)2C. Cells carrying a mutation in either the csg1 orcsg2 gene do not make either MIPC or M(IP)2C and are inhibited for growth by high concentrations of calcium (5Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon these data, it seemed possible that RCD113 cells might be more sensitive to calcium ions than wild type cells. Contrary to our expectation, RCD113 cells were slightly more resistant to growth inhibition by calcium than were wild type cells (TableII).Table IIGrowth inhibition by calciumCalciumA 600 nmYPH250RCD113 (ipt1-Δ1)mm 01.662.1 101.672.3 500.321.221000.0960.312000.0230.083Cells were grown in PYED medium containing the indicated concentration of calcium chloride to an A 600 nm of 0.6, diluted into 2 ml of fresh medium to give 105 cells/ml and grown 17 h with aeration at 30 °C. The final cell density atA 600 nm is shown. Open table in a new tab Cells were grown in PYED medium containing the indicated concentration of calcium chloride to an A 600 nm of 0.6, diluted into 2 ml of fresh medium to give 105 cells/ml and grown 17 h with aeration at 30 °C. The final cell density atA 600 nm is shown. Haploid RCD113 cells were able to mate with cells of the opposite mating type (W303–1B) at a frequency of about 50% (24Sprague G.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which is the same frequency we found for parental YPH250 cells, indicating that M(IP)2C lipids are not necessary for mating. Diploid RCD113 and YPH250 cells, made by transformation of haploid cells with pHO12 (25Russell D.W. Jensen R. Zoller M.J. Burke J. Errede B. Smith M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4281-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and selection of large, diploid-like cells, sporulated at about the same frequency (20% for RCD113 and 25% for YPH250), indicating that M(IP)2C lipids are not essential for sporulation. Here, we present evidence that the IPT1 gene is necessary for synthesis of M(IP)2C, the major and terminal sphingolipid in S. cerevisiae. This assignment is based upon that fact that ipt1-deleted RCD113 cells fail to make M(IP)2C and, instead, make increased amounts of MIPC (Figs.3 and 4), the precursor to M(IP)2C (Fig. 1). In addition, membranes prepared from RCD113 cells lack M(IP)2C synthase activity since they fail to make [3H]M(IP)2C from [3H-inositol]phosphatidylinositol (Figs. 4 and5). The observation that mutant RCD113 cells compensate for the loss of M(IP)2C lipids and make a nearly equal amount of MIPC lipids indicates that S. cerevisiae cells have a mechanism for sensing their total sphingolipid content. MIPC and M(IP)2C may be alternate fates of the ceramide available for sphingolipid synthesis. Attempts to identify a function for M(IP)2C lipids were inconclusive since RCD113 mutant cells grew as well as non-mutant cells in both complex and defined media and under a variety of stress conditions that are known to inhibit growth of cells that lack sphingolipids (21Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RCD113 cells may not exhibit obvious phenotypes because the elevated level of MIPC may compensate for some functions of M(IP)2C. The limited available data indicate that, as long as S. cerevisiae cells make at least one type of sphingolipid, they are viable under non-stressful laboratory conditions. For example, mutant cells lacking mannosylated sphingolipids (5Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but containing at least one species of IPC, grow well if given 10 mm calcium. However, these mutants have not been extensively tested for mutant phenotypes. S. cerevisiae cells lacking any sphingolipids grow under non-stressful conditions but are killed by stresses, indicating a role(s) for sphingolipids in stress resistance (21Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Finally, no wild type fungus has been reported to exist without making sphingolipids. In addition to S. cerevisiae (26Steiner S. Smith S. Waechter C.J. Lester R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar),Cryptococcus neoformans (27Vincent V.L. Klig L.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Candida albicans(28Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are known to contain M(IP)2C, whereas Neurospora crassa contains a major lipid with the composition (inositol-P)2-ceramide (28Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histoplasma capsulatum makes several mannosylated sphingolipids but not M(IP)2C when growing in the yeast phase (29Barr K. Lester R.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5581-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Barr K. Laine R.A. Lester R.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RCD113 cells were slightly more resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of calcium ions than were non-mutant YPH250 cells (Table II). Mutations in seven complementation groups, SCS1–7, give resistance to calcium-inhibited growth of a strain mutated in thecsg2 gene (5Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The scs mutant strains all have altered sphingolipid metabolism, and one complementation group,SCS1, is identical to the LCB2 gene (4Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), necessary for the first step in sphingolipid synthesis (Fig. 1). Based upon these results, it has been suggested that sphingolipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae is either regulated by Ca2+and/or is required for Ca2+ homeostasis (5Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium resistance phenotype of RCD113 cells is consistent with these possibilities. Finally, because their synthesis has been conserved and because of their abundance, the M(IP)2C lipids must perform an important function(s) that awaits identification. M(IP)2C synthase activity is found in membranes (33Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 747-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Ipt1 protein sequence indicates seven predicted membrane-spanning domains (34Hofmann K. Stroffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Several of these transmembrane domains correspond to predicted transmembrane domains in the Aur1 protein (Fig. 2), suggesting that these proteins have related membrane topologies. However, the predicted inside-outside orientation of some of the transmembrane domains are opposite in the two proteins, and experimental analysis will be required to verify the correct topology and existence of the transmembrane domains. IPC synthase activity is strongly inhibited by the antifungal drug aureobasidin A, with 50% inhibition seen at a concentration of 0.2 nm (6Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Because M(IP)2C synthase and IPC synthase both use phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (Fig. 1) and because of their amino acid sequence similarity (Fig. 2), we examined M(IP)2C synthase for inhibition by aureobasidin A. Our data demonstrate that M(IP)2C synthase activity is strongly inhibited by the drug (Table I), but the enzyme is 2500–5000-fold less sensitive to inhibition than is IPC synthase activity. Further kinetic experiments with both enzymes, native and mutant forms (see below), along with analogues of aureobasidin, could be fruitful in pinpointing the catalytic sites in these enzymes. Mutations in the AUR1 gene are known to give resistance to aureobasidin A. One resistant strain has Leu-137 replaced by Phe and His-157 replaced by Tyr (35Heidler S.A. Radding J.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2765-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas another resistant strain has Phe-158 replaced by Tyr (36Hashida-Okado T. Ogawa A. Endo M. Yasumoto R. Takesako K. Kato I. MGG. 1996; 251: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 157 and 158 are particularly interesting because they lie in a region whose amino acid sequence has been well conserved between the Aur1 and Ipt1 proteins (Fig. 2). This region is predicted to be a membrane-spanning domain and since there would be no strong evolutionary pressure to conserve the amino acid sequence simply to maintain the membrane-spanning function, the conservation of residues suggests some other shared function. We speculate, based upon the amino acid conservation, the predicted transmembrane domains, and the location of the aureobasidin A-resistant mutations, that the region of Aur1p from around residue 146 (residue 186 in Ipt1p) to around 259 (residue 302 in Ipt1p) is the catalytic core of the two enzymes that interacts with the hydrophobic portion of one or both lipid substrates. Furthermore, we speculate that the conserved non-membrane-bound region from around residue 300 in Aur1p (residue 323 in Ipt1p) to the C terminus of the protein (residue 409 in Ipt1p) recognizes the polar head-group in phosphatidylinositol. The corresponding regions in Ipt1p would perform similar functions. The availability of the complete S. cerevisiae genomic sequence provides the first opportunity to identify all genes and proteins necessary for sphingolipid synthesis in any organism. Knowledge of the genes should enable characterization of the cognate proteins and enzymes and this information should expedite the task of understanding how sphingolipid synthesis is regulated in S. cerevisiae. Since it is not known how sphingolipid synthesis is regulated in any organism, insight gained from S. cerevisiaemay provide clues to regulation in other eucaryotes. In addition, the level of sphingolipid metabolic intermediates, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine and ceramide, thought to be signaling molecules that regulate expression of at least some of the many yeast genes whose promoter contains an STRE (stress response element), increases during heat stress by an unknown mechanism. 2R. C. Dickson, E. E. Nagiec, G. B. Wells, M. M. Nagiec, and R. L. Lester, submitted for publication. Knowledge of sphingolipid biosynthetic genes and proteins should facilitate studies to understand how heat stress regulates the level of these intermediates."

Inhibition of Notch-1 expression or function decreased the expression of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors δ and γ, transcription factors that control adipocyte differentiation and that are up-regulated at cell confluence. These results implicate Notch in the commitment of 3T3-L1 cells to undergo adipogenesis by controlling the expression of the principal regulators of this process. The Notch gene family has been the object of extensive investigation in both vertebrates and invertebrates (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E.

In invertebrates, these motifs participate in cell-to-cell like interactions that ultimately regulate differentiation decisions during development (6Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1245-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The invertebrate EGF-like proteins Delta and Serrate and their mammalian counterparts have been identified as ligands of Notch-1 (10Bettenhausen B. Deangelis M.H. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gossler A.

In the case of Drosophila and Xenopus, these ligands have been reported to interact with EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch to trigger its activation (6Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that activated Notch functions by maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated state (12Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The role of Notch in the differentiation of mammalian cells is, however, still incompletely understood. An activated Notchmutant has been shown to suppress neurogenesis and myogenesis, but not gliogenesis in P19 cells (13Nye J.S. Kopan R. Axel R. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An inhibitory effect on the function of MyoD1 has been demonstrated in the C2C12 myoblast model (14Kopan R. Nye J.S.

Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), we chose this well studied differentiation model to further explore the role of mammalian Notch-1. 3T3-L1 cells are of mesenchymal origin and are committed to undergo adipocyte differentiation when grown to confluence and treated with a combination of hormones, including glucocorticoids and insulin-like growth factor 1/insulin. Following activation of the Ras signaling cascade (19Benito M. Porrás A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Porrás A. Nebreda A.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cells undergo gene expression changes that lead to a morphological and biochemical metamorphosis toward the adipocyte phenotype. Cells become round and accumulate lipids in the form of cytoplasmic droplets easily detected by phase-contrast microscopy or when stained with lipophilic agents. The genetic and biochemical changes associated with differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells have been extensively studied (reviewed in Refs. 18MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar and 22Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), supporting thisin vitro model as representative of in vivoadipogenesis. For instance, in vitro differentiated adipocytes can be injected into animals, where they form adipose tissue indistinguishable from normal (23Green H. Kehinde O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The transcription factors that regulate the biochemical and morphological changes leading to adipocyte differentiation belong to the CAATT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and the thyroid/steroid family. Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), members of the latter family, are activated by fatty acid metabolites (24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

A. 1994; 92: 9856-9860Crossref Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Adipocyte differentiation obtained by ectopic expression of c/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is mediated by an increase in PPARγ expression (35Wu Z.D. Xie Y.H. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 9: 2350-2363Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PPARγ plays a key role as a “master regulator” of the adipocyte differentiation process. We transfected 3T3-L1 cells with a partial Notch-1 construct encompassing an intracellular region of the protein containing the six intracellular ankyrin repeats in either sense or antisense orientation. Differentiation was not affected by ectopic Notchtransfected in the sense orientation. AntisenseNotch-1-transfected cells, however, lost their ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation, an effect that correlated with the inhibition of Notch protein expression in these cells. Moreover, differentiation could also be inhibited by treatment of normal cells with a soluble recombinant protein containing exclusively EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch-1 (Hurn1EGF1112) or with an antiserum directed against the same EGF-like repeats. Inhibition of Notch-1 expression correlated with morphological changes similar to those induced by culturing 3T3-L1 cells in delipidated medium, a condition that inactivates PPARs (36Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Analysis of some members of the PPAR family showed that their expression was decreased in the antisenseNotch-1-transfected cells or in cells treated with the recombinant Hurn1EGF1112 protein, whereas the expression of other transcription factors remained unchanged. These results support the conclusion that the expression of Notch-1 is required for adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and that Notch-1 participates in the cell-to-cell interactions that modulate the expression of the transcription factors that regulate this differentiation process. 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2 in air. Differentiation assays were performed as described previously (19Benito M. Porrás A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 10-cm plates and allowed to grow until confluence. After 1–2 days in this state, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and 500 nm dexamethasone (Sigma). Two days later, the medium was replaced with regular medium to which insulin was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. The cells were maintained in this medium for 5–7 days, with media replacement each 2 days. At the end of this period, differentiation was assessed by red oil O (Sigma) staining and microscopic examination. Hurn1EGF1112 protein or rabbit antisera against the same protein or control antisera were added at the beginning of the differentiation process and maintained at the indicated concentrations for the duration of the differentiation assay. Cell transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were selected in 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Subcloning of hygromycin-resistant cells was performed by limiting dilution and recovery of individual cell colonies. The Notch-1construct used for the experiments described here was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of human spleen total RNA using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and a PCR reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer). The sequence of the sense oligonucleotide is 5′-agtgtctgaggccagcaagaagaa-3′, and that of the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-gaggggcacggacggagact-3′. The region amplified is 1372 nucleotides long and corresponds to the intracellular Notch-1 region containing the ankyrin/Cdc10 repeats from amino acids 1776 to 2232 of the human TAN-1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number M73980). The blunt-end PCR product was cloned into the PvuII site of the plasmid pEBVHisA (Invitrogen) to produce in-frame sense and antisense expression constructs. Production of a human recombinant protein composed of EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch-1 (Hurn1EGF1112) was accomplished by RT-PCR amplification from human spleen total RNA. The primers used had the following sequences: 5′-acaccatggctgcagaattccatcatcatcatcatcatcaggacgtggatgagtgct-3′ for the sense oligonucleotide and 5′-gataagcttggatcctcatcatgtgttgacctcgcagtgca-3′ for the antisense oligonucleotide. This fragment spanned from positions 1231 to 1471 of the human TAN-1 (Notch-1) sequence. The primers were designed to encode an additional six-histidine tag to enable purification of the recombinant protein by affinity chromatography through nickel columns. The PCR fragment was cloned in PLD101, a bacterial expression plasmid developed for the expression of functional proteins rich in disulfide bonds, as described previously (37Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6427-6435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen). The recombinant protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. This protein was used to study its effect on differentiation and to produce rabbit antisera. Analysis of the expression of Notch-1, PPARγ, and PPARδ in 3T3-L1 cells was performed by RT-PCR from 2 μg of RNA isolated from these cells. RNA was isolated by using the QIAGEN total RNA purification kit according to the manufacturer's directions. First strand cDNA was prepared by using a reverse transcriptase cDNA kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The upper and lower primers used were 5′-gtgtgtggatgagggagataa-3′ and 5′-ggcatagacagcggtagaaa-3′ for Notch-1, 5′-ttgagtgccgagtctgtggggataa-3′ and 5′-cagggaggccagcatcgtgtaga-3′ for PPARγ, 5′-gaggcccgggaagaggagaaagaggaagtg-3′ and 5′-tgaggaagaggctgctgaagttggggatgt-3′ for PPARδ, 5′-cccggccgccttcaacgacgagttc-3′ and 5′-gatgccccgcagcgtgtccagttca-3′ for C/EBPα, 5′-ccgccgcccgccgcctttaga-3′ and 5′-ccgccgtcagctccagcaccttgtg-3′ for C/EBPβ, 5′-ccgacctcttcaacagcaaccacaaag-3′ and 5′-gcatgcgcagtctcttcctcttatctacaaaa-3′ for C/EBPδ, 5′-ccccagctcaccaaatgaccctgttacc-3′ and 5′-accttctccctcaacgcctccacctc-3′ for retinoid X receptor α, and 5′-agacagctcctccccaaatcccctttct-3′ and 5′-tggccaggcacttctgatagcgacagt-3′ for retinoid X receptor β, respectively. As a RNA loading and quality control, 36B4/P0 phosphoriboprotein (38Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was also amplified. The primers used for this amplification were 5′-gcactttcgctttctggagggtgtc-3′ for the sense oligonucleotide and 5′-tgacttggttgctttggcgggattag-3′ for the antisense oligonucleotide. PCR negative controls, containing all reagents except cDNA, were set in all cases. To ensure PCR specificity, we used two-step PCR cycles of extension/annealing at 68–70 °C for 2 min and denaturing at 95 °C for 2 s. The specificity of the primers was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis showing unique bands of the expected sizes. To further confirm specificity, PCR products were sequenced and cloned in PCR II (Invitrogen), and several minipreps were sequenced. Western blots for the analysis of Notch-1 expression in the 3T3-L1 cells and transfectants were performed according to classical procedures (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar) using the rabbit antisera raised against the recombinant Hrun1EGF1112 protein. Detection of bound antibody was performed by incubation with 125I-protein A (Amersham Corp.). Pools of hygromycin-resistant 3T3-L1 cells transfected with sense or antisenseNotch-1 constructs were analyzed for their ability to undergo adipocyte differentiation upon treatment with differentiating agents. The cells transfected with sense Notch-1 did not show any changes in their differentiation potential when compared with either vector-transfected or normal cells. However, cells stably transfected with antisense Notch-1 completely lost their ability to differentiate to adipocytes, as determined by the absence of morphological changes and lipid accumulation characteristic of the adipocyte phenotype (Fig.1 A). This behavior could be observed in individual clones. Following a second transfection with the same antisense Notch construct, the antibiotic-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution. During this process, we observed two morphologically distinct types of clones (Fig. 1 B). The first type (type N) consisted of cells morphologically indistinguishable from normal 3T3-L1 cells that grew in contact with each other as they expanded from the original cell founder of the colony. The second type of colony (type E) consisted of cells that showed a fusiform or elongated morphology and avoided contact with each other as they multiplied. When isolated and allowed to grow to confluence, cell-to-cell contact was re-established. At confluence, some type E clones formed a monolayer indistinguishable from parental cells (type E1), whereas others formed a more ordered monolayer (type E2) (Fig. 1 B) similar to primary fetal mouse fibroblasts in culture. All the above clones, regardless of their morphology, were unable to differentiate toward the adipocyte phenotype. Type E1 clones, however, when treated at confluence with differentiating agents, underwent morphological changes that made them resemble type E2 clones (data not shown). No morphological changes were observed with the other antisense Notch-1 clone types when treated under the same conditions. Morphological changes or lack of differentiation was not observed in a similar number of clones isolated from mock or senseNotch-1 transfections. Analysis of Notch-1 expression by RT-PCR in normal or transfected cells showed that transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with antisense Notch-1diminished the expression of the Notch-1 gene (Fig.2 A). The extent of decrease in Notch-1 mRNA levels correlated well with the acquisition of the elongated morphology, as confirmed by a semiquantitative RT-PCR comparison of Notch-1 expression in type N clones, showing no morphological changes, and type E clones, showing elongated morphology (Fig. 2 B). We next analyzed whether the decrease in Notch-1 mRNA expression detected by RT-PCR resulted in diminished protein expression levels. A Western blot, performed with normal and antisense transfected cell extracts and antisera raised against EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch-1, showed that Notch-1 protein expression was exclusively detected in normal cells (Fig. 2 C). 3T3-L1 antisense transfectants and SUP-T1, a T-cell leukemia line that does not express intact Notch-1 (40Ellison L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), showed no detectable expression. Absence of membrane expression of Notch-1 protein in the antisense transfected clones was also evidenced by flow cytometry (data not shown). These results demonstrated that transfection with the antisenseNotch-1 construct caused an inhibition of the expression of both Notch-1 mRNA and protein levels. The morphological changes observed in type E1 and E2 clones, which show the largest decrease in Notch-1 expression, resembled the changes observed in 3T3-L1 cells cultured in delipidated medium (Ref. 36Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and data not shown). Under these conditions, activation of the fatty acid metabolite-dependent transcription factors of the PPAR family is inhibited, and adipocyte differentiation does not occur. The striking similarity of the morphological features among some of our antisense transfectant clones and normal cells grown in delipidated medium suggested that Notch-1 inhibition could have an effect on the regulation of the expression of the PPAR family of transcription factors. RT-PCR analysis of the expression levels of two members of this family indicated that while type N clones showed detectable but extremely low levels of PPARγ, no expression of this transcription factor was observed in type E clones (Fig.3, upper panel). The expression of PPARδ was also diminished in both types of clones. This indicates a correlation between the expression of PPARγ and the absence of morphological changes. The inability to differentiate correlated also with the profound decrease in PPARδ and PPARγ, consistent with the key role of these transcription factors in adipogenesis. We also analyzed the expression of other transcription factors potentially involved in adipocyte differentiation. The expression of these transcription factors in nondifferentiated cells was unaffected by transfection with antisense Notch-1 (Fig. 3, lower panels). As happened for PPARγ and PPARδ, antisenseNotch-1 cells induced to differentiate did not up-regulate C/EBPα, although they could down-regulate retinoid X receptor β. The expression of C/EBPβ could not be detected either in nondifferentiated cells or in cells treated to differentiate, including normal 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). Thus, it appears that Notch-1 specifically regulates the expression of members of the PPAR family. In all cell models studied, in vitro adipogenesis requires induction at confluence (11Fleming R.J. Scottgale T.N. Diederich R.J. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 40Ellison L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell-to-cell contact is a prerequisite for differentiation. The observations reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that Notch signaling triggered by cell-to-cell contact at confluence is a necessary condition for differentiation. This hypothesis was tested by blocking a potential site for ligand interaction with Notch-1 in 3T3-L1 cells. Two EGF-like repeats, EGF-like repeats 11 and 12, have been reported to constitute the conserved region of ligand interaction for Delta and Serrate inDrosophila. A recombinant Drosophila Notch protein devoid of the other 34 EGF-like repeats of the extracellular domain has been shown to maintain interaction with these ligands. The same EGF-like repeats of Xotch, the Xenopus homolog ofDrosophila Notch, have also been shown to interact withDrosophila Delta (6Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was induced in the presence of various concentrations of a recombinant protein encompassing EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch-1 (HurnEGF1112). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was also induced in the presence of a rabbit antiserum directed against Hurn1EGF1112 as another method to prevent potential Notch-1/ligand interaction. The results of these experiments showed that differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was significantly inhibited in the presence of 0.1 μmHurn1EGF1112, and 1 μm Hurn1EGF1112 completely inhibited adipocyte differentiation (Fig.4 A). In addition, a 1:100 dilution of the rabbit antiserum directed against EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch-1 had identical effects and totally inhibited the differentiation, whereas preimmune serum and other antisera raised against irrelevant antigens had no effect. No morphological changes were observed in the Hurn1EGF1112- or antiserum-treated cells, presumably reflecting residual Notch signal levels. We then studied whether the inhibition of differentiation caused by the recombinant Hurn1EGF1112 protein was associated with decreased levels of expression of PPAR transcription factors. RT-PCR analysis of the expression of PPARγ and PPARδ (Fig. 4 B) showed that 3T3-L1 cells treated with Hurn1EGF1112 had decreased levels of these transcription factors. These results suggest that molecular interference with the normal Notch-1/ligand interaction produces the same effects as the inhibition of Notch-1 expression by genetic means. Thus, Notch-1 function is necessary for the expression of transcription factors of the PPAR family in confluent 3T3-L1 cells. We have observed that abrogation of Notch-1 expression or signaling prevents hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. This effect correlated with down-regulation of PPARγ and PPARδ transcription factors. In addition to its role in the development and differentiation of the nervous system, Notch-1 has been shown to participate in the signaling events controlling the differentiation of Drosophila and mammalian cells of mesodermal origin (12Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 41Corbin V. Michelson A.M. Abmayr S.M. Neel V. Alcamo E. Maniatis T. Young M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 311-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with a requirement for Notch-1 in permitting terminal differentiation of mammalian mesodermal cells toward the adipocyte phenotype. We have taken into consideration the potential role of Notch-2, Notch-3, and Notch-4/Int-3 in the control of adipogenesis. 3T3-L1 cells express Notch-2 and Notch-3, but not Int-3 (data not shown). Antisense clones showed no diminished levels of Notch-2 expression. Notch-3, however, was diminished to some extent in the antisense clones (data not shown). Based on these data, a function for Notch-3 in the control of adipogenesis cannot be completely ruled out. Nevertheless, the biological agents used to block Notch-1 interactions are specific for Notch-1. In particular, the anti-Notch-1 antisera able to block differentiation cannot interact with Notch-2 or Notch-3. Taken together, these data indicate that the control of adipogenesis is a function specific of Notch-1, but not Notch-2 or Notch-3. Lindsell et al. (12Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) have proposed that the role of activated Notch-1 is to maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state. This is accomplished by inhibiting the expression or the activity of transcription factors of the helix-loop-helix family. Among these, the Achaete-Scute family of transcription factors inDrosophila and MyoD1 transcription factors have been shown to be targets of Notch action (14Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H.

Baeuerle P.A. Hoffman T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Notch-1, however, is expressed at high levels in certain terminally differentiated cells, such as neurons and T-lymphocytes (40Ellison L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 45Ahmad I. Zaqouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The permissive role of Notch-1 in adipocyte differentiation described here involves maintenance of the expression of transcription factors of the steroid/thyroid family. Interestingly, hormonal down-regulation of c-Myc, a transcription factor of the helix-loop-helix family whose overexpression inhibits adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (29Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), is not affected in the antisense Notch-1 transfectants (data not shown). PPARγ is the most prominent player in the transcriptional control of adipogenesis. When activated by its ligands, PPARγ alone is able to drive the complete adipogenic process (24Forman B.M.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). In addition, other transcription factors involved in adipogenesis appear to act by increasing the expression of PPARγ (35Wu Z.D. Xie Y.H. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 9: 2350-2363Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). PPARγ transcriptional effects are activated by fatty acid metabolites (24Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M.

Commun. 1994; 204: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that growth factor inhibition of adipogenesis is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ (46Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Thus, PPARγ expression and activation appear to be the key control components for driving the cells to the adipocyte phenotype. PPARγ is expressed preferentially in adipose tissue (47Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and its expression increases during the process of adipogenesis (33Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 59Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The factors that control the preferential expression of PPARγ in preadipocytes and adipocytes are unknown. Our data suggest that Notch-1 is involved in the control of PPARγ gene expression through mechanisms independent of the hormonal induction of the adipocyte differentiation process and therefore controls adipogenesis upstream of PPARγ itself. The signal transduction events in which Notch participates are the object of intense research (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). The intracellular regions of the four Notch proteins contain six ankyrin/Cdc10 repeats, which appear to be necessary for signaling. The expression of truncated forms of some Notch family members spanning the ankyrin repeats has been implicated in the development of mammary tumors and T-cell leukemias (7Jhappan C. Gallahan D. Stahle C. Chu E. Smith G.H. Merlino G. Callahan R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 8Robbins J. Blondel B.J. Gallahan D. Callahan R. J.

Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Notch signaling may require processing by specific proteases that cleave the Notch intracellular region just distal to the transmembrane domain. The polypeptide released by this cleavage contains the ankyrin repeats (15Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) as well as other regions that appear to be involved in signal cross-talk (48Axelrod J.D. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Perrimon N. Science. 1996; 271: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). According to this model, upon interaction of Notch with its ligands, the intracellular region is released to the cytoplasm, from where it migrates to the nucleus to inhibit the expression or the function of transcription factors (12Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 15Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). These transcription factors, in turn, control the expression of genes involved in terminal differentiation. Binding of the intracellular region of Notch to the transcription factor Supressor of Hairless (Su(H)) in Drosophila or to its mammalian analog (CBF-1) has been reported to be necessary for Notch activity in some experimental models (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 49Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Notch signaling interacts with other signaling cascades that can be modulated by or that can modulate Notch signaling itself (48Axelrod J.D. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Perrimon N. Science. 1996; 271: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 50Blair S.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1822-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 51Hing H.K. Sun X.

Whether the same type of mechanism is involved in the regulation of the transcription factors described in this report remains to be established. However, since we detect a decrease in PPARγ expression in 3T3-L1 cells prior to any differentiation treatment, it is unlikely that changes in Notch-1 expression may affect the hormone-induced signal transduction pathways that lead to adipocyte differentiation. Nonetheless, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid region of Drosophila Notch is involved in the cross-talk with Wingless (48Axelrod J.D. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Perrimon N. Science. 1996; 271: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), homolog to the mammalian proto-oncogene Wnt-1, which has been implicated in the growth factor-dependent regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (55Pan M.G. Wang Y.H. Hirsch D.D. Labudda K. Stork P.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2005-2012PubMed Google Scholar). Since Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation participate in hormone-induced adipogenesis (19Benito M. Porrás A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Porrás A. Muszynski K. Rapp U.R. Santos E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Notch/Ras cross-talk may further participate in the regulation of differentiation. Notch-1 expression levels may influence the differentiation state of the cell and condition the interpretation of extracellular signals. A stoichiometric relationship between the expression of Notch-1 and its ligands has been shown to play a role in the development ofDrosophila. Thus, mutants expressing half the normal Notch levels can be rescued by another mutation in which Delta expression is also diminished in the same proportion (56Xu T. Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Scottgale T.N. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 464-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This phenomenon could be at play in 3T3-L1 cells. Pref−/dlk, another member of the transmembrane EGF-like homeotic protein family, has been reported to play a possible role in cell-to-cell communication prior to adipocyte differentiation (57Lee Y.L. Helman L. Hoffman T. Laborda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 58Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Commitment toward the adipocyte phenotype or the different morphologies produced by Notch-1 repression could depend on the levels of expression of Notch-1, its putative ligands, and the stoichiometric relationship between them. Although we failed to detect Notch-1 protein expression by Western blotting in all the 3T3-L1 antisense Notch-1-transfected clones, the different levels of Notch-1 mRNA expressed by these cells could impact on different Notch-1/ligand stoichiometric relationships related to the morphological and differentiation changes observed. Our results suggest that the levels of expression of Notch-1 are involved in the interpretation of extracellular signals. In this regard, the behavior of type E1 clones is representative. When treated to differentiate with the same hormones used to induce adipocyte differentiation, these cells undergo morphological changes toward a different fibroblast-like morphology. This shows that the cells did not become unresponsive to the signals, but rather, the same signals are interpreted in a different way. The requirement of Notch-1 function for the commitment of preadipocytes to differentiation shows that it actively participates in the acquisition of a new phenotype and suggests a novel function for Notch-1 in cell fate determination of mammalian cells.

Nir E. Am. J. Ped. Hem. Oncol. 1987; 9: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The disorder is lethal and generally ends in an accelerated phase characterized by infiltration of tissues by mononuclear cells. CHS is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait with similar disorders described in mice, mink, cattle, cats, and killer whales. The best studied of the animal disorders is the murine homologue of CHS designatedbeige. Cells from patients with CHS and from beige mice contain giant intracellular vesicles that cluster around the nucleus. Affected vesicles include lysosomes, melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and cytolytic granules. It is not known whether giant vesicles form because of a defect in vesicle fusion or fission (2Oliver C. Essner E. Lab. Invest. 1975; 32: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar, 3Spicer S.S. Sato A. Vincent R. Eguchi M. Poon K.C. Fed. Proc. 1981; 40: 1451-1455PubMed Google Scholar). The genes responsible for CHS and beige have been identified and are orthologous (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L.

Nature. 1996; 382: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), with the predicted sequence of the Beige/CHS protein yielding little insight into the protein's function. We demonstrate here that the murine Beige protein is a cytosolic protein expressed in most tissues. A deficiency of Beige protein results a perinuclear clustering of giant lysosomes. In contrast, overexpression of Beige protein results in abnormally small lysosomes, which localize to the periphery of cells. We suggest that the Beige protein is involved in regulating vesicle fission and not fusion. The pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) vector was used to make a recombinant fusion protein that contained glutathioneS-transferase (GST) linked to the carboxyl-terminal 89 kDa of the murine Beige protein (GenBank™ accession number U52461). This portion of the Beige protein contains the highly conserved BEACH domain and seven WD40 repeats (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H.

This construct was made using PCR to synthesize the beige gene portion using the F primer 5′-ACAGGATCCGCTGCAAGTGAATCCATCAGA-3′ containing an EcoRI site at its 5′ end and the R primer 5′-AGCGAATTCTCATCCAGCTGCGTAGCTGCT-3′ that contained a BamHI site at its 5′ end. These two primers were used with the high fidelity PCR polymerase Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) and a template cDNA plasmid named 22B (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which contains the last 5.6 kb of the murine beige gene. This mixture was amplified using a Perkin-Elmer PCR machine and the following PCR parameters: 94° C for 2 min hot start, followed by 94° C for 30 s, 53° C for 30 s, and 72° C for 4 min for 35 cycles. This reaction yielded the expected band of 2.37 kb, which was then cut withEcoRI and BamHI and gel purified. ThisEcoRI-BamHI fragment was cloned into theEcoRI-BamHI site of pGEX-2T using standard cloning techniques. Recombinant plasmids were recovered and assayed for production of the GST-Beige fusion protein (BP55). One clone was used for all of the large scale preparations of the GST-Beige fusion protein as per the manufacturer's instructions. The glutathione-Sepharose purified fusion protein was digested with thrombin to separate GST from the Beige protein portion. This digested protein mixture was run out on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue-R250 in distilled H20, and the 89-kDa recombinant Beige protein band excised. Some of this band was transferred to PVDF membranes, and the amino terminus was sequenced. The sequence obtained precisely matched the expected Beige protein sequence. This gel purified band was mixed 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. All following immunizations were similar except that incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used. After five boosts, immune serum was obtained from one rabbit that recognized the starting Beige antigen as determined by Western blotting. This serum was further purified by column chromatography in which the antigen was coupled to Sepharose beads using the manufacturers instructions (Pierce). Mouse fibroblasts (described in Refs. 4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L.

All cells used in this study, except the bg/bg cell line SB/Le, contained a G418 resistance gene provided by the plasmid pRV1 (8Srivastava A.K. Schlessinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and were grown in 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) without P/S. For production of the fibroblast protein extracts, confluent monolayers were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in ice cold FB buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm leupeptin (Sigma), 10 mm pepstatin A (Sigma), and 1 mm[4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride] (ICN)). Some experiments were done in a FB buffer that lacked sucrose but that contained 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were placed in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min to obtain a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). Mouse tissue homogenates were prepared as described above. Protein determinations were performed using the BCA method (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) as a standard. Postnuclear supernatants were fractionated over 10–60% (w/w) linear sucrose gradients for 3 h at 100,000 × g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient and pelleted at 200,000 × g for 90 min. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of a 1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, which contained the previously mentioned protease inhibitors, and then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Hexoseaminidase activity was assayed as described previously (9Edelson P.J. Erbs C.J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and refractive indices were determined on each gradient. All experiments were performed at least three times. Precast 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) or 5% SDS-PAGE gels that did not have a “stacker” were used to separate the protein extracts described above. The SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (Gelman Sciences) for 1–2 h using electrophoretic transfer buffer without methanol (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mmglycine). The filters were blocked by incubation in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 10% dry milk (Carnation) for 30 min at 37 °C or 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed using a 1:500 dilution of affinity purified rabbit anti-Beige antibodies diluted in TBST. For some experiments, the PVDF membranes were stripped in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol (stripping buffer) for 30 min at 50 °C and then reprobed. For antigen blocking experiments, either the starting GST-Beige fusion protein or GST was mixed with the diluted antibodies in TBST to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml and incubated overnight before addition to the PVDF membranes. The anti-G-Protein β subunit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and an anti-β COP antibody was obtained from Sigma and used at a 1:500 dilution. Cultured fibroblasts were incubated in 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran (10,000 molecular weight, Molecular Probes) in the standard culture medium described above for 18 h. The cells were washed twice with culture medium and chased for 2 h in culture medium lacking the fluorescent ligand. Culture medium was then replaced with 4 °C Hanks' minimal essential medium, and the samples were kept on ice throughout the remainder of the experiment. The cells were scraped and washed once in FB buffer followed by Dounce homogenization in 0.5 ml of FB plus protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min, and the PNS was collected and mixed with 2.5 ml of FACS loading buffer (275 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage operating with CellQuest software and equipped with a Coherent Enterprise argon laser (Coherent Laser Group) producing 225 mW at 488 nm. For this application the basic instrument configuration was altered by removing the beam expanding lens in the laser focusing optics, removing the ND1 filter in front of the forward light scatter (FSC) detector and setting the acquisition threshold at 150 on log side scatter (log SSC). All other optical filters for light scatter and fluorescence remained in the basic configuration recommended by the manufacturer for FITC fluorescence. Optical alignment was optimized using DNA QC 2-μm beads (Becton Dickinson) for log FSC, log SSC and log FL1 (FITC) fluorescence. Consistency of the alignment process was confirmed on a daily basis in two ways: For light scatter, a panel of four polystyrene beads ranging in size from 0.48 to 1.43 μm (Polysciences, Inc.) was analyzed, and peak channels were compared with previous results. For log FSC the largest bead appeared just above the 103 division on a four log scale (linear channels 1200–1300) and the smallest beads at or below the 101 division (linear channels 5–20). The log SSC peaks ranged from the 102 (linear channels 70–130) down to 101 (linear channels 5–20). In a similar manner, FITC sensitivity was standardized with a FITC Quantum fluorescence kit (Flow Cytometry Standards) that consisted of a blank bead and four beads ranging in fluorescent intensity from 10,000–256,000 mean equivalent fluorescent units. Before data acquisition, sample buffer was analyzed to assess the noise level due to scattered laser light, electronic noise, and particles in the buffer. For a 2-min data acquisition period, the noise level typically ranged from 1000 to 5000 events. All background events were nonfluorescent (i.e. they were relatively low in the first decade of the FL1 distribution), so a data acquisition gate was set to include only those events positive for FITC fluorescence (>101 for log FL1). Data on 50,000 fluorescent events were collected and stored in list mode files for off-line analysis using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickenson). Lysosome size was measured as forward scatter height (FSC), and different samples were compared by computing the mean and median forward scatter heights on all 50,000 fluorescent events. The data presented in Fig. 3 are representative of four different experiments, all of which gave similar results. The visualization of mouse fibroblast lysosomes was performed as described previously in Refs. 11Perou C.M. Kaplan J. Somatic Cell Mol.

Briefly, fibroblasts on coverslips were incubated in the above mentioned culture medium that contained either 0.5 mg/ml Lucifer Yellow-CH (Aldrich) or 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran (Molecular Probes) for 18 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with fresh medium without the fluorescent probe, followed by a chase in culture medium for at least 2 h. The cells were visualized and photographed using fluorescent microscopy as described in Ref. 12McVey Ward D. Perou C.M. Lloyd M.L. Kaplan J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Western blot analysis of YAC-complementedbg J/bg J fibroblasts or mouse lung extracts detected two proteins, one of approximately 400 kDa and a smaller band of 40 kDa (Fig. 1,A and B). The molecular mass of the large band is similar to the Beige protein's predicted molecular mass of 425 kDa (13Perou C.M. Pryor R.J. Naas T.P. Kaplan J. Genomics. 1997; 42: 336-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These bands, which were unaffected by preincubation of the antibodies with GST, were not observed when the antibodies were preincubated with the intact GST-Beige fusion protein (Fig. 1). The smaller band may represent the heterotrimeric G-protein β subunit, because an identically sized band was recognized by a commercially available antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of the mouse G-protein β subunit (data not shown). Cross-reactivity between these two proteins might be expected due to the presence of conserved WD40 repeats in the G-protein β subunit (14Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) and in the Beige protein (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H.

The cloning of the murine beige gene was confirmed by the identification of a unique mutation within the bg allele (15Kelley E.M. Res. News. Mouse News Lett. 1957; 16: 36Google Scholar), which is predicted to result in a truncated Beige protein that is missing the region of Beige that was used to create the GST-Beige fusion antigen (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat.

Fibroblasts from bg/bgmice lacked the 400-kDa band present in control mouse fibroblasts (Fig.1 B). The bg J allele has been shown to be associated with reduced levels of beige gene mRNA (6Barbosa M.D. Nguyen Q.A. Tchernev V.T. Ashley J.A. Detter J.C. Blaydes S.M. Brandt S.J. Chotai D. Hodgman C. Solari R.C.E. Lovett M. Kingsmore S.F. Nature. 1996; 382: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The 400-kDa band was absent from extracts ofbg J/bg J mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). In all tissue extracts, both control and mutant, a band larger than 400 kDa was also detected. This band could represent cross-hybridization to the CDC4L/BGL gene product (16Feuchter A.E. Freeman J.D. Mager D.L. Genomics. 1992; 13: 1237-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is a large gene of unknown function that is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and which is highly related (i.e. 50% identical over a 300-amino acid stretch) to the Beige/CHS protein (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We cloned the beige gene using a YAC complementation strategy in which YACs were introduced intobg J/bg J mouse fibroblasts (7Perou C.M. Justice M.J. Pryor R.J. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5905-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies we isolated two complemented cell lines (195-3 and 195-4), in which the beige gene was overexpressed as determined by Northern analysis (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Overexpression in these cells results from the amplification of the YACs as episomal DNA elements (7Perou C.M. Justice M.J. Pryor R.J. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5905-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western analysis of extracts from these two cell lines showed a very strong 400-kDa band (Fig. 1 B). This band was increased 13-fold in clone 195-3 and 6-fold in clone 195-4 compared with wild type cells. A third complemented cell line (113-1) that contained a different YAC also showed the expected 400-kDa band but at levels that were equal to those of control fibroblasts. Three cell lines (137-1, 151-1, and 151-2) that contained noncomplementing YACs did not show the 400-kDa band but still showed the unknown larger band (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the 400-kDa band is the Beige protein due to its presence in all YAC-complemented cell lines, its absence in all noncomplemented cell lines, and its absence in two beige mutants. Although thebeige gene mRNA is expressed at very low levels in vivo, it can be detected by reverse transcription-PCR in most tissues tested (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The 400-kDa Beige protein was detected in almost all mouse tissues tested, with the highest levels of expression seen in brain, spleen, and lung (Fig. 1 C), and undetectable levels seen in heart and small intestine. Most tissues examined showed expression levels similar to that seen in the control mouse fibroblasts. The 400-kDa band seen in control mouse tissues was absent in all bg/bg mouse tissues. Subcellular fractionation of homogenates from YAC-complemented cell lines or wild type mouse lung indicated that the Beige protein was cytosolic and was not associated with membranes. Subcellular fractionation using sucrose or Percoll gradients indicated that the Beige protein showed no association with lysosomes or any other definable organelle. Using a variety of buffer conditions and nucleotides (i.e. ATP, GTP, or GTPγS), we did not observe any association of the Beige protein with membranes (data not shown). Examination of the distribution of Beige protein in wild type and uncomplemented cells by indirect immunofluorescence showed a weak diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Examination of the YAC-complemented cell lines also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining, but the signal seen was significantly brighter than in wild type or mutant cells (data not shown). The immunofluorescence data are consistent with the biochemical data and indicate that the Beige protein is cytosolic. We examined the effects of Beige protein overexpression on lysosomal morphology using the fluorescent fluid phase marker Lucifer Yellow to visualize fibroblast lysosomes. All YAC-containing cell lines were derived from a C57BL/6J-bg J/bg J mouse fibroblast cell line (MCHSF2) that showed the classicbeige/CHS phenotype of a reduced number of giant lysosomes clustered near the nucleus (Fig.2 A and Refs. 4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat.

The control mouse fibroblast cell line, established from a C57BL/6J mouse, showed the typical wild type morphology of numerous small lysosomes that were scattered throughout the cell but that were predominantly located within the cell body (Fig. 2 C). The YAC-complemented clone 113-1, which contained wild type levels of Beige protein, showed a lysosomal morphology similar to control fibroblasts (Fig. 2 D). The two YAC-complemented overexpressing cell lines (195-3 and 195-4), however, showed a phenotype characterized by the presence of more peripheral lysosomes (Fig. 2, E andF). Approximately 50% of the cells in these two cell lines showed this altered phenotype, with another 45% displaying a wild type morphology and 5% displaying a beige phenotype. This phenotypic variability can be explained by the variability in the number of YAC copies per cell. Fluorescent in situhybridization studies, as well as cloning studies, indicated that these episomal YACs were unstable and were readily lost from cells (7Perou C.M. Justice M.J. Pryor R.J. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5905-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, the YAC-containing but noncomplemented clones 137-1 (Fig.2 B), 151-1, and 151-2 (data not shown) displayed the parental beige phenotype. All cell lines tested were maintained in 1 mg/ml G418, which was necessary to maintain the neomycin resistance gene that was contained on the YACs (7Perou C.M. Justice M.J. Pryor R.J. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5905-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cell line 137-1 showed YAC amplification equal to cell line 113-1, which represented 2–4-fold amplification of the YACs, whereas cell lines 195-3 and 195-4 had 12- and 6-fold amplifications, respectively. Visual examination of lysosomes in the YAC-complemented cell lines 195-3 and 195-4 suggested that they had smaller lysosomes than control cells. This observation was confirmed by quantifying lysosome size using a flow cytometric assay. As initially described by Murphy and colleagues, flow cytometric analysis can quantitatively determine the size and fluorescence intensity of individual intracellular endocytic vesicles within a crude cell homogenate (18Murphy R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8523-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Wilson R.B. Murphy R.F. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblast lysosomes were labeled with FITC-dextran using protocols that specifically label lysosomes as determined by the co-localization of the fluorescent ligand with the lysosomal enzyme hexoseaminidase on Percoll gradients (data not shown). The labeled cells were homogenized, and the PNS was analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage. As expected, the bg J/bg Jfibroblasts (MCHSF2) had a greater percentage of larger lysosomes when compared with either control (C57-2CF) or Beige overexpressing fibroblasts (195-4) (Fig. 3 A). The Beige overexpressing cell line 195-4 had a significantly larger number of smaller lysosomes than the wild type cell line. Similar results were obtained when the median or mean for the forward scatter height on all fluorescence positive events was determined (TableI). These measurements yield a relative number for the average size of lysosomes from one cell sample and allows for a direct comparison of the average vesicle size between different cell types. These data confirm the observation that the cells with the lowest amount of Beige protein or no Beige protein (bg J/bg J MCHSF2 cells orbg/bg SB/Le cells) have the largest lysosomes. Lysosome size was reduced upon expression of normal levels of Beige protein (C57-2CF and 113-1) and was further decreased in cells expressing the highest levels of Beige protein (195-3 and 195-4).Table ILysosome size in mutant and YAC-complemented fibroblast cell linesFibroblast cell linesMedianMeanSB/Le (bg/bg)45.3246.1MCHSF2 (bg J /bg J)43.7146.83C572CF (wild type)32.7832.03113–1 (YAC complemented)26.4227.47195–3 (Beige overexpressor)22.0723.12195–4 (Beige overexpressor)17.7819.55Flow analysis measurements were obtained on fluorescently labeled lysosomes in homogenates of fibroblasts as described under “Materials and Methods.” The median and mean for the forward scatter height on 50,000 fluorescence positive events was determined. Open table in a new tab Flow analysis measurements were obtained on fluorescently labeled lysosomes in homogenates of fibroblasts as described under “Materials and Methods.” The median and mean for the forward scatter height on 50,000 fluorescence positive events was determined. We have begun to define the function of the Beige/CHS protein by developing an affinity purified polyclonal antibody directed against the Beige protein and by observing the effects of overproduction of the Beige protein on lysosome morphology. The specific nature of our antibody preparation was established in five ways. First, a band of approximately 400 kDa was identified on Western blots in multiple mouse tissues and cell lines. The molecular mass of the Beige protein predicted by the gene sequence is 425 kDa. Second, this band was absent on Western blots from bg/bg andbg J/bg J mice. Third, the signal from the 400-kDa band was blocked by the addition of the GST-Beige fusion protein into the Western blotting mix but was not blocked by GST alone. Fourth, the 400-kDa band was present in all YAC-complemented cell lines but was missing in all noncomplemented lines. Finally, the 400-kDa band, seen on Western blots from YAC-complemented cell lines, was identical in size to the band seen in control mouse tissues. Experiments utilizing subcellular fractionation of fibroblast and tissue extracts localized the Beige protein to the cytoplasm. We were unable to detect any membrane association between the Beige protein and any subcellular fraction. This finding was unexpected for two reasons. First, the beige protein has homology to the VPS15 and Huntington protein that encode proteins localizing to both cytosolic and membrane fractions (5Nagle D.J. Karim M.A. Wolf E.A. Holmgren L. Bork P. Misumi D. McGrail S.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Perou C.M. Boissy R.E. Duyk G.M. Spritz R.A. Moore K.J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The VPS15 and Huntington proteins may cycle on and off membranes and are believed to be involved in vesicle dynamics. Second, the main morphologic abnormalities in cells lacking Beige/CHS protein occur in membrane bound organelles. In a previous report, we complemented the beige defect in a cell culture system using a somatic cell fusion approach (20Perou C.M. Kaplan J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). We observed complementation only after a normal and beige lysosome had fused. We concluded that the Beige protein required a membrane interaction to exert its effect, but when the beige/CHS genes were cloned, the predicted protein sequence contained no obvious signal sequence or transmembrane domains. The cytosolic localization of the Beige protein may accurately reflect the distribution of the protein, in which case its role may be to interact with a second protein. This second protein may then interact with membranes. The existence of a protein interaction domain is suggested by the known function of WD40 repeats. An alternative that cannot be eliminated by our data is that the lack of membrane association may result from the techniques used for the cell fractionation studies, but no membrane association was observed by immunolocalization. Overexpression of the Beige protein in YAC-complemented cell lines was the result of a 6–12-fold amplification of the YACs as demonstrated by Southern and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (7Perou C.M. Justice M.J. Pryor R.J. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5905-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amplification resulted in overproduction of beige gene mRNA as determined by Northern analyses (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although thebeige gene cDNA is quite large (11.6 kb of open reading frame), Northern blotting detected only one band in the YAC-complemented cell clones, 195-3 and 195-4 (4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H. Dussault Jr., B.J. Monroe C.A. Duyk G.M. Pryor R.J. Li L. Justice M.J. Kaplan J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results of our Northern analysis, we detected the 400-kDa band only in YAC-complemented cell lines and wild type murine tissues. The 400-kDa band was also the only band that was increased in intensity in our YAC-complemented cell lines (Fig. 1 B). These results strongly suggest that the 400-kDa Beige protein band is functionally significant to the beige phenotype. Overexpression of the Beige protein inbg J/bg J fibroblasts produced a phenotype different from that in the beigemutants, the wild type cells, or the YAC-complemented clone 113-1, which contained wild type levels of Beige protein. Cells lacking the Beige protein (most CHS and beige alleles are believed to be null alleles; Refs. 4Perou C.M. Moore K.J. Nagle D.L. Misumi D.J. Woolf E.A. McGrail S.H. Holmgren L. Brody T.H.

Cells with wild type levels of Beige protein contained smaller lysosomes clustered in the cell body. Overexpressing cells contained even smaller lysosomes located near the cell periphery. There is a tight correlation between the observed phenotype and the level of Beige protein with highest levels producing a phenotype, exactly opposite to that seen in beige/CHS mutants. It remains possible that the complementing YACs overexpress other genes, in addition tobeige, and that these genes are responsible for the observed phenotype, but this seems extremely unlikely. We previously demonstrated that beige/CHS giant lysosomes are as capable of fusing with other lysosomes as are wild type lysosomes (11Perou C.M. Kaplan J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Perou C.M. Kaplan J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that the formation of beige/CHS giant lysosomes results from a reduced rate of fission. The hypothesis that Beige protein regulates fission is supported by our finding that cells overexpressing Beige protein contain smaller than normal lysosomes. We have recently developed a lysosome-lysosome fusion assay (22McVey-Ward D. Leslie J.D. Kaplan J.J. Cell Biol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) and have determined that cytosol from cells overexpressing the Beige protein had no effect on lysosome fusion in vitro. This finding, coupled with the smaller than normal lysosomes produced when the Beige protein was overexpressed, suggests that the defect in beige/CHS is one of lysosomal fission and not fusion. A molecular mechanism mediating fission is not obvious, but it is possible that one domain of the Beige protein provides a structural support for lysosomes and that another domain, through a linking protein, pulls at the lysosomal membrane until fission occurs."

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor-related receptor (11Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for which the ligand is not known. The positions of cysteines in the amino acid sequences of these receptors are highly conserved. Alkylation of the IR suggests that it has one free thiol group per αβ monomer and that this is on the β-chain (12Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Finn F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9489-9493Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Chiacchia K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mild reduction of the insulin receptor cleaves a small number of disulfide bonds (the class I bonds) giving rise to disulfide-linked αβ monomers that can still bind ligand; more vigorous reduction cleaves the α-β bond(s) (the class II bonds) leading to free α- and β-chains and to denaturation of the two protein chains (15Czech M.P. Massague J. Pilch P.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 222-225Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Some of the disulfide bonds have been established by direct isolation of disulfide-bonded peptides from a tryptic digest of the IR ectodomain. Thus Cys435 and Cys468 in the L2 domain are linked in an intrachain disulfide bond, whereas Cys524forms an α-α interchain link, one of the class I disulfides (16Schäffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, mutation of Cys524 to Ala (17Macaulay S.L. Polites M. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or Ser (18Bilan P.J. Yip C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1891-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) resulted in an IR that was still dimeric, thereby indicating that more than one disulfide bond is involved in dimer formation. Labeling of monomeric IR showed that there are at least two cysteines per monomer involved in class I disulfide bonds (13Chiacchia K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results of experiments in which Cys647 was mutated to serine suggested that the IR has only one α-β disulfide bond (19Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7108-7115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current models of the IR thus suggest α-chains linked to each other to form the dimer with β-chains linked only to α-chains within each monomer (13Chiacchia K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,14Finn F.M. Ridge K.D. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report the disulfide bond arrangement in the C-terminal half of the IR ectodomain is established. It is shown that the α-β disulfide link is between Cys647 in the first Fn III repeat and Cys872 in the second Fn III repeat, which is consistent with the mutagenesis data (19Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7108-7115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); also identified is an α-α dimer linkage, in addition to that involving Cys524 (16Schäffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), involving one or more of the triplet of cysteine residues at positions 682, 683, and 685 in the insert domain. Finally we have recovered peptides in which Cys884 was found cross-linked to Trp632 in a tryptathionine linkage. We have subsequently shown that this linkage is generated during the CNBr reaction and requires the Cys residue to be present as cysteine not cystine (20Sparrow L.G. Robinson C.P. Kirkpatrick A. Rivett D.E. Gorman J.J. Protein Peptide Lett. 1997; 4: 271-276Google Scholar). This suggested that in the ectodomain, Cys884 exists as a buried thiol, and this was confirmed by isolation and sequence characterization of a peptide from a digest of NEM-labeled IR ectodomain, showing that Cys884 was derivatized. CNBr was from Fluka; iodoacetic acid was obtained from Merck; trifluoracetic acid was Pierce SpectroGrade; HPLC grade acetonitrile was from either BDH or Mallinckrodt; guanidine hydrochloride was from Research Organics Inc. (Cleveland, OH); NEM was from Calbiochem;3H-labeled NEM (specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) was from Strem Chemicals (Newburyport, MA); n-octyl glucoside was from Sigma. Reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were obtained from Bio-Rad. Endoproteinase Lys-C was the enzyme from Achromobacter lyticus supplied by Wako Fine Chemicals (Osaka, Japan); sequencing grade endoproteinase Asp-N was from Boehringer Mannheim; trypsin was sequencing grade modified trypsin from Promega; thermolysin was from Calbiochem; peptideN-glycosidase F was from New England BioLabs. Human IR ectodomain (exon 11 plus) was cloned, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and purified as described previously (21Cosgrove L. Lovrecz G.O. Verkuylen A. Cavaleri L. Black L.A.

Cloning and expression of human IR ectodomain (exon 11 minus) 2This study was initiated using IR (exon 11 plus), and this material was utilized for the CNBr digests and subsequent enzyme digestions. Due to a lack of material, the experiments to confirm that Cys884 is a free thiol were carried out using IR (exon 11 minus). in cells of the Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutant, Lec 8 (22Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), were carried out by similar procedures, except that Fibracell discs (Sterilin, UK) were used in a Celligen bioreactor for the fermentation step 3N. Ivancic, personal communication. and the purification protocol used insulin affinity chromatography for the primary purification (21Cosgrove L. Lovrecz G.O. Verkuylen A. Cavaleri L. Black L.A. Bentley J.D. Howlett G.J. Gray P.P. Ward C.W. McKern N.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CNBr cleavage was carried out on 10 nmol of human IR ectodomain (exon 11 plus) using the method of Gross and Witkop (23Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510-1511Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), except that trifluoracetic acid was used instead of formic acid. Digestions with trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C were carried out in 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, at 37° C for 16–18 h using an enzyme to substrate ratio of approximately 1:20; for some digests detergent (0.01% (v/v) Tween 20) was included in the buffer. Digestions with endoproteinase Asp-N were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 16–18 h with an enzyme to substrate ratio of approximately 1:3. Thermolysin digestion was carried out in 1% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 8.2, for 4 h at 37° C with an enzyme to substrate ratio of approximately 1:1. All protease digestions were stopped by acidification with 10% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and fractionated by RP-HPLC. Digestion with peptideN-glycosidase F was carried out in 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 16–18 h. RP-HPLC was carried out on a Hewlett Packard 1090 Liquid Chromatograph using a flow rate of 0.20 ml/min. Linear gradients were formed between buffer A and buffer B where A was ∼0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and B was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile; the absorbance at 214 nm of A was adjusted to be the same as that of B by addition of trifluoracetic acid. Except where otherwise indicated all chromatography was carried out at room temperature. Fractions were collected manually. Specific conditions for each fractionation are given in the figure legends. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) with 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II electrophoresis cell. After staining with Coomassie Blue G250, gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.), dried under vacuum, and subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.). To approximately 200 μg of human IR ectodomain (1 nmol, exon 11 minus, expressed in Lec 8 cells) in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline with 0.025% (w/v) azide (TBSA) and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added 50 μCi of [3H]NEM in pentane. The solvent was removed with a stream of nitrogen, and the mixture was allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. After this time 10 μl of a 1.0 m NEM solution in water was added, and the incubation was continued for a further 30 min. The mixture was then chromatographed at room temperature on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) in TBSA at 0.5 ml/min; 1-min fractions were collected, and an aliquot of each was counted. To approximately 200 μg of human IR ectodomain (1 nmol, exon 11 minus, expressed in Lec 8 cells) in 200 μl of TBSA was added 50 μCi of [3H]NEM and 5 μl of 0.2 mm NEM in water; after 5 min of incubation at room temperature, 220 mg of solid guanidine hydrochloride was added and dissolved by gentle mixing. The mixture was then allowed to stand in the dark for 2 h, after which 10 μl of 1.0 m NEM in water was added; the mixture was chromatographed as above after a further 30 min. [3H]NEM-labeled human IR ectodomain (see “Denaturing Conditions” above) was reduced in 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol for 4 h at 37 °C; the mixture was then made 1.5 mm in iodoacetate and allowed to stand a further 30 min in the dark. It was then chromatographed on Superdex 200 as described above. Amino acid sequence determinations were carried out on a Hewlett Packard G1005A sequencer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed with a Bruker Reflex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) operated exclusively in the reflectron mode as described previously (25Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peptides were diluted in 30% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and 2 μl of a matrix comprised of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone containing diammonium hydrogen citrate (25Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) prior to deposition of 0.5–1 μl onto a stainless steel target. Reduction was achieved by adding diammonium hydrogen citrate to the diluted peptide solutions to a final concentration of 0.2 mfollowed by TCEP to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubation of the mixture for 20 min at 65 °C. A 2-μl aliquot of the reduction mixture was mixed with 2 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone in 50% (v/v) ethanol/acetonitrile and applied to the sample target of the mass spectrometer (25Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The distribution of the 11 methionine residues in the primary sequence of the IR ectodomain (1Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) enabled the use of a strategy having cleavage with CNBr as a first step to generate a series of disulfide-bonded fragments (Table I; see also Fig. 7). The fragments resulting from CNBr cleavage of the expressed ectodomain of the human IR (exon 11 plus) (αβ′)2 were readily separated by RP-HPLC (Fig.1). Fractions 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 were characterized by further chromatography (not shown) and N-terminal sequence analysis. The sequences obtained (TableII) show that all the peptides expected for cleavage at the 11 methionine residues were present in one or more of these fractions with the exception of the small peptide, CN5, running from Val99 to Met110. The fractionation was complicated by the fact that the N-terminal sequence of peptide CN12 (which contains no cysteine residues) was found across the elution profile in fractions 2, 3, 5, and 6, whereas the sequences of others were found in fewer fractions. This may be due to nonspecific associations or incomplete cleavage.Table IPredicted sequences for the CNBr peptides of human insulin receptor ectodomainα-Chain CN11 HLYPGEVCPG m 11 CN2 12 DIRNNLTRLH ELENCSVIEG HLQILLm 38 CN3 39 FKTRPEDFRD LSFPKLIm 56 CN4 57 ITDYLLLFRV YGLESLKDLF PNLTVIRGSR LFFNYALVIF Em 98 CN5 99 VHLKELGLYN Lm 110 CN6111 NITRGSVRIE KNNELCYLAT IDWSRILDSV EDNYIVLNKD DNEECGDICP 160161 GTAKGKTNCP ATVINGQFVE RCWTHSHCQK VCPTICKSHG CTAEGLCCHS 210211 ECLGNCSQPD DPTKCVACRN FYLDGRCVET CPPPYYHFQD WRCVNFSFCQ 260261 DLHHKCKNSR RQGCHQYVIH NNKCIPECPS GYTm 294 CN7295 NSSNLLCTPC LGPCPKVCHL LEGEKTIDSV TSAQELRGCT VINGSLIINI 344345 RGGNNLAAEL EANLGLIEEI SGYLKIRRSY ALVSLSFFRK LRLIRGETLE 394395 IGNYSFYALD NQNLRQLWDW SKHNLTITQG KLFFHYNPKL CLSEIHKm 442 CN8443 EEVSGTKGRQ ERNDIALKTN GDQASCENEL LKFSYIRTSF DKILLRWEPY 492493 WPPDFRDLLG Fm 504 CN9505 LFYKEAPYQN VTEFDGQDAC GSNSWTVVDI DPPLRSNDPK SQNHPGWLm 553 CN10554 RGLKPWTQYA IFVKTLVTFS DERRTYGAKS DIIYVQTDAT NPSVPLDPIS 603604 VSNSSSQIIL KWKPPSDPNG NITHYLVFWE RQAEDSELFE LDYCLKGLKL 653654 PSRTWSPPFE SEDSQKHNQS EYEDSAGECC SCPKTDSQIL KELEESSFRK 703704 TFEDYLHNVV FVPRKTSSGT GAEDPRPSRK RR 735β′-Chain CN11736 SLGDVGNVTV AVPTVAAFPN TSSTSVPTSP EEHRPFEKVV NKESLVISGL 785786 RHFTGYRIEL QACNQDTPEE RCSVAAYVSA RTm 818 CN12819 PEAKADDIVG PVTHEIFENN VVHLm 843 CN13844 WQEPKEPNGL IVLYEVSYRR YGDEELHLCD TRKHFALERG CRLRGLSPGN 893894 YSVRIRATSL AGNGSWTEPT YFYVTDYLDV PSNIAK 929Abbreviations for the amino acids are in single-letter code; m represents methionine in the uncleaved protein and homoserine in the peptides resulting from cleavage with CNBr.

Sequences underlined are the major sequences seen in the mixture. X indicates that no PTH amino acid signal within the peptide was seen for that cycle. Cysteine-containing fragments were found in fractions 2, 3, 5, and 6, whereas fraction 7 contained the 42-residue peptide CN4 (Ile57-Met98) that contains no cysteine residues. As shown in Table II, fraction 2 contained four peptides, of which two (CN1 and CN2) each contain a single cysteine residue (TableI; see also Fig. 7). This suggested that Cys8 and Cys26 formed an intrachain disulfide bond. This same pair of peptides was also found in the adjacent fraction 3 along with CN12 and CN11. CN11 is an 83-residue peptide extending from the N terminus of the β-chain to Met818. It contains cysteines 798 and 807 (Tables I and II; see also Fig. 7) and was purified by rechromatography (giving fraction 3.3; data not shown) prior to tryptic digestion. Fraction 5 contained four CNBr peptides, of which the pair CN10 (residue 554 to the end of the α-chain, including four cysteine residues) and CN-13 (residues 844–929, including two cysteine residues) could not be resolved by further chromatography, suggesting that they contained the α-β disulfide bond(s) of the IR ectodomain. The remaining cysteines of the IR ectodomain were found in fraction 6, which contained peptides CN6 and CN7, derived from the cysteine-rich and L2 domains of the receptor, and CN8 and CN9 from the L2 and connecting domains (see Fig. 7). Fig.2 shows the elution profile for RP-HPLC of a tryptic digest of fraction 2 (see Fig. 1). Both peaks 2T-9 and 2T-10 had the same two N-terminal sequences starting from His1 and Leu20, consistent with these fractions containing the disulfide-linked peptide pair His1-Hse11/Leu20-Hse38(CN1 and CN2 in Table I and Fig. 7). The sequence His1-Hse11 had a single blank cycle (i.e. with no new PTH signal during sequencing) corresponding to the position of Cys8, whereas the sequence Leu20-Hse38 had two blank cycles corresponding to the positions of Asn25 and Cys26, showing that Asn25 is glycosylated. Mass spectral analysis of 2T-9 (Table III) gave data consistent with the proposed structure for this fragment but showing it also included the species His1-Hse11-Arg14/Leu20-Hse38.Table IIIMass spectral analysis of disulphide-bonded peptidesPeptideResidues in IRSequencem/z by MALDI-TOFDisulphide formReduced formObservedCalculatedObservedCalculated3.3T-6793–806IELQA X NQDTPEER2670.62671.01646.01646.8807–816X SVAAYVSAR1026.31027.23.3T-5793–806IELQA X NQDTPEER2256.42258.51645.51646.8807–812X SVAAY613.0613.75T-26a635–649QAEDSELFELDYCLK3222.53222.5ND864–875YGDEELHL X VSR5T-26b635–649ZAEDSELFELDYCLK3205.43205.51786.51786.3864–875YGDEELHL X VSR1421.01420.85AP-5670–687H X QSEYEDSAGECCSCPK8966.43966.23-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.4486.81984.13-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.5AP-5-AspN2677–687DSAGE XX SCPK2192.82193.0ND5AP-21-Th23880–888LERG X RLRG2956.52957.32955.32957.3629–643LVF X ERQAEDSELFE5AP-21-N-glyc.624–637DITHYLVF X ERQAE3108.03107.33106.93107.3AspN-17D881–892ERG X RLRGLSPG2T-91–11HLYPGEV XPGHse5103.3, 5118.13331.83-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.1173.31173.320–38LHELE XX SVIEGHLQILLHse5205.9, 5395.43931.7, 4223.12160.53-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.5468.6, 5486.34297.7, 4325.84589.62T-91–14HLYPGEV XPGHsDIR5758.9, 5778.03716.33-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.1558.11557.820–38LHELE XX SVIEGHLQILLHse5861.13931.7, 4223.12160.53-aValues are the calculated mass of peptide, not including carbohydrate.4297.7, 4325.84589.6Residues identified by amino acid sequencing are underlined.X indicates that no PTH amino acid signal was seen for that cycle.

Fig. 3 shows the elution profile for RP-HPLC of a tryptic digest of CN11 (fraction 3.3) and rechromatography of selected peaks. Characterization of peaks by N-terminal sequencing showed that peak 6 (peptide 3.3T-6) had two N-terminal sequences starting from Ile793 and Cys807. Mass spectrometry (Table III) gave a molecular weight of 2670.6 for peptide 3.3T-6 and, after reduction, molecular weights of 1646.0 and 1026.3. These data showed that 3.3T-6 is the disulfide-linked peptide pair Ile793-Arg806/Cys807-Arg816and establishes an intrachain disulfide bond between Cys798and Cys807 (see Fig. 7). The same digest yielded a related peptide, 3.3T-5, which arose from an additional cleavage at Tyr812. Its structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry to be Ile793-Arg806/Cys807-Tyr812(Table III). Fig. 4 A shows the elution profile of a tryptic digest of fraction 5, which includes the two large CNBr fragments CN10 and CN13 (Table II). Rechromatography of peak 5T-26 (inset, Fig. 4 A) gave two peaks, 5T-26a and 5T-26b. Fraction 5T-26a showed two N-terminal sequences corresponding to Gln635-Lys649 and Tyr864-Arg875, suggesting that they were disulfide bonded. This was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table III), establishing an α-β interchain disulfide bond between the α-chain Cys647 and the β-chain Cys872 (see Fig. 7). Peak 5T-26b was identical to 5T-26a but with the N-terminal glutamine cyclized so that only the sequence Tyr864-Arg875 was observed; the molecular mass (Table III) was consistent with 5T-26b being the disulfide-linked peptide pair pGlu635-Lys649/Tyr864-Arg875. Although sequences were found for most of the peptides expected to be generated by tryptic digestion of the four CNBr peptides in fraction 5 (Tables I and II), no peptides containing cysteines 682, 683, 685, or 884 were recovered, and so additional enzymic digestions were carried out. Fractionation of an endoproteinase Lys-C digest of fraction 5 (Fig.4 B) yielded a sharp peak, 5AP-5, which had a single sequence starting at His670. Mass spectrometry gave molecular weights of 8966.4 and 4486.8 after reduction with TCEP (Table III), confirming that peptide 5AP-5 was a dimer of His670-Lys687. Further digestion of peptide 5AP-5 with endoproteinase Asp-N gave the two expected peptides (data not shown), one of which, 5AP-5-AspN1, was the glycopeptide His670-Glu676, and the other, 5AP-5-AspN2, was the disulfide-linked dimer of Asp677-Lys687. The latter peptide gave the sequence DSAGEXXSXPK (Table III), where X refers to a lack of PTH signal during sequencing and corresponds to Cys in the known sequence (1Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Its molecular weight before reduction was 2192.8, showing it to be a disulfide-linked dimer (calculated weight, 2193.0; Table III). No mass spectral data could be obtained after reduction of this fragment. These data demonstrated that the dimer disulfide bond(s), in addition to the known bond involving Cys524 (16Schäffer"
https://openalex.org/W2062307439,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a protein secreted by activated phagocytes, may be a potential candidate for the generation of modified/oxidized lipoproteins in vivo via intermediate formation of HOCl, a powerful oxidant. During the present study, the effects of reagent NaOCl and OCl− generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system on physicochemical and metabolic properties of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass 3 (HDL3) were investigated. Up to a molar oxidant:lipoprotein ratio of approximately 30:1, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL3 apolipoprotein component, represented the preferential target for OCl− attack (consuming 35–76% of the oxidant), thereby protecting HDL3 fatty acids (consuming between 17 and 30% of the oxidant) against OCl−-mediated modification. At molar oxidant:HDL3 ratios ≥ 60:1, we have observed pronounced consumption of HDL3 unsaturated fatty acids with concomitant formation of fatty acid chlorohydrins. Modification of HDL3 in the presence of the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in amino acid oxidation in a manner comparable with that found with reagent NaOCl only. Treatment of HDL3 with reagent NaOCl as well as modification by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in significantly enhanced turnover rates of HDL3 by mouse peritoneal macrophages, an effect that was not a result of HDL3 aggregation as judged by dynamic and static light-scattering experiments. In comparison with native HDL3, the degradation by macrophages was enhanced by 4- and 15-fold when HDL3 was modified with reagent NaOCl or the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system. Finally, the ability of HDL3 to promote cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages was significantly diminished after modification with reagent NaOCl. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the modification of HDL3 by hypochlorite (added as reagent or generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl−system) transformed an antiatherogenic lipoprotein particle into a modified lipoprotein with characteristics similar to lipoproteins commonly thought to initiate foam cell formation in vivo. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a protein secreted by activated phagocytes, may be a potential candidate for the generation of modified/oxidized lipoproteins in vivo via intermediate formation of HOCl, a powerful oxidant. During the present study, the effects of reagent NaOCl and OCl− generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system on physicochemical and metabolic properties of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass 3 (HDL3) were investigated. Up to a molar oxidant:lipoprotein ratio of approximately 30:1, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL3 apolipoprotein component, represented the preferential target for OCl− attack (consuming 35–76% of the oxidant), thereby protecting HDL3 fatty acids (consuming between 17 and 30% of the oxidant) against OCl−-mediated modification. At molar oxidant:HDL3 ratios ≥ 60:1, we have observed pronounced consumption of HDL3 unsaturated fatty acids with concomitant formation of fatty acid chlorohydrins. Modification of HDL3 in the presence of the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in amino acid oxidation in a manner comparable with that found with reagent NaOCl only. Treatment of HDL3 with reagent NaOCl as well as modification by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in significantly enhanced turnover rates of HDL3 by mouse peritoneal macrophages, an effect that was not a result of HDL3 aggregation as judged by dynamic and static light-scattering experiments. In comparison with native HDL3, the degradation by macrophages was enhanced by 4- and 15-fold when HDL3 was modified with reagent NaOCl or the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system. Finally, the ability of HDL3 to promote cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages was significantly diminished after modification with reagent NaOCl. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the modification of HDL3 by hypochlorite (added as reagent or generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl−system) transformed an antiatherogenic lipoprotein particle into a modified lipoprotein with characteristics similar to lipoproteins commonly thought to initiate foam cell formation in vivo. In contrast to low density lipoproteins (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); apo, apolipoprotein; CE, cholesteryl ester; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; GC-MS; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); MPO, myeloperoxidase; NaOCl, sodium hypochlorite; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline;R H, hydrodynamic radius; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TMS, trimethylsilyl; [3H]Ch18:2, [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7- 3H]linoleate. high plasma concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) are associated with a decreased risk for the development of coronary artery disease, an effect commonly attributed to their central role in reverse cholesterol transport (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this process, HDL is able to promote efflux of cholesterol from peripheral tissues, and the accepted cholesterol is (at least in part) esterified by the action of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (2Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl esters (CEs) formed by the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction are then transferred from HDL to other lipoproteins mediated by the cholesterol ester transfer protein or are delivered to the liver for bilary secretion or reutilization during lipoprotein assembling (3Barter P.J. Rye K.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Within the oxidative theory, HDL appears to be Janus-faced (4Forte T.M. McCall M.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. van Lenten B.J. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A.

Lipidol. 1996; 7: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The majority of lipid hydroperoxides (the first detectable products of lipoprotein oxidation) in plasma are transported in the HDL fraction (7Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10316-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and HDL was suggested to act as a sink for preformed lipid hydro(pero)xides. HDL-associated cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides, which are probably transferred to HDL by the action of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (8Christison J.K. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2017-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are preferentially catabolized over nonoxidized CEs; this was shown in HepG2 cells (9Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in situperfused rat liver (10Christison J.K. Karjalainen A. Brauman J. Bygrave F. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and intact rats (11Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Kostner G.M. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HDL was also shown to protect LDL from lipid peroxidation, inhibiting the formation of lipid hydroperoxides but not the formation of conjugated dienes (12Mackness M.I. Abbott C. Arrol S. Durrington P.N. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDL is more easily oxidized than LDL (7Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10316-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), HDL-associated lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase is modified by reactive short and long chain aldehydes (13McCall M.R. Tang J.Y. Bielicki J.K. Forte T.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the ability of oxidatively modified HDL to promote cellular cholesterol efflux is diminished (14Nagano Y. Arai H. Kita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Rifici V.A. Khachadurian A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Salmon S. Maziere C. Auclair M. Theron L. Santus R. Maziere J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), most probably due to alterations in its apolipoprotein moiety. During the acute phase response, up to 80% of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major apolipoprotein of HDL, is displaced by serum amyloid A (17Malle E. de Beer F.C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 26: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and due to this exchange in the HDL apolipoprotein domain, native, anti-inflammatory HDL became proinflammatory during the acute phase response (18Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The above mentioned results imply that HDL can protect LDL against oxidative modifications and could serve as a vehicle for detoxification of potentially (cyto)toxic lipid hydroperoxides. However, under certain circumstances many of the important physiological properties of HDL can be lost during oxidation/modification, transforming HDL into a proatherogenic lipoprotein particle. Within the wide spectrum of oxidants available for the organism, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is thought to play an important role during microbial killing and inflammatory tissue injury by neutrophils and monocytes (19Lampert M.B. Weiss S.J. Blood. 1983; 62: 645-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypochlorite (OCl−), formed in vivo via the myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2/halide system from activated neutrophils and/or monocytes, may react with a wide range of biological target molecules, including lipids, antioxidants, and proteins (20Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Modification of LDL with HOCl in vitro has generated a modified particle, which was avidly taken up by macrophages (21Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The importance of MPO as a potential in vivo oxidant is further underlined by the presence of enzymatically active MPO in human atherosclerotic lesions (22Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin Invest. 1994; 97: 437-444Crossref Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the presence of HOCl-modified (lipo)proteins was recently demonstrated in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions (23Hazell L. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and inflammatory kidney tissues rich in MPO (24Malle E. Woenckhaus C. Waeg G. Esterbauer H. Groene E.F. Groene H.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the consequences of NaOCl modification on the apolipoprotein and lipid domain of HDL3, the concomitant changes in HDL3-associated CE and holoparticle metabolism in macrophages, and the cholesterol efflux properties. We found that HDL3-associated amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol were modified by HOCl, either added as reagent or generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system. Presumably as a result of apolipoprotein modification, binding, internalization, and degradation of NaOCl and MPO modified HDL3 by mouse peritoneal macrophages were greatly enhanced. We demonstrate further that NaOCl treatment of HDL3resulted in impaired ability to promote cholesterol efflux from the cellular plasma membrane of macrophages. NaOCl, BF3/MeOH, egg yolk lecithin, hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylchlorosilane, organic solvents, and potassium bromide were obtained from Sigma. MPO (isolated from human leukocytes) was from Alexis Biochemicals. Radiochemicals were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts. Plasticware used for tissue culture was obtained from Costar. All other chemicals were obtained from Merck, except where indicated. Human apoE-free HDL3 was prepared by discontinuous density ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from normolipemic donors in a TL120 Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge using a TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman) as described (25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Modification of HDL3 with OCl− was performed as described previously (21Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One mg of HDL3protein/ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was incubated with NaOCl solution (added as single addition and gentle vortexing) at molar ratios of NaOCl to HDL3 ranging from 7.5 (90 μm NaOCl) to 400 (5.3 mm NaOCl; 60 min, 37 °C, under argon) with the final pH adjusted to 7.4. The modified HDL3 preparations were passed over a PD10 column to remove unreacted NaOCl. The concentration of the reagent NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient for OCl− of 350 cm−1 at 292 nm (27Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 12: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Depending on the type of experiment performed after NaOCl treatment, the modified HDL3 preparations were used between 2 and 24 h after exposure to the oxidant. HDL3 modification in the presence of the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system was performed at pH 7.4 or 4.5 to generate HOCl or Cl2 as the oxidant (28van den Berg J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, to the substrates (1 mg of HDL3protein/ml in PBS (50 mm, pH 7.4) or in sodium phosphate (50 mm, 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 4.5)) additions of 20 μmH2O2 were made at 10-min intervals at 37 °C until reaching a total of 15 additions (final concentration 300 μm; assuming quantitative conversion, a molar oxidant:lipoprotein ratio of ∼20:1 could be expected). MPO (13 nm) was added at the start and subsequently at every second addition of H2O2. At alternate additions of H2O2, 2 μm ascorbate was added. To blank incubations, only H2O2 and ascorbate were added in the same concentrations and sequence as described above. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h (37 °C) and subsequently dialyzed against PBS (10 mm, 4 °C). Iodination of HDL3 was performed as described by Sinn et al. (30Sinn H.J. Schrenk H.H. Friedrich E.A. Via D.P. Dresel H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) usingN-Br-succinimide as the coupling agent. Routinely, 1 mCi of125INa (Amersham Corp.) was used to label 5 mg of HDL3 protein. This procedure resulted in specific activities between 300 and 450 dpm/ng of protein with less than 3% lipid-associated activity. No cross-linking or fragmentation of apoA-I due to the iodination procedure could be detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography. HDL3 was labeled with [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]linoleate (NEN Life Science Products) by cholesterol ester transfer protein-catalyzed transfer from donor liposomes essentially as described (9Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). [3H]Ch18:2-labeled HDL3 was reisolated in a TLX120 benchtop ultracentrifuge using a TLA100.4 rotor as described (25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This labeling procedure resulted in specific activities of 5–7 cpm/ng HDL3 protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of HDL3apolipoproteins was performed using 5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels with electrophoresis at 150 V for 90 min in a Bio-Rad miniprotean chamber (Bio-Rad, Austria) (26Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For Western blotting experiments, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (150 mA, 4 °C, 90 min). Immunochemical detection of NaOCl-modified apolipoproteins was performed with a monoclonal antibody clone 2D10G9 (Ref. 26Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; dilution 1:50) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad, 1:5000). Immunochemical detection of apoA-I in the same lipoprotein samples was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-human apoA-I (Behring, Germany) as a primary antibody, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs as secondary antibodies. Detection was performed by the ECL method. Dynamic light-scattering experiments were performed with native and NaOCl-modified HDL3. The laboratory-built goniometer was equipped with an Argon+ laser (Spectra Physics, model 2060-55, P max = 5 watts, λ = 514.5 nm), single mode fiber detection and an ALV-5000 correlator (ALV, Germany). Measurements were carried out at a scattering angle of 90° at 25 °C and a laser power of 200 milliwatts. The time dependence of the scattering intensity, represented by its correlation function, provides information on diffusional motion of the scatterer. The diffusion coefficient is related to the apparent hydrodynamic radius,R H, by the Stokes-Einstein equation,i.e. an equivalent sphere with radiusR H shows the same diffusion behavior as the particle under investigation and serves as a size parameter. Polydisperse systems give rise to a correlation function with a spectrum of different decay constants. A series expansion called cumulant fit (31Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) results in a mean value for the diffusion coefficient (first cumulant, c 1) and its variance (second cumulant, c 2). The ratioc 2/c 12 is called the polydispersity index. Any aggregation of HDL3particles will lead to an increase of the measuredR H values and the polydispersity index. The integrated intensity (averaged over long times compared with the time scale of fluctuations in the dynamic experiment) is another, completely independent, parameter for aggregation phenomena. For particles that are small compared with the wavelength of the scattered radiation, this intensity is directly related to the mean mass or aggregation number of the particles and independent of its diffusion dynamics. Any increase in this intensity relative to the native control is equivalent to the degree of aggregation, i.e.dimerization would lead to a 2-fold increase of the integrated intensity. Aliquots of native and NaOCl-modified HDL3 (450 μg of protein) were lyophylized in 5-ml ampules and purged with nitrogen before hydrolysis in constant boiling 6 n HCl (24 h, 120 °C). Amino acid analysis was performed as described by Parks and Rudel (32Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6716-6723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a Biotronics analyzer. Fatty acid analysis of HDL3 lipids was performed as described (33Sattler W. Puhl H. Hayn M. Kostner G.M. Esterbauer H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Separation of fatty acid methylesters (2-μl samples) was performed on a fused silica 25-m FFAP-CB column (0.32-mm inner diameter; Chrompack) using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a split/splitless injector (Hewlett-Packard Co.). Cholesterol analysis of HDL3 lipids was performed as described by Sattler et al. (25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of NaOCl-modified HDL3 lipids was performed essentially as described by van den Berg et al. (28van den Berg J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34van den Berg J.J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Kuypers F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2005-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted HDL3 lipids were transmethylated with BF3/MeOH as described above. The fatty acid and chlorohydrin fatty acid methylesters were converted to the corresponding trimethylsilyl (TMS)-ether derivatives with pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/trimethylchlorosilane (9:3:1; v/v/v) at 65 °C for 1 h. One-μl samples of theO-methylester-O-TMS-ether derivatives were analyzed by GC-MS without further extraction. Separation was performed on a DB-5 capillary column (15 m, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness from J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) using helium as carrier gas. The column was kept at 120 °C (3 min) and programmed to 180 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. A second ramp was programmed from 180 °C at 5 °C/min to 260 °C with an isothermal hold at 260 °C for 5 min. The quadrupole was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV and a source temperature of 200 °C. Thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were plated on 6- or 12-well trays in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS as described recently by Panzenboeck et al. (35Panzenboeck U. Wintersperger A. Levak-Frank S. Zimmermann R. Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h, cells were washed three times with PBS and kept in DMEM (containing FCS) for 2 or 3 days. One day prior to the experiments, cells were preincubated in DMEM containing lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS, 10%, v/v). Lipid loading experiments of macrophages were performed with radioactively labeled (125INa or [3H]Ch18:2) native HDL3 and NaOCl-HDL3 in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled HDL3. Radioactively labeled native or NaOCl-modified HDL3 was added to a final concentration of 50 μg of protein/well, and cells were incubated in DMEM (10% FCS) at 37 °C for 6 h. Following this incubation, the cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing bovine serum albumin (5%, w/v), followed by three washes in TBS. To release cell membrane-bound HDL3, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of trypsin (0.05%, Cytosystems). The trypsin-releasable fraction is referred to as “bound” fraction. Cells were then lysed in NaOH (1 ml, 0.3 n, 1 h at 4 °C) to determine both the non-trypsin-releasable fraction (“internalized” fraction) and the cell protein in the lysate. Specific binding/internalization was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding/internalization. Protein measurement was performed according to Lowry (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On average, the protein content per well was 300–350 μg. Degradation of125I-HDL3 or125I-NaOCl-HDL3 by mouse peritoneal macrophages was estimated by measuring the non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the medium after precipitation of free iodine with AgNO3 (37Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To facilitate the comparison of results obtained with125I-HDL3/125I-NaOCl-HDL3and [3H]Ch18:2-HDL3/[3H]Ch18:2-NaOCl-HDL3, selective uptake of HDL3-CE is expressed as apparent HDL3 particle uptake (i.e. as the amount of apoA-I that would deliver the observed amount of tracer if uptake were solely mediated by holoparticle uptake) as suggested by Pittmanet al. (38Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioglycollate-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages were harvested and plated as described above. The cells were incubated in the presence of DMEM containing LPDS (10%, v/v) and [3H]cholesterol (0.05 μCi/ml) for 2 days (39Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Philipps M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the cholesterol efflux experiments the [3H]cholesterol-containing medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice in TBS (containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and twice in TBS. Efflux experiments were then initiated by the addition of DMEM containing LPDS (10%, v/v) and HDL3or NaOCl-HDL3 (0.5 mg of protein/ml). At the indicated time points, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 0.3n NaOH to estimate both the remaining radioactivity and the cellular protein content. The efflux of radioactive label to the medium was calculated as the percentage of radioactivity present in the cells prior to the addition of NaOCl-HDL3- or native HDL3-containing medium. To investigate the effect of NaOCl on the amino acid composition of HDL3-associated apoA-I, HDL3 aliquots (containing a total HDL3 mass of 900 μg) were treated with increasing concentrations of NaOCl (pH 7.4). The molar oxidant:lipoprotein ratio ranged between 7.5 and 300. The results of the amino acid analyses are shown in TableI. An increasing degree of NaOCl-modification of HDL3 was paralleled by an increasing loss of total amino acids from 3 to 109 mol/mol HDL3. Following the loss of individual amino acids as a function of increasing NaOCl concentration, three groups of amino acids with respect to their sensitivity toward NaOCl reactivity could be discriminated. The first and most sensitive group was composed of Cys, Met, and Tyr. Cys and Met were completely consumed at a molar NaOCl:HDL3 ratio of 30 and 60, respectively. Tyr was consumed in a dose-dependent fashion by 5–95% at NaOCl:HDL3 ratios of 7.5:1 and 300:1. The second group (less reactive toward NaOCl modification) is constituted by Phe, Lys, His, and Arg, which were consumed by 67, 55, 67, and 63%, respectively, at the highest NaOCl concentration used. Finally, the third group, relatively insensitive to NaOCl treatment, is composed of Asx, Thr, Ser, Glx, Pro, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, and Leu. As can be seen from data shown in Table I, between 36 and 78% of NaOCl was consumed by reactions with HDL3 apolipoprotein amino acids. In line with these findings, the relative electrophoretic mobility of NaOCl-modified HDL3 as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis increased to 1.02 (15:1), 1.1 (30:1), 1.2 (60:1), 1.6 (150:1), and 1.9 (300:1).Table IAmino acid analysis of native and NaOCl-modified HDL3apolipoproteinsAmino acidNativeNaOCl:HDL3 (ratio)7.5153060150300mol/molAsx1-aAsp + Asn.45.746.044.945.144.642.544.4Thr31.130.329.728.728.127.627.4Ser39.039.139.038.234.535.134.5Glx1-bGlu + Gln.110.1110.4109.9110.7107.9106.3109.0Pro24.224.424.524.524.223.523.6Gly22.322.521.421.821.220.320.5Ala40.540.440.941.841.439.339.5Val32.533.332.732.831.832.431.8Cys1.30.61.1NT1-dNT, not detectable.NTNTNTMet1.91.71.41.2NTNTNTIle4.74.64.34.04.04.03.9Leu78.278.978.279.377.576.477.8Tyr22.721.620.016.913.44.90.3Phe20.320.019.419.419.419.16.7Lys55.353.752.548.938.130.625.2His8.78.58.47.87.64.82.9TrpND1-cND, not determined.NDNDNDNDNDNDArg29.028.728.527.927.423.210.8Total567.6564.7556.7549.1521.2490.0458.3Lost311194678109ApoE-free HDL3 was prepared by discontinuous density ultracentrifugation and modified with increasing concentrations of NaOCl (7.5–300 molecules/HDL3 particle).

The effects of the MPO/H2O2/Cl−system on the amino acid composition of HDL3-associated apolipoproteins are shown in Table II. Incubations were performed at pH 7.4 and 4.5 to generate either HOCl or Cl2 as the oxidant (28van den Berg J. Winterbourn C.C.

Under these experimental conditions, we have observed pronounced Cys and Met consumption (60 and 40%), in line with data presented in Table I(NaOCl:HDL3 ≥ 15:1). Tyr, Phe, and Lys were also modified by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system, although to a lesser extent (17, 7, and 5%, respectively). Comparable modification rates were observed for Thr, Ala, and Val (Table II). With the exception of Thr, the modification rates for individual amino acids at pH 7.4 and 4.5 were quite similar. In summary, both HOCl and Cl2 generated by the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system resulted in modification of HDL3-associated apolipoproteins.Table"

During this process, it appears that p47 phox undergoes conformational changes, resulting in the exposure of binding sites involved in assembly and activation of the oxidase. In the present study, we have directly evaluated activation-induced conformational changes in p47 phox using tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Treatment of p47 phox with amphiphilic agents known to activate the NADPH oxidase (SDS and arachidonic acid) caused a dose-dependent quenching in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of p47 phox , whereas treatment with a number of other amphiphilic agents that failed to activate the oxidase had no effect on p47 phox fluorescence. In addition, the concentration range of activating agents required to induce changes in fluorescence correlated with the concentration range of these agents that induced maximal NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free assay system. We next determined if activation by phosphorylation caused the same type of conformational changes in p47 phox . Protein kinase C phosphorylation of p47 phox in vitro resulted in comparable quenching of fluorescence, which also correlated directly with NADPH oxidase activity. Finally, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of p47 phox was significantly changed by the addition of SDS, whereas treatment with a non-activating detergent had no effect on the CD spectrum. These results support the conclusion that activation by amphiphilic agents results in changes in the secondary structure of p47 phox . Thus, our studies provide direct evidence linking conformational changes in p47 phox to the NADPH oxidase activation/assembly process and also further support the hypothesis that amphiphile-mediated activation of the NADPH oxidase induces changes in p47 phox that are similar to those mediated by phosphorylation in vivo.

Human neutrophils play an essential role in host defense and are key participants in the inflammatory response to foreign pathogens (for reviews, see Refs. 1Boxer G.J. Curnutte J.T. Boxer L.A. Hosp. Practice. 1985; 40: 69-90Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar and 2Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18: S170-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During the inflammatory response, neutrophils are readily mobilized to sites of inflammation, where they phagocytose pathogens and/or fragments of damaged tissue and subsequently release a variety of toxic oxygen radical species which can destroy the engulfed material (1Boxer G.J. Curnutte J.T. Boxer L.A. Hosp. Practice. 1985; 40: 69-90Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18: S170-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The generation of oxygen radicals by neutrophils is known as the respiratory burst and results from the activation of a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (reviewed in Refs. 3Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A.

During the respiratory burst, electrons are transferred from NADPH to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide anion (O·̄2), the direct product of the NADPH oxidase. O·̄2 is then rapidly converted to secondary toxic oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH⋅), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that can efficiently kill microorganisms; in combination with the primary and secondary granule contents, O·̄2 constitutes the primary host defense mechanism used by neutrophils (6Rosen G.M. Pou S. Ramos C.L. Cohen M.S. Britigan B.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase is a highly regulated enzyme complex that is composed of a number of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins (reviewed in Refs.3Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A.

In the resting cell, these proteins remain segregated into cytosolic and plasma membrane compartments. However, because the active enzyme complex is located on the plasma membrane, the cytosolic proteins must translocate from the cytosol to the membrane during assembly of the functional enzyme complex (3Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Robinson J.M. Badwey J.A.

This translocation process is initiated by a series of highly regulated signaling events, resulting in assembly of the active complex. The mechanism by which the NADPH oxidase cytosolic proteins assemble during activation of the oxidase is complex and not completely understood. One of the key cytosolic proteins in this process is known as p47 phox , which seems to be the first cytosolic component to interact with flavocytochrome b during the assembly process (7DeLeo F.R.

Subsequent studies of the exact sites of phosphorylation in p47 phox confirmed that p47 phox serines 303, 304, 320, 328, 345, 348, and 379 were phosphorylated during activation of the oxidase (14el Benna J.

These observations support the conclusion that phosphorylation of p47 phox is a necessary event in the activation of the NADPH oxidase in vivo. In contrast to intact neutrophils, production of O·̄2 in the cell-free assay system does not require phosphorylation of p47 phox (20Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18593-18598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there is a requirement for anionic amphiphilic detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or arachidonic acid (22Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol.

Invest. 1985; 75: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It is still not clear whether amphiphile activation in vitro is mimicking actual physiological eventsin vivo, but it has been suggested that activation with amphiphiles may share mechanistic similarities with activation by phosphorylation (5Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 87-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this idea, it has recently been shown that PKC can also induce O·̄2 generation in the cell-free system without added amphiphiles, thus mimicking the phosphorylation-dependent activation process occurring in vivo (25Cox J.A.

Dis. 1995; 21: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been proposed by several investigators that phosphorylation causes a conformational change in p47 phox and/or neutralizes the cationic region of the proteinin vivo so that it may interact with the membrane (15Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Renee J. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in a similar manner, SDS or arachidonic acid may provide a neutralizing negative charge which allows p47 phox to undergo similar conformational changes in vitro that are likely to occur with phosphorylation in vivo (22Curnutte J.T.

Interestingly, five of the tryptophans are located in the region of p47 phox containing both Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (28Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M.

Thus, we hypothesized that if activation of the NADPH oxidase induced unmasking of this region of p47 phox (28Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S.

In the present studies, we measured changes in p47 phox tryptophan fluorescence before and after exposure to several in vitro activators of NADPH oxidase. We present data showing that both amphiphiles (SDS and arachidonic acid) and PKC phosphorylation cause similar changes in the inherent tryptophan fluorescence of p47 phox , and these changes in fluorescence correlated directly with NADPH oxidase activity. Thus, our results provide direct evidence linking conformational changes in p47 phox to the activation process of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase. Purified human neutrophils, isolated as described previously (33Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from this cavitate using sequential centrifugation, as described by Fujita et al. (34Fujita I. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant p47 phox was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using a modification of the method of Leto et al. (35Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 72 h, the cells were collected, disrupted by cavitation, and the cytosol collected by differential centrifugation (35Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diluted supernatant from ∼2–4 × 108 cells was applied to a Bio-Rad Macro-Prep CM column (10 ml bed volume), the column was washed, and p47 phox was eluted by application of a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The purity (>95%) and identity of the recombinant p47 phox were confirmed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with an anti-p47 phox monoclonal antibody (31DeLeo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein content of the fractions was determined using a Pierce BCA assay. For fluorescence analysis, recombinant p47 phox (in a volume of 40–70 μl) was added as indicated to a final volume of 2 ml of cell-free assay buffer (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.7, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA) in a quartz cuvette containing a stir bar. The samples were then analyzed on a Photon Technology International scanning fluorimeter at 25 °C using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (1-nm bandwidth) and recording the emission spectra from 300 to 450 nm (2-nm bandwidth). Although measurement of tryptophan fluorescence is often performed using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm instead of 280 nm to reduce the contribution of tyrosine residues to the signal, we found that absolute fluorescence of tryptophan was significantly reduced at 295 nm, and the signal to noise ratio using small amounts of protein was much lower. Thus, to confirm that we were only measuring tryptophan fluorescence, we performed a dose-response of fluorescenceversus SDS concentration using excitation at both 280 and 295 nm and found that the dose-response curves plotted as a percentage of control peak fluorescence were identical for the two different excitation wavelengths (data not shown), indicating that tyrosine fluorescence did not contribute significantly to the observed signal. Excitation at 280 nm with 2–5-nm bandwidths led to a slight photobleaching of p47 phox (approximately 5%); therefore, the excitation bandwidth was kept at a minimum to eliminate photobleaching artifacts. Once a base-line spectrum of the protein sample was obtained, SDS or arachidonic acid (or other agents as described under “Results”) could be added directly to the cuvette (with stirring) and a new spectrum obtained immediately. SDS and arachidonic acid were added from concentrated stocks to the final concentrations indicated under “Results.” The arachidonic acid stock solution contained 25% ethanol, but controls containing the ethanol alone did not change the fluorescence spectrum of the protein (maximum final ethanol concentration was 0.4%) (data not shown). Nine μg of purified p47 phox were added to a buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP. Three sets of samples, each in triplicate, were used to compare the fluorescence of p47 phox phosphorylated by PKC (with activators), p47 phox with inactive PKC (without activators), and the fluorescence of the PKC and activators alone. The first set contained 0.2 unit of PKC, 25 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 3 μg of dioctanoyl glycerol. The second set contained 0.2 unit of PKC, but no phosphatidylserine or dioctanoyl glycerol. The third set contained 0.2 unit of PKC, 25 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 3 μg of dioctanoyl glycerol, but no p47 phox . Phosphatidylserine and dioctanoyl glycerol were added in the form of mixed micelles produced as follows. Solutions of the lipids in chloroform were added to a small glass tube and dried down to a lipid film under nitrogen at 4 °C. The lipids were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, by vortexing, sonicating for 2 × 3 s, transferring to a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube, and sonicating again for 10 × 3 s. Twenty μl of this suspension was added to the relevant samples, and the final reaction volume for all samples was 80 μl. Samples were placed in a 37 °C bath for 20 min. After incubation, the entire volume of the reaction was added to 1.92 ml of cell-free assay buffer and analyzed fluorometrically as described above. To verify that phosphorylation was taking place under these conditions, the above ingredients were mixed in the same proportions, but in a smaller final volume (30 μl), and 1 mm unlabeled ATP supplemented with 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added per tube. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the samples were washed of free ATP by filtering the sample through a Spinzyme phosphocellulose filter (Pierce), and the filter with bound protein was placed into a scintillation vial and counted using a Packard scintillation counter. Three sets of duplicate samples were analyzed: one with the complete mixture, one without the lipid activators, and one without p47 phox . Normally, p47 phox has been analyzed in the past using non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE) because of its highly basic nature (36Okamura N. Curnutte J.T. Roberts R.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies by Görg et al. (37Görg A. Postel W. Weser J. Günther S. Strahler J. Hanash S. Somerlot L. Kuick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have shown that basic proteins normally separated by NEPHGE with limited reproducibility can now be perfectly separated under equilibrium conditions using immobilized pH gradients for isoelectric focusing. Therefore, we utilized this method for analyzing p47 phox . Phosphorylation reactions were performed as described above; however, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 225 μl of Immobiline rehydration buffer (8.0 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% Pharmalyte 3–10, and 0.3% DTT). The samples were then placed in individual slots of an Immobiline reswelling tray with an Immobiline 3–10L DryStrip (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The strips were allowed to swell overnight and were then subjected to isoelectric focusing in a Multiphor II electrophoresis apparatus. Isoelectric focusing was done stepwise (1 h at 300 V, 13 h at 1000 V, at 3.5 h at 2000 V) for a total of 20,300 V·h. The focused strips were frozen until the second dimension was run. To run the second dimension, the strips were thawed, gently agitated in equilibration buffer with DTT (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 30% glycerol (v/v), and 0.2% DTT) for 2.5 min and then in equilibration buffer without DTT for 2.5 min. The strips were then placed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and overlaid with a small amount of 0.5% agarose in stacking gel buffer. The gel was then run, followed by transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p47 phox spots were detected by probing with monoclonal anti-p47 phox , as described previously (31DeLeo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the Immobiline strips have an immobilized linear pH gradient, we could estimate the pI of the p47 phox spots from their relative horizontal position on the blot. Relative spot densities were quantified by densitometric analysis with an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Amphiphile-activated NADPH oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically in a cell-free NADPH oxidase assay system as described previously (38Quinn M.T. Curnutte J.T. Parkos C.A. Mullen M.L. Scott P.J. Erickson R.W. Jesaitis A.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2438-2445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl assays containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm FAD, 2 mmNaN3, 50 μm cytochrome c, 4 μl of neutrophil membranes, 4 μl of neutrophil cytosol, and 10 μm GTPγS were incubated with SDS or arachidonic acid (at concentrations as indicated under “Results”) for 5 min, followed by the addition of 200 μm NADPH to initiate the reaction. The change in absorbance at 550 nm was measured continuously over 15 min at 25 °C in a Molecular Devices THERMOmax microtiter plate reader. Results are presented asV max rates, calculated using an ε = 1.88 mm−1 cm−1 for cytochromec, and expressed as nanomoles of O·̄2/min/mg of membrane protein. A variation of the method of El Benna et al. (26El Benna J. Park J.-W. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1995; 21: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used to measure O·̄2 production in a PKC-activated cell-free assay. We used a microtiter plate assay with 0.2-ml reaction volumes containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 50 μm GTPγS, 4 μl of neutrophil cytosol, and 10 μl of neutrophil membranes. In some experiments, recombinant cytosolic proteins were substituted for cytosol as follows: 3–5 μg of p47 phox , 3–5 μg of p67 phox , and 0.5 μg of Rac2 (production of the latter two proteins is described in Ref. 31DeLeo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lipid activators of PKC were added in the form of mixed micelles of phosphatidylserine (25 μg/well) and dioctanoyl glycerol (3.3 μg/well), and micelles were made as described above. PKC (0.2 units) was added to each well, the plates were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of cytochrome c and NADPH at final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mm, respectively. O·̄2 production was measured as described above, except that the plate reader was maintained at 37 °C. For CD spectroscopy, samples of p47 phox were dialyzed into a low ionic strength buffer (15 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1) to minimize the UV absorbance of the buffer below 195 nm. SDS or Zwittergent 3-14 were added to the samples and buffer controls as indicated at final concentrations of 150 μm. The far UV circular dichroism spectra of the p47 phox samples were measured in 0.02-cm pathlength cuvettes using a JASCO model J-710 CD spectrometer. CD spectra were recorded from 260 to 185 nm at a digital resolution of 0.5 nm, with scan speeds of 5 and 2 nm/min for wavelengths above and below 194 nm, respectively. Eight scans were signal averaged for each wavelength range, and the resulting data sets were concatenated. The final CD spectrum was obtained by subtracting base-line scans of the buffer blank measured in the same cuvette used for the sample. To correct the measured CD intensities for the absorption flattening effects (39Wallace B.A. Mao D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) observed in protein samples containing SDS (see “Results”), the far UV absorption spectra from 260–185 nm were measured in the same instrument, and the absorption flattening coefficients were calculated from the ratio of the UV absorption spectra measured with and without detergent present. To analyze potential activation-induced conformational changes in p47 phox , we measured its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence before and after exposure to agents that are used as activators of the NADPH oxidase in the cell-free assay system.

DNA encoding Ov20 was isolated, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Fluorescence-based ligand binding assays show that the protein contains a high affinity binding site for retinol, fluorescent fatty acids (11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid, dansyl-dl-α-aminocaprylic acid, and parinaric acid) and, by competition, oleic and arachidonic acids, but not cholesterol. The fluorescence emission of dansylated fatty acids is significantly blue-shifted upon binding in comparison to similarly sized β-sheet-rich mammalian retinol- and fatty acid-binding proteins. Secondary structure prediction algorithms indicate that a α-helix predominates in Ov20, possibly in a coiled coil motif, with no evidence of β structures, and this was confirmed by circular dichroism. The protein is highly stable in solution, requiring temperatures in excess of 90 °C or high denaturant concentrations for unfolding. Ov20 therefore represents a novel class of small retinol-binding protein, which appears to be confined to nematodes. The retinol binding activity of Ov20 could possibly contribute to the eye defects associated with onchocerciasis and, because there is no counterpart in mammals, represents a strategic target for chemotherapy.

Infection with Onchocerca volvulus can result in perhaps the most distressing of diseases caused by parasitic nematodes, river blindness. The infection is a major cause of eye pathology in areas in which the parasite is endemic, and degenerative and disfiguring skin conditions also result (1Rodger F.C. Bull. W. H. O. 1962; 27: 429-448PubMed Google Scholar). One of the first indications of eye damage in onchocerciasis is night blindness (1Rodger F.C. Bull. W. H. O. 1962; 27: 429-448PubMed Google Scholar), a symptom which would be consistent with a deficiency in available retinoids. The parasites are known to accumulate retinol to a concentration an order of magnitude greater than the tissue they occupy (2Sani B.P. Vaid A. Comley J.C.W. Montgomery J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Sani B.P. Vaid A. Biochem.

RBPs are, therefore, potentially relevant to the survival of the parasite, the development of blindness in sufferers, and to therapeutic interventions against the infection.Retinol is usually transported and protected from chemical degradation in intracellular and extracellular aqueous environments within carrier proteins. The retinol-binding proteins described to date are all β-strand-rich proteins which form β-barrel structures having a single binding site for retinol in their interiors. These proteins can be further subdivided into the predominately extracellular proteins with eight β-strands (the lipocalins), which include plasma retinol-binding protein and milk lactoglobulin (4Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T. Findlay J.B.C. Sivaprasadarao R. Jones T.A. Newcomer M.E. Kraulis P.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and the predominately intracellular 10 β-stranded FABP/P2/CRBP/CRABP family of hydrophobic ligand transporter proteins (5Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of each family bind retinoids and/or fatty acids and have been described throughout the animal phyla, ranging from vertebrates to insects and flatworms (7Haunerland N.H. Jacobson B.L. Wesenberg G. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12378-12385Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Mei B. Kennedy M.W. Beauchamp J. Komuniecki P.R. Komuniecki R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8447-8454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins with retinol binding activities include interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein, which is confined to the interphotoreceptor matrix (sub-retinal space) of the retina, and serum albumin, although retinol binding is thought to be a minor function for albumin in vivo, and both of these are substantially larger and more complex in structure than the β-barrel proteins.Here we describe a new class of helix-rich retinol-binding protein, which is exemplified by the Ov20 protein of O. volvulus.Ov20 originally attracted attention as a glycoprotein secreted by the parasite and has been used in immunological analyses of human immune responses to the infection (10Bradley J.E. Elson L. Tree T.I.M. Stewart G. Guderian R. Calvopiña M. Parades W. Araujo E. Nutman T.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Tree T.I.M. Gillespie A.J. Shepley K.J. Blaxter M.L. Tuan R.S. Bradley J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Genes encoding Ov20-like proteins have also been found in several other parasitic nematodes that are highly pathogenic in humans, and in a plant parasite. 2Unpublished data base entries. 2Unpublished data base entries. Ov20 is shown to possess strong retinol binding, but it is distinct from all the other known RBPs in terms of its structure and the characteristics of its binding site.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe cDNA encoding Ov20 of O. volvulus predicts a 20580.6-Da protein with a hydrophobic leader which is presumably removed posttranslationally (11Tree T.I.M. Gillespie A.J. Shepley K.J. Blaxter M.L. Tuan R.S. Bradley J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Signalp program, trained on eukaryotic sequences, predicts that this cleavage should occur between Ala16 and Asn17 to give a 18781.2-Da polypeptide, assuming no further modifications. DNA encoding Ov20 was amplified by PCR from cDNA using primers designed to exclude the hydrophobic leader, and recombinant protein with a 6xHis affinity tag plus 20 vector-encoded amino acids, was produced in bacteria and purified as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant polypeptide (rOv20; molecular mass 20944.6) was judged to be homogeneous on the bases of a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Data base searching revealed no proteins of known function similar to Ov20, but a short N-terminal amino acid sequence of a retinol-binding protein from the dog heart worm Dirofilaria immitis showed similarities to the Ov20 sequence. 3T. V. Rajan, personal communication. The beginning of this sequence aligns exactly at the predicted cleavage site for the removal of the hydrophobic leader in Ov20.Ligand BindingThe retinol binding activity of rOv20 was investigated using changes in retinoid fluorescence that occur upon interaction with binding proteins (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The fluoresence emission of retinol was minimal in buffer alone, but was dramatically enhanced when added to a solution of Ov20 (Fig. 1). Similar changes were observed with bovine milk lactoglobulin, human serum retinol-binding protein, and recombinant ABA-1 allergen ofAscaris lumbricoides (data not shown), all of which have well described retinol binding activities (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transferrin, ovalbumin, or RNase had no effect on retinol fluorescence (data not shown). The fluorescence enhancement brought about by Ov20 was reversed upon addition of oleic acid, presumably through displacement of retinol from a protein-binding site into solvent. This therefore indicated that Ov20, in common with many retinol-binding proteins, will also bind fatty acids and that the binding sites for retinol and fatty acids are coincident or interact competitively.The dissociation constant of retinol:Ov20 binding was estimated by fluorescence titration in which increasing quantities of retinol were added to an rOv20 solution in the cuvette. Fig.2 shows the dissociation curve, corrected for free retinol, consistent with a single retinol-binding site per molecule of rOv20 (assuming monomeric dispersion), which provided a K d of 8.5 × 10−8m.Figure 2Titration curve for the binding of retinol to rOv20. Change in relative fluorescence intensity at 470 nm of 1.06 μm rOv20 monomer on addition of increasing concentrations of retinol. λexc = 350 nm. The line for free retinol was obtained with increasing concentrations of retinol in PBS in the absence of protein, and the best fit line is shown. This was used to correct for free retinol to produce the corrected curve. The line drawn for the corrected data is the theoretical binding curve for complex formation with a dissociation constant, K d = 8.5 × 10−8m, and apparent stoichiometryn = 0.8 per monomer unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fatty acid binding activity of purified Ov20 was examined using solvent polarity-sensitive fluorescent lipid analogues. The fluorescence emission intensity of DAUDA is increased and shifted to shorter wavelengths when bound to fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) such as rat liver FABP (27Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In buffer alone, the peak emission of DAUDA occurred at 541 nm, but moved to 485 nm upon addition of rOv20 (Fig. 3), together with a marked increase in emission intensity. Blue shifts of this magnitude are taken as indicative of entry of the fluorophore into a highly apolar environment and removal from collisional contact with water (28Macgregor R.B. Weber G. Nature. 1986; 319: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This blue shift was greater than that reported for serum albumin (495 nm) (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and rat liver FABP (500 nm) (27Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and approached that reported for DAUDA binding to the ABA-1 fatty acid-binding protein ofAscaris (475 nm) (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Control experiments with dansylamide revealed minimal binding to rOv20, indicating that the fluorophore group itself does not contribute to the binding of the dansylated fatty acid.Figure 3Binding of DAUDA to recombinant rOv20 and competition with fatty acid. Fluorescence emission spectra (λexc = 345 nm) of 0.64 μm DAUDA alone or upon addition of 1.84 μm rOv20. Also shown is the reversal of changes in DAUDA emission by competition with oleic acid (5.7 μm) added to the rOv20·DAUDA complex. The wavelengths of peak emission by DAUDA when in PBS or when bound to the protein are as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar blue-shifts in fluorescence emission (from 543 to 483 nm) upon interaction with Ov20 were found with a fluorescent fatty acid probe in which the dansyl fluorophore is attached to the α carbon (dansyl-dl-α-aminocaprylic acid), rather than to the hydrocarbon (ω) terminal, as in DAUDA (data not shown). Assuming that the binding of both the dansylated fatty acids is representative of natural ligands, this similarity in behavior of the two probes indicates that the ligand is held entirely within the binding site of rDvA-1L and isolated from polar solvent. X-ray crystallographic studies of the β-barrel retinol- and fatty acid-binding proteins show similar isolation of ligand from solvent (4Papiz M.Z. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. North A.C.T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (with exception of liver fatty acid-binding protein, which holds one of two ligand molecules close to the surface of the protein) (29Thompson J. Winter N. Terwey D. Bratt J. Banaszak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which would serve to protect oxidation-sensitive ligands, such as retinol and other hydrophobic ligands during transport within an organism or cell.Fluorimetric titration of rOv20 with DAUDA (Fig.4A) gave a progressive increase in relative fluorescence intensity, with an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of 9.7 × 10−7m. This value approximates that obtained for other lipid-binding proteins (30Thumser A.E.A. Evans C. Worrall A.F. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and a similar value was obtained for progressive addition of a natural, nonfluorescent fatty acid (oleic acid) to a rOv20:DAUDA mixture (K I apparent = 3.6 × 10−7m; Fig. 4 B). A titration with the naturally fluorescent fatty acid parinaric acid gave a value of 8.6 × 10−7m, which is of the same order of magnitude to the values for DAUDA and oleic acid. Competition was also used to test for binding with other natural ligands, which showed that arachidonic acid, but not cholesterol, binds to rOv20 (data not shown).Figure 4Titration curves for the binding of DAUDA and oleic acid to rOv20. A, change in relative fluorescence intensity at 483 nm (corrected for dilution; λexc = 345 nm) of 1.26 μm DAUDA on addition of increasing concentrations of rOv20. The solid lineis the theoretical binding curve for complex formation with a dissociation constant, K d = 9.7 × 10−7m, and apparent stoichiometry consistent with one binding site per monomer unit. B, decrease in relative fluorescence due to displacement of DAUDA from rOv20 by oleic acid. Increasing concentrations of oleic acid were added to a mixture containing 1.26 μm DAUDA and 2.45 μm rOv20. The solid line is a theoretical curve for simple competitive binding of oleic acid in the DAUDA-binding site of rOv20, with apparent K I (oleic) 3.6 × 10−7m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the hydrophobic ligands that bind to Ov20 in a biological context, a sample of Ov20 which had been affinity-purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” but with no further treatment, was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate, and the extracted material was subjected to GC-MS. The mass spectra revealed single ions consistent with the presence of palmitoleic, palmitic, heptenoic, oleic, and stearic acids. No evidence for significant amounts of retinol was found, which would be consistent with the fact thatE. coli does not synthesize retinoids.Structural Analysis and StabilityThe far UV CD spectrum of Ov20 is illustrated in Fig.5 A, and shows a strong α-helix signal. Analysis of the data over the range 190 to 240 nm by the CONTIN procedure yielded the following estimates of secondary structure: 60 ± 1.3% α-helix, 32 ± 1.6% β-sheet, and the remainder 8 ± 2.7%. In our experience, the application of the CONTIN procedure to proteins with a significant content of α-helix can overestimate the β-sheet content considerably (31White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the estimate of the α-helix is reliable. Addition of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl led to a progressive loss in secondary structure as detected by CD (Fig. 5 B), with the greater part of the unfolding occurring between 3 and 4 m GdnHCl. Ov20 therefore appears to be more robust to this means of denaturation than are many proteins, including the ABA-1-type proteins (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A.

This would indicate that the stability of the protein to chemical denaturation is mirrored by extreme thermal stability, which is also in excess of that exhibited by the ABA-1-type proteins (26Kennedy M.W.

No significant matches to other proteins were found from data base searching. Secondary structure prediction algorithms applied to the whole alignment predicted a highly helical conformation (86% helix), 13.5% loop structures, but no β/extended structure (Fig. 6). When plotted on helical wheels (Fig.7), some of the predicted helical stretches can be seen to be strongly amphipathic. This applies both for the hydrophobic residues occurring in Ov20, and, even more dramatically, for hydrophobic sites conserved across the entire array. This is exemplified by the regions of highest probability helix, from Pro27 to Thr62, from Asp78 to Arg117, and from Met126 to Ala153.Figure 6Structural predictions for Ov20 and its homologs.

Other symbols are as follows: % is for either F or Y, and # is for anyone of NDQEBZ. The PHD line shows the secondary structure prediction from submission of the multiple alignment to the PHD secondary structure prediction program; H = helix, L = loop, · = no prediction; no extended/β structure was predicted), and the final line indicates conserved hydrophilic (+) and hydrophobic (•) positions.

The strongest predictions are for positions 61–89 and 119–155 (probabilities 0.78 and 1.00, respectively), and there is also a possibility of coiled coil from positions 90 to 118 (probability 0.46). All the programs used predicted similar regions of coiled coil in Ov20, and, albeit at slightly lesser probability, in its homologs. Interactions between helices in a coiled-coil conformation might explain the extremely high stability of Ov20 to both heat and chemical denaturation. The coiled-coil interactions could presumably act between the two stretches of predicted coiled coil within a single molecule of Ov20, or be involved in intramolecular interactions between other Ov20 molecules, such as in leucine zippers (33Branden C.

Phosphorylation has been found to control the biological activity of certain proteins, including those involved in gene regulation, controlling homodimerization, and even the stability of α-helices (34Szilak L.

The phosphorylation site of Ov20 is, therefore, potentially involved in control processes, and its localization within the cells of developing parasite embryos might therefore be pertinent. It is, however, also secreted by the parasites, and the PSORT program predicts sorting of the protein into a secretory compartment in the synthesizing cell. It is possible, therefore, that that Ov20 has functions intracellularly in nematodes and that its secretion might be an adaptation for parasitism.The predominance of helical structures within Ov20 clearly sets it apart from the small RBPs of the β-barrel hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins. Acyl coenzyme A-binding protein is known from crystal studies also to be predominately helical, but it does not bind free fatty acids, the nucleotide group of the coenzyme being required to shield the aliphatic tail from the solvent environment (41Kragelund B.B. Andersen K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The only other family of retinoid-binding proteins of similar size and helicity that has been reported are individual units of the polyprotein allergens of nematodes (NPAs), such as ABA-1 (26Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Kennedy M.W. Britton C. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. J. Biol.

These are predicted to be four-helix proteins with no β content, but Ov20 is distinct from the NPAs in that it is not produced as a polyprotein and its primary structure has none of the characteristic features of the NPAs, such as the conserved Trp and pair of Cys residues. This absence of tryptophan residues is another distinguishing feature of Ov20 and its homologs; in all the β-barrel RBPs, and in serum albumin, there is a Trp residue in or near the ligand-binding site (4Pap"

However, efforts to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which caspases induce cell death have been greatly hindered by the lack of systematic and broadly applicable strategies to identify their substrates. Here we describe a novel expression cloning strategy to rapidly isolate cDNAs encoding caspase substrates that are cleaved during apoptosis. Small cDNA pools (approximately 100 clones each) are transcribed/translatedin vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine; these labeled protein pools are then incubated with cytosolic extracts from control and apoptotic cells. cDNA pools encoding proteins that are specifically cleaved by the apoptotic extract and whose cleavage is prevented by the caspase inhibitor acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp chloromethylketone are subdivided and retested until a single cDNA is isolated. Using this approach, we isolated a partial cDNA encoding protein kinase C-related kinase 2 (PRK2), a serine-threonine kinase, and demonstrate that full-length human PRK2 is proteolyzed by caspase-3 at Asp117 and Asp700 in vitro. In addition, PRK2 is cleaved rapidly during Fas- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in vivo by caspase-3 or a closely related caspase. Both of the major apoptotic cleavage sites of PRK2 in vivo lie within its regulatory domain, suggesting that its activity may be deregulated by proteolysis.

Caspases are a novel family of cysteine proteases with aspartate specificity that are related to the Caenorhabditis eleganscell death gene product CED-3. Evidence from many laboratories indicates that caspases play a critical role in the execution of apoptosis. Ectopic expression of these proteases induces programmed cell death. Caspases are normally present in cells as catalytically inactive proenzymes and are proteolytically processed and activated during the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, viral, peptide, and dominant negative inhibitors of caspases delay or prevent programmed cell death (reviewed in Ref. 1Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Finally, homozygous inactivation of caspase-1 (2Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) in mice results in selective defects in apoptosis. Because caspase activation is a crucial event in apoptosis, it is essential to identify the downstream molecular targets of these proteases whose selective proteolysis is likely to underlie the characteristic morphological features of apoptotic cell death. Although a number of structural and signaling proteins have been shown to be cleaved by caspases during programmed cell death (reviewed in Ref. 4Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which caspases induce cell death has been greatly hindered by the lack of systematic and broadly applicable strategies to identify these substrates. Given the absence of such methods and the growing number of caspase family members, it seems likely that the majority of apoptotic caspase targets have yet to be identified. In this report, we describe a method to identify caspase substrates directly and rapidly using labeled protein pools derived from small cDNA library pools (5Lustig K. Kroll K. Sun E. Kirschner M. Development. 1996; 122: 4001-4012PubMed Google Scholar) that have been transcribed/translatedin vitro (6Lustig K.D. Stukenberg T. McGarry T. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P. Zon L. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W.

These protein pools are incubated with cell-free extracts prepared from nonapoptotic and apoptotic cells. cDNA pools encoding proteins specifically cleaved by an apoptotic extract (and prevented by caspase inhibitors) are subdivided and re-examined until a single cDNA is isolated.

Human Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp chloromethyl ketone (YVAD-CMK), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp aldehyde (YVAD-CHO), and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) were obtained from BACHEM Bioscience, Inc. 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pre-existing cDNA pools of approximately 100 clones each from a Xenopus gastrula-stage library (5Lustig K. Kroll K. Sun E.

Development. 1996; 122: 4001-4012PubMed Google Scholar) were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and SP6 RNA polymerase. Reactions were scaled down from the manufacturer's instructions to a 5-μl volume using 100–500 ng of total DNA/pool; all other reagents were proportionately reduced. Jurkat cells were grown to near confluence in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and concentrated to 2 × 107 cells/ml in fresh medium immediately prior to making extracts. An aliquot of concentrated cells was treated with 250 ng/ml of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb) CH-11 (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Thousand Oaks, CA) for 1 h. Cytosolic extracts from untreated cells (control extract) and anti-Fas-treated cells (apoptotic extract) were prepared as described previously (6Lustig K.D. Stukenberg T. McGarry T. King R.W.

Each μl of extract (control or apoptotic) was derived from 4 × 105 cells and contained approximately 8–10 μg of total protein. Protein pools were analyzed in triplicate. 1.5-μl aliquots of each 35S-labeled protein pool were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μl of (i) control extract, (ii) apoptotic extract, or (iii) apoptotic extract preincubated for 15 min with 10 μm YVAD-CMK, a specific caspase inhibitor that inhibits many caspases under these conditions (8Cryns V.L.

Cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × protein lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min.

All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing of both strands. Mutant PRK2 cDNA constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro, and the corresponding35S-labeled proteins were incubated with extracts and bacterially expressed caspases as above. Jurkat cells were seeded overnight in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS.

For caspase inhibitor studies, Jurkat cells were pretreated for 2 h with either DEVD-CHO (1–100 μm) or YVAD-CHO (1–100 μm) and then treated for an additional 5 h with 250 ng/ml anti-Fas mAb. Viabilities were determined in quadruplicate in two independent experiments by the MTT conversion assay as described previously (8Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described elsewhere (8Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in these studies: (i) a PRK2 polyclonal peptide antibody recognizing the C terminus of human PRK2 (1:200 dilution) (7Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); (ii) PARP mAb C2–10 (Pharmingen) (1:2000 dilution); (iii) caspase-3 (CPP32) mAb (Transduction Laboratories) (1:1000 dilution); and (iv) α-tubulin mAb (Sigma) (1:10,000 dilution). 75 cDNA pools containing approximately 100 cDNAs each were transcribed/translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, usually resulting in the production of only 15–28 labeled proteins/pool. This discrepancy likely reflects the presence of empty or noncoding inserts in the cDNA library and variable transcription/translation efficiencies among cDNAs, some of which are not full-length and lack transcription initiation sequences (6Lustig K.D. Stukenberg T. McGarry T. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P. Zon L. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The labeled protein pools were then examined for protein bands specifically modified by a cell-free apoptotic extract derived from cells treated with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. These cytosolic extracts have been shown to faithfully reproduce many of the characteristic features of apoptosis observed in vivo, including selective proteolysis of caspase substrates and fragmentation of added nuclei (14Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 15Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C.

Of the 75 labeled protein pools screened, five contained a single protein that was cleaved by the apoptotic extract but not by this same extract preincubated with the caspase inhibitor YVAD-CMK; one pool contained two such proteins (data not shown). In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of one of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 A, incubation of 35S-labeled protein pool 25 with an apoptotic extract (lane A) resulted in the production of a novel protein fragment of approximately 36 kDa (indicated by the arrow) that was not observed when this pool was incubated with either control extract (lane C) or apoptotic extract preincubated with the caspase inhibitor YVAD-CMK (lane A+I). The specificity of the proteolytic activity of the apoptotic extract (lane A) and its sensitivity to inhibition by YVAD-CMK (lane A+I) was verified by using 35S-labeled PARP, a well characterized caspase-3 substrate, as a control (Fig. 1 B). The observed pattern for protein pool 25 suggests that the novel protein band seen in the apoptotic extract represents a cleavage fragment of a caspase substrate. In this case, disappearance of the intact caspase substrate in the apoptotic extract was not observed because it was only partially cleaved (Fig. 1 C). cDNA pool 25 was progressively subdivided into smaller pools, and the smaller pools were retested until a single cDNA encoding a protein with the above-noted cleavage pattern was isolated (Fig. 1 C). DNA sequencing of clone 25 revealed that it is a partial Xenopus PRK2 cDNA containing the entire C-terminal kinase domain. Comparison of clone 25 with human PRK2 (7Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) revealed a striking degree of homology in the kinase domains: >90% identity at the amino acid level. Because clone 25 is a partial Xenopus PRK2 cDNA, we next examined whether full-length human PRK2 was cleaved by the apoptotic extract. As shown in Fig. 2 A(left-hand panel), 35S-labeled human PRK2 was completely cleaved by the apoptotic extract (lane A) into three fragments of approximately 110, 70, and 36 kDa (indicated by thearrows). However, the closely related kinase PRK1 was not cleaved by the apoptotic extract (Fig. 2 A, right-hand panel). Moreover, the apoptotic cleavage of PRK2 in vitro was completely inhibited by 10 nm DEVD-CHO (Fig.2 B), a peptide caspase inhibitor that preferentially inhibits caspase-3 and related subfamily members (10Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). In contrast, the apoptotic proteolysis of PRK2 was only partially prevented by 1000-fold higher (10 μm) concentrations of YVAD-CHO (Fig.2 B), a selective inhibitor of caspase-1 and related subfamily members (17Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that human PRK2 is cleaved at two distinct sites by a DEVD-inhibitable caspase (caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like family member) during apoptosisin vitro. In an effort to better characterize the caspase(s) responsible for PRK2 proteolysis in the apoptotic extract, we incubated35S-labeled human PRK2 with caspase-1, caspase-2, and caspase-3 (the prototypical members of the three caspase subfamilies). Bacterially expressed caspase-3 cleaved PRK2 into three fragments of identical size seen in the apoptotic extracts (Fig.3 A, left-hand panel). However, incubation of PRK2 with amounts of caspase-1 or caspase-2 that were 5-fold greater than that needed to cleave pro-interleukin-1β and pro-caspase-2, respectively, did not result in any detectable proteolysis of PRK2 (Fig. 3 A, both panels). These findings are consistent with the inhibitor profile of the PRK2 protease and strongly implicate caspase-3 as the protease responsible for PRK2 cleavage during apoptosis in vitro. To identify the caspase-3 cleavage sites in human PRK2, we examined its amino acid sequence and identified two DXXD motifs (the consensus caspase-3 cleavage sequence (12Talanian R.V. Quinlan C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar)) that would result in cleavage fragments of the expected size: DITD117C (in the N-terminal regulatory domain) and DEVD700S (in the C-terminal kinase domain). By site-directed mutagenesis of the critical aspartic acid residues, we created two mutant PRK2 constructs (D117A and D700E). As shown in Fig. 3 B, substitution of aspartate 700 with glutamic acid (D700E) prevented cleavage at this site (the 70- and 36-kDa cleavage fragments were not formed) but not at the second site (the 110-kDa cleavage fragment was produced). In contrast, substitution of aspartate 117 with alanine (D117A) prevented cleavage at this site (the 110-kDa fragment was not formed) but did not prevent cleavage at Asp700, thereby resulting in cleavage fragments of 36 kDa and approximately 90 kDa (appropriately larger than the corresponding 70-kDa fragment seen in wild-type PRK2 because the 20-kDa N-terminal cleavage site is missing). These cleavage patterns are illustrated schematically in Fig. 3 C. Interestingly, cleavage of full-length PRK2 in the D117A mutant was reproducibly diminished compared with either wild-type PRK2 or the D700E mutant (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that proteolysis at this N-terminal site may facilitate subsequent cleavage at Asp700. These results unambiguously establish Asp117 and Asp700 as the two sites in human PRK2 cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis in vitro. Having demonstrated that human PRK2 is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro, we next wanted to determine whether PRK2 was cleaved during apoptosis in vivo. To this end, we performed Western analysis of PRK2 in lysates from Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody or staurosporine for various time periods. Using a polyclonal peptide antibody directed against the C terminus of human PRK2 (7Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a 110-kDa cleavage fragment (indicated by anarrow) was readily detected within 2 h of treatment with either anti-Fas mAb or staurosporine (Fig.4 A) and was observed as early as 1 h after these treatments on prolonged exposure of the blot (data not shown). This fragment is identical in size to the N-terminal cleavage fragment produced in vitro by cleavage at Asp117 (data not shown). A smaller fragment of approximately 100 kDa (indicated by an arrow) was first observed 4 h after treatment with anti-Fas mAb and 2 h after staurosporine treatment. In addition, several faint, smaller fragments (approximately 50–70 kDa in size) were observed at later time points (after 4 h), especially in staurosporine-treated cells; these minor fragments are likely produced by proteases activated after the initiation of apoptosis. Of note, no cleavage fragment in the 30–40-kDa range was detected during Fas- or staurosporine-induced cell death in vivo, indicating that proteolysis at Asp700 does not occur during apoptosis in vivo. Within 6 h of anti-Fas treatment or 4 h of staurosporine treatment, virtually all of the full-length PRK2 had been proteolyzed into the above-noted cleavage fragments. Importantly, PRK2 proteolysis occurs early during the induction of Fas- and staurosporine-mediated apoptosis. As noted, the 110-kDa cleavage fragment can be detected within 1–2 h of exposure to either of these apoptotic stimuli. Within this time period, 88–96% of the anti-Fas mAb-treated cells and 52–75% of the staurosporine-treated cells are still viable. Furthermore, at all time points examined, the extent of PRK2 proteolysis correlated with the degree of cell death. Fas- and staurosporine-induced PRK2 cleavage also coincided temporally with caspase-3 proteolytic activation (as manifested by reduction in intensity of its proenzyme) and proteolysis of the well characterized caspase-3 substrate PARP (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that caspase-3 (or a related subfamily member) is the protease responsible for PRK2 cleavage during apoptosis in vivo. Further evidence implicating caspase-3 in this role comes from the in vivoinhibitor studies. Preincubation of cells with 100 μmDEVD-CHO, a peptide inhibitor that preferentially inhibits caspase-3 (10Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar), prevented Fas-induced PRK2 cleavage and cell death (Fig.4 B). The same concentration of YVAD-CHO, a caspase-1 selective inhibitor (17Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J.

Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar), had little effect on Fas-mediated PRK2 cleavage and cell death. Interestingly, the proteolytic formation of the smaller, 100-kDa PRK2 cleavage fragment was particularly sensitive to inhibition by DEVD-CHO. Concentrations of DEVD-CHO as little as 1–10 μm inhibited formation of this fragment and resulted in the accumulation of excess amounts of the larger, 110-kDa cleavage fragment (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that apoptotic PRK2 proteolysis in vivo may be executed by two distinct caspase-3-like proteases with different sensitivities to DEVD-CHO. In short, the serine-threonine kinase PRK2 is rapidly and specifically cleaved by caspase-3 (and/or a caspase-3-like subfamily member) during apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Although one of the cleavage sites of PRK2 in vitro lies within its kinase domain (D700), both of its major apoptotic cleavage sites in vivo lie within its N-terminal regulatory domain. Given the evidence that both PRK2 and the closely related kinase PRK1 are activated by limited tryptic proteolysis (18Yu W. Liu J. Morrice N.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the activity of PRK2 might be deregulated by its cleavage during apoptosis. Indeed, several other kinases, including protein kinase C δ (21Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and MEKK-1 (25Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), are cleaved and activated by caspase-3 during apoptotic cell death; proteolytic activation of these kinases may contribute to the morphological manifestations of apoptosis. In addition, the successful isolation of PRK2 as a caspase substrate cleaved during apoptosis demonstrates the utility of the small pool expression cloning strategy presented here. By providing a rapid and direct method to identify the downstream targets of these critical apoptotic proteases, this approach should enable investigators to systematically dissect the molecular events/signaling pathways that play an important role in the execution of apoptosis. Although we used an apoptotic extract to screen for caspase substrates, individual recombinant caspases could be used to identify substrates of a particular caspase. Furthermore, the approach has much broader potential applications and can be used to identify substrates of a variety of enzymatic activities, including kinases (6Lustig K.D. Stukenberg T. McGarry T.

Occasionally, oxidation results in the bioactivation of potentially potent carcinogens, particularly with substrates metabolized by P450 2E1 (5Guengerich F.P. Liebler D.C. Crit. Rev.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Rotan, FL1987: 19-79Google Scholar). P450 2E1 is active in the oxidation of many low molecular weight organic compounds (e.g. nitrosamines and alkenes) associated with human cancers, and the reactivity of products with DNA has been demonstrated (7Guengerich F.P. Kim D.-H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 8Yamazaki H. Inui Y. Yun C.-H. Mimura M. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1789-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). DNA alkylating ability and carcinogenicity were shown to be decreased upon deuterium substitution of N-nitrosodimethylamine, now known to be a substrate of P450 2E1 (9Keefer L.K. Lijinsky W. Garcia H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When rat liver microsomes were examined, deuteration was found to increase K m for these reactions ∼5-fold, but the k cat (V max) remained unaffected by deuterium substitution (10Yang C.S. Ishizaki H. Lee M. Wade D. Fadel A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Dagani D. Archer M.C. J. Natl.

Mico B.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3373-3377PubMed Google Scholar). Most P450s are considered to operate according to a general scheme (Fig. 1) (13White R.E. Coon M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 315-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Following substrate binding (step 1), ferric P450 receives 1 electron via NADPH-P450 reductase (step 2). Steps 1a and 2a represent a potential pathway by which Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ in the absence of substrate and suggests a possibility for later entry of the substrate into the catalytic cycle. The ferrous form of the heme binds O2 (step 3) before undergoing a second 1-electron reduction to begin O2 activation (step 4). Although this second electron originates from NADPH-P450 reductase, the accessory protein cytochrome b 5 (b 5, EC 4.4.2 group) appears to play some role in the delivery of the electron to the P450 (14Pompon D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6429-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Insertion of the activated oxygen into the substrate is believed to occur by way of C–H bond cleavage (step 6) followed by rapid oxygen rebound to form product (step 7) (15Groves J.T. McClusky G.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 859-861Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Step 8 is release of the product from the enzyme active site. Within the context of this scheme, the reduction (steps 2 and 4) and chemistry (step 6) are generally considered to be rate-limiting (13White R.E. Coon M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 315-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Steps 9 and 10 reflect the potential for the Fe3+ROH complex to receive an electron from NADPH-P450 reductase, possibly leading to a second cycle of oxidation. High intramolecular kinetic hydrogen isotope effects are seen in many P450 reactions involving C–H bond cleavage and are usually interpreted as evidence for a hydrogen atom abstraction mechanism (16Groves J.T. McClusky G.A. White R.E. Coon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), with some caveats (17Guengerich F.P. Yun C.-H. Macdonald T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27321-27329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There are fewer reports of non-competitive intermolecular hydrogen isotope effects on P450 reactions, and these tend to be onk cat not K m (18Guengerich F.P. Peterson L.A. Böcker R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8176-8183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effects of deuterium substitution onN-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylation were first reported in 1973, a definitive explanation for the intermolecular isotope effect on K m (and notk cat) has not been given. The observation has been repeated using several P450 2E1 substrates (9Keefer L.K. Lijinsky W. Garcia H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Yang C.S.

(10Yang C.S. Ishizaki H. Lee M. Wade D. Fadel A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) compared the competitive inhibition of alternate2H and 1H substrates of P450 2E1 and suggested that the observed deuterium effect was due, in part, to a rate difference in the breaking of the C–H bond and its relationship with other rate constants. It was also proposed (10Yang C.S. Ishizaki H. Lee M. Wade D. Fadel A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the effect onV/K might be interpreted in the context of a generalized scheme (23Korzekwa K. Trager W.F. Gillette J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9012-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Gillette J.R. Darbyshire J.F. Sugiyama K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2927-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in which (i) the isotopically sensitive step (C–H bond breaking) precedes a slower step (possibly product release) and (ii) the enzyme exhibits a low commitment to catalysis. Yang et al. (10Yang C.S. Ishizaki H. Lee M. Wade D. Fadel A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) also suggested that rate-limiting product release could explain the results if a relatively high degree of uncoupling of the activated P450-oxygen complex also occurred. MMO is a mixed-function monooxygenase that is functionally similar to P450 2E1 (25Rataj M.J. Kauth J.E. Donnelly M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18684-18690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMO requires a multi-enzyme complex and NADH as a co-substrate. The non-heme, two-iron catalytic center catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Additionally, MMO has been shown to exhibit apparent isotope effects that are similar to those seen with P450 2E1. Chemical quench studies of the intermediates and interconversion rates in the MMO catalytic cycle revealed that product release is the rate-limiting step in this cycle (26Lee S.K. Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nesheim J.C. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10240-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that this might be the case for P450 2E1. To determine the basis for the kinetic hydrogen isotope effects observed with P450 2E1, we have used deuterium substitution and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques to characterize the effect of deuteration on individual steps of the catalytic cycle. The role ofb 5 and its ability to enhance the rate of product formation were also examined. We interpret the observed kinetic isotope effects terms of rate-limiting product release and isotopically sensitive C–H bond cleavage. Rabbit NADPH-P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) and rabbitb 5 were purified as previously reported (28Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Recombinant human P450 2E1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described (30Gillam E.M.J. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem.

Lauric acid was purchased from Aldrich and recrystallized from CH3OH:H2O (50:50, v/v). 11-Hydroxylauric acid was synthesized from 11-dodecenoic acid (Nu-Check-Prep, Elysian, MN) as described by Brown and Geoghegan (33Brown H.C. Geoghegan Jr., P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 1522-1524Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The identity of 11-hydroxylauric acid was confirmed by NMR and fast atom bombardment-mass spectral analysis. Cumene hydroperoxide (80%, Aldrich) was purified by extraction with alkali (34Nordblom G.D. White R.E. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and stored under argon Dinitrophenylhydrazine·HCl, purchased from Eastman Kodak Co., was recrystallized from H2O before use. 18-Crown-6-ether and 4-bromomethyl-6,7-dimethoxycoumarin were purchased from Aldrich. FloroxTM reagent (2.5 mg ofO-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine·HCl ml−1, in pyridine) was obtained from Pierce. Pesticide grade hexane was purchased from Mallinckrodt-Baker (Paris, KY), and pesticide grade CH3OH was from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). [1-3H]Ethanol (16.3 mCi/mmol, anhydrous), [14C]ethanol (55 mCi/mmol), and [1-14C]lauric acid (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Before use, [1-3H]ethanol and [1-14C]ethanol were purified on BakerbondTM octadecylsilane 3-ml disposable extraction columns (J. T. Baker Inc.) to remove, respectively, 3H2O and [14C]acetaldehyde, by-products of radioactive ethanol synthesis. For purification, extraction columns were first washed with 10 ml of CH3OH and then equilibrated with 10 ml of H2O. [1-3H]Ethanol (100 μl diluted with H2O to 340 mm, 16.3 mCi mmol−1) or 150 μl of [14C]ethanol (diluted with [1H]ethanol and H2O to 170 mm, 10 mCi of mmol−1) was loaded onto the column. Analytes were eluted with <3 ml of H2O, and ∼150-μl fractions were collected. A portion of each fraction was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Radioactivity was plotted against fraction number, and the fractions comprising the major radioactive peak were pooled. The purity of the pooled solutions was confirmed by HPLC interfaced with radioflow detection (described under “Intrinsic Isotope Effect Estimation,” see below). The concentrations of ethanol solutions were determined by measuring NADH formation spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in a reduction assay using yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (35Sund H. Theorell H. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrback K. 2nd Ed. The Enzymes. VII. Academic Press, New York1963: 25Google Scholar). The purified solutions were then counted by liquid scintillation to determine the specific activity. Unless otherwise specified, P450 2E1 (1.0 μm) was reconstituted withb 5 (2.0 μm), NADPH-P450 reductase (3.0 μm), and DLPC (30 μm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For steady-state measurements, 100-μl reactions were initiated with either an NADPH-generating system (36Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1989: 777-814Google Scholar) or 1.0 mm cumene hydroperoxide and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in reaction vials sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa. Reactions supported by cumene hydroperoxide lacked NADPH-P450 reductase and b 5. Reactions were terminated with 20 μl of a mixture of 17% ZnSO4(w/v) and 0.55 mm semicarbazide (1:1, v/v) and centrifuged following addition of saturated Ba(OH)2 (5.0 μl). The acetaldehyde product was rederivatized to form the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (37Shriner R.L. Fuson R.C. Curtin D.Y. The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1965: 253-254Google Scholar) and then analyzed by HPLC using a Zorbax 6.2 × 80-mm octadecylsilane reversed-phase analytical column (3 μm, DuPont Chromatography Products, Wilmington, DE) (H2O:CH3CN, 45:55, v:v; 2.0 ml min−1), monitoring A 340) (38Brady J.F. Lee M.J. Li M. Ishizaki H. Yang C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 148-154PubMed Google Scholar). For reactions with [3H]- and [14C]ethanol, the HPLC peaks containing the radioactive product were collected and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry, with calibration of counting efficiency using external [3H]- and [14C]toluene standards. P450 2E1 (0.5 μm) was reconstituted with NADPH-P450 reductase andb 5 as described for the ethanol oxidation assay. Reactions (400 μl) with lauric acid ord 23-lauric acid (0–200 μm, as sodium salt) were terminated after 10 min at 37 °C by adding 50 μl of 12.5% H2SO4 (v:v). The quenched reactions were extracted twice with 6 ml of (C2H5)2O, and the combined extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and then evaporated under a stream of N2. The residue was redissolved in 100 μl of 18-crown-6-ether dissolved in CH3CN (2.5 mg ml−1), to which was added 100 μl of 4-bromomethyl-6,7-dimethoxycoumarin dissolved in (CH3)2CO (10 mg ml−1) (in the presence of 2 mg of anhydrous K2CO3). The samples were incubated 60 min at 70 °C to form fluorescent derivatives. Product formation was measured by HPLC using a Zorbax 6.2 × 80 mm octadecylsilane reversed-phase analytical column (3 μm, DuPont, H2O:CH3CN, 41:59, v:v; 2.0 ml min−1). Fluorescence was monitored at λexcitation 375 nm, λemission 470 nm (39Amet Y. Berthou F. Goasduff T. Salaun J.P. Le Breton L. Menez J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). External standards of 11-hydroxylauric acid were used for quantitation. Experiments using [1-14C]lauric acid were quenched with H2SO4 as described above, and reactions (40 μl) were extracted twice with 3 ml of (C2H5)2O, and the combined extracts were dried under N2. The residue was redissolved in 100 μl of CH3OH, and 50-μl aliquots were analyzed by HPLC interfaced with radioflow counting (ZorbaxTM 4.6 × 250-mm octadecylsilane reversed-phase analytical column, 5 μm, DuPont) (H2O:CH3CN, 50:50, v:v; 2.0 ml min−1). The [1-14C]11-hydroxylauric acid peak was collected and re-counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Deuterium isotope effects were determined by two methods (40Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In a non-competitive method, P450 2E1 was incubated with d0 -ethanol ord2 -[1,1-2H]ethanol (0–100 mm) or d0 -lauric acid ord23 -lauric acid (0–150 μm), and the products were analyzed as described. K m andk cat were calculated using ak cat nonlinear regression program (Bio-Metallics, Princeton, NJ). In a competitive method, P450 2E1 was incubated with a 1:1 mixture (v/v) of d0 -ethanol andd2 -ethanol (20 mm). The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones were extracted into CH2Cl2 and analyzed by capillary column GC-PIEIMS (17Guengerich F.P. Yun C.-H. Macdonald T.L. J. Biol.

The tritium isotope effect T(V/K) on ethanol oxidation was determined by reaction of P450 2E1 with [1-3H]ethanol (20 mm). Previous work by others (21Ekström G. Norsten C. Cronholm T.

P450 2E1 (40 or 200 pmol) was incubated in the presence of either 200 mm[1H]ethanol, 20 mm [3H]- or [14C]ethanol, or 100 μm[14C]lauric acid in a 40-μl reaction volume for a period ranging from 2 ms to 10 min (as indicated) at 37 °C. Reactions with radioactive ethanol were quenched with a ZnSO4/semicarbazide mixture and analyzed as described for steady-state reactions. Reactions using [1H]ethanol were quenched by the addition of 30% pesticide grade CH3OH and derivatized with PFB-hydroxylamine by reacting the 250-μl quenched reaction volume with 20 μl of FloroxTM reagent for 20 min at 60 °C. The oxime derivative was extracted into 1.0 ml of pesticide grade hexane, and the residual reagent was back-extracted following addition of 3 drops of concentrated H2SO4. The hexane layer (0.7 ml) was dried under N2 and then redissolved in 20 μl of hexane. The oxime derivative was analyzed by GC-NICIMS (45Koshy K.T. Kaiser D.G. VanDerSlik A.L. J. Chromatogr.

P450 2E1 was reconstituted with NADPH-P450 reductase with or without b 5 as described for steady-state ethanol oxidation experiments. Reconstituted enzyme (196 μl) was preincubated for 1 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of substrate (20 mm ethanol or 0.15 mmchlorzoxazone). Reactions were initiated with the addition of 4 μl of 10 mm NADPH, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored spectrophotometrically. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a modified Cary 14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). Rates of NADPH oxidation were calculated using ε340 = 6.22 mm−1cm−1 for NADPH. Reaction systems were prepared exactly as described above, except that reaction volumes were 0.5 ml. Reactions were initiated by adding the NADPH-generating system and were terminated by adding 0.8 ml of cold CF3CO2H (3%, w:v) after 10 min at 37 °C. H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically by reaction with ferroammonium sulfate and potassium thiocyanate as described (48Kostrubsky V.E. Szakacs J.G. Jeffery E.H. Woods S.G. Bement W.J. Wrighton S.A. Sinclair P.R. Sinclair J.F. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1997; 27: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme mixtures and NADPH (600 μm) solutions were prepared separately as described for steady-state reactions. Some enzyme mixtures contained 20 mm ethanol (or 0.15 mm chlorzoxazone). The solutions were made anaerobic by alternating applications of vacuum and argon to a closed system as described previously (49Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W. Ueng Y.-F. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Reduction kinetics were monitored in a stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics SX-17MV instrument, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) at 37 °C under a CO atmosphere. Rapid reduction of P450 2E1 to a Fe2+·CO complex was observed at 450 nm upon mixing of reconstituted enzymes with NADPH. Data were collected using the Applied Photophysics software system and fitted to exponential equations using a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear regression analysis. Results are reported as three to eight individually monitored reactions averaged using the manufacturer's software. The hydrazone derivatives were analyzed by GC-PIEIMS. Analytes were separated on a 15-m SPBTM-1 fused silica capillary column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) interfaced to a Finnigan INCOS 50 mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). GC conditions were as follows: carrier gas (2He) at constant pressure of 10 p.s.i.; injection port 230 °C; transfer line 260 °C. The initial column temperature was 150 °C and was increased to 300 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1. The [1H]acetaldehyde hydrazone was detected by selected ion monitoring at m/z 224, and the [2H]acetaldehyde hydrazone was monitored atm/z 225 (Fig. 4). GC-NICIMS of the PFB-oxime derivatives was performed using a 30-m SPBTM-5 fused silica capillary column (Supelco) coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5989A mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE). GC conditions were as follows: carrier gas (2He) at constant pressure of 0.8 p.s.i.; injection port 265 °C; transfer line 270 °C. The column was initially held at 65 °C for 10 min, increased by 5 °C min−1 to 100 °C, and then raised at 20 °C min−1 to 250 °C (Fig.5). Acetaldehyde-PFB oxime was quantitated by selected ion monitoring at m/z 181, using propionaldehyde-PFB oxime as an internal standard. The retention times of the analytes were verified by monitoring ions corresponding to M+ − 20 (M+-HF) for each of the oximes (Fig.6).Figure 5GC-MS of aldehyde-PFB oximes. Peaks 1 and 2 are identified as acetaldehyde-PFB oxime stereoisomers (E and Z), and peaks 4and 5 are identified as propionaldehyde-PFB oxime stereoisomers (used as internal standard).

Multiple lamin kinases have been identified, including protein kinase C, that mediate mitotic lamin phosphorylation and mitotic nuclear lamina disassembly. Conversely, lamin dephosphorylation is required for nuclear lamina reassembly at the completion of mitosis. However, the protein phosphatase(s) responsible for the removal of mitotic phosphates from the lamins is unknown. In this study, we use human lamin B phosphorylated at mitosis-specific sites as a substrate to identify and characterize a lamin phosphatase activity from mitotic human cells. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the mitotic lamin phosphatase corresponds to type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1). First, mitotic lamin phosphatase activity is inhibited by high nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid and the specific PP1 peptide inhibitor, inhibitor-2. Second, mitotic lamin phosphatase activity cofractionates with PP1 after ion exchange chromatography. Third, microcystin-agarose depletes mitotic extracts of both PP1 and lamin phosphatase activity. Our results demonstrate that PP1 is the major mitotic lamin phosphatase responsible for removal of mitotic phosphates from lamin B, a process required for nuclear lamina reassembly.

Our results demonstrate that PP1 is the major mitotic lamin phosphatase responsible for removal of mitotic phosphates from lamin B, a process required for nuclear lamina reassembly. In higher eukaryotes, mitosis is characterized by a dramatic structural reorganization of the cell. Mitotic changes include chromosome condensation, mitotic spindle formation, nuclear lamina disassembly, vesiculation of the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope breakdown (1Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Nuclear lamina disassembly is the best characterized of these mitotic processes (2Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The nuclear lamina is a proteinaceous scaffold underlying the inner nuclear membrane and is an anchoring site for interphase chromatin (3Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The major constituents of the nuclear lamina are the A-, B-, and C-type lamins, which are members of the intermediate filament protein family (3Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HL60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, express only lamin B, making them a convenient system for the study of lamin dynamics (4Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8253-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lamins contain a central α-helical domain that mediates coiled-coil dimerization (5McKeon F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Head-to-tail dimer interactions form lamin polymers that associate laterally to form the supramolecular meshwork that constitutes the nuclear lamina (3Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, hyperphosphorylation of the nuclear lamins leads to transient disassembly of the nuclear lamina, a process that is required for nuclear envelope breakdown (2Nigg E.A. Curr.

Inhibition of phosphorylation at this site leads to failure to enter mitosis and inhibition of nuclear lamina disassembly (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

During late anaphase/early telophase, nuclear membrane-derived vesicles reassociate with the chromatin, and the nuclear lamina repolymerizes to form daughter nuclei (10Chaudhary N. Courvalin J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The nuclear envelope reassembles by sequential targeting of envelope components to the chromatin surface, beginning with attachment of nuclear membrane vesicles containing the lamin B receptor, which may then recruit lamin B to the reforming nucleus (10Chaudhary N. Courvalin J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Lamin dephosphorylation is required for nuclear lamina reassembly (3Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), at which time the lamins repolymerize around the daughter cell chromatin and the nuclear envelope is reconstructed (11Ottaviano Y. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 624-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein phosphatase responsible for the late mitotic dephosphorylation of the lamins and nuclear lamina reassembly is unknown. In this report we identify and characterize a lamin B phosphatase activity in late mitotic cell extracts. Biochemical evidence indicates that the source of lamin phosphatase activity in mitotic cells is a type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1). These studies implicate PP1 in nuclear lamina reassembly and the completion of mitosis. Human promyelocytic (HL60) leukemia cells were grown and maintained in suspension culture as described previously (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Cells were washed to remove aphidicolin and released into fresh Iscove's medium containing 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h to arrest cells in prometaphase. Cells were washed to remove nocodazole, released into fresh medium, and harvested 1 h later in late mitosis. Cell cycle distribution was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis as described previously (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells in late mitosis were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mm benzamidine by gentle vortexing. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove nuclei and cellular debris. Protease inhibitors were used routinely in all experiments to prevent degradation of PP1 regulatory subunits. Mitotic lysates were assayed for protein phosphatase activity using phosphorylated human lamin B as substrate. To prepare lamin B phosphorylated at mitotic sites, nuclear envelopes were isolated from unsynchronized HL60 cells as described previously (4Fields A.P. Pettit G.R. May W.S. J. Biol.

Purified nuclear envelopes were phosphorylated using recombinant, baculovirus-expressed human PKC βII in a standard PKC reaction buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (8Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J.

Routinely, 5 × 105 cell equivalents of late mitotic cell lysate were used in 15-min reactions, conditions under which phosphatase activity was linear. In some cases, the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (LC Laboratories) or inhibitor-2 peptide (Calbiochem) were included in the phosphatase assay at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis.32P-Labeled lamin B was visualized by autoradiography, and lamin B phosphorylation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The presence of lamin B and PP1 in cell lysates and column fractions was determined by immunoblot analysis. After electrophoresis in either 8% (lamin B) or 12% (PP1) acrylamide gels, resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell) as described previously (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was conducted as described previously using either a monoclonal antibody to human lamin B (Matritech), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal residues 296–309 (GEPHVTRRTPDYFL) of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal residues 317–330 (RPITPPRNSAKAKK) of rat PP1Cα, or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal residues 347–360 (LPSVRQIDATFVRF) of human sds22 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard and Perry) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). In some cases, immunoblots were quantitated by analysis of the exposed film with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Mitotic cell lysate from 1 × 108 cells was loaded onto a Bio-Scale Q5 column (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5, and the column was developed using a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5. 2-ml fractions were collected, and protein elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. 10 μl of each fraction was analyzed for lamin B phosphatase activity as described above. 50 μl of each fraction was subjected to immunoblot analysis for PP1 content. HL60 cells were harvested and lysed in late mitosis as described above. Cell lysates were incubated with microcystin-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 10 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with buffer A (50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5m NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors) to remove unbound proteins prior to elution with 3 m NaSCN in buffer A to remove affinity-purified PP1 along with associated subunits. The onput lysate, unbound fraction, and bound eluates were subjected to immunoblot analysis for PP1 as described above. In addition, onput lysate and unbound fraction were assayed for lamin B phosphatase activity as described above. Previous studies from our laboratory have examined the role of site-specific phosphorylation of lamin B in the process of mitotic nuclear lamina disassembly (8Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19074-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that PKC βII mediates direct phosphorylation of lamin B at the major mitosis-specific site, Ser405, within the carboxyl-terminal domain of lamin B just prior to mitosis (8Goss V.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC-mediated phosphorylation of lamin B leads to nuclear lamina disassembly in vitro (13Hocevar B.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of PKC βII-mediated phosphorylation of lamin B leads to cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of this phosphorylation event in mitotic nuclear lamina disassembly and cell cycle progression. In the present study, we wished to identify the cellular phosphatase responsible for removing mitotic phosphate residues from lamin B. For this purpose, we developed an in vitro assay system consisting of human lamin B phosphorylated at mitotic sites by recombinant human PKC βII as a substrate for phosphatases derived from extracts of cells in late mitosis. When mitotically phosphorylated lamin B is incubated with mitotic cell lysate, a time-dependent loss of [32P]phosphate label in lamin B is observed (Fig.1 A). Dephosphorylation is not due to an endogenous phosphatase activity within the nuclear envelope because dephosphorylation is not seen upon incubation with diluent alone (Fig. 1 A). Loss of phosphate on lamin B is dose-dependent, because addition of increasing amounts of mitotic cell lysate leads to a corresponding decrease in phosphate on lamin B (Fig. 1 B). Lamin B is readily dephosphorylated by crude mitotic lysate in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively), characteristic of an enzymatic activity. Because proteolysis of lamin B could mimic dephosphorylation in this assay, immunoblot analysis for lamin B was performed to establish that loss of 32P-labeled lamin B is not attributable to protein degradation (Fig. 1 C). As can be seen, no loss of lamin B mass is observed following incubation with mitotic lysates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of phosphate from lamin B is due to the presence of a protein phosphatase activity in mitotic cell lysates. Although hundreds of serine/threonine protein kinases phosphorylate substrates within a cell, most dephosphorylation is mediated by only four major classes of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) (14Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity can distinguish between these classes (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies with microcystin and okadaic acid have demonstrated that most of the serine/threonine phosphatase activity within a cell is attributable to PP1 and PP2A (14Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both of these phosphatase classes have been linked to mitotic events (14Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Ajiro K. Yoda K. Utsumi K. Nishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13197-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. Silver R.V. Cell Motil.

Therefore, we suspected that our lamin B phosphatase activity could be one of these two classes, and inhibitor studies were conducted to distinguish between them. Okadaic acid (LC Laboratories), a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, inhibits PP1 with an IC50 of 60–200 nm and PP2A with an IC50 of 1–2 nm (16Ajiro K. Yoda K. Utsumi K. Nishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13197-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 17Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. Silver R.V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. Decaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used okadaic acid to characterize the lamin B phosphatase activity (Fig.2 A). Okadaic acid was found to inhibit lamin B phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion with an apparent IC50 of 80 nm, consistent with the published IC50 of okadaic acid for PP1. In addition to okadaic acid, inhibitory proteins can also be used to distinguish these two classes of protein phosphatase. Several inhibitory polypeptides (inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2, NIPP-1, and DARPP-32) exist in the cell that are highly selective for PP1, whereas PP2A remains completely insensitive to inhibition by these proteins (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). For this assay, we used inhibitor-2, which can completely abolish PP1 activity at nanomolar concentrations (20Helps N.R. Street A.J. Elledge S.J. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purified inhibitor-2 potently inhibits lamin B phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion with an apparent IC50 of 1.2 nm (Fig. 2 B). These studies indicate that the mitotic lamin B phosphatase is PP1. To explore the possibility that multiple lamin B phosphatases are present in mitotic cells, late mitotic cell extracts were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using a gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl, and individual column fractions were analyzed for lamin B phosphatase activity (Fig.3 A). This analysis reveals a major peak of lamin phosphatase activity (fractions 41–43) eluting at ∼300 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblot analysis of these fractions with polyclonal antibodies against PP1 demonstrates that a peak of immunoreactive PP1 directly coincides with the observed peak of lamin B phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A,inset). Immunoblot analysis of the column fractions using polyclonal antibodies to PP1 and PP2A shows a nearly complete separation of these two phosphatase classes by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 3 B), providing further evidence that the lamin phosphatase activity is PP1. Microcystin is a cyclic heptapeptide produced by most strains of the blue-green algae Microcystis aeruginosa and is a potent inhibitor of PP1 (21Honkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Moore R.E. Daily S.L.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Microcystin is routinely coupled to agarose beads for rapid affinity purification of these phosphatases along with associated regulatory subunits (14Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,22Moorhead G. Mackintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. Mackintosh C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To determine if microcystin-agarose can deplete lamin B phosphatase activity, late mitotic cell lysate was incubated with microcystin-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). As can be seen, microcystin-agarose depletes cell lysates of lamin B phosphatase activity by approximately 80% (Fig.4 A). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates for PP1 before and after incubation with microcystin-agarose reveals a concomitant decrease (70% reduction by densitometry) in PP1 levels following affinity depletion (Fig.4 B). A second immunoreactive band of about 40 kDa is also seen in the unbound lane that does not fractionate with PP1 by anion exchange chromatography, has no lamin B phosphatase activity, and does not bind microcystin-agarose. Therefore, this band appears to be nonspecifically recognized by the polyclonal antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates reveals that PP2A does not bind significantly to the microcystin-agarose (data not shown), confirming again that PP1 rather than PP2A is responsible for the lamin B phosphatase activity. PP1 and PP2A are potential mediators of lamin B dephosphorylation because they have both been implicated in mitotic processes (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 17Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. Silver R.V. Cell Motil.

The catalytic subunits of these two phosphatases share approximately 40% sequence identity (26Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These two phosphatase families are distinguished by their sensitivity to selective phosphatase inhibitors as well as to inhibitory polypeptide subunits (17Johnston J.A. Sloboda R.D. Silver R.V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that PP1 mediates lamin B dephosphorylation in late mitotic cells. Genetic studies in yeast, Aspergillus andDrosophila implicate a role for PP1 in cell cycle regulation (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 26Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In these organisms, mutation of their PP1 homologs leads to mid-mitotic arrest or other mitotic defects (24Mackelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Doonan J.H.

Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hence, PP1 activity seems to be required for the completion of mitosis. Several lines of evidence indicate that PP1 plays a role in mitosis in mammalian cells as well. First, exposure of HL60 cells to okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP1, leads to cell cycle arrest at G2/M over a 24-h period (19Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. Decaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, microinjection of an inhibitory PP1 antibody into rat embryo fibroblasts at mitosis arrests cells in metaphase (30Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Finally, microinjection of active PP1 during anaphase accelerates cytokinesis and reflattening of the injected cell (30Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies in rat embryo fibroblasts reveal that PP1 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of G1 and S phase cells, accumulates in the nucleus during G2 phase, and intensely colocalizes with the nuclear chromatin at mitosis (30Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This colocalization suggests the presence of a nuclear targeting subunit as well as an important role in nuclear processes (31Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. TIBS. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Although there is genetic and biochemical evidence of a role for PP1 in nuclear function and mitosis, little is known about the physiologic mitotic substrates for PP1 (32Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To date, only one potential mitotic substrate for PP1, histone H1, has been identified (33Paulson J.R. Patzlaff J.S. Vallis A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that mitotically phosphorylated lamin B is a substrate for PP1 isolated from late mitotic cells. We propose that PP1 mediates nuclear lamina reassembly, in part by dephosphorylation of lamin B, based on several lines of evidence. First, HL60 cells treated with a high concentration of okadaic acid enter a mitosis-like state characterized by nuclear lamina disassembly, suggesting that PP1 activity is required to maintain an intact nuclear lamina (19Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. Decaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, dephosphorylation of chicken lamin B2 by purified PP1in vitro allows reassembly of lamin head-to-tail polymers (6Peter M. Heitlinger E. Haner M. Aebi U. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Finally, immunolocalization studies in mitotic rat fibroblasts reveal PP1 translocation to the nuclear chromatin (30Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which is the site of nuclear lamina reassembly. PP1 is a family of serine/threonine phosphatases that play a role in many cellular processes including muscle contraction, protein synthesis, glycogen metabolism, and cell cycle control (27Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization of PP1 are regulated through association of the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) with one or more regulatory subunits that function in an inhibitory, regulatory, or targeting manner (15Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 24Mackelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Ludlow J.W. Nelson D.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 27: 227-281Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 35Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies using microcystin affinity chromatography, we have identified at least six proteins associated with mitotic PP1C that are candidates for regulatory or targeting subunits for PP1. 2L. J. Thompson and A. P. Fields, unpublished results. Further studies will be required to determine if any of these PP1C-binding proteins convey lamin B specificity. To date, the only known regulator of PP1 that has been implicated in the control of mitosis is sds22. In yeast, sds22 acts as a positive regulator of PP1 and is required for the completion of anaphase (24Mackelvie S.H. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Ohkura H. Yanagida M. Cell. 1991; 64: 149-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Homologs of sds22 have recently been identified as regulatory subunits of PP1 in both rat and human (18Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Renouf S. Beullens M. Wera S. Van Eynde A. Sikela J. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, immunoblot analysis of the lamin B phosphatase after purification on microcystin-agarose using an antibody to sds22 did not reveal its presence (data not shown). Likewise, the major nuclear regulator of PP1, NIPP-1, was not detected by immunoblot analysis of affinity-purified lamin phosphatase (data not shown). Therefore, the polypeptide(s) associated with mitotic PP1C appear to be novel, because they do not correspond to these known PP1 regulators. Future studies will focus on the further identification and biochemical characterization of these PP1-binding proteins and analysis of their role in the mitotic function of PP1C. We thank Dr. M. Beullens (Leuven, Belgium) for the immunoblot analysis of the lamin phosphatase for the presence of sds22 and NIPP-1."

N-771 is a photoreactive enzyme that is inactivated by nitrosylation of the non-heme iron center and activated by photodissociation of nitric oxide (NO). To obtain structural information on the iron center, we isolated peptide complexes containing the iron center by proteolysis. When the tryptic digest of the α subunit isolated from the inactive form was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, the absorbance characteristic of the nitrosylated iron center was observed in the peptide fragment, Asn105-Val-Ile-Val-Cys-Ser-Leu-Cys-Ser-Cys-Thr-Ala-Trp-Pro-Ile-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Pro-Thr-Trp-Tyr-Lys128. The peptide contained 0.79 mol of iron/mol of molecule as well as endogenous NO. Subsequently, by digesting the peptide with thermolysin, carboxypeptidase Y, and leucine aminopeptidase M, we found that the minimum peptide segment required for the nitrosylated iron center is the 11 amino acid residues from αIle107 to αTrp117. Furthermore, by using mass spectrometry, protein sequence, and amino acid composition analyses, we have shown that the 112th Cys residue of the α subunit is post-translationally oxidized to a cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) in the NHase.

NHase consists of two kinds of subunits (α and β with the molecular mass values of 23 kDa) and contains non-heme iron (3Sugiura Y. Kuwahara J. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Am. Chem.

N-771, which is a αβ heterodimer containing a non-heme iron, is inactivated by aerobic incubation in the dark for a half-day (dark-inactivation), whereas the enzyme purified from the dark-inactivated cells is immediately converted to the active form by light irradiation (photoactivation) (5Nagamune T.

Recently, it has been revealed that dark-inactivation and photoactivation are controlled by association and photodissociation of nitric oxide (NO) with the non-heme iron center (7Noguchi T. Honda J.

The iron-containing NHase is the first enzyme with a mononuclear low-spin non-heme iron(III) which is thought to be involved in the catalysis (3Sugiura Y. Kuwahara J. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5848-5850Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The structure of the iron center in the active form has been studied by various spectroscopies including ESR (3Sugiura Y.

Recently, the metal site structure has been studied in detail by means of electron nuclear double resonance (18Doan P.E. Nelson M.J. Jin H. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7014-7015Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), resonance Raman (19Brennan B.A. Cummings J.G. Chase D.B. Turner Jr., I.M. Nelson M.J.

It was demonstrated that the coordination sphere of the metal site consisted of twocis-coordinated sulfhydryl ligands, three His imidazole ligands, and an exchangeable solvent ligand, probably an hydroxo group. It is widely believed that the metal site structure of the cobalt-containing NHases is closely related with that of the iron-containing one. Indeed, recent ESR and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies showed that the metal site of the NHase fromRhodococcus rhodochrous J1 was a mononuclear low-spin six-coordinate Co3+ ion with the ligand field of mixed sulfur, and nitrogen or oxygen donor atoms (4Brennan B.A. Alms G. Nelson M.J. Durney L.T. Scarrow R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9194-9195Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In previous reports, we found that the iron center bound with NO is solely located on the α subunit (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Odaka M. Noguchi T. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Yabuki S. Hoshino M. Inoue Y. Endo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the α subunit denatured by 6 m urea exhibited light-induced UV-Vis absorptional change similar to the native NHase, indicating that the nitrosylated iron center was stably associated with the α subunit even unfolded (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, Duine and colleagues 4J. A. Duine, personal communication. 4J. A. Duine, personal communication. digested the inactive NHase with Pronase, and obtained a peptide containing chromophore with an absorption peak characteristic of the inactive form. These findings suggest that the iron atom binds with a short specific region of the α subunit. In the present study, we analyzed the iron-binding site through proteolytic cleavage of the α subunit followed by reversed-phase HPLC, and found that the nitrosylated iron center complex consists of a segment of 11 amino acids of the α subunit, which contains the highly conserved Cys cluster. Furthermore, we have shown by mass spectrometry, protein sequence, and amino acid composition analyses that a Cys residue in this region is post-translationally oxidized to a cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H). Based on the results, we will discuss the structure of the photoreactive non-heme iron center of the NHase in the inactive form. Dark-inactivated NHase was prepared as described (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For photoactivation, the NHase in the inactive form was irradiated with a photoreflector lamp (500 W SPOT, Toshiba) for 15 min in an ice bath. The α subunit was isolated from the inactive form by anion-exchange chromatography in the presence of 6 m urea in the dark, while the isolation from the active form was carried out under light (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The α subunit isolated from the inactive form reconstituted the NHase with the β subunit. The reconstituted complexes exhibited about 80% of the specific activity of the native NHase after photoactivation. However, the α subunit from the active form did not reconstitute the NHase at all (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The inactive enzyme and the isolated α subunits were stored as suspensions in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C in the dark. The NHase operon of Rhodococcus sp. N-771 has been cloned and sequenced.3 The N-terminal half of the α subunit gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce an NdeI site at the initiation codon. The fragment was digested byNdeI and PstI, whose digest site is located just upstream of the complementary polymerase chain reaction-primer binding site, and subcloned into pET-3c with the remainder of the α subunit gene. Escherichia coli, BL21(DE3), was transfected with the constructed expression vector, pRCMα, and the recombinant α subunit (αrec) was expressed as inclusion bodies. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and disrupted by sonication. After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 20 min), the precipitate was washed with 1 m sucrose and then 2% Triton X-100 and 10 mmEDTA. The washed precipitate was solubilized with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 6 m urea and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol and applied to an anion-exchange Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, 2.5 cm inner diameter × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. αrec was eluted with a 0–500 mmNaCl linear gradient at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. αrecwas estimated to be more than 99% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and stored at 4 °C as a suspension in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate. All manipulations were executed in the dark to avoid photodissociation of NO from the iron center. The α subunit isolated from the inactive NHase was thoroughly desalted using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The α subunit at a final concentration of 2∼2.5 mg/ml in 500 μl was treated with TPCK-trypsin (14 μg) for 3 h at 37 °C. The digest was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC with a Capcell Pak C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Shiseido). Solvent A was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and solvent B was 20% A + 80% acetonitrile. The content of B was increased as follows: 0–2 min, 0%; 2–4 min, 0–20%; 4–24 min, 20–60%; 24–26 min, 60–100%; 26–28 min, 100%. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. For quantification of the iron atom in the peptide, 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, was used as solvent A. To minimize the size of the iron center complex peptide, the tryptic peptide was further digested. The peptide (1.35 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was treated with 1 μg of thermolysin for 1 h at 37 °C, and then with carboxypeptidase Y (1 μg) and leucine aminopeptidase M (1 μg) for 12 h at 37 °C. The α subunit isolated from the active enzyme was cleaved with trypsin without being shielded from light. The digest was separated by reversed-phase HPLC with an Aquapore RP300 column (4.6 × 100 mm, Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Solvent A was 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid containing 80% acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with 100% solvent A and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% solvent B over a period of 16 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The molecular masses of proteins and peptide fragments were determined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). FAB-MS spectra were obtained with a JEOL JMS-HX110 mass spectrometer operated at 10-kV accelerating voltage and a resolution of 1:3000. Ionization was carried out using xenon gas as the primary beam with the energy of 6-keV in the positive mode. Samples were mixed with 0.1% trichloroacetic acid in 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol/thioglycerol/glycerol (1:1:1). MALDI-TOF MS was performed on a Reflex (Bruker) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source. Samples were prepared by mixing 0.5 μl of the 10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution with 0.5 μl of the sample dissolved in 33% acetonitrile, 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid on the target. Positive ion mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode at 28.5-kV accelerating voltage. Mass scale was calibrated using commercially available peptides. An aliquot of the irradiated α subunit (800 μg) was carboxymethylated after reduction, and then treated with trypsin (5 μg). The carboxymethylated NK24 was isolated by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. After removal of acetonitrile in a vacuum centrifuge and adjustment of the pH value to 8.0, the carboxymethylated NK24 was cleaved with thermolysin (1.0 μg) at 37 °C for 6 h, and then analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC with a Superpher 60RP select B column (2.1 × 125 mm, Merck). Solvent A was 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid, and Solvent B was 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid containing 80% acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with 20% solvent B and eluted with a linear gradient from 20 to 55% solvent B over a period of 17.5 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After removal of acetonitrile in a vacuum centrifuge and adjustment of the pH to 8.0, the fraction containing an octapeptide, LP8 (αLeu111 to αPro118), was incubated with leucine aminopeptidase M (0.02 μg) for 6 h at 37 °C. Once dried in a vacuum centrifuge, the digest was dissolved in 5 μl of acetonitrile and incubated with 5 μl of 18 mm(+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate (FLEC) (23Hayashi T. Sasagawa T. Anal. Chem. 1993; 209: 163-168Google Scholar) in acetone for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 100 mm tryptophan in 100 mm borate buffer at pH 9.0. The sample solution was mixed with 10 μl of 9n acetic acid and 40 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and then subjected to reversed-phase HPLC with a PEGASIL ODS-3 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Senshu) equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium acetate (NaOAc) buffer, pH 4.0, NaOAc/acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (77/15/8, v/v). The column was isocratically run with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The concentration of the NHase was estimated by the absorbance of the inactive form at 280 nm (ε280 = 1.7 ml·mg−1·cm−1) (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the isolated subunits were determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye reagent (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using the inactive NHase as a standard. Carboxymethylation was carried out by the method of Crestfield et al. (25Crestfield A.M. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before carboxymethylation, the sample was reduced by incubation in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 10 mm EDTA and the 100-fold excess of dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h. ESR spectra were measured with a JEOL JES FE-3AX X-band ESR spectrometer. Iron atoms were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (VG Elemental, VG PQΩ). N-terminal sequence and amino acid composition were analyzed with a 477A protein sequencer connected on line to a 120A PTH analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and an 835 Amino Acid Analyzer (Hitachi), respectively. TPCK-treated trypsin (type, XIII: from bovine pancreas), carboxypeptidase Y, leucine aminopeptidase M,l-cysteine-sulfinic acid, and dl-cysteic acid were purchased from Sigma, and thermolysin from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). N-Methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD) was a generous gift from Dr. I. Ueno of RIKEN. 3-Nitrobenzyl alcohol, thioglycerol, and glycerol were the products of Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was purchased from Aldrich. All the other reagents used were of the highest biochemical grade available. We first cleaved the α subunit with trypsin in the dark. Even after cleavage, the absorption peak at 370 nm, characteristic of the inactive form, remained and disappeared upon light irradiation (data not shown). The excitation profile of the resonance Raman spectra of the inactive form suggested that this band was due to the transitions with both the iron ← NO and iron ← S charge transfer characters (9Noguchi T. Hoshino M. Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Inoue Y. Endo I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16777-16781Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To obtain the photoresponsive peptide, the digest was separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a column connected to a diode array detector. Since the absorbance at 370 nm readily disappeared both below pH 6 and above pH 9, the pH values of the solvents used in HPLC were controlled at 7.5. The chromatogram at 215 nm showed 13 peaks while that at 370 nm contained only one peak at 20.6 min (Fig.1, A and B). Protein sequence analysis revealed that the 20.6-min peak contained a peptide fragment of 24-amino acids, Asn105-Val-Ile-Val-(Cys)-Ser-Leu-(Cys)-Ser-(Cys)-Thr-Ala-Trp-Pro-Ile-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Pro-Thr-Trp-Tyr-Lys128((Cys) was assumed as a Cys residue based on the nucleotide sequence) (NK24). This region is highly conserved among all known NHases and contains the Cys cluster (Cys109-Ser-Leu-Cys112-Ser-Cys114). When the tryptic digest was irradiated prior to injection, the elution profile monitored at 215 nm was identical to that of the non-irradiated digest except that the 20.6-min peak delayed to 22.4 min (Fig.1 C). Since the amino acid sequences were identical, the shift would be induced by release of NO and/or iron. Fig.2 shows the UV-Vis difference spectrum between the 22.4-min peak of the irradiated digest and the 20.6-min peak of the non-irradiated one. It exhibited two positive peaks at 280 and 370 nm, which is in good agreement with the photo-induced absorptional change of the isolated α subunit (21Tsujimura M. Odaka M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Endo I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Figure 2Light-induced difference UV-Vis absorption spectrum of NK24. The spectra of the 20.6-min peak of the non-irradiated digest (Fig. 1 A) and of the 22.4-min peak of the irradiated one (Fig. 1 C) were obtained with a diode array detector in Hewlett-Packard HP1090M liquid chromatograph. The difference spectrum was obtained by subtracting the latter from the former.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the quantitative measurements of both the iron atom and NO in NK24 isolated from the inactive enzyme. The amount of iron atoms in NK24 was measured to be 0.79 iron/molecule by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. NO molecules associated with NK24 were investigated with the use of a spin trap reagent, [(MGD)2-FeII]. The solution of [(MGD)2-FeII] is ESR silent (Fig.3 A), but exhibits three hyperfine ESR lines characteristic of the nitrogen atom by forming a [(MGD)2-FeII-NO] complex with free NO in the solvent (26Komarov A. Mattson D. Jones M.M. Singh P.K. Lai C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated the light-induced denitrosylation of the inactive NHase using this technique (8Odaka M. Fujii K. Hoshino M. Noguchi T. Tsujimura M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Nagamune T. Inoue Y. Endo I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3785-3791Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The solution of NK24 (20 μm) was also ESR silent (Fig.3 B). However, when [(MGD)2-FeII] was added to the solution in the dark, clear ESR signals of [(MGD)2-FeII-NO] (a N = 1.29 millitesla and g iso = 2.04) were observed (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that this peptide intrinsically possessed NO molecules. Unlike the native NHase in the inactive form, the ESR spectrum appeared without light stimulation. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. However, it is probable that [(MGD)2-FeII] attacks the nitrosyl iron in NK24 because of the absence of other protein moieties. To obtain the minimum peptide segment required for the nitrosylated iron center, we attempted to digest NK24 with amino- and carboxypeptidases in the dark. At first, NK24 (450 pmol) was treated with thermolysin at a molar ratio of 1:10 so that it could be efficiently digested by exopeptidases. Subsequently, carboxypeptidase Y and leucine aminopeptidase M were added at a molar ratio of 1:50, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The digest was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC in pH 7.5 in the dark (Fig.4). A peak at 11.6 min contained a peptide of 11 amino acids from Ile107 to Trp117(IW11) while other peaks contained hydrolyzed amino acids and buffer components. The yield of IW11 was estimated to be 28%. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the 11.6-min peak exhibited the absorption peak at 370 nm (inset of Fig. 4), indicating that the nitrosyl iron was still associated with IW11. When NK24 was irradiated prior to digestion with thermolysin and exopeptidases, the 11.6-min peak completely disappeared (data not shown). Photodissociation of NO might destabilize the iron center, and induce the subsequent proteolysis of the peptide. Fig. 5 shows FAB-MS spectrum of NK24 prepared from the photoactivated NHase (NK24active). The iron atom was dissociated from NK24 by reversed-phase HPLC in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular mass of NK24active was m/z 2693.6, which is 30.3 Da larger than that deduced from the corresponding gene sequence. The molecular mass of the isolated α subunit was also about 30 Da larger than the expected value by electrospray (data not shown). These cannot be attributed to nitrosothiolation of side chains of Cys residues by NO released from the iron center, because NO is quantitatively released into the solvent upon photoactivation (8Odaka M. Fujii K. Hoshino M. Noguchi T. Tsujimura M. Nagashima S. Yohda M. Nagamune T. Inoue Y. Endo I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3785-3791Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the nitrosothiol group is unstable in the acidic solvent used in reversed-phase HPLC for isolation of the peptide. Thus, it was suggested that the NHase have a post-translational modification in this region of the α subunit. Sequence analysis of NK24active indicated that all residues were normal except three Cys residues, which are not stable in automated Edman degradation without alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups. Therefore, it was most probable that one or two Cys residues were modified to cause a mass increase of 30 Da. To identify the modified Cys residue(s), we carboxymethylated the Cys residues after reduction. Cys109 and Cys114 were identified as carboxymethylcysteines, whereas Cys112 remained undetectable. The molecular mass of reduced and carboxymethylated NK24active was determined by MALDI-TOF MS to be 2810.9 (Fig. 6 A), which is 31.6 Da larger than the expected value (the molecular mass calculated from the gene sequence (2663.3) plus that of two carboxymethyl groups (+59 × 2 − H × 2)). Thus, the 112th Cys residue of the α subunit must be specifically modified to cause the mass increase of 32 Da. To rule out the possibility that the modification is an artifact caused during the preparation of NK24, we analyzed the corresponding fragment prepared from the recombinant α subunit (αrec) expressed in E. coli. Like the native α subunit, αrec was purified by anion-exchange chromatography in the presence of 6 m urea. The purified αrec was colorless, indicating the absence of an iron center (data not shown). This αrec was readily cleaved with trypsin and carboxymethylated after reduction. The corresponding fragment was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 6 B). All three Cys residues in the fragment were carboxymethylated and the molecular mass of the fragment was 2837.0 Da, which well coincided with the expected value, 2837.3 Da (the molecular mass calculated from the gene sequence (2663.3) plus that of three carboxymethyl groups (+59 × 3 − H × 3)). Therefore, the modification of the 112th Cys residue seems to be specific to Rhodococcus sp. N-771. Finally, we studied the structure of the modified Cys112. The molecular mass increment of 32 Da can likely be explained by derivatization of the 112th Cys residue by one sulfur atom (Cys-S-SH) or two oxygen atoms (cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H); Fig. 7). Since Cys-S-SH should be carboxymethylated after reduction, it was assumed that Cys112 was modified to Cys-SO2H. We subjected the peptide to amino acid analysis through derivatization with FLEC (23Hayashi T. Sasagawa T. Anal. Chem. 1993; 209: 163-168Google Scholar). Avoiding oxidation during hydrolysis in acidic conditions, NK24active was hydrolyzed enzymatically. We prepared NK24a"
https://openalex.org/W2034404899,"We have previously characterized two murine cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit genes, Cα and Cβ1. Targeted disruption of the Cβ1 promoter revealed two splice variants of the Cβ catalytic subunit gene (designated Cβ2 and Cβ3) that continue to be expressed. These variants arise from unique promoters and are brain-specific. Cβ2 is expressed in several discrete areas in the limbic system. These include the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventral medial hypothalamus, and the amygdala. In the neocortex, expression is highest in cortical areas such as the prefrontal and insular cortex that are associated limbic structures. By contrast, Cβ1 is most highly expressed in the cortex and hippocampus and is also present in all non-neuronal tissues examined. Cβ3 is expressed at very low levels with wide distribution throughout the brain. Both the Cβ2 and Cβ3 variants are enzymatically active and induce gene expression in transient transfections with a cAMP response element-reporter construct. This activity is inhibited by protein kinase A regulatory subunits, the protein kinase inhibitor, and the chemical inhibitor H-89. We also demonstrate that Cβ1 is myristoylated at the amino terminus like the Cα isoform, but neither Cβ2 nor Cβ3 is myristoylated. The discrete expression of Cβ variants in the brain suggests specific functional roles in neuronal signaling.

The inactive PKA holoenzyme exists as a heterotetramer of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. The C subunit family consists of two characterized isoforms (Cα and Cβ) that have been described in murine (1Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine (2Showers M.O. Maurer R.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1987; 167: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) tissues. The Cα isoform is expressed ubiquitously, whereas Cβ, although found in all tissues examined, is most highly expressed in the brain (5Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A third isoform (Cγ) is found only in primates and is expressed from a processed gene in the testis (3Beebe S.J. Oyen O. Sandberg M. Froysa A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The murine genome also contains a processed pseudogene related to Cα, but this pseudogene is not transcribed (6Cummings D.E. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. McKnight G.S. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Although the Cα and Cβ isoforms are 91% identical in amino acid sequence, recent work has revealed distinct biochemical properties that suggest unique functions (7Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cα exhibited a 3–5-fold lowerK m for certain peptide substrates and a 3-fold lower IC50 for inhibition by PKI or RIIα subunits than did Cβ. In addition, holoenzyme containing RIIα and Cβ is 5-fold more sensitive to activation by cAMP and has a higher basal activity in COS-1 cells than does holoenzyme containing Cα.The Cα subunit of PKA was one of the first examples of anN-myristoylprotein to be described (8Carr S.A. Biemann K. Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the case of members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, this modification is necessary for targeting the protein to membranes and for normal function (9Gordon J.I. Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Gokel G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8647-8650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation of Cα does not appear to serve a unique membrane targeting function as the protein is found in many cellular compartments. We have also demonstrated previously that a mutant form of Cα that is not myristoylated has the ability to induce gene expression and modulate steroidogenesis (11Clegg C.H. Ran W. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20140-20146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A targeted disruption of the Cβ gene was created in which the promoter and translational start site were deleted, and mice carrying this mutation lacked the Cβ protein that we had previously characterized (12Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have designated this previously described isoform Cβ1. Mice that lack Cβ1 exhibit a decrease in hippocampal long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. In addition, the Cβ1 mutant mice lack both long-term depression and depotentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. We have also shown that these mice lack long-term potentiation in the mossy fiber-CA3 pathway (13Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. Varshavsky L. Brandon E.P. Qi M. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Bourtchouladze R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1211-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, Northern analysis of tissues from Cβ1 knockout mice showed that the Cβ transcript was eliminated from all tissues of the Cβ1 mutants except the brain, where a unique transcript remained. Western blots of brain regions probed with a Cβ antibody revealed a slightly more rapidly migrating band that remained in the knockout mice.In this paper, we describe two novel splice variants of the murine Cβ gene. These two Cβ variants (designated Cβ2 and Cβ3) diverge from the original Cβ1 sequence at the amino terminus and arise from the use of alternate promoters. Both the Cβ2 and Cβ3 variants are brain-specific and encode functional catalytic subunits that interact with R subunits and PKI. In contrast to the previously studied Cα and Cβ1 proteins, Cβ2 and Cβ3 are not myristoylated at the amino terminus. The Cβ2 transcript is most highly expressed in limbic areas of the brain, whereas Cβ1 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and more diffusely throughout the brain. Expression of Cβ3 is very low and appears to be widely distributed in brain regions.DISCUSSIONWe have characterized two novel variants of the murine Cβ gene of PKA that are specifically expressed in the brain. These variants (designated Cβ2 and Cβ3) arise by the use of alternate first exons with distinct transcriptional start sites.This diversity in the N-terminal exon of PKA genes has been observed in species other than mouse. In Aplysia, a neuronal form of PKA has been shown to have two alternate N termini that can combine with either of two internal cassettes to produce enzymes with different biochemical characteristics (22Cheley S. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10246-10255Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Beushausen S. Lee E. Walker B. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PKA C subunits with extended amino termini have also been described in Drosophila (24Mel'endez A. Li W. Kalderon D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium (25Anjard C. Etchebehere L. Pinaud S. V'eron M. Reymond C.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9532-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding an alternately spliced form of the Cβ subunit has been cloned from bovine heart. This bovine Cβ variant has an alternate first exon that is spliced at the same place as the murine variants (26Wiemann S. Kinzel V. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the murine Cβ splice is in the identical location as in the bovine Cβ variant, our genomic clones were probed with an oligonucleotide made against the bovine sequence. No hybridization of this bovine sequence was seen with our murine genomic clones. However, because our genomic clones do not overlap, the presence of a sequence like the bovine Cβ variant in the intervening space is possible.Analysis of the genomic sequence in the region that contains the alternate first exons of Cβ2 and Cβ3 reveals differences between these splice variants and the other PKA C subunits described previously (1Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine Cα gene and the Cβ1 isoform have multiple sites of transcriptional initiation and a GC-rich 5′-flanking region typical of many constitutively active genes (14Chrivia J.C. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cβ2 and Cβ3 have a single major transcriptional start site and an AT-rich promoter. Also of note is the presence of short upstream open reading frames in the 5′-leaders of Cβ2 and Cβ3. This structure is characteristic of genes that exhibit translational control (27Gabelle A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our in situresults demonstrate cell type-specific control at the transcriptional level, but the presence of these upstream open reading frames suggests possible regulation at a post-transcriptional level as well.Our functional testing reveals that the proteins made from the Cβ2 and Cβ3 sequences are able to activate a cAMP-responsive reporter gene. They are inhibited by R subunits and regain activity upon elevation of cAMP levels. They are also inhibited when PKI is overexpressed or the PKA-selective chemical inhibitor H-89 is present. There have been suggestions in the literature that neural C subunit isoforms might exist that could be resistant to typical PKA inhibitors (21Liu F.C. Takahashi H. McKay R.D. Graybiel A.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 3: 2367-2384Crossref Google Scholar). However, the experiment shown in Fig. 5 D demonstrates the ability of H-89 to effectively block activity from these novel Cβ variants.N-Myristoylation of a protein has an absolute requirement for a glycine residue at the amino terminus. Other substrate specificity parameters have been established and rely on the first six residues of the protein (28Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylation of the Cα subunit has been established (8Carr S.A. Biemann K. Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), but the function in vivo of this post-translational modification remains unclear (11Clegg C.H. Ran W. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20140-20146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of Cβ1 as a myristoylprotein is not unexpected due to sequence similarity to Cα. Cβ2 lacks the glycine residue at the amino terminus and is not myristoylated. Cβ3 has the N-terminal glycine, but does not incorporate myristate. The inability of Cβ3 to act as a substrate for N-myristoyltransferase possibly resides in amino acids 5 and 6 of this protein. The acidic residue at position 5 may be incompatible with negatively charged residues in the enzymatic cleft of N-myristoyltransferase. In addition, the bulky aromatic residue at position 6 is likely a stearic hindrance.We found Cβ2 and Cβ3 mRNAs to be expressed only in the brain. Cβ2 has a high level of expression, approximately equivalent to that of Cβ1 in preparations of whole brain. Cβ3 is expressed at a low level in total brain RNA, and it does not appear to be regionally localized by in situ hybridization. Neither Cβ2 nor Cβ3 mRNA appears to compensate for the loss of Cβ1 mRNA in null mutants. This was assessed both by Northern blots prepared from whole brain and by in situ hybridization experiments on wild-type and Cβ1 mutant brains (data not shown). We also observed no increase in the lower molecular weight Cβ band on Western blots from Cβ1 mutant mice, indicating no compensation at the protein level (12Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 2C. R. Guthrie, B. Skålhegg, and G. S. McKnight, unpublished observations. The differential distribution of Cβ1 and Cβ2 mRNAs in discrete areas of the mouse brain is intriguing. The appearance of prominent expression of Cβ1 in the hippocampus was expected and is consistent with the defects seen in late-phase long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse (12Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Previous work (5Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) has shown that Cα is expressed in these same regions, but is apparently unable to functionally compensate for Cβ1. It is possible that Cα may not be expressed in the proper cells or in the correct subcellular location. Our data reveal only weak expression of Cβ2 in the hippocampus, and clearly, Cβ2 cannot compensate functionally.The neocortex is labeled throughout by the Cβ2 probe, with the prelimbic cortex and insular cortex being particularly intense. This is of interest, as these brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and are rich in D1 receptors that act by elevating cAMP (30Okubo Y. Suhara T. Suzuki K. Kobayashi K. Inoue O. Terasaki O. Someya Y. Sassa T. Sudo Y. Matsushima E. Iyo M. Tatena Y. Toru M. Nature. 1997; 385: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The septal region has strong signals for Cβ2 in the lateral septal nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the more caudal aspect of the forebrain region, we see a strong Cβ2 signal in the ventral medial hypothalamic nucleus. This nucleus has been implicated in alterations in feeding behavior and aggression. The amygdala, like the hypothalamus, is an integrator of input from other limbic structures and is labeled with the Cβ2 probe in the cortical, medial, basal, and basolateral nuclei. We can only speculate as to the function of Cβ2 in these areas. The amygdala and its homologous rostral extension, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, have some of the heaviest innervation by dopaminergic neurons in the brain, where Cβ2 could be activated via D1 dopamine receptor binding. There are numerous interconnections among these regions, and they are believed to be involved in learning and memory, emotion, and more primitive aspects of behavior such as flight from danger or pain avoidance. The functional significance of these variants awaits targeted disruption of Cβ2 and Cβ3 and their effects on neural function and behavior.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylation of the Cα subunit has been established (8Carr S.A. Biemann K. Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6128-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), but the function in vivo of this post-translational modification remains unclear (11Clegg C.H. Ran W. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20140-20146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of Cβ1 as a myristoylprotein is not unexpected due to sequence similarity to Cα. Cβ2 lacks the glycine residue at the amino terminus and is not myristoylated. Cβ3 has the N-terminal glycine, but does not incorporate myristate. The inability of Cβ3 to act as a substrate for N-myristoyltransferase possibly resides in amino acids 5 and 6 of this protein. The acidic residue at position 5 may be incompatible with negatively charged residues in the enzymatic cleft of N-myristoyltransferase. In addition, the bulky aromatic residue at position 6 is likely a stearic hindrance.We found Cβ2 and Cβ3 mRNAs to be expressed only in the brain. Cβ2 has a high level of expression, approximately equivalent to that of Cβ1 in preparations of whole brain. Cβ3 is expressed at a low level in total brain RNA, and it does not appear to be regionally localized by in situ hybridization. Neither Cβ2 nor Cβ3 mRNA appears to compensate for the loss of Cβ1 mRNA in null mutants. This was assessed both by Northern blots prepared from whole brain and by in situ hybridization experiments on wild-type and Cβ1 mutant brains (data not shown). We also observed no increase in the lower molecular weight Cβ band on Western blots from Cβ1 mutant mice, indicating no compensation at the protein level (12Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P.

McKnight, unpublished observations. The differential distribution of Cβ1 and Cβ2 mRNAs in discrete areas of the mouse brain is intriguing. The appearance of prominent expression of Cβ1 in the hippocampus was expected and is consistent with the defects seen in late-phase long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse (12Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Previous work (5Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) has shown that Cα is expressed in these same regions, but is apparently unable to functionally compensate for Cβ1. It is possible that Cα may not be expressed in the proper cells or in the correct subcellular location. Our data reveal only weak expression of Cβ2 in the hippocampus, and clearly, Cβ2 cannot compensate functionally.The neocortex is labeled throughout by the Cβ2 probe, with the prelimbic cortex and insular cortex being particularly intense. This is of interest, as these brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and are rich in D1 receptors that act by elevating cAMP (30Okubo Y. Suhara T. Suzuki K. Kobayashi K. Inoue O. Terasaki O. Someya Y. Sassa T. Sudo Y. Matsushima E. Iyo M. Tatena Y. Toru M. Nature. 1997; 385: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The septal region has strong signals for Cβ2 in the lateral septal nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the more caudal aspect of the forebrain region, we see a strong Cβ2 signal in the ventral medial hypothalamic nucleus. This nucleus has been implicated in alterations in feeding behavior and aggression. The amygdala, like the hypothalamus, is an integrator of input from other limbic structures and is labeled with the Cβ2 probe in the cortical, medial, basal, and basolateral nuclei. We can only speculate as to the function of Cβ2 in these areas. The amygdala and its homologous rostral extension, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, have some of the heaviest innervation by dopaminergic neurons in the brain, where Cβ2 could be activated via D1 dopamine receptor binding. There are numerous interconnections among these regions, and they are believed to be involved in learning and memory, emotion, and more primitive aspects of behavior such as flight from danger or pain avoidance. The functional significance of these variants awaits targeted disruption of Cβ2 and Cβ3 and their effects on neural function and behavior. We have characterized two novel variants of the murine Cβ gene of PKA that are specifically expressed in the brain. These variants (designated Cβ2 and Cβ3) arise by the use of alternate first exons with distinct transcriptional start sites. This diversity in the N-terminal exon of PKA genes has been observed in species other than mouse. In Aplysia, a neuronal form of PKA has been shown to have two alternate N termini that can combine with either of two internal cassettes to produce enzymes with different biochemical characteristics (22Cheley S. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10246-10255Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Beushausen S. Lee E. Walker B. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PKA C subunits with extended amino termini have also been described in Drosophila (24Mel'endez A. Li W. Kalderon D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium (25Anjard C. Etchebehere L. Pinaud S. V'eron M. Reymond C.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9532-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding an alternately spliced form of the Cβ subunit has been cloned from bovine heart. This bovine Cβ variant has an alternate first exon that is spliced at the same place as the murine variants (26Wiemann S. Kinzel V. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the murine Cβ splice is in the identical location as in the bovine Cβ variant, our genomic clones were probed with an oligonucleotide made against the bovine sequence. No hybridization of this bovine sequence was seen with our murine genomic clones. However, because our genomic clones do not overlap, the presence of a sequence like the bovine Cβ variant in the intervening space is possible. Analysis of the genomic sequence in the region that contains the alternate first exons of Cβ2 and Cβ3 reveals differences between these splice variants and the other PKA C subunits described previously (1Uhler M.D. Chrivia J.C. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15360-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The murine Cα gene and the Cβ1 isoform have multiple sites of transcriptional initiation and a GC-rich 5′-flanking region typical of many constitutively active genes (14Chrivia J.C. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cβ2 and Cβ3 have a single major transcriptional start site and an AT-rich promoter. Also of note is the presence of short upstream open reading frames in the 5′-leaders of Cβ2 and Cβ3. This structure is characteristic of genes that exhibit translational control (27Gabelle A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our in situresults demonstrate cell type-specific control at the transcriptional level, but the presence of these upstream open reading frames suggests possible regulation at a post-transcriptional level as well. Our functional testing reveals that the proteins made from the Cβ2 and Cβ3 sequences are able to activate a cAMP-responsive reporter gene. They are inhibited by R subunits and regain activity upon elevation of cAMP levels. They are also inhibited when PKI is overexpressed or the PKA-selective chemical inhibitor H-89 is present. There have been suggestions in the literature that neural C subunit isoforms might exist that could be resistant to typical PKA inhibitors (21Liu F.C. Takahashi H. McKay R.D. Graybiel A.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 3: 2367-2384Crossref Google Scholar). However, the experiment shown in Fig. 5 D demonstrates the ability of H-89 to effectively block activity from these novel Cβ variants.

https://openalex.org/W2026178507,"The major isoform of fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) is initiated from a CUG codon, and the resultant product is distributed to the nucleus/nucleolus and secretory pathway. This dual subcellular localization is achieved in part by the competing effects of two classical intracellular targeting signals located near the amino terminus. At the extreme amino terminus is a short stretch of 29 amino acids before a signal peptide necessary for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, which is next to an adjacent bipartite nuclear localization signal. The carboxyl-terminal region of FGF3 is also implicated in nuclear/nucleolar localization. We describe here the characterization of carboxyl-terminal signals by showing they are capable of directing a heterologous protein, beta-galactosidase, to the nucleus. Furthermore, appending both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains onto beta-galactosidase, reproduces the dual subcellular localization properties of FGF3. Nuclear uptake of FGF3 appears to be signal-mediated since it binds to karyopherin alpha, the nuclear localization signal binding subunit of a heterodimeric receptor of the nuclear import machinery. The import of FGF3 into the nucleus is energy-dependent, and the inhibition of this process has demonstrated the importance of the nucleolar retention signal in nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1978836807,"We reported previously that ∼80-kilobase pair (kb) P1 bacteriophage clones spanning either the human or mouse apoB gene (clones p158 and p649, respectively) confer apoB expression in the liver of transgenic mice, but not in the intestine. We hypothesized that the absence of intestinal expression was due to the fact that these clones lacked a distant DNA element controlling intestinal expression. To test this possibility, transgenic mice were generated with 145- and 207-kb bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that contained the human apoB gene and more extensive 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. RNase protection, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical, and genetic complementation studies revealed that the BAC transgenic mice manifested appropriate apoB gene expression in both the intestine and the liver, indicating that both BACs contained the distant intestinal element. To determine whether the regulatory element was located 5′ or 3′ to the apoB gene, transgenic mice were generated by co-microinjecting embryos with p158 and either the 5′- or 3′-sequences from the 145-kb BAC.

Of note, the basic role of apoB, to serve as the structural protein in the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, is essentially the same in both the liver and the intestine.Even though apoB plays the same functional role in hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes and even though both cell types arise from primitive gut tissue during embryonic development (4Langman J. Medical Embryology. 4th Ed. Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore1981Google Scholar), there is strong evidence to suggest that the genetic control of apoB gene expression in the liver is distinct from that in the intestine. To assess the effect of apoB overexpression on lipid metabolism, we generated human apoB transgenic mice with an 80-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. P1 bacteriophage clone (p158) that spans the entire human apoB gene and contains 19 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 17.5 kb of 3′-flanking sequences (5Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the human apoB transgene was expressed at high levels in the liver, but not at all in the intestine. This pattern of expression was observed in many transgenic lines in our laboratory and was also documented in independent studies by another laboratory (6Callow M.J. Stoltzfus L.J. Lawn R.M. Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, in human apoB transgenic rabbits that we generated with p158, transgene expression was high in the liver, but undetectable in the intestine (7Fan J. McCormick S.P.A. Krauss R.M. Taylor S.

This absence of intestinal expression with the large p158 transgene was unexpected because transient transfection assays in intestinal or liver cell lines using apoB promoter-reporter gene constructs had suggested that as few as 260 bp of the apoB gene promoter were sufficient for apoB expression in the intestine and the liver (8Levy-Wilson B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found the transgenic mouse expression data intriguing simply because the absence of intestinal transgene expression contrasted so sharply with the normal hepatic expression pattern. While transgene expression in the intestine was undetectable even by the most sensitive techniques (i.e. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) (9Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V.

Rubin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2130-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), all indications that this large clone contained all of the sequences required for appropriate gene expression.More recently, we excluded the possibility that the absence of human apoB expression in the intestine resulted from our attempt to express ahuman transgene in another species. A P1 clone spanning themouse apoB gene (including 33 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 11 kb of 3′-flanking sequences) yielded high levels of expression in transgenic mouse liver, but absolutely none in the intestine, as judged by a sensitive transgene-specific RNase protection assay (10McCormick S.P.A. Peterson K.R. Hammer R.E. Clegg C.H. Young S.G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the latter study, the absence of intestinal transgene expression was underscored by mating the transgenic mice with apoB knockout mice. Mouse apoB transgenic mice that were homozygous for a knockout mutation in the endogenous apoB gene expressed the apoB transgene in the liver, but lacked all apoB synthesis in the intestine, leading to a massive accumulation of fat within intestinal enterocytes (10McCormick S.P.A. Peterson K.R. Hammer R.E. Clegg C.H. Young S.G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments, together with the earlier transgenic experiments with p158, suggested that distant DNA sequences, perhaps located >33 kb 5′ or >17.5 kb 3′ to the gene, might be required for the expression of apoB in the intestine. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that appropriate expression of apoB in the intestine is controlled by a distant regulatory element.RESULTSA 207-kb BAC that spanned the coding regions of the human apoB gene and contained 120 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 35 kb of 3′-flanking sequences (BAC(120,35)) (Fig.1) was used to generate human apoB transgenic mice. In one transgenic line, BAC vector sequences on both the far 5′- and 3′-ends of the transgene could be amplified from transgenic mouse tail DNA (Fig. 2). To investigate whether sequences within BAC(120,35) conferred intestinal expression of the apoB gene, RNA was prepared from the liver and duodenum of F1 transgenic mice and analyzed by RNase protection assays. In contrast to transgenic mice generated with the ∼80-kb P1 bacteriophage clone (p158), which manifested transgene expression only in the liver, the BAC(120,35) transgenic mice expressed human apoB in both the liver and the duodenum (Fig.3).Figure 3RNase protection assay illustrating human apoB expression in the liver and duodenum of BAC(120,35) and BAC(70,22) transgenic mice. The RNase protection assay was performed with a 121-bp human apoB riboprobe and revealed that both of the BAC transgenes conferred expression in the liver (5 μg of RNA) and the intestine (5 μg of RNA), whereas the 80-kb P1 clone (p158) yielded expression only in the liver.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To localize further the DNA sequences that direct intestinal expression of apoB, we isolated a BAC that contained 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences and 22 kb of 3′-flanking sequences (BAC(70,22)) (Fig. 1) and used it to generate additional lines of human apoB transgenic mice. A high-expressing line, with ∼13 copies of the human apoB transgene integrated into the mouse genome, was chosen for extensive analysis. Both ends of the BAC(70,22) transgene could be amplified from mouse genomic DNA (Fig. 2). Moreover, Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA that had been digested with NotI and size-fractionated on a pulsed-field agarose gel also indicated that the BAC(70,22) transgene was intact. 2NotI cleaves BAC(70,22) in the vector sequences at the far 3′- and 5′-ends of the transgene and within intron 1 of the apoB gene, generating a 70-kb 5′-fragment and a 66-kb 3′-fragment (Fig. 1). In Southern blot experiments, we used a32P-labeled 1.1-kb HindIII-StuI fragment from the apoB gene promoter region (i.e. 5′ to the intron 1 NotI site) (48Farese Jr., R.V. Flynn L.M. Young S.G. J.

On a chow diet, this transgenic line had human apoB levels of ∼60 mg/dl and high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, as judged by fast-phase liquid chromatography analysis (Fig.4). Furthermore, transgene expression in the liver hepatocytes was uniform, as judged by both in situhybridization and immunohistochemistry (data not shown), indicating that the BAC(70,22) transgene directed fully appropriate apoB expression in the liver without transgene variegation.Figure 4Distribution of cholesterol in the plasma of BAC(70,22) transgenic mice.

This expression pattern was identical to that of the endogenous mouse apoB gene (Fig.5 B). As judged by a quantitative analysis of RNase protection assays with a PhosphorImager, the amounts of human apoB mRNA in the duodenum and the jejunum were 55 and 61% of that in the liver, respectively, whereas the corresponding amounts of endogenous mouse apoB mRNA in the duodenum and the jejunum were 56 and 51% of that in the liver, respectively.Figure 5Expression of the human and mouse apoB genes along the stomach-to-colon axis.

The absence of mouse apoB expression was established by Western blot analysis of mouse plasma with antibodies specific for human or mouse apoB (Fig.7). In control experiments, we generated p158apoB −/− mice, which lacked all apoB expression (mouse or human) in the intestine. The p158apoB −/− mice had growth retardation and manifested a massive accumulation of fat within the villus enterocytes (Fig. 8). In contrast to the p158apoB −/− mice, the BAC(70,22)apoB −/− mice grew normally, and microscopic analysis of the intestines showed normal histology and no evidence of intestinal fat accumulation (Fig. 8). As expected from the results of the in situ hybridization analysis, immunohistochemical staining of intestinal sections of the BAC(70,22)apoB −/− mice revealed expression of human apoB in the villus enterocytes. Mouse apoB expression was undetectable (Fig. 9).Figure 7Western blot of the plasma from a BAC(70,22) transgenic mouse that was homozygous for a knockout mutation in the mouse apoB gene (BAC(70,22)apoB −/−) using mouse and human apoB-specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Oil red O-stained duodenal sections from human apoB transgenic mice that were homozygous for a knockout mutation in the mouse apoB gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9ApoB expression in the intestines of mice that express human apoB, but not mouse apoB.

To address this issue, we subcloned the two NotI fragments from BAC(70,22) (Figs. 1and 10 A) into a P1 bacteriophage vector. P1–70 contained 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences; P1–66 contained 22 kb of 3′-flanking sequences. Additional lines of transgenic mice were generated by co-microinjecting fertilized mouse eggs with p158 and either P1–70 or P1–66. Transgenic lines generated by co-microinjecting p158 with P1–70 expressed the human apoB gene at high levels in both the liver and the intestine (Fig. 10 B). Southern blot analysis indicated that both DNA fragments had integrated into the mouse genome (Fig. 10 C). In contrast to these results, human apoB transgenic mice generated by co-microinjecting p158 and P1–66 lacked apoB gene expression in the intestine (Fig.11).Figure 10DNA sequences 5′ to the apoB gene direct intestinal expression in transgenic mice.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24149-24160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of these experiments suggested that 260 bp of upstream sequences were sufficient to direct the expression of the apoB gene in both the liver and the intestine. The conclusion that proximal promoter sequences might control expression in both tissues seemed plausible. The physiologic role of apoB is essentially the same in both tissues, and there are convincing precedents that proximal promoter sequences are sufficient to direct both liver and intestinal gene expression. 3For example, an analysis of the promoter for the liver fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl) in transgenic mice (28Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that as few as 153 bp of proximal promoter sequences were sufficient to confer expression in both the liver and the intestine. More recently, however, transgenic mouse expression studies with P1 bacteriophage clones have strongly suggested the possibility of a very different scenario for apoB: that the DNA sequence elements governing apoB gene expression in the intestine and the liver might be entirely distinct, with intestinal expression requiring a distant enhancer element, perhaps located >33 kb from the transcription initiation site of the apoB gene (3Young S.G.

In this study, we put that hypothesis to the test by generating human apoB transgenic mice from BACs containing more extensive 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. The initial set of experiments demonstrated that a 207-kb BAC directed apoB expression in both the liver and the intestine, and subsequent experiments revealed that a much smaller (145-kb) BAC was sufficient for intestinal apoB gene expression.To further localize the DNA sequences that direct intestinal expression of apoB, we co-microinjected p158 (which alone does not confer intestinal apoB expression) with DNA fragments containing either the 5′- or 3′-portion of BAC(70,22). When two DNA fragments are co-microinjected into mouse embryos, they typically integrate into the same site within the genome and co-segregate in subsequent breeding experiments (26Hammer R.E. Maika S.D. Richardson J.A. Tang J.-P. Taurog J.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 1099-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). We chose the co-microinjection strategy because it had been used previously to examine a distant enhancer element for the immunoglobulin λ gene; co-microinjection of a cosmid containing the immunoglobulin λ gene coding region and a cosmid harboring a distant 3′-enhancer element yielded high-level, tissue-specific expression of the λ transgene in B lymphocytes of transgenic mice (27Eccles S. Sarner N. Vidal M. Cox A. Grosveld F. New Biol. 1990; 2: 801-811PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, we found that transgenic mice generated by co-microinjection of p158 and P1–70 (containing 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences) manifested robust human apoB expression in the intestine. When considered in combination with our previous P1 bacteriophage experiments, the current studies indicate that intestinal expression of the apoB gene requires a distant DNA sequence element located between 33 and 70 kb 5′ to the apoB gene (Fig.12).Figure 12Summary of apoB gene expression patterns in transgenic mice generated with large genomic clones. Shown is the expression of apoB in the livers and intestines of transgenic mice generated with ∼80-kb P1 clones and 207- and 145-kb BAC clones and co-microinjection of two different P1 clones (p158 plus either P1–70 or P1–66).

Moreover, the DNA sequences responsible for different spatial patterns of gene expression in the intestine can be entirely distinct and can involve both positive and negative elements. For example, Simonet al. (28Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Remarkably, a reporter gene construct containing the entire 4 kb of upstream sequences directed inappropriate expression of the transgene in enterocytes of the colon, implying that additional sequence elements are important for the correct pattern of Fabpl gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2025054819,"Abstract Amplification and overexpression of theHER-2/neu proto-oncogene frequently coincide with an aggressive clinical course of certain human adenocarcinomas. To assess whether HER-2/neu plays a rate-limiting role in ovarian cancer, we used human SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells as a model. We applied a conditional mRNA depletion strategy of HER-2/neu with anti-HER-2/neu-targeted hammerhead ribozymes expressed under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter system. In these ovarian cancer cells, we reduced HER-2/neu mRNA, protein expression, and tumor growth in nude mice by transfection with HER-2/neu-targeted ribozymes and generated cell lines expressing different levels of HER-2/neu. Expression of the most effective ribozyme (Rz3) quenched HER-2/neu mRNA levels by >90%. Concomitantly, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that expression of the HER-2/neu-encoded surface glycoprotein was almost completely abrogated. In nude mice, tumor growth was dramatically inhibited in the HER-2/neu-depleted Rz3-expressing SK-OV-3 cells. Furthermore, already established tumors started to regress when Rz3 expression was activated midstream by withdrawal of the tetracycline treatment. This study supports the thesis that HER-2/neu can be rate-limiting for the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer in a gene dose-dependent manner."

Removal of the hydroxyl group of Ser-9 by site-directed mutagenesis raises the pK a of bound GSH to about 7.6, and a very low turnover number (about 0.5% of that of wild type) is observed.

Despite this heterogeneity, the overall polypeptide fold is very similar among the crystal structures so far obtained (6Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and all GSTs are highly selective for the GSH molecule. An important conserved residue between classes is a tyrosine near the N-terminal region (Tyr-6 in rat GST M1–1 (11Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Tyr-7 in human GST P1–1 (12Kong K.-H. Takasu K. Inoue H. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)) that has been proposed to activate the bound GSH by stabilizing its thiolate form. The blowfly Lucilia cuprina infests Australian sheep flocks, and the GST isoenzyme purified from this species (14Board P.G. Russel R.J. Marano R.J. Oakeshott J.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) is possibly involved in the mechanism of insecticide resistance. TheLucilia GST has been classified as a Theta class GST on the basis of its primary structure, but the crystal structure shows the equivalent tyrosine residue within the N-terminal region (Tyr-5) to be 13.9 Å away from the thiol group of GSH (15Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, other residues could replace Tyr-5 and be involved in the activation of GSH. From the crystal structure, Ser-9 is found to be within hydrogen bond distance of the sulfur atom of GSH (3.9 Å), and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-113 may also form a hydrogen bond with the GSH sulfur atom through a water molecule. This tyrosine residue is not conserved in all of the Theta class isoenzymes, and it is absent in the human Alpha class GST. Data so far obtained on L. cuprina GST show that Tyr-113 is not significantly involved in catalysis (16Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an equivalent tyrosine residue plays an important catalytic role in the Mu class GST. X-ray diffraction of GST M1–1 in complex with a transition state analogue shows ς-complex stabilization by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-6 and Tyr-115 (17Ji X. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12949-12954Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); moreover, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-115 is involved both in chemical and physical steps of catalysis, and its removal has different effects, depending on which of these steps is rate-limiting (18Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the GST P1–1, the equivalent Tyr-108 shows a multifunctional role in catalysis (19Lo Bello M. Oakley A.J. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Nuccetelli M. Mazzarese G. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ricci G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6207-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the hydroxyl function of Tyr-108 stabilizes the transition state for the Michael addition of GSH to ethacrynic acid, whereas it has a negative influence when 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazole is used as cosubstrate. Mutation of Tyr-108 in Phe yields a 7-fold increase of the turnover number, and the additional link between Tyr-108 and the cosubstrate may increase the internal friction of the protein lowering the k cat (20Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antonini G. Parker M.W. Oakley A.J. Chiessi E. Nuccetelli M. Battistoni A. Bellizia A. Ricci G. J. Biol.

With regard to Ser-9, this residue is conserved in all Theta class isoenzymes, and its mutation to Ala strongly lowers the activity of Lucilia GST (16Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The role in catalysis of the equivalent Ser-11 in human Theta GSTT2–2 has been recently studied (21Tan K.L. Chelvanayagam G. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); in that case, the contribution of serine varies with the nature of the second substrate. The aim of this paper is to investigate the catalytic mechanism of theLucilia GST and the possible role of Ser-9 and Tyr-113 as suggested by the Lucilia GST crystal structure. L. cuprina GST wild type, Y113F, and S9A mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as reported by Board et al. (14Board P.G. Russel R.J. Marano R.J. Oakeshott J.G. Biochem.

With regard to the S9A mutant, the enzyme was partially purified on a DE52 ion exchange column, since this mutant loses its activity almost completely after the GSH affinity column. GSH, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) were purchased from Sigma. Glycerol was a BDH product.

Kinetic experiments were carried out in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing variable amounts of substrates and 0.2–0.8 μg of enzyme, except for the S9A mutant, where about 40 μg of enzyme was utilized. The reaction rates were measured at 0.1-s intervals for a total period of 12 s. Initial rates were determined by linear regression and corrected for the spontaneous reaction.S 0.5CDNB was obtained at fixed GSH (10 mm) and variable CDNB concentrations (from 20 μm to 2 mm). S0.5GSH was obtained at fixed CDNB (1 mm) and variable GSH concentrations (from 10 μm to 20 mm). Data of v versus[S] were fitted to Equation 1, v=Vmax/(1+K/[S]nH)Equation 1 and the best fit gave V max,S 0.5 (S 0.5 =K 1/n H), and Hill coefficient (n H) for each substrate. The protein concentration was obtained from the protein absorbance at 280 nm assuming an ε1 mg/ml of 1.41 for Theta wild type and 1.36 for the Y113F mutant; extinction coefficients were calculated on the basis of the amino acid sequence as reported by Gill et al. (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5083) Google Scholar). For the S9A mutant, the absorbance at 280 nm of the enzyme partially purified on a DE52 ion exchange column was corrected for the relative amount of the S9A mutant derived from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. A molecular mass of 23.9 kDa per GST subunit was used in the calculations. The pH dependence ofk cat/ S0.5CDNBwas obtained as reported above by recording the enzymatic reaction in the following buffers (0.1 m): sodium acetate buffer between pH 4.5 and pH 5.5 and potassium phosphate buffer between pH 6.0 and pH 8.7. Control studies showed that the affinity of the enzyme toward GSH does not change in the pH range utilized. The pH dependence of the GS− bound to LuciliaGST was obtained by difference spectroscopy. In a typical experiment, 0.5 mm GSH was added to 12 μm GST active sites in 1 ml of 0.1 m suitable buffer. The amount of thiolate formed at each pH was monitored with the peak-to-trough amplitude between 240 and 300 nm (ε240 nm = 5,000m−1 cm−1) after subtraction of the spectral contributions of free enzyme and of free GSH (in a serum bovine albumin solution showing an absorbance at 240 nm similar to that of GST sample). pK a values were obtained from kinetic and spectroscopic experiments by fitting the data to Equation 2. y=ylim/(1+10pKa−pH)Equation 2 Binding of GSH to LuciliaGST was studied by difference spectroscopy by following the amount of GS− formed in the active site. In a typical experiment, GSH (ranging from 5 μm up to 4 mm) was added to 1 ml containing 25 μm GST active sites in 0.1m potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The amount of GS− bound was monitored with the peak-to-trough amplitude between 245 and 300 nm (ε245 nm = 3,800m−1 cm−1) after subtraction of the spectral contributions of free enzyme and of free GSH (in a serum bovine albumin solution showing an absorbance at 245 nm similar to that of GST sample). The 245-nm wavelength was selected to minimize the absorbance of the high amount of free GSH utilized. Data were fitted to Equation 1, where v and V max were substituted by GS− bound and total GST active sites, respectively. The second order kinetic constants at pH 6.5 for the spontaneous reaction of GSH with CDNB and FDNB and the turnover numbers at pH 6.5 forLucilia GST with CDNB and FDNB as cosubstrates were obtained as previously reported (24Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Battistoni A. Mazzetti P. Ricci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1428-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were obtained at 25 °C by using 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing variable glycerol concentrations as already described (25Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics kinetic spectrometer stopped-flow instrument equipped with a temperature-regulated observation chamber with a 1-cm light path and 1-ms dead time. In a typical experiment,Lucilia GST (22 μm), in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing GSH (20 mm), was mixed with CDNB (2 mm) dissolved in the same buffer. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm and at different temperatures (between 2.2 and 25 °C). The time course of the product (P) formation was fitted to Equation 3, [P]=[E0](k1/(k1+k2))2−[E0](k1/(k1+k2))2exp(−(k1+k2)t) +[E0](k1/(k1+k2))k2tEquation 3 which gives the pseudo-first order rate constant for the formation of the enzyme-bound product (k 1) and the first order rate constant for the release of product from the active site (k 2) (26Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 121-154Google Scholar). A well documented property of GSTs is the ability to lower the pK a of the sulfhydryl group of the bound GSH. The acidity constant of GSH in the active site ranges between 6.0 and 6.5 for the Alpha (27Bjornestedt R. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Board P.G. Sinning I. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have a crucial role in stabilization of the thiolate form of GSH. Whether Lucilia GST activates the bound GSH in a manner that is similar to the other GST isoenzymes is still an open question. The crystal structure of Theta GST from L. cuprina blowfly (15Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) shows the equivalent tyrosine, near the N terminus (Tyr-5), is 13.9 Å away from the thiol group of bound GSH but suggests that two active site residues, either Ser-9 or Tyr-113, may replace Tyr-5 in the GSH activation. Direct evidence for the forced deprotonation of GSH in the active site of Lucilia GST comes from spectroscopic experiments. The differential spectrum of the binary complex GST·GSH, obtained under nonsaturating GSH concentration and at pH 7.0 (Fig.1, inset), shows an absorption band centered at 240 nm that is typical of a thiolate anion. The absorbance value suggests that more than 50% of the bound GSH is deprotonated at neutral pH values. The pH dependence of the thiolate band shows a pK a of 6.6 for the bound GSH (Fig. 1, Table I). The pH dependence ofk cat/ S0.5CDNB, which should reflect a kinetically relevant ionization of the GST·GSH complex, gives an apparent pK a value of 6.5 (Fig.2 and Table I). These spectroscopic and kinetic experiments provide the first evidence that a Theta-like isoenzyme lowers the pK a of the sulfhydryl group of the bound GSH as occurs in other GST classes despite replacement of the essential tyrosine residue in the latter with a serine residue in the former (11Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kong K.-H. Takasu K. Inoue H. Takahashi K. Biochem.

To check the influence of the proximal Tyr-113 residue, difference spectroscopy experiments were performed on the Y113F mutant. As shown in Fig. 1, the GSH thiolate band is still present, and the pH dependence of the mercaptide absorption band at 240 nm indicates a pK a value of about 6.5, very close to that found with the wild type enzyme (Table I). Again, the pH dependence ofk cat/ S0.5CDNBparallels the spectroscopic data showing a pK a value of 6.3 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Thus, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-113 does not seem to play a role in the forced deprotonation of the bound GSH. Ser-9 seems to be involved; the S9A mutant has been only partially purified, and direct spectroscopic evidence for the ionization of the bound GSH cannot be obtained. However, the pH dependence ofk cat/ S0.5CDNBidentifies an apparent pK a of 7.6, about 1 pH unit higher than that found for the wild type (Fig. 2, inset, and Table I).Table IpH dependence of kinetic and spectroscopic parametersKinetic parametersSpectroscopic parameterspK ak cat/S 0.5limpK a[GS−]/[GST]lims −1 m −1Wild type6.48 ± 0.14(5.3 ± 0.5) × 1056.60 ± 0.110.82 ± 0.07Y113F6.33 ± 0.15(15.3 ± 1.1) × 1056.55 ± 0.080.84 ± 0.05S9A7.57 ± 0.03(17.2 ± 0.3) × 103k cat/S 0.5lim represents the limiting value of the specificity constant at high pH values; [GS−]/[GST]lim represents the limiting value of the relative amount of GSH thiolate at high pH values.

Steady state kinetics of Lucilia GST do not strictly obey the Michaelis-Menten equation. When the concentration of GSH or CDNB is varied, at fixed cosubstrate concentrations, double reciprocal plots are concave down versus GSH and concave up versusCDNB (Fig. 3). This behavior may be a signal that the enzyme follows a steady state kinetic mechanism where a preferred pathway for the ternary complex exists (29Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 460-461Google Scholar) or, alternatively, may be due to a cooperative binding of the substrates to the enzyme as already reported for the Cys-47 mutants of GST P1–1 (30Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1243-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To discriminate between these possibilities, the isothermic binding of GSH was studied. Binding of GSH to other GST classes has been easily measured by following the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of the enzyme (31Caccuri A.M. Aceto A. Rosato N. Di Ilio C. Piemonte F. Federici G. Ital. J. Biochem. 1991; 40: 304-311PubMed Google Scholar), but the intrinsic fluorescence of theLucilia GST is not perturbed by the addition of GSH up to a 20 mm concentration. The isothermic binding curve of GSH has been obtained by measuring the amount of GSH thiolate that is formed at the active site as function of the substrate concentration. At pH 6.5, a KDGSH of 107 μm and a Hill coefficient of about 0.90 have been calculated (Table II), indicating a nearly Michaelian behavior. Similar nonhyperbolic kinetics but noncooperative binding of substrates to the enzyme have been already described for the rat GSTs M1–1, M1–2, and A3–3 (32Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Sikakana C.N.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Jakobson I. Warholm M. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7085-7089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and explained by a steady state random sequential Bi Bi mechanism. The dissociation constant (K D ) of GSH, obtained from binding experiments, is almost 5 times lower than theS 0.5 value derived from kinetic experiments; this discrepancy may be explained by a negative effect of CDNB on GSH binding, as already observed in GST P1–1 (34Ivanetich K.M. Goold R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or may be the consequence of a steady state random mechanism in whichS 0.5 does not correspond toK D . Table II contains kinetic and thermodynamic data obtained with Lucilia GST wild type and Y113F and S9A mutants; both mutants show S 0.5 values toward GSH and CDNB and Hill coefficients comparable with that of wild type. On the other hand, the Y113F turnover number is about 3 times higher than that of the wild type, while the S9A mutant shows an extremely low specific activity (about 0.5% of that of wild type).Table IIKinetic and thermodynamic parameters at pH 6.5k catk cat/S 0.5S 0.5CDNBn H 2-an H obtained at constant GSH and variable CDNB concentrations.S 0.5GSHn H 2-bn H obtained at constant CDNB and variable GSH concentrations.K D GSHn H 2-cn H obtained from GSH binding experiments.s −1s −1 m −1μmμmμmWild type53 ± 1(3.2 ± 0.2) × 105165 ± 81.24 ± 0.03530 ± 410.72 ± 0.02107 ± 110.90 ± 0.02Y113F144 ± 2(7.8 ± 0.5) × 105185 ± 101.17 ± 0.01320 ± 200.83 ± 0.02S9A0.28 ± 0.02(1.3 ± 0.1) × 103208 ± 301.10 ± 0.01540 ± 710.74 ± 0.02Kinetic and binding parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” S 0.5 represents the substrate concentration that yields half of the V maxvalue.2-a n H obtained at constant GSH and variable CDNB concentrations.2-b n H obtained at constant CDNB and variable GSH concentrations.2-c n H obtained from GSH binding experiments.

It is well known that the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions proceed via a ς-complex intermediate (35Miller J. Eaborn C. Chapman N.B. Reaction Mechanisms in Organic Chemistry. 8. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1968: 137-179Google Scholar). Substitution of chlorine by the more electronegative fluorine in the CDNB molecule increases about 50-fold the second order rate constant of the spontaneous reaction with GSH, suggesting that the ς-complex formation is rate-limiting (4Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by Lucilia GST is insensitive to the nature of the leaving group; the kcatFDNB to kcatCDNB ratio ranges between 1.0 and 1.6 for wild type and Y113F and S9A mutants. Therefore, a physical step rather than a chemical step may be rate-limiting in this enzymatic reaction as previously observed in human GST P1–1 (24Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Battistoni A. Mazzetti P. Ricci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1428-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in rat GST M1–1 (18Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of viscosity on kinetic parameters has been mainly utilized to study the rate-determining step of very efficient enzymes in which the encounter of substrates with the protein is rate-limiting (k cat/K m = 107 to 108 s−1m−1). A decrease of the pseudo-second order rate constant (k cat/K m ) by increasing the medium viscosity should reflect the weight of diffusive events on catalysis (36Blacklow S.C. Raines R.T. Lim W.A. Zamore P.D. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The reactions catalyzed by Lucilia GST, wild type, and mutants are characterized byk cat/S 0.5 values ≤ 8 × 105 s−1m−1, so this enzyme is far from being a “perfect” catalyst. In this case, the effect of a viscosogen onk cat should indicate that the rate-limiting step of reaction is related to the product release (18Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to diffusion-controlled structural transitions of the protein (25Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This may occur for Lucilia GST; in fact, a plot of the reciprocal of the relative catalytic constant kcato/k catagainst the relative viscosity (η/ηo) gives a linear dependence with a slope of about 1.0 for Lucilia GST wild type (Fig. 4), 0.9 for Y113F, and 0.8 for S9A mutants. Diffusion-controlled motions of the protein were already reported to modulate the catalysis of other GST isoenzymes, and different physical events were hypothesized to influence the reaction rate: a conformational change of the ternary complex in the human GST P1–1 (25Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Rosato N. Mei G. Nicotra M. Chiessi E. Mazzetti A.P. Federici G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16187-16192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the product release in the rat GST M1–1 (18Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-steady state kinetics ofLucilia GST were studied by stopped-flow experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, the early stage of catalysis displays a well defined burst phase at 340 nm, which indicates that the product accumulates before the steady state attainment. The burst phase is more evident when the temperature is lowered from 25 to 2.2 °C. At 2.2 °C and saturating substrate concentrations, a burst is observed even in the more active Y113F mutant (Fig. 5 C). Enzyme concentrations, calculated on the basis of the burst amplitude (π) (9.9 and 9.5 μm for the Y113F mutant and wild type, respectively), are close to the protein concentration used in these experiments (11 μm). The reaction catalyzed by the Lucilia GST may be roughly subdivided into two steps: the formation of the enzyme-bound GSH conjugate, governed by the pseudo-first order rate constant (k 1), which summarizes all steps from the substrate binding to the product formation, and the release of product from the active site governed by the first order rate constant (k 2), shown in Scheme I. E+GSH+CDNB→k1EP→k2E+PScheme I The rate constants k 1 andk 2 obtained from pre-steady state kinetics performed at different temperatures are reported in TableIII. The free energy levels of the catalytic steps related to the rate constants k 1and k 2 may be estimated by their temperature dependence. The Arrhenius plot gives activation energy values of about 54 and 104 kJ/mol for k 1 andk 2, respectively (Fig.6), indicating that two very different energy barriers are involved. Temperature dependence ofk cat gives an activation energy value of about 96 kJ/mol, confirming that the release of product is rate-limiting. The rate constant k 2 is much more sensitive to the temperature than k 1, so the gap between the two rate constants becomes smaller as the temperature increases. Pre-steady state data suggest that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-113, which resides in α-helix 4 (15Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), affects negatively both rate constantsk 1 and k 2; at 2.2 °C, the Y113F mutant shows a k 1 value of about 325 s−1 and a k 2 of about 18 s−1, while at the same temperature, the wild type shows ak 1 value of about 67 s−1 and ak 2 of about 5 s−1. This may be the consequence of additional interactions involving the hydroxyl group of Tyr-113, which will be discussed below.Table IIITemperature dependence of kinetic parametersTemperatureWild typeY113Fk 1k 2k 1k 2°Cs −1s −1s −1s −12.2675325185.61221415.22934824.7415172The values of the rate constants k 1 andk 2 (see Scheme I) at different temperatures were calculated from the best fit of experimental data according to Equation3.

Kinetic and binding experiments show, for the first time in a Theta GST, that the isoenzyme purified from the sheep blowfly L. cuprina is able to lower the pK a of bound GSH about 3 pH units despite the absence, in the G-site, of the crucial tyrosine found in the Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs (11Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kong K.-H. Takasu K. Inoue H. Takahashi K. Biochem.

The role played by the hydroxyl group of Ser-9 and also of Tyr-113, two residues possibly involved in the GSH activation, has been examined. Removal of the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-113 and of Ser-9 does not affect the affinity toward both GSH and CDNB. Moreover, the pK a of the E·GSH complex is unchanged in the Y113F mutant, while it shifts from 6.5 to about 7.6 in the S9A mutant, a value still lower than the pK a (9.0) of the GSH in aqueous solution. Another contributor to the lower than expected pK a might be the influence of a helix dipole, since the sulfur atom of GSH lies directly above the N terminus of α-helix 1 (15Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the other hand, removal of the hydroxyl group of Ser-9, hydrogen-bonded to the thiol group of GSH, results in a very low turnover number (about 0.5% of that of wild type). Similarly, replacement of Tyr-6 with phenylalanine in the rat GST M1–1 (11Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a very low turnover number and the pH dependence ofk cat/ KmCDNBfor the E·GSH complex gave a pK a value of 7.8. Zheng and Ornstein (37Zheng Y.-J. Ornstein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1523-1528Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), by using ab initiomolecular orbital calculations, found a pK a value of 7.8 for the bound GSH when the active site tyrosine was replaced by phenylalanine. These results confirm that Ser-9, in L. cuprina GST, is equivalent to the conserved tyrosine residues in the G-site of other GST classes. Like Tyr-6, in the rat GST M1–1, Ser-9 may contribute to the stabilization of the GSH thiolate; however, on the basis of the pK a value of 7.6 in the S9A mutant, a k cat 6-fold lower than that of wild type is expected at pH 6.5, while a 200-fold decrease ofk cat is actually observed. The dramatic lowering of k cat observed in the absence of Ser-9 can be explained neither on the basis of an increased pK a of the bound GSH nor by a different thermal stability between S9A and wild type (data not shown); thus, Ser-9 seems to be mainly implicated in the correct orientation of the sulfhydryl group of GSH in the catalytic step or in the transition state stabilization. In the last few years, a great effort has been made to clarify whether the crucial tyrosine residue acts as a general base proton acceptor or as a hydrogen bond donor in the GSH activation mechanism; in the former, a relevant amount of tyrosinate is required. The functional equivalence between serine and tyrosine suggests that the tyrosinate ion idea may not be physiologically important. In fact, in the LuciliaGST the ionization of the key hydroxyl residue Ser-9 is not possible, and this ionization may be also not be required for the equivalent tyrosine residue in other GST classes. Recently, a consensus pattern for Theta class GSTs based on Lucilia GST structure has been derived and utilized to identify key residues in the polypeptide fold (38Rossjohn J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Wilce M.C.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); in this study the serine (or sometimes threonine) residue near the N terminus is found in virtually all Theta class GSTs, so the present findings are probably applicable to varying degrees to all of the family members."

Although it is clear that SOCs are activated by depletion of internal Ca2+stores, the mechanism for this process is not well understood. Previously, we have reported that inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity block the bradykinin- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ entry in fibroblasts, suggesting that a tyrosine kinase activity may be involved in relaying the message from the empty internal Ca2+ stores to the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel (Lee, K.-M., Toscas, K., and Villereal, M. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9945–9948). We also have demonstrated that bradykinin activates the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-src (Lee, K.-M., and Villereal, M. L. (1996) Am. J. Physiol. 270, C1430–C1437). We investigated whether c-src plays a role in the regulation of SOCs by monitoring capacitative Ca2+ entry in 3T3-like embryonic fibroblast lines derived from either wild type orsrc −/src −(Src−) transgenic mice. We report that Ca2+entry, following store depletion by either bradykinin or thapsigargin, is dramatically lower in Src− fibroblasts than in wild type fibroblasts. The level of capacitative Ca2+ entry in Src− cells is restored to nearly normal levels by transfecting Src− cells with chicken c-src. These data suggest that c-src may play a major role in the regulation of SOCs.

These data suggest that c-src may play a major role in the regulation of SOCs. Most cultured fibroblasts respond to the peptide hormone bradykinin with a biphasic elevation of intracellular Ca2+concentration. The initial peak of the Ca2+ response is due to Ca2+ release from inositol trisphosphate-sensitive stores, whereas the longer duration, plateau phase is due to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the BK-stimulated 1The abbreviations used are: BK, bradykinin; SOC, store-operated channels; wt, wild type; Src−, fibroblasts from c-src knock-out mice; TG, thapsigargin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HHBSS, HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution. Ca2+ influx is via a “capacitative” Ca2+pathway (1Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) similar to the one first described in pancreatic acinar cells by Putney (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of capacitative Ca2+ entry is suggested by the resulting primary immunodeficiency associated with defective T cell proliferation in patients whose lymphocytes have low capacitative Ca2+ entry following T cell receptor stimulation (3Partiseti M. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Fischer A. Korn H. Choquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32327-32335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Partiseti M. Thomas C. Buc H.A. Oleastro M. Belohradsky B. Choquet D. Fischer A. Blood. 1995; 85: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putney hypothesized that the mechanism for opening this type of Ca2+ channel involves a signal transduction process in which the “fill state” of the internal Ca2+ stores is sensed and a message is sent to open plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, if the stores are empty. Subsequent studies from a number of different laboratories have supported the basic concepts of this hypothesis, although the exact mechanism for regulation of these capacitative Ca2+channels, or store-operated channels (SOCs), is still an area of active investigation. Based upon previous results from our laboratory, we have proposed that a tyrosine kinase activity is involved in relaying the message from the empty internal Ca2+ stores to the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel (5Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on our observations that inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity (such as genistein and tyrphostin) block the plateau phase of the BK-induced Ca2+ response, whereas an inactive analog of genistein (diadzein) or inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases have no effect (5Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase activity appears to lie downstream from the empty Ca2+ pool because tyrosine kinase inhibitors also block the Ca2+ entry stimulated by thapsigargin (5Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an agent that directly empties the Ca2+ pools by inhibiting the Ca2+-ATPase that pumps Ca2+ into the internal stores. To investigate the identity of the tyrosine kinase involved in regulating SOCs, we first had to identify the tyrosine kinases activated in response to BK stimulation. We recently reported (6Lee K.-M. Villereal M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1430-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that in fibroblasts BK stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of pp60c- src (c-src). With this information in hand, we turned to the investigation of whether this tyrosine kinase is involved in the regulation of SOCs. To test for the involvement of c-src in the regulation of SOCs, we chose to utilize fibroblast lines that do not express the c-src protein tyrosine kinase as a result of gene disruption by homologous recombination (7Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of SOCs by c-src, the intracellular Ca2+ stores of either wt cells or Src− cells were emptied by various methods in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer, and the influx of Ca2+ was monitored following addition of Ca2+to the external medium. The absence of c-src produced a significant decrease in the Ca2+ influx in response to both bradykinin and thapsigargin. This could be reversed by expression of c-src in Src− cells. The wt andsrc −/src −(Src−) cell lines were derived by the spontaneous immortalization of mouse embryo fibroblasts prepared from either wild type mice or mice homozygous for a disruption in the c-srcgene. These nonclonal cell populations were kindly provided by Philippe Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). The chicken c-src plasmid was kindly provided by David Shalloway (8Lin P.-H. Shenoy S. Galitski T. Shalloway D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 401-405PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid carrying hygromycin resistance was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Avian-specific monoclonal anti-c-srcantibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-c-src antibodies (mAb 327) were obtained from Oncogene Sciences (Uniondale, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein assay kits and ECL reagents were obtained from Pierce. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. For measurements of intracellular calcium concentration, cells were plated onto coverslips 2–5 days prior to experiments. For Western blotting, the cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes. Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with 0.5% SDS/8 m urea. The lysates were freeze-thawed three times to reduce viscosity. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). The protein samples were mixed with equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (1 × = 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.001% pyronin-Y, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membranes in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml were added, and the blot was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBS/0.2% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 40 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The blot was washed five times, and the immunostaining was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were loaded with 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (HHBSS) + 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin + 0.025% Pluronic F127 detergent for 30 min at room temperature and incubated without fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in HHBSS for 30 min, and the intracellular [Ca2+] was monitored as described previously (1Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All traces represent the average response of 300–400 cells on a nearly confluent coverslip. Although data shown here are from nearly confluent coverslips, measurements on lower density coverslips showed that there was no density dependence of the results. Cells perfused in “nominally” Ca2+-free HHBSS prepared as described previously (1Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are still tightly adherent and can be vigorously perfused for extended time periods. Fibroblasts deficient in c-src were cotransfected with chicken c-src and a plasmid carrying hygromycin resistance (pCEN4). After 2 days, cells were cultured in the presence of 250 μg/ml hygromycin for 24 h. The selection pressure was removed, and cells were cultured in normal medium. A week later cells were reselected with 150 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 days. Approximately 200 clones survived. All of the surviving clones were harvested, mixed together, and expanded to generate a heterogenous population of cells expressing chicken c-src. Cells were periodically put under selection pressure. For the initial studies, cells were challenged with 100 nm BK in a nominally Ca2+-free external medium. The Ca2+ peak under these conditions (Fig. 1) is due to the emptying of inositol trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores (1Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the height of initial peaks in individual experiments generally is due to the fact that some fibroblasts in the field had delayed response to BK, thereby producing a wider, lower peak Ca2+ response. Analysis of multiple coverslips (n = 12) indicates that the areas under the initial BK-stimulated peaks were not significantly different in Src− and wt fibroblasts, indicating that the amounts of Ca2+ mobilized in the two cell lines were approximately equal. This suggests that the loss of c-src does not disrupt the signaling between the BK receptor and the Ca2+stores. When the release of internal Ca2+ stores was complete and the [Ca2+] i returned to base line, Ca2+ was added externally in the continuous presence of BK. Under these conditions the observed rise in [Ca2+] i is due to capacitative Ca2+influx; the initial slope of this Ca2+ rise was used as a measure of Ca2+ influx. As observed in Fig. 1, a dramatic Ca2+ influx was observed in BK-stimulated wild type cells. In cells that were incubated with Ca2+-free medium without BK, the influx of Ca2+ initiated by Ca2+addition was only 5% of that observed in the presence of BK (data not shown). In contrast to results in wt cells, BK induced a significantly lower capacitative Ca2+ entry in fibroblasts deficient in c-src, as judged by the initial slope of the Ca2+ trace (28 ± 10% of the slope observed in wt cells, n = 12; this value was significantly different from the wt value based on a t test, p < 0.0001). Similar experiments utilizing Ba2+ to monitor capacitative Ca2+ entry also showed dramatic differences between wt and Src− cells (data not shown). Because Ba2+ is not pumped by Ca2+-ATPases, the reduced Ca2+ entry observed in Src− cells is not due to an increased Ca2+ pump activity but is the result of decreased capacitative Ca2+ influx. This observation suggests that c-src may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ entry in response to BK. Although we have demonstrated that BK-induced Ca2+ entry is significantly suppressed in Src− fibroblasts, there does appear to be capacitative Ca2+ entry in Src−cells. This residual Ca2+ influx may be due to either regulation by other tyrosine kinases or to regulation by a tyrosine kinase-independent mechanism. It has been shown that other c-src tyrosine kinase family members (e.g.c-fyn and c-yes) have some overlapping activities with c-src, which suggests the possibility that c-fyn or c-yes could also participate in the regulation of SOCs. This possibility is supported by experiments using genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that further suppressed the residual capacitative Ca2+ entry in Src− cells (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that c-src might regulate events in the BK signaling pathway that lie upstream of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, we have also examined capacitative Ca2+ influx in Src−cells stimulated with thapsigargin (TG), a potent Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor (Fig.2). Following TG-induced Ca2+store depletion, Ca2+ influx was initiated by the addition of Ca2+ to the external media. Analysis of multiple wt and Src− coverslips (n = 7) indicates that the total amount of Ca2+ mobilized by thapsigargin is not statistically different in Src− and wt fibroblasts. As was the case for BK, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx is significantly lower in fibroblasts deficient in c-src than that measured in wt fibroblasts (30 ± 15% of the slope observed in wt cells, n = 7; value significantly different from wt value based on a t test, p < 0.005), suggesting that the effect of c-src in the regulation of SOCs is downstream from the depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores. The fact that Ca2+ entry is lower in Src− fibroblasts in response to both BK and TG could mean either that c-src is involved in regulation of Ca2+ entry following store depletion or that the level of Ca2+ entry was coincidentally lower in the independently derived Src− cell lines. To distinguish between these possibilities, we established Src− fibroblasts stably expressing chicken c-src, thus eliminating the possibility that the independently derived Src− and wt cells are different because they fortuitously express different levels of regulatory proteins or SOCs. To express c-src in Src−fibroblasts, we chose chicken c-src, because thissrc protein was shown to have little or no transforming activity when overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, compared with v-src and mouse c-src (8Lin P.-H. Shenoy S. Galitski T. Shalloway D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 401-405PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shalloway D. Coussens P.M. Yaciuk P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1985; 5: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We did not want to transform the cells, because transformation very often results in the overexpression or hyperphosphorylation of proteins involved in important signaling processes. The expression of c-src in Src− fibroblasts posed some technical difficulties because these cells are difficult to transfect transiently. Therefore, we generated a population of cells that stably expresses the protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The expression of chicken c-src was detected by immunostaining and also by Western blotting using the avian specific anti-c-src antibodies (Fig. 3). Western blots performed with mAb 327 demonstrated a 3–4-fold higher level of staining in the c-src transfected cells compared with wt cells (data not shown), although without knowing the relative specificity of mAb 327 for chicken versus mouse c-src, it is not clear whether this represents a 3–4-fold difference in protein expression. When capacitative Ca2+ entry was monitored following Ca2+ pool depletion with BK, it was observed that stable expression of chicken c-src significantly enhanced the capacitative Ca2+ influx (Fig.4). The expression of chicken c-src resulted in a 2.8 ± 0.2-fold increase (n = 7) in the initial slopes of the Ca2+traces at the addition of external Ca2+ (value is significantly higher than Src− value based on at test, p < 0.001). In addition, when intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by treating cells with thapsigargin (1 μm), the capacitative Ca2+ influx was greatly enhanced in the cells expressing chicken c-src (2.7 ± 0.6-fold increase,n = 9; value is significantly higher than Src− value based on a t test, p< 0.01) (Fig. 5). Although the initial BK-stimulated release of Ca2+ was frequently higher in the cells transfected with chicken c-src than in the Src− cells, this does not explain the higher Ca2+ influx in the transfected cells. First, although measurements of the initial peak in chicken c-srctransfected cells varied widely in height between individual coverslips, there was no correlation between first peak height and size of Ca2+ influx. Second, the TG-stimulated peaks frequently had the opposite relationship (although this was not the case in Fig.5, the first peak height was often higher in Src−fibroblasts than in the cells transfected with chicken c-src), and Ca2+ fluxes were still higher than in Src− cells. Therefore, these observations strongly support our proposal that c-src is indeed involved in the regulation of calcium entry via store-operated calcium channels.Figure 5TG-stimulated Ca2+ entry in Src − fibroblasts and fibroblasts stably expressing chicken c-src. Src−fibroblasts (A) and Src− fibroblasts expressing the chicken c-src (B) were perfused with HHBSS and Ca2+-free HHBSS as indicated. Cells were treated with thapsigargin (1 μm) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. After [Ca2+] i returned to base line, the Ca2+ influx was initiated by the addition of 1.8 mm Ca2+ to the extracellular solution. The traces represent the average responses of 300–400 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The BK-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry in c-src transfected cells was 78 ± 11% of the signal observed in the wild type cells. In the case of TG-induced Ca2+ entry we observed 82 ± 18% restoration. Immunostaining of hygromycin-selected cells showed that we could detect strong expression of avian c-src in 25% of the cells, intermediate expression in 30% of the cells, and little or no chicken c-src staining in 45% of the cells (data not shown). Thus, because of the selection method used, not all of the cells in this heterogenous population express chicken c-src. Cells were selected based on their expression of an antibiotic resistance gene marker; thus some percentage of cells express the antibiotic resistance gene and no c-src or low levels of c-src. Even though these data support the hypothesis that c-src may play an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ entry via store-operated calcium channels, we cannot exclude the possibility that c-src might be acting via a longer term mechanism, such as by controlling the level of expression of SOCs. However, our previous data (5Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that tyrosine kinase inhibitors reduce capacitative Ca2+ influx within a matter of minutes of their addition, a finding that supports the involvement of tyrosine kinases in a short term, regulatory role. However, based on the observation that the SH2 and SH3 domains but not the kinase activity of c-src are important for the effect of c-src on the rate of cell spreading on fibronectin (12Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out the possibility that the c-src effect we observe might be independent of thesrc kinase domain. In the future, we plan to express c-src constructs with mutations in the kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains in Src− cells to determine in more detail the importance of these domains in the regulation of Ca2+entry. Although the exact mechanism for c-src regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry is not known, it appears that the decrease in Ca2+ entry in Src− cells is not the result of a reduction in the membrane potential and therefore a decrease in the driving force for Ca2+ entry. Hyperpolarization of Src− and wild type cells, by the addition of valinomycin in a 6 mm K+ medium, did not alter the fact that wild type cells had a dramatically higher level of Ca2+ entry than those measured in Src− cells (data not shown). There is considerable evidence that protein phosphorylation can regulate ion channels. Ion channels are known to be regulated and directly phosphorylated by a number of serine/threonine kinases, such as protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent kinase, and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (13Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Some recent studies suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation can also regulate channel activities. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the channel activities of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (14Yu X.-M. Askalan R. Keil II, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), a brain- and heart-specific delayed rectifier-type potassium channel (15Huang X.-Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G.

A recently cloned focal adhesion kinase family member, PYK2, directly tyrosine phosphorylates a potassium channel (Kv1.2) and inhibits currents elicited by phorbol myristyl acetate (17Lev S.

In regard to the regulation of SOCs, several studies suggest that serine and threonine phosphorylation may inhibit capacitative Ca2+ entry (18Parekh A.B. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further studies are required to determine whether the effect of c-src on the regulation of capacitative Ca2+entry is a direct effect on the store-operated Ca2+channel, as seen for hKv1.5 andN-methyl-d-aspartate channels, or an indirect effect via other c-src substrates.

Polymerization has been described as a two-step process: the formation of double-stranded protofibrils and the subsequent lateral aggregation of protofibrils into fibers. Previous studies have shown that γ chain residues Tyr-363 and Asp-364 have a significant role in polymerization, most likely in protofibril formation. To better define the role of these residues, we synthesized three fibrinogens with single substitutions at these two positions: Tyr-363 → Ala, Asp-364 → Ala, and Asp-364 → His. We found that the release of fibrinopeptides A and B was the same for these variants and normal recombinant fibrinogen, showing that all variants had normal fibrin formation. In contrast, we found that polymerization was significantly delayed for both Ala variants and was almost nonexistent for the His variant. Clottability for the Ala variants was only slightly reduced, and fibrin gels were formed. Surprisingly, clottability of the His variant was substantially reduced, and fibrin gels were not formed. Our data suggest that both protofibril formation and lateral aggregation were altered by these substitutions, indicating that the C-terminal domain of the γ chain has a role in both polymerization steps.

Fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein composed of a pair of three polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ. The six N termini form a central domain, called E, which can be isolated as a single fragment from a plasmin digest of fibrinogen. The six chains divide into two three-chain sets that emanate in opposite directions from the central E domain as coiled-coil rods that terminate with the C-terminal residues of each chain forming separate domains. The peripheral domains can also be isolated from plasmin digests as the D fragments, which contain residues from all three chains but consist primarily of the C-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains.During blood coagulation, fibrinogen is converted to an insoluble fibrin clot by the serine protease thrombin, which cleaves four peptide bonds, releasing two fibrinopeptides A (FpA, Aα 1–16) and two fibrinopeptides B (FpB, Bβ 1–14) and fibrin monomers that polymerize spontaneously. The association of fibrin monomers into a fibrin clot has long been described as a two-step process, where the first step involves half-staggered, end-to-end interactions leading to double-stranded protofibrils and the second step, usually called lateral aggregation, involves the assembly of protofibrils into thick, multi-stranded fibers that branch to form a fibrin network. The final product is a fibrin gel (1Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interactions that promote protofibril formation occur between N-terminal α chain residues in the E domain on one fibrin molecule and C-terminal γ chain residues in the D domain on a second fibrin molecule. The interactions that promote lateral aggregation are less well known, although it has been shown that FpB cleavage enhances lateral aggregation (1Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Gorkun O. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The enhanced lateral aggregation may, however, be an indirect result of strengthened protofibril interactions that accompany FpB release (4Shainoff J.R. Dardik B.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the C-terminal domains of the α chain (the αC domains) participate in lateral aggregation and that calcium binding to fibrinogen increases during lateral aggregation (5Okada M.

Res. 1990; 57: 183-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Recent experiments have identified two specific residues in the D domain of the γ chain as participants in protofibril formation. Tyr-363 in the γ chain was identified by photoaffinity labeling with a peptide that mimics the N-terminal α chain residues of the E domain of fibrin (12Yamazumi K. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2893-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Asp-364 in the γ chain was identified in fibrinogen Matsumoto I (13Okumura N. Furihata K. Terasawa F. Nakagoshi R. Ueno I. Katsuyama T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a dysfibrinogen that was found in a heterozygous individual. Fibrinogen Matsumoto I is a mixture of molecules with normal and variant γ chains that have His at position 364. Polymerization of fibrinogen Matsumoto I is markedly delayed, and this delay can be partially compensated by mixing with normal fibrinogen (13Okumura N. Furihata K. Terasawa F. Nakagoshi R. Ueno I. Katsuyama T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the normal molecules of this fibrinogen support polymerization, whereas the variant molecules do not.In the studies described, here we examined the roles of these two residues by analysis of genetically engineered variants. Using the previously described two-step procedure for synthesis of variant fibrinogens, we synthesized three variants with single amino acid substitutions in the γ chain: Tyr-363 → Ala (Y363A), Asp-364 → Ala (D364A), and Asp-364 → His (D364H). We determined the clottability of these variants and followed the kinetics of thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide release and thrombin-catalyzed polymerization. We compared the variants to one another and to normal recombinant fibrinogen, which has polymerization characteristics comparable to normal plasma fibrinogen (14Gorkun O.V. Veklich Yu.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe data presented here confirmed that the C-terminal γ chain residues 363 and 364 are important participants in polymerization. We found that Ala substitutions at either position 363 or 364 dramatically delayed polymerization. We measured turbidity, which with normal fibrin polymerization gauges the rate of protofibril formation from the lag period, and the rate of fiber formation from the slope of the turbidity change. With both Ala substitutions, the lag periods were lengthened and the slopes were less steep. The 363 Ala substitution was the most normal, and even with this mutant the shortest lag period and the most rapid increase in turbidity were about 3-fold delayed relative to normal fibrinogen under the most favorable conditions. These results suggest that both protofibril formation and fiber formation were affected by the single Ala substitutions. Alternatively, the Ala substitutions may change only one of the polymerization steps and still alter both the lag period and the slope. This possibility has been carefully described by Weisel and Nagaswami (9Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), who showed with simulated data that changing the rate of protofibril formation or the rate of lateral aggregation can change both the lag and the slope of a turbidity curve. For example, if the rate of protofibril formation is slowed, then the lag period is lengthened, and the slope of the turbidity increase is decreased. Similarly, if the rate of fiber formation is slowed, then normal protofibrils form in the normal time frame, but the lateral aggregation of these protofibrils is less efficient, which is seen as both a longer lag period and a reduced slope. Thus, further studies using assays that distinguish these two steps are needed to determine whether one or both steps of polymerization is impaired in these Ala variants. Even though polymerization was delayed with both of the Ala variants, the clottability data and clot appearance, which was similar to the normal clot, indicate that large, insoluble polymers were finally assembled from these molecules.The turbidity curves obtained with the Asp-364 to His substitution were more remarkable. We were able to measure changes in turbidity only at 0.45 mg/ml fibrinogen. At lower fibrinogen concentrations (0.09 mg/ml), where normal polymerization is complete within a few hours, polymers with D364H were not detected even after days of incubation. A delay in D364H fibrin polymerization was predicted from studies with fibrinogen Matsumoto I, which contains normal and variant γ chains, but the striking loss of function found with the homogeneous recombinant variant was unanticipated. The clottability data showed that normal polymers were not formed; no fibrin gel was seen and only half the protein was incorporated into precipitated material. This result was observed even though fibrinopeptide release indicated normal fibrin formation. Analysis of the nonclottable protein suggests that the soluble fibrin molecules were degraded, probably by prolonged exposure to thrombin. Thrombin cleavage of the C-terminal region of α chains has been previously reported (25Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This extensive proteolysis most likely occurred because the fibrin monomers were not readily incorporated into fibrin polymers, but the proteolysis may subsequently have contributed to the lowered clottability.The normal kinetics for FpB release from these three variants, which show delayed polymerization, was unanticipated. It is generally accepted that the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin proceeds in an ordered fashion such that FpA is released, desA-fibrin polymers are formed, and FpB is released from these polymers (7Mihalyi E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 976-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the kinetics of thrombin-catalyzed FpB release depend on polymerization, such that FpB release is delayed when fibrin polymerization is limited. For example, both EDTA and the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro inhibit polymerization, and both decrease the rate of FpB release from normal fibrinogen (21Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ruf W. Bender A. Lane D.A. Preissner K.T. Selmayr E. Muller-Berghaus G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Lewis S.D. Shields P.P. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10192-10199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, two abnormal fibrinogen variants, London I and Ashford, show impaired polymerization of fibrin monomers and exhibit a decreased rate of FpB release. Thus, the normal kinetics for FpB release from the variants studied here (Table I) indicate that an intermolecular structure, either the normal D:E structure found in protofibrils or something that mimics the function of the protofibril structure, was formed at a normal rate. This result is surprising because the residues γ363 and γ364 are thought to support D:E interactions, such that a significant change at these residues would be reflected in the rate of protofibril formation. Our results showed that changes at residues γ363 and γ364 did in fact significantly alter polymerization, so we anticipated a change in D:E interactions and the consequential change in FpB kinetics. The observed normal release of FpB therefore implies that intermolecular structures are formed at a normal rate. Of course, our data are also consistent with the conclusion that these intermolecular structures are not necessary for normal FpB kinetics, but this would be contrary to previous reports.Our results are similar to those seen with several dysfibrinogens with known changes in the C-terminal domain of the γ chain, impaired polymerization associated with normal rate of FpB release (28Ebert R.F. Index of Variant Human Fibrinogens 1994 Edition. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar). The kinetics of FpB release from these dysfibrinogens must be considered with caution, however, as these variants, like Matsumoto I, were identified in individuals with heterozygous genotypes. Kinetic analysis of a mixture of normal and variant proteins is ambiguous, especially at concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin that are higher than those used to obtain the data in Table I. Nevertheless, the reports on these dysfibrinogens lend support to the possibility that changes in the C-terminal domain of the γ chain impair polymerization but do not prevent intermolecular interactions needed to support normal FpB release.Recently, high resolution structures have been published for the isolated 30-kDa C-terminal fragment of the human fibrinogen γ chain alone and in a complex with the peptide GPRP (29Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 30Pratt K. Cote H. Chung D. Stenkamp R. Davie E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7176-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As microcalorimetry data show that the C-terminal domain of the γ chain is folded independently (31Litvinovich S.V. Henschen A.H. Krieglstein K.G. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 605-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that this isolated fragment, which was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, preserves the structure it has in the fibrinogen molecule. These structures, therefore, allows us to speculate on the molecular basis for the functional changes we have observed. A deep pocket, called the polymerization pocket, is defined by four loops, P-1 through P-4. Tyr-363 and Asp-364 lie within loop P-3. As shown in Fig.4, the side chain for Tyr-363 faces into the pocket such that it can participate in D:E interactions. Thus, exchanging the large, aromatic, hydrogen bond-forming side chain of Tyr for the methyl group of Ala is likely to eliminate significant aspects of this intermolecular interaction and thereby abate polymerization. It is reasonable to assume that multiple D-domain residues participate in the D:E interactions, such that Tyr-363 is not the only critical residue. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, polymerization with the Y363A variant is abated but not eliminated, and fibrin clots do form. Nevertheless, the extensive delay in polymerization of Y363A demonstrates that this single residue has a consequential role in fibrin clot formation.As shown in Fig. 4, Asp-364 is oriented such that it forms a salt bridge with Arg-375 in loop P4. This electrostatic interaction could anchor the relative orientation of loops P-3 and P-4. As both loops contribute residues that line the polymerization pocket, it is reasonable to expect that changes in the orientation of these loops would alter polymerization. A critical role for Arg-375 is supported by the observation of abnormal fibrin polymerization with the substitution of Gly for Arg-375 in the heterozygous dysfibrinogen Osaka V. Furthermore, the structure obtained in the presence of GPRP showed that Asp-364 forms a salt bridge with the N terminus of the GPRP. Thus, Asp-364 likely participates in two ways: forming an intermolecular salt bridge that is critical to fibrinogen structure and supporting the intermolecular D:E interactions that are critical to fibrin polymerization. Therefore, the substitution of Ala for Asp would be expected to significantly delay polymerization. Our data are also consistent with the recent report by Cote et al. (32Cote H. Pratt K. Chung D. Davie E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 757Google Scholar) who synthesized and characterized the 30-kDa recombinant fragment with the D364A substitution. They found that the peptide GPRP did not bind to this variant and that this variant fragment was unable to inhibit polymerization of normal fibrin.Interpretation of the results from the substitution of His for Asp-364 is more difficult, because the changes in function were so dramatic. In contrast to the two Ala substitutions, this mutant did not form a fibrin gel under the conditions described here. After long incubations with thrombin, turbidity increases were apparent, but these were not associated with fibrin clot formation. Both the lag period and the rate of turbidity change with this mutant were 10-fold or more longer than that observed with the substitution of Ala at this position. Obviously, the size and potential charge of the histidine side chain differ significantly from alanine, and these characteristics likely contribute to the extreme loss of function, but the rationale for the extensive differences is unclear. The data suggest that the overall structure of the polymerization pocket is changed by this substitution such that no reasonable polymerization site is present. That is, the presence of histidine not only disrupts the salt bridge with Arg-375 but also disrupts the overall conformations of loops P-3 and P-4, with the consequent loss of the polymerization pocket. This conclusion that large structural changes accompany the histidine substitution is supported by our finding that a high Ca2+ concentration was required for binding to the conformation-sensitive IF-1 antibody used for immunopurification of D364H fibrinogen.We interpret our data as indicating that the C-terminal γ chain domain participates in both protofibril formation and fiber formation. Many previous experiments show that protofibrils form when the N terminus of the α chain of one fibrin molecule (exposed after FpA is cleaved from fibrinogen) binds in the polymerization pocket in the C-terminal γ chain domain of a second fibrin molecule. Our data are consistent with this conclusion. In addition, our data indicate that changing the polymerization pocket also changes lateral aggregation. This would be the case if the first interactions, between the polymerization pocket and the N terminus of the α chain, induced a conformational change such that the C-terminal domain of the γ chain takes on a role in the lateral aggregation of protofibrils. This conclusion emanates from a comparison of the data with the two 364 variants. Because the Ala variant was able to form a continuous fibrin gel and the His variant was not, we conclude that sites for both protofibril formation and lateral aggregation are missing in the His variant. As stated above, our results with the Ala variants are also consistent with the conclusion that both protofibril formation and fiber formation are altered by these substitutions. We have initiated experiments that are designed to test whether these single-amino acid substitutions alter more than one step in fibrin clot formation. Fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein composed of a pair of three polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ. The six N termini form a central domain, called E, which can be isolated as a single fragment from a plasmin digest of fibrinogen. The six chains divide into two three-chain sets that emanate in opposite directions from the central E domain as coiled-coil rods that terminate with the C-terminal residues of each chain forming separate domains. The peripheral domains can also be isolated from plasmin digests as the D fragments, which contain residues from all three chains but consist primarily of the C-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains. During blood coagulation, fibrinogen is converted to an insoluble fibrin clot by the serine protease thrombin, which cleaves four peptide bonds, releasing two fibrinopeptides A (FpA, Aα 1–16) and two fibrinopeptides B (FpB, Bβ 1–14) and fibrin monomers that polymerize spontaneously. The association of fibrin monomers into a fibrin clot has long been described as a two-step process, where the first step involves half-staggered, end-to-end interactions leading to double-stranded protofibrils and the second step, usually called lateral aggregation, involves the assembly of protofibrils into thick, multi-stranded fibers that branch to form a fibrin network. The final product is a fibrin gel (1Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The interactions that promote protofibril formation occur between N-terminal α chain residues in the E domain on one fibrin molecule and C-terminal γ chain residues in the D domain on a second fibrin molecule. The interactions that promote lateral aggregation are less well known, although it has been shown that FpB cleavage enhances lateral aggregation (1Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

The enhanced lateral aggregation may, however, be an indirect result of strengthened protofibril interactions that accompany FpB release (4Shainoff J.R. Dardik B.N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the C-terminal domains of the α chain (the αC domains) participate in lateral aggregation and that calcium binding to fibrinogen increases during lateral aggregation (5Okada M.

Recent experiments have identified two specific residues in the D domain of the γ chain as participants in protofibril formation. Tyr-363 in the γ chain was identified by photoaffinity labeling with a peptide that mimics the N-terminal α chain residues of the E domain of fibrin (12Yamazumi K. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2893-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Asp-364 in the γ chain was identified in fibrinogen Matsumoto I (13Okumura N. Furihata K. Terasawa F. Nakagoshi R. Ueno I. Katsuyama T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a dysfibrinogen that was found in a heterozygous individual. Fibrinogen Matsumoto I is a mixture of molecules with normal and variant γ chains that have His at position 364. Polymerization of fibrinogen Matsumoto I is markedly delayed, and this delay can be partially compensated by mixing with normal fibrinogen (13Okumura N. Furihata K. Terasawa F. Nakagoshi R. Ueno I. Katsuyama T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the normal molecules of this fibrinogen support polymerization, whereas the variant molecules do not. In the studies described, here we examined the roles of these two residues by analysis of genetically engineered variants. Using the previously described two-step procedure for synthesis of variant fibrinogens, we synthesized three variants with single amino acid substitutions in the γ chain: Tyr-363 → Ala (Y363A), Asp-364 → Ala (D364A), and Asp-364 → His (D364H). We determined the clottability of these variants and followed the kinetics of thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide release and thrombin-catalyzed polymerization. We compared the variants to one another and to normal recombinant fibrinogen, which has polymerization characteristics comparable to normal plasma fibrinogen (14Gorkun O.V. Veklich Yu.I. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe data presented here confirmed that the C-terminal γ chain residues 363 and 364 are important participants in polymerization. We found that Ala substitutions at either position 363 or 364 dramatically delayed polymerization. We measured turbidity, which with normal fibrin polymerization gauges the rate of protofibril formation from the lag period, and the rate of fiber formation from the slope of the turbidity change. With both Ala substitutions, the lag periods were lengthened and the slopes were less steep. The 363 Ala substitution was the most normal, and even with this mutant the shortest lag period and the most rapid increase in turbidity were about 3-fold delayed relative to normal fibrinogen under the most favorable conditions. These results suggest that both protofibril formation and fiber formation were affected by the single Ala substitutions. Alternatively, the Ala substitutions may change only one of the polymerization steps and still alter both the lag period and the slope. This possibility has been carefully described by Weisel and Nagaswami (9Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), who showed with simulated data that changing the rate of protofibril formation or the rate of lateral aggregation can change both the lag and the slope of a turbidity curve. For example, if the rate of protofibril formation is slowed, then the lag period is lengthened, and the slope of the turbidity increase is decreased. Similarly, if the rate of fiber formation is slowed, then normal protofibrils form in the normal time frame, but the lateral aggregation of these protofibrils is less efficient, which is seen as both a longer lag period and a reduced slope. Thus, further studies using assays that distinguish these two steps are needed to determine whether one or both steps of polymerization is impaired in these Ala variants. Even though polymerization was delayed with both of the Ala variants, the clottability data and clot appearance, which was similar to the normal clot, indicate that large, insoluble polymers were finally assembled from these molecules.The turbidity curves obtained with the Asp-364 to His substitution were more remarkable. We were able to measure changes in turbidity only at 0.45 mg/ml fibrinogen. At lower fibrinogen concentrations (0.09 mg/ml), where normal polymerization is complete within a few hours, polymers with D364H were not detected even after days of incubation. A delay in D364H fibrin polymerization was predicted from studies with fibrinogen Matsumoto I, which contains normal and variant γ chains, but the striking loss of function found with the homogeneous recombinant variant was unanticipated. The clottability data showed that normal polymers were not formed; no fibrin gel was seen and only half the protein was incorporated into precipitated material. This result was observed even though fibrinopeptide release indicated normal fibrin formation. Analysis of the nonclottable protein suggests that the soluble fibrin molecules were degraded, probably by prolonged exposure to thrombin. Thrombin cleavage of the C-terminal region of α chains has been previously reported (25Yoshida N. Wada H. Morita K. Hirata H. Matsuda M. Yamazumi K. Asakura S. Shirakawa S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1958-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This extensive proteolysis most likely occurred because the fibrin monomers were not readily incorporated into fibrin polymers, but the"

Insulin treatment barely changed the low levels of glycogen synthesis measured in fibroblasts. Following differentiation into adipocytes, insulin increased glycogen synthesis up to 40-fold. After further culturing of the adipocytes for a week, insulin stimulated glycogen accumulation 700-fold. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells also resulted in the increased expression of glycogen synthase and in increases in both total glycogen synthase activity and -fold stimulation by insulin. While the levels of PP1 protein were unchanged by differentiation, PP1 specific activity decreased over 60%, although sensitivity to insulin treatment was augmented. Concurrently, levels of the PP1 inhibitor protein DARPP-32 were dramatically induced upon 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. DARPP-32 in both 3T3-L1 and primary rat adipocytes was exclusively localized to the particulate fractions, including the glycogen-enriched pellet. PP1 activity from 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibited a kinetic lag in vitro, which was not present in fibroblast extracts. Insulin pretreatment of the adipocyte cells overcame thein vitro lag in PP1 activity, resulting in up to 5-fold stimulation of PP1 activity being measured at early assay time points. These results suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, DARPP-32 may maintain glycogen-targeted PP1 activity in a low basal state, priming the phosphatase for stimulation by insulin.

Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). As the major anabolic hormone regulating glucose utilization and storage, insulin exerts many of its effects by promoting the net dephosphorylation of enzymes such as glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase, resulting in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Several lines of evidence indicate that these insulin-stimulated dephosphorylations are catalyzed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; GM, glycogen-binding regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; GL, hepatic glycogen-targeting subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; PTG, protein targeting to glycogen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PNS, postnuclear supernatant. 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; GM, glycogen-binding regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; GL, hepatic glycogen-targeting subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; PTG, protein targeting to glycogen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PNS, postnuclear supernatant.

First, by localizing PP1 to subcellular compartments, such as glycogen, targeting proteins serve to increase PP1 specific activity against co-localized substrates. The two glycogen-targeting subunits, GM and GL, have also been reported to differentially regulate PP1 activity toward the same glycogen-bound substrates (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GM has been proposed to directly regulate PP1 activity in response to both anabolic and catabolic signals (12Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P.

To add to the uncertainty, the two putative regulatory phosphorylation sites of GM are not conserved in PTG or GL, and both proteins are poorly phosphorylated in vitro (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since it is unlikely that PTG is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), other models for the stimulation of glycogen-targeted PP1 need to be explored.PP1 activity is also regulated by inhibitor (Inh) proteins (reviewed in Ref. 19Shenolikar S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are three inhibitors of PP1 activity, Inh-1, its neuronal homologue DARPP-32, and Inh-2. Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue on Inh-1 and DARPP-32, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, converts these molecules into highly potent, reversible, and very specific inhibitors of PP1 activity. Dephosphorylation of these proteins results in their inactivation and disassociation from PP1. Inh-2 is also regulated by phosphorylation, but it acts more as a regulatory subunit. The direct regulation of glycogen-targeted PP1 by these inhibitors has not been extensively investigated.We have investigated the regulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Differentiation of these cells from fibroblasts into adipocytes results in a large increase in both total metabolic activity and insulin responsiveness. To evaluate the regulation of the components directly involved in glycogen synthesis, we examined the effects of insulin treatment on glycogen synthase and glycogen-targeted PP1 activity during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. The results suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the inhibitor peptide DARPP-32 may regulate glycogen-associated PP1 activity and may be a target of insulin signaling to increase glycogen synthesis.DISCUSSIONInsulin action is characterized by the paradoxical regulation of serine/threonine phosphorylation (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of protein kinase cascades play a crucial role in the mitogenic effects of this hormone. However, regulation of glucose- and lipid-metabolizing enzymes by insulin occurs largely through dephosphorylation of these proteins. Although inactivation of upstream kinases may be involved (27Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the key enzymes that regulate glycogen synthesis, namely glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase, are all excellent substrates for PP1. Further, PP1 has been shown to be specifically activated by insulin, suggesting an important role for this phosphatase in insulin action. Although PP1 is present in nearly all cellular compartments, only a specific, limited number of phosphoproteins are dephosphorylated in response to insulin (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). This paradox raises two important questions: how is PP1 targeted to the relevant substrates, and how are specific pools of PP1 preferentially activated by insulin?We have utilized the 3T3-L1 cell line to investigate the regulation of glycogen metabolism by insulin. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are poorly responsive to insulin; however, differentiation of these cells into lipid-containing adipocytes results in a dramatic increase in insulin-mediated glucose utilization and storage. The levels of many proteins are increased during adipogenesis, including key mediators of insulin signaling, such as the insulin receptor (22Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Glut-4 (23Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the hormonal regulation of glycogen synthesis during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In fibroblasts, insulin only caused a 3-fold increase in glucose accumulation as glycogen; in the fully differentiated day 8 adipocytes, insulin treatment resulted in a 700-fold increase in glycogen synthesis. Correspondingly, the protein and activity levels of glycogen synthase were dramatically increased upon adipogenesis, as was the stimulation of synthase activity in response to insulin. In contrast, the specific activity of PP1 decreased by over 60% during differentiation, with no corresponding change in protein levels. However, this decrease in PP1 specific activity correlated with a significant increase in the -fold activation of PP1 by insulin. These findings suggest that mechanisms may exist that maintain PP1 in a low activity state, allowing the phosphatase to be maximally stimulated by insulin.The precise events leading to the activation of glycogen-localized PP1 activity remain unclear. Three mammalian proteins have been identified that target PP1 to glycogen: GM, GL, and PTG. Dent et al. (12Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) reported that the phosphorylation of site 1 on GM by pp90 rsk in vitro increased the activity of the bound PP1, while phosphorylation of sites 1 and 2 on GM by cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in the disassociation of PP1 from GM. This attractive model would explain how insulin, through the stimulation of the MAP kinase/pp90 rsk cascade, could increase PP1 activity, while also explaining how catabolic agents, through activation of adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, could reduce PP1 activity at the glycogen particle. However, several groups have since convincingly shown that the MAP kinase/pp90 rsk pathway is neither sufficient nor necessary for the increases in glucose storage or PP1 activity caused by insulin (13Robinson L.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Further, since neither site 1 or 2 of GM is conserved in either PTG or GL, it is impossible to apply the GM phosphorylation model to these proteins. Not surprisingly, PTG and GL are not phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, PTG, is not phosphorylatedin vivo in response to anabolic agents such as insulin or catabolic agents such as isoproterenol (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither treatment had any effect on the levels of glycogen-associated PP1 in 3T3-L1 or primary rat adipocytes (Fig. 2 B; data not shown; Ref. 18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of PP1 targeted to glycogen by PTG occurs independently of PP1 translocation and PTG phosphorylation.Several lines of evidence have been presented here implicating DARPP-32 as a key regulator of glycogen-targeted PP1 activity in adipocytes. DARPP-32 was not detectable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but it was dramatically up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. This expression of DARPP-32 correlated well with both the decrease in PP1 specific activity measured during differentiation and the increased stimulation of PP1 by insulin. DARPP-32 in 3T3-L1 and primary rat adipocytes is exclusively localized to particulate fractions, including the glycogen pellet. Finally, an assay of PP1 activity in 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates revealed a lag in PP1 activity that was largely overcome by insulin treatment of the cells. The largest stimulation of PP1 activity was thus detected at the earliest assay time points. PP1 activity from fibroblast cells did not exhibit this in vitrolag, nor was phosphatase activity significantly affected by insulin. One explanation of these results is that PP1 in fully differentiated adipocytes is regulated by DARPP-32 binding, and stimulation of PP1 by insulin occurs through disinhibition of the phosphatase. Although DARPP-32 is considered to be the neuronal homologue of Inh-1, both pig brown fat and bovine adipose tissue have previously been reported to contain DARPP-32 (28Meister B. Fried G. Hökfelt T. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8713-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Strålfors P. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was also detected in primary rat adipocytes (Fig. 3 A), so DARPP-32 is likely to be the 32-kDa inhibitor of phosphorylase phosphatase activity in rat adipose tissue reported by Nemenoff et al. (30Nemenoff R.A. Blackshear P.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9437-9443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that in adipocytes DARPP-32 may play an important role in insulin signaling.The mechanisms of regulation of glycogen-targeted PP1 by both DARPP-32 and insulin are unclear. The organic PP1 inhibitor microcystin has been used as an affinity matrix to isolate PP1 and a large number of associated proteins from tissues (8Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Many PP1-binding proteins, therefore, do not appear to obstruct the catalytic site, allowing targeted PP1 to interact not only with substrates but also with physiological inhibitors such as DARPP-32. Thiophosphorylated DARPP-32 could inhibit PP1 bound to recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-PTG by 70% without any detectable disassociation of the phosphatase from PTG (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that a trimeric PTG·PP1·DARPP-32 complex may be formed. The possible disruption of the PP1/DARPP-32 interaction by insulin could occur in several ways. First, insulin may stimulate the dephosphorylation or prevent the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, most likely through reduction of cAMP levels and/or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Alternatively, insulin stimulation of adipocytes may result in the generation of a soluble second messenger, which could disrupt DARPP-32 binding to PP1 independently of inhibitor dephosphorylation. We have previously shown that PP1 bound to PTG is less sensitive to inhibition by DARPP-32 (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conversely, the PP1·PTG complex may be more easily disinhibited by insulin treatment, possibly explaining the ability of insulin to specifically activate glycogen-targeted PP1, leading to the dephosphorylation of a limited number of substrates. Because of the high off rate and the need to solubilize with detergent, it has thus far not been possible to capture a complex between PP1 and DARPP-32 in vivo. Efforts are under way to explore the effect of insulin on PP1/DARPP-32 interaction. Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). As the major anabolic hormone regulating glucose utilization and storage, insulin exerts many of its effects by promoting the net dephosphorylation of enzymes such as glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase, resulting in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Several lines of evidence indicate that these insulin-stimulated dephosphorylations are catalyzed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; GM, glycogen-binding regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; GL, hepatic glycogen-targeting subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; PTG, protein targeting to glycogen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PNS, postnuclear supernatant. 1The abbreviations used are: PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; GM, glycogen-binding regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; GL, hepatic glycogen-targeting subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase; PTG, protein targeting to glycogen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PNS, postnuclear supernatant.

Further, since neither site 1 or 2 of GM is conserved in either PTG or GL, it is impossible to apply the GM phosphorylation model to these proteins. Not surprisingly, PTG and GL are not phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, PTG, is not phosphorylatedin vivo in response to anabolic agents such as insulin or catabolic agents such as isoproterenol (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither treatment had any effect on the levels of glycogen-associated PP1 in 3T3-L1 or primary rat adipocytes (Fig. 2 B; data not shown; Ref. 18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of PP1 targeted to glycogen by PTG occurs independently of PP1 translocation and PTG phosphorylation.Several lines of evidence have been presented here implicating DARPP-32 as a key regulator of glycogen-targeted PP1 activity in adipocytes. DARPP-32 was not detectable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but it was dramatically up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation. This expression of DARPP-32 correlated well with both the decrease in PP1 specific activity measured during differentiation and the increased stimulation of PP1 by insulin. DARPP-32 in 3T3-L1 and primary rat adipocytes is exclusively localized to particulate fractions, including the glycogen pellet. Finally, an assay of PP1 activity in 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates revealed a lag in PP1 activity that was largely overcome by insulin treatment of the cells. The largest stimulation of PP1 activity was thus detected at the earliest assay time points. PP1 activity from fibroblast cells did not exhibit this in vitrolag, nor was phosphatase activity significantly affected by insulin. One explanation of these results is that PP1 in fully differentiated adipocytes is regulated by DARPP-32 binding, and stimulation of PP1 by insulin occurs through disinhibition of the phosphatase. Although DARPP-32 is considered to be the neuronal homologue of Inh-1, both pig brown fat and bovine adipose tissue have previously been reported to contain DARPP-32 (28Meister B. Fried G. Hökfelt T. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8713-8716Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Strålfors P. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was also detected in primary rat adipocytes (Fig. 3 A), so DARPP-32 is likely to be the 32-kDa inhibitor of phosphorylase phosphatase activity in rat adipose tissue reported by Nemenoff et al. (30Nemenoff R.A. Blackshear P.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9437-9443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that in adipocytes DARPP-32 may play an important role in insulin signaling.The mechanisms of regulation of glycogen-targeted PP1 by both DARPP-32 and insulin are unclear. The organic PP1 inhibitor microcystin has been used as an affinity matrix to isolate PP1 and a large number of associated proteins from tissues (8Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Many PP1-binding proteins, therefore, do not appear to obstruct the catalytic site, allowing targeted PP1 to interact not only with substrates but also with physiological inhibitors such as DARPP-32. Thiophosphorylated DARPP-32 could inhibit PP1 bound to recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-PTG by 70% without any detectable disassociation of the phosphatase from PTG (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that a trimeric PTG·PP1·DARPP-32 complex may be formed. The possible disruption of the PP1/DARPP-32 interaction by insulin could occur in several ways. First, insulin may stimulate the dephosphorylation or prevent the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, most likely through reduction of cAMP levels and/or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Alternatively, insulin stimulation of adipocytes may result in the generation of a soluble second messenger, which could disrupt DARPP-32 binding to PP1 independently of inhibitor dephosphorylation. We have previously shown that PP1 bound to PTG is less sensitive to inhibition by DARPP-32 (18Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conversely, the PP1·PTG complex may be more easily disinhibited by insulin treatment, possibly explaining the ability of insulin to specifically activate glycogen-targeted PP1, leading to the dephosphorylation of a limited number of substrates. Because of the high off rate and the need to solubilize with detergent, it has thus far not been possible to capture a complex between PP1 and DARPP-32 in vivo. Efforts are under way to explore the effect of insulin on PP1/DARPP-32 interaction. Insulin action is characterized by the paradoxical regulation of serine/threonine phosphorylation (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of protein kinase cascades play a crucial role in the mitogenic effects of this hormone. However, regulation of glucose- and lipid-metabolizing enzymes by insulin occurs largely through dephosphorylation of these proteins. Although inactivation of upstream kinases may be involved (27Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the key enzymes that regulate glycogen synthesis, namely glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase, are all excellent substrates for PP1. Further, PP1 has been shown to be specifically activated by insulin, suggesting an important role for this phosphatase in insulin action. Although PP1 is present in nearly all cellular compartments, only a specific, limited number of phosphoproteins are dephosphorylated in response to insulin (1Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). This paradox raises two important questions: how is PP1 targeted to the relevant substrates, and how are specific pools of PP1 preferentially activated by insulin? We have utilized the 3T3-L1 cell line to investigate the regulation of glycogen metabolism by insulin. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are poorly responsive to insulin; however, differentiation of these cells into lipid-containing adipocytes results in a dramatic increase in insulin-mediated glucose utilization and storage. The levels of many proteins are increased during adipogenesis, including key mediators of insulin signaling, such as the insulin receptor (22Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Glut-4 (23Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the hormonal regulation of glycogen synthesis during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In fibroblasts, insulin only caused a 3-fold increase in glucose accumulation as glycogen; in the fully differentiated day 8 adipocytes, insulin treatment resulted in a 700-fold increase in glycogen synthesis. Correspondingly, the protein and activity levels of glycogen synthase were dramatically increased upon adipogenesis, as was the stimulation of synthase activity in response to insulin. In contrast, the specific activity of PP1 decreased by over 60% during differentiation, with no corresponding change in protein levels. However, this decrease in PP1 specific activity correlated with a significant increase in the -fold activation of PP1 by insulin. These findings suggest that mechanisms may exist that maintain PP1 in a low activity state, allowing the phosphatase to be maximally stimulated by insulin. The precise events leading to the activation of glycogen-localized PP1 activity remain unclear. Three mammalian proteins have been identified that target PP1 to glycogen: GM, GL, and PTG. Dent et al. (12Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) reported that the phosphorylation of site 1 on GM by pp90 rsk in vitro increased the activity of the bound PP1, while phosphorylation of sites 1 and 2 on GM by cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in the disassociation of PP1 from GM. This attractive model would explain how insulin, through the stimulation of the MAP kinase/pp90 rsk cascade, could increase PP1 activity, while also explaining how catabolic agents, through activation of adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, could reduce PP1 activity at the glycogen particle. However, several groups have since convincingly shown that the MAP kinase/pp90 rsk pathway is neither sufficient nor necessary for the increases in glucose storage or PP1 activity caused by insulin (13Robinson L.J.

The thioredoxin system composed of the small peptide thioredoxin (12 kDa), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), 1The abbreviations used are: TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; PfTrxR, Plasmodium falciparumTrxR; PfTrxRC88A, PfTrxR containing alanine at position 88 instead of cysteine;PfTrxRC88S, PfTrxR containing serine at position 88 instead of cysteine; PfTrxRC93A,PfTrxR containing alanine at position 93 instead of cysteine; PfTrxRH509A, PfTrxR containing alanine at position 509 instead of histidine;PfTrxRH509Q, PfTrxR containing glutamine at position 509 instead of histidine; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoate). and NADPH is involved in the maintenance of the crucial intracellular redox state (1Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). TrxR catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to thioredoxin, which itself acts as a reductant of disulfide-containing proteins, such as ribonucleotide reductase (2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TrxR is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, which includes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, mercuric ion reductase, and trypanothione reductase (3Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recently, TrxR from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was cloned and recombinantly expressed in a prokaryotic expression system (4Müller S. Becker K. Bergmann B. Schirmer R.H.

Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the parasite protein shows a high degree of similarity to human TrxR, whereas both proteins have only moderate similarity to the well characterized Escherichia coli TrxR (5Müller S.

These data imply that two classes of clearly distinguishable TrxRs exist, large TrxRs, represented by human and P. falciparum TrxRs, with a subunit size of 58 and 64 kDa, respectively, and small TrxRs such as the prokaryotic E. coli protein, with a subunit size of 35 kDa (4Müller S.

Both classes show local regions of strong similarity, such as the FAD binding site, but their primary structures are only distantly related. Based upon their amino acid sequences, large TrxRs are much more related to glutathione reductases than to their small counterparts (5Müller S. Gilberger T.-W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H.

These investigations led to the hypothesis that small TrxRs have to undergo a conformational change before they are able to exhibit their catalytic activity (11Williams Jr., C.H.

Ten oligonucleotides were designed to replace amino acid residues potentially involved in PfTrxR activity (Table I). The putative active site cysteines, Cys88 and Cys93, were changed to alanine. Residue Cys88 was also changed to serine. The putative active site base His509 was replaced by either alanine or glutamine. The replacement of the original amino acids with the desired ones was performed by an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis method according to Papworth et al. (14Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar). By using high fidelity thermostable Pfu DNA polymerase, low cycle number, and primers designed only to copy the parental strand in a linear fashion, this method minimized unwanted second site mutations and generated mutants in a 1-day procedure. Briefly, the mutagenic oligonucleotides, complementary to the opposite strand of the double-stranded DNA template, were extended by the Pfu DNA polymerase during temperature cycling. 35 ng of the double-stranded, supercoiled expression plasmid pJC40PfTrxR (5Müller S. Gilberger T.-W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and 100 ng of mutagenic sense and antisense primers were used in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing deoxyribonucleotides, reaction buffer, andPfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min, 12 cycles. The linear amplification product was treated with endonucleaseDpnI (10 units/μl, Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h to eliminate the parental template. Subsequently, an aliqout of 6 μl of this reaction mixture containing the double-nicked mutated plasmid was used for the transformation of competent E. coli BL 21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). All mutants were analyzed performing the Sanger dideoxy chain termination reaction for double-stranded DNA (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 100% of the analyzed colonies contained the desired mutation in the absence of other unwanted mutations.Table IMutagenic oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis of PfTrxR5′ 247GGTATAGGTGGAACGTGTGTGAACGTAGGATGTGTACC 3′C88WT1-aWT, wild type.5′ GGTATAGGTGGAACG GC TGTGAACGTAGGATGTGTACC 3′C88A (S)1-bS, sense.5′ GGTACACATCCTACGTTCACA GC CGTTCCACCTATACC 3′C88A (AS)1-cAS, antisense.5′ GGTATAGGTGGAACGT C TGTGAACGTAGGATGTGTACC 3′C88S (S)5′ GGTACACATCCTACGTTCACA G ACGTTCCACCTATACC 3′C88S (AS)5′ 265GTGAACGTAGGATGTGTACCAAAAAAATTAATGCAC 3′C93WT5′ GTGAACGTAGGA GC TGTACCAAAAAAATTAATGCAC 3′C93A (S)5′ GTGCATTAATTTTTTTGGTACA GC TCCTACGTTCAC 3′C93A (AS)5′ 1514GCATAGGTATTCATCCAACAGATGCTGAATCG 3′H509WT5′ GCATAGGTATTCA A CCAACAGATGCTGAATCG 3′H509Q (S)5′ CGATTCAGCATCTGTTGG T TGAATACCTATGC 3′H509Q (AS)5′ GCATAGGTATT GC TCCAACAGATGCTGAATCG 3′H509A (S)5′ CGATTCAGCATCTGTTGGA GC AATACCTATGC 3′H509A (AS)Nucleotides that were exchanged in order to obtain the desired mutation are underlined and in bold letters.

Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which contains a T7 promotor and encodes 10 histidine residues preceding the N terminus of the recombinant protein, was used for overexpression of the wild-typePfTrxR and all mutants in E. coli BL 21 (DE3) cells. E. coli BL 21 (DE3) cells carrying the expression plasmid containing the mutated cDNA were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin). The cells were diluted 100-fold into the same medium and grown until anA 600 of 0.5 was reached. To induce the expression, 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation (4000 × g; 10 min) and sonicated (Branson Sonifier 250) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mmimidazole, 0.5 mm NaCl, pH 7.9), and the cell lysate was centrifugated at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Centrikon 1065, Kontron). The resulting supernatant was used for purification on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in a batch procedure according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard, and for spectral analyses the respective extinction coefficient was used for protein determination. To exchange the buffer system, recombinant proteins were dialyzed overnight against two changes of 2 liters of 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. For spectral analyses of PfTrxRC88A at various pH values, the buffer was exchanged by using Centricon 50 (Amicon) filters. The kinetic parameters of wild-type PfTrxR and all mutants were determined by the 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) reduction assay (5Müller S. Gilberger T.-W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 7271-7277Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mixture (1 ml; 20 °C) consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 2–4 μg ml−1 recombinant enzyme, 200 μm NADPH and 0.03–3 mm DTNB. For the determination of K m values for NADPH, NADPH concentrations were 1–50 μm and DTNB was 2 mm. The change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 412 nm (Uvikon 932, Kontron). The activity was calculated using the molar absorption coefficient of thionitrobenzoate at 412 nm (13600 m−1cm−1 per thionitrobenzoate unit). The extinction coefficients of the protein bound FAD in the 450-nm region were determined for all PfTrxRs. Enzyme-bound flavin was liberated by thermal denaturation at 100 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. The denatured protein was precipitated by centrifugation (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The concentration of free flavin was determined from its absorption coefficient at 450 nm of 11.3 × 103m−1cm−1. Spectral analyses of the oxidized form of the proteins were performed under aerobic conditions using 9–14 μm of wild-type and mutated PfTrxRs. Anaerobic spectra were performed by gently flushing oxygen-free nitrogen through the protein solution for 20 min followed by sealing the cuvette with a screw cap containing a septum adequate for anaerobic work or by overlaying the solution with mineral oil (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The spectra reported (between 250 and 750 nm) were obtained using a thermostated spectrophotometer (Uvikon 932, Kontron) with a scan speed of 200 nm/min at 22 °C. Subsequently, an excess of NADPH was added to the cuvette and the spectral changes during the reduction process of the protein were determined. For anaerobic reduced spectra, NADPH was treated with oxygen-free nitrogen as described above and added to the oxidized protein using a gas-tight Hamilton syringe (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that PfTrxR can be expressed as an active homodimer in the E. coli system (5Müller S. Gilberger T.-W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression and subsequent purification of wild-type PfTrxR,PfTrxRC88A, PfTrxRC88S,PfTrxRC93A, PfTrxRH509Q, andPfTrxRH509A yielded in 1–3.5 mg of pure protein liter−1 of bacterial culture. The purity of the proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The thiol reducing activities of wild-type and mutantPfTrxRs were compared based upon their kinetic properties (Table II). To evaluate the role of Cys88, Cys93, and His509 as putative catalytic active residues, the DTNB reduction assay was performed with wild-type and mutant proteins. Mutation of either Cys88 or Cys93 to alanine or serine resulted in a total loss of DTNB reducing activity, indicating that these residues are essential for enzymatic activity and most likely represent the active site thiols of the large PfTrxR. Replacement of His509 by either glutamine or alanine drastically decreased the reduction capacity of PfTrxR which implies that His509 represents the active site base ofPfTrxR. PfTrxRH509Q retained about 5% of residual activity toward DTNB compared with the wild-type protein. To eliminate the possibility of a partial compensation of the imidazole side chain by the amido group of glutamine, we substituted His509 by alanine. However, the H509A mutant still retained 3% of the wild-type enzyme activity with DTNB. Although the turnover number of the histidine mutants decreased drastically, these mutants had a lower K m value for the model substrate DTNB (Table II). Additionally, the K m for NADPH of the H509A mutant decreased. A similar effect on the K m value for NADPH is well known for the same point mutation of the functionally homologous histidine residue in the E. coliglutathione reductase (20Deonarain M.P. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table IIApparent kinetic parameters for recombinant wild-type and mutant PfTrxRsConstructSpecific activityk catK m DTNBK m NADPHunits/mgmin −1μmWT4.30 ± 0.8275.2 ± 51.2212 ± 499 ± 0.7C88A, C88S, C93ANo activityH509Q0.22 ± 0.0914.0 ± 5.850 ± 99 ± 0.6H509A2-aThe true K m value for NADPH in this mutant could not be determined since the discrimination in rate could not be achieved even at a concentration of NADPH as low as 2 μm.0.15 ± 0.039.6 ± 1.9147 ± 3<2Data represent means (±S.E.) of three different enzyme preparations.

Open table in a new tab Data represent means (±S.E.) of three different enzyme preparations. The kinetic properties of the recombinant proteins were determined by the DTNB reduction assay. Spectral analysis of oxidized wild-type PfTrxR under aerobic conditions shows a characteristic flavin spectrum with peaks around λ460 nm and λ380 nm (Fig. 1, line a). The λmax for the oxidized enzyme is at 462 nm (ε = 11.46 × 103m−1cm−1) (Table III) with a shoulder at 486 nm. During reduction of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions using 10 equivalents of NADPH/FAD, the 462-nm peak bleaches and a shoulder in the 550-nm region is formed. The λmaxof the reduced protein shifts with 26 nm toward the blue end of the spectrum, forming a peak at 436 nm (Fig. 1, line b). A similar spectral change was observed for other members of this protein family like glutathione reductase during the redox process (21Arscott L.D. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,22Deonarain M.P. Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser.

Open table in a new tab Data represent means (±S.E.) of three different enzyme preparations. The absorption spectra of PfTrxRC88A (Fig.2 A) andPfTrxRC93A (Fig. 3) in the absence of reductant differ from wild-type PfTrxR by a shift of λmax to the blue;PfTrxRC88A to 451 nm with an absorption coefficient of 12.80 × 103m−1cm−1, and PfTrxRC93A to 456 nm with an absorption coefficient of 12.62 × 103m−1 cm−1 (Table III).PfTrxRC93A shows a normal oxidized spectrum, and the reduction leads to a decrease of the absorbance at 456 nm and a slight increase of the absorption at the 550-nm band. The exchange of the Cys88 with serine has drastic effects on the enzyme as expected if the charge transfer band is due to interaction of Cys93 with the protein-bound flavin. The purified protein has a brick-red color instead of being yellow as all other proteins. Spectral analysis of nonreduced PfTrxRC88S shows the presence of a charge transfer complex with a λmax at 442 nm and a shoulder around 550 nm (Fig. 4), resembling the charge transfer produced in the EH2 species of glutathione reductase and trypanothione reductase (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Arscott L.D. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Remarkably, PfTrxRC88A is yellow and shows only a slight increase of the absorbance at 550 nm compared with the oxidized wild-type protein, and addition of NADPH does not change the spectral features apart from bleaching the absorbance at 451 nm due to FAD reduction. Determination of the oxidized spectra ofPfTrxRC88A at higher pH values resulted in spectral changes of the nonreduced protein. Fig. 2 B shows the absorption spectrum at pH 7.9 (original conditions) and pH 10.6. Apart from the induction of a long wavelength band around 580 nm, the pH change from 7.9 to 10.6 resulted in a blue shift of the flavin peak by 21 nm. The appearance of the 580-nm band at higher pH values suggests that the alanine mutation of Cys88 affects the pK of Cys93, so that this residue is not in its thiolate form at pH values lower than 8.5 (Fig. 2 C) and can thus not interact with the protein-bound flavin ofPfTrxRC88A. Further, these data imply that Cys93 represents the charge transfer thiol ofPfTrxR.Figure 3Spectra of PfTrxRC93A (in 20 mm Tris/HCl containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9). a, oxidizedPfTrxRC93A (12 μm); b, reduced PfTrxRC93A.

Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 7271-7277Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These two types of isofunctional enzymes are distinct in molecular mass, location of their active site residues, and most likely by their structure and catalytic mechanism (5Müller S. Gilberger T.-W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G.

A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Molecular analyses of PfTrxR and the human enzyme revealed a high degree of similarity of both proteins to glutathione reductases rather than to E. coli TrxR, which is further supported by the results of Arscott et al. (8Arscott D.L. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) for human TrxR and the data presented here forPfTrxR. A series of PfTrxR mutants altered at the potential redox-active disulfide bridge (Cys88 and Cys93) and the potential active site base (His509) were generated to obtain more information about their role for the catalytic reaction of large TrxRs. The conversion of either one of the putative active site thiols, Cys88 and Cys93, into alanine or serine caused a complete inactivation of the thiol-reducing ability ofPfTrxR. These data clearly identify Cys88and Cys93 as essential amino acid residues involved in the catalysis of PfTrxR. Similar results were obtained when isofunctional residues were mutated in trypanothione reductase and glutathione reductase (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Deonarain M.P. Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B. 1990; 241: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast the replacement of the isofunctional residues in E. coli TrxR resulted in a residual activity of the mutant proteins of about 10%, which was explained by the different topology of the protein-bound flavin and the disulfide axis in comparison to other members of this protein family (11Williams Jr., C.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further, it was demonstrated that His509 is involved in the catalytic mechanism of PfTrxR. The catalytic activity toward DTNB was drastically reduced but not completely eliminated with the substitution of the His509 by either glutamine or alanine. The residual activity of 5% after substitution of His509 by glutamine might be due to the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the glutamine residue or to the participation of another protonable side chain in the enzyme. To completely remove the potential hydrogen-bonding capacity, His509 was replaced by alanine.PfTrxRH509A still maintained 3% of catalytic activity with DTNB. This result implies that the function of His509can be substituted, although inefficiently, by a nearby side chain that functions as an alternative proton acceptor/donor. These data are consistent with investigations on the E. coli glutathione reductase, where the analogous mutants H439Q and H439A retained 1 and 0.3%, respectively, of the activity of the wild-type enzyme (20Deonarain M.P. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, in E. coli TrxR Asp139 rather than His245 functions as the acid catalyst for the dithiol-disulfide redox interconversion (23Mulrooney S.B. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The most characteristic spectral feature of wild-typePfTrxR is the formation of a new 550-nm absorbance band upon NADPH reduction (Fig. 1). This long wavelength absorbance resembles other EH2 forms of related proteins (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Arscott L.D. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Distefano M.D. Au K.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is indicative of a thiolate flavin charge transfer complex as a stable intermediate of the two electron reduced form of the enzyme (25Massey V. Ghisla S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 227: 446-465Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, the formation of a thiolate flavin charge transfer complex upon reduction with NADPH and dithionite was described for human TrxR (8Arscott D.L. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) but does not occur in the E. coli enzyme (11Williams Jr., C.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,26Zanetti G. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5232-5236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of EH2 is influenced by complex formation with NADP+ and/or NADPH (27Sahlman L. Lambeir A.M. Lindskog S. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12403-12408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a modulation might also occur in the spectrum reported here for the NADPH-reduced wild-type PfTrxR slightly increasing the absorbance around 550 nm. To delineate the role of the active site cysteines and to identify the residue responsible for the thiolate flavin charge transfer interaction of EH2, we exchanged the putative active site cysteines ofPfTrxR. In related flavoproteins such as glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, and mercuric ion reductase, the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue of the redox active site is responsible for the formation of the thiolate flavin charge transfer complex (19Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Distefano M.D. Au K.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The replacement of Cys93 by alanine (PfTrxRC93A) does not change the spectral features of the oxidized form of the protein. Upon reduction with an excess of NADPH a slight increase of the 550-nm band occurs (Fig. 3). This might be due to the binding of excess NADPH to the reduced protein. The replacement of the other active site cysteine Cys88resulted in conspicuous spectral properties. While a serine at this position leads to the expected distinctive absorption spectrum of the oxidized protein resembling a permanent charge transfer complex even under nonreductive conditions (Fig. 4), the alanine mutant protein reveals just a slight increase at the 550 nm band (Fig. 2 A). The absence of the long wavelength band in PfTrxRC88A in the absence of the reducing agent was unanticipated, providing that the carboxyl-terminal Cys93 represents the charge transfer thiol within the PfTrxR active site. At higher pH values between 8.5 and 10.6 the thiolate charge transfer complex in the oxidized PfTrxRC88A was induced (Fig. 2, Band C), indicating that in this mutant protein Cys93 is not in its thiolate form at pH values lower than 8.5. These data imply that the pK of Cys93 was altered within the protein due to the C88A mutation. The long wavelength band in monoalkylated lipoamide dehydrogenase (EHR) is also missing as shown by Thorpe and Williams (29Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3553-3557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probably the alkylation of the amino-terminal cysteine residue sufficiently perturbs the environment of the charge transfer donor and might increase its pK (21Arscott L.D. Thorpe C.

However, in this case binding of 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase induces the appearance of the long wavelength band and is assigned to a charge transfer complex between the carboxyl-terminal thiolate and the protein-bound flavin (30Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In glutathione reductase monoalkylated at the amino-terminal cysteine residue, the long wavelength band is fully retained (21Arscott L.D. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Decreasing the pH value to 3.5 results in almost a complete loss of the charge transfer absorbance; increasing the pH to 10.3 yields a blue shift of the FAD band and increases the long wavelength absorbance (31Sahlman L. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8033-8038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also seen in PfTrxRC88A (Fig. 2 B). In conclusion, the data presented here suggest fundamental differences between small TrxRs and large TrxRs. Cys88, Cys93, and His509 were identified as essential active site residues of PfTrxR. Equivalent residues are responsible for the enzymatic activity of glutathione reductase, whereas in E. coli TrxR the active site residues show a completely different topology (9Kyurian J. Krishna T.S.R. Wong L. Guenther B. Pahler A. Williams C.H. Model P. Nature. 1991; 352: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Williams Jr., C.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further, the formation of a stable thiolate flavin charge transfer complex implies that the reaction mechanism of large TrxRs is similar to glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase as it has also been suggested by Arscottet al. (8Arscott D.L. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the fact thatPfTrxRC88A does not show the expected charge transfer band at pH values lower than 8.5 hints toward distinctive differences in the architecture of the catalytic center of glutathione reductase and PfTrxR, that demand more detailed studies dealing with the acid-base chemistry of the PfTrxR active site. In addition, crystallographic analysis of the three-dimensional structure will be necessary to conclusively discuss the active site geometry of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1976859715,"A series of studies were performed to determine whether zinc finger peptides could efficiently repress transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters in vivo and to determine how such repression might depend on the position of the zinc finger binding site with respect to those of the TATA box or the initiator element. Promoter constructs were prepared with Zif268 binding sites inserted at various positions, and the activity of a reporter gene was measured in transfection studies. We found that the peptide containing the three zinc fingers of Zif268 could efficiently repress activated transcription when bound to a site near the TATA box (19-fold repression) or when bound to a site near the initiator element (18-fold repression). Repression was even more effective when the zinc finger peptide was bound to both of these sites (63-fold repression). Novel zinc finger peptides that had been selected via phage display also served as repressors of activated transcription, but repression with these proteins was somewhat less efficient than with the Zif268 peptide.

Designer DNA-binding proteins may eventually provide novel reagents for gene therapy and for the regulation of gene expression in transgenic organisms. In the past several years, there has been remarkable progress in the design and selection of novel zinc finger proteins (1Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Recent phage display experiments suggest that it may be possible to select zinc finger peptides that will recognize almost any desired target site on duplex DNA (8Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Despite this rapid progress in design, there has been relatively little information about how such novel proteins might be used to regulate transcription or about the differential effects of targeting the zinc finger peptides to various promoter regions. In this study, we begin exploring these issues to develop a more systematic basis for the application of zinc finger proteins in gene therapy and in the regulation of transgenic organisms. We systematically scan the promoter region to find sites where zinc fingers are most effective as repressors. We also show that novel zinc finger proteins selected via phage display can function effectively as repressors in vivo.DISCUSSIONStudies with novel zinc finger proteins may help elucidate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (earlier studies using zinc fingers to block RNA polymerase III transcription helped delineate key regulatory sites) (24McBryant S.J. Kassavetis G.A. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and these studies also may provide a basis for using zinc finger proteins in gene therapy. (As mentioned in the Introduction, a designer zinc finger/homeodomain fusion (9Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1995; 267: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) already is being tested for applications in gene therapy (11Rivera V.M. Clackson T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).) In the studies reported here, we have shown that zinc finger peptides can repress both basal and VP16-activated transcription when bound close to the TATA box or the initiator element. Computer modeling studies suggest that the Zif268 zinc fingers, when bound to DNA sites between the TATA box and the initiator element, may interfere with proper binding of TBP and TFIIB to the promoter. The Zif268 peptide also functioned effectively as a repressor when bound to DNA at position +18 (but not at position +49). It seems plausible that binding of the Zif268 peptide at position +18 may interfere with the binding of TBP-associated factors. (Drosophila TAF150 binds around the initiator and the footprint extends to position +33 (25Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.-L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).) We find, with several different promoter constructs, that positions −22 and +18 give essentially equivalent levels of repression (Fig. 3). When both a TATA box and an initiator element were present, the Zif peptide gave 19-fold (position −22) and 18-fold (position +18) repression. When only the initiator element was present, each site gave about 4-fold repression. When only the TATA box was present, these sites gave 9-fold (position −22) and 10-fold (position +18) repression. Agreement of these repression levels may be fortuitous, but since 1) other proteins are tightly associated with TBPin vivo to form the multiprotein TFIID complex, and since 2) the TFIID footprint covers both the −22 and +18 sites, it seems plausible that binding of the Zif peptide at these positions may actually block the same step (i.e. binding of TFIID to the promoter), explaining why similar levels of repression are observed for these two positions.Phage display systems (3Rebar E.J.

Genet. 1992; 12: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have been successfully used to change the DNA-binding specificities of zinc finger proteins. Recent results suggest that it may be possible to select zinc fingers that will specifically recognize almost any desired site (8Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This should allow the design of transcription factors that target critical sites in the promoters of viral genes and of oncogenes. Such novel zinc finger peptides may be used alone (as tested here), or possibly as fusions with repression domains (26Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to down-regulate target genes in a sequence-specific manner. Specificity of the DNA binding proteins may be especially critical in gene therapy, since it will be vitally important to minimize adventitious repression of endogenous genes. (Affecting regulation of other genes might lead to dangerous side effects in a clinical application.) In this regard, we note that it may be possible to improve the effectiveness and specificity of transcriptional repression by independently targeting multiple sites in a promoter region. We found that the Zif268 peptide, when bound to two critical sites, gave much stronger repression then when bound to a single site. Thus, when repressing activated transcription from a promoter containing a TATA box and an initiator element, binding to position −22 gave 19-fold repression, binding to position +18 gave 18-fold repression, whereas binding to both positions gave 63-fold repression (Fig. 2). These results suggest that it may be desirable to select several zinc finger peptides, recognizing critical but nonoverlapping regions in a given promoter, and to combine these peptides for target-specific repression. This strategy has interesting parallels with the mechanisms of “combinatorial control” that are so common in eukaryotic gene regulation.The strategies and results reported in this study should provide a good background for developing zinc finger peptides as repressors for use in gene therapy and in the regulation of gene expression in transgenic organisms. We find that zinc finger peptides can effectively repress transcription when they bind to key regions of the promoter, and phage display methods should allow selection of zinc finger peptides that recognize the corresponding regions of endogenous promoters.Previous studies (24McBryant S.J. Kassavetis G.A. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) had shown that zinc fingers could efficiently block RNA polymerase III transcription in vitro (repressing up to 17-fold with optimal placement of the binding sites). We show that comparable levels can be obtained in vivo at RNA polymerase II promoters. However, our results raise interesting questions about two other studies that have tested designer zinc finger proteins as repressors. A few years ago, Choo et al. (27Choo Y. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. Nature. 1994; 372: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) designed a zinc finger protein that would recognize a 9-bp site within the coding region of the targeted gene. They reported that this designer protein gave effective repression in vivo, interpreting changes in cell viability as evidence for “transcriptional blockage” of the targeted gene. However, it is important to note that their protein had a relatively modest affinity for the targeted DNA site (reported K d = 620 nm, which is about 1,000-fold weaker than Zif268), and that the putative binding site for this zinc finger peptide was significantly downstream of the transcription initiation point. (It would need to block transcriptional elongation rather than merely prevent initiation.) The results of Choo et al. appear to be in striking contrast to our own; the Zif268 peptide binds much more tightly than their designed peptide and yet Zif268 has, at best, a modest effect on transcription when binding at position +49. The basis for these differences is not clear but our results certainly raise questions about the general utility of targeting zinc fingers to binding sites within the coding region of a gene.It also is interesting to compare our results with those reported by Liu et al. (26Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) who designed proteins containing six zinc fingers (arguing that these might be specifically targeted to unique sites in a complex genome). They also added a 43-amino acid peptide representing the minimal Krüppel-associated box-A repression domain (28Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K.-H. Vissing H. Thiesen H.-J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Liu et al. report 14-fold repression for their construct when it binds to a promoter that contains six tandem copies of the binding site for this polydactyl protein. Thus, they have good evidence for repression of the targeted gene, but many questions remain about the utility and specificity of these six-finger proteins and about the most effective methods of using zinc finger proteins as repressors. For repression of activated transcription, our strategy seems at least as efficient; we can obtain equal or greater levels of repression with a three-finger protein and a single binding site. Selection of zinc finger proteins recognizing endogenous (gene-specific) promoter regions should allow further testing and the potential for broad application of our strategy. Designer DNA-binding proteins may eventually provide novel reagents for gene therapy and for the regulation of gene expression in transgenic organisms.

For repression of activated transcription, our strategy seems at least as efficient; we can obtain equal or greater levels of repression with a three-finger protein and a single binding site. Selection of zinc finger proteins recognizing endogenous (gene-specific) promoter regions should allow further testing and the potential for broad application of our strategy. Studies with novel zinc finger proteins may help elucidate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (earlier studies using zinc fingers to block RNA polymerase III transcription helped delineate key regulatory sites) (24McBryant S.J. Kassavetis G.A. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and these studies also may provide a basis for using zinc finger proteins in gene therapy. (As mentioned in the Introduction, a designer zinc finger/homeodomain fusion (9Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1995; 267: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) already is being tested for applications in gene therapy (11Rivera V.M. Clackson T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Amara J.F. Keenan T. Magari S.R. Phillips T. Courage N.L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).) In the studies reported here, we have shown that zinc finger peptides can repress both basal and VP16-activated transcription when bound close to the TATA box or the initiator element. Computer modeling studies suggest that the Zif268 zinc fingers, when bound to DNA sites between the TATA box and the initiator element, may interfere with proper binding of TBP and TFIIB to the promoter. The Zif268 peptide also functioned effectively as a repressor when bound to DNA at position +18 (but not at position +49). It seems plausible that binding of the Zif268 peptide at position +18 may interfere with the binding of TBP-associated factors. (Drosophila TAF150 binds around the initiator and the footprint extends to position +33 (25Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.-L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).) We find, with several different promoter constructs, that positions −22 and +18 give essentially equivalent levels of repression (Fig. 3). When both a TATA box and an initiator element were present, the Zif peptide gave 19-fold (position −22) and 18-fold (position +18) repression. When only the initiator element was present, each site gave about 4-fold repression. When only the TATA box was present, these sites gave 9-fold (position −22) and 10-fold (position +18) repression. Agreement of these repression levels may be fortuitous, but since 1) other proteins are tightly associated with TBPin vivo to form the multiprotein TFIID complex, and since 2) the TFIID footprint covers both the −22 and +18 sites, it seems plausible that binding of the Zif peptide at these positions may actually block the same step (i.e. binding of TFIID to the promoter), explaining why similar levels of repression are observed for these two positions.

Genet. 1992; 12: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2256-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have been successfully used to change the DNA-binding specificities of zinc finger proteins. Recent results suggest that it may be possible to select zinc fingers that will specifically recognize almost any desired site (8Greisman H.A. Pabo C.O. Science. 1997; 275: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This should allow the design of transcription factors that target critical sites in the promoters of viral genes and of oncogenes. Such novel zinc finger peptides may be used alone (as tested here), or possibly as fusions with repression domains (26Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to down-regulate target genes in a sequence-specific manner. Specificity of the DNA binding proteins may be especially critical in gene therapy, since it will be vitally important to minimize adventitious repression of endogenous genes. (Affecting regulation of other genes might lead to dangerous side effects in a clinical application.) In this regard, we note that it may be possible to improve the effectiveness and specificity of transcriptional repression by independently targeting multiple sites in a promoter region. We found that the Zif268 peptide, when bound to two critical sites, gave much stronger repression then when bound to a single site. Thus, when repressing activated transcription from a promoter containing a TATA box and an initiator element, binding to position −22 gave 19-fold repression, binding to position +18 gave 18-fold repression, whereas binding to both positions gave 63-fold repression (Fig. 2). These results suggest that it may be desirable to select several zinc finger peptides, recognizing critical but nonoverlapping regions in a given promoter, and to combine these peptides for target-specific repression. This strategy has interesting parallels with the mechanisms of “combinatorial control” that are so common in eukaryotic gene regulation. The strategies and results reported in this study should provide a good background for developing zinc finger peptides as repressors for use in gene therapy and in the regulation of gene expression in transgenic organisms. We find that zinc finger peptides can effectively repress transcription when they bind to key regions of the promoter, and phage display methods should allow selection of zinc finger peptides that recognize the corresponding regions of endogenous promoters. Previous studies (24McBryant S.J. Kassavetis G.A. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) had shown that zinc fingers could efficiently block RNA polymerase III transcription in vitro (repressing up to 17-fold with optimal placement of the binding sites). We show that comparable levels can be obtained in vivo at RNA polymerase II promoters. However, our results raise interesting questions about two other studies that have tested designer zinc finger proteins as repressors. A few years ago, Choo et al. (27Choo Y. Sanchez-Garcia I. Klug A. Nature. 1994; 372: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) designed a zinc finger protein that would recognize a 9-bp site within the coding region of the targeted gene. They reported that this designer protein gave effective repression in vivo, interpreting changes in cell viability as evidence for “transcriptional blockage” of the targeted gene. However, it is important to note that their protein had a relatively modest affinity for the targeted DNA site (reported K d = 620 nm, which is about 1,000-fold weaker than Zif268), and that the putative binding site for this zinc finger peptide was significantly downstream of the transcription initiation point. (It would need to block transcriptional elongation rather than merely prevent initiation.) The results of Choo et al. appear to be in striking contrast to our own; the Zif268 peptide binds much more tightly than their designed peptide and yet Zif268 has, at best, a modest effect on transcription when binding at position +49. The basis for these differences is not clear but our results certainly raise questions about the general utility of targeting zinc fingers to binding sites within the coding region of a gene. It also is interesting to compare our results with those reported by Liu et al. (26Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) who designed proteins containing six zinc fingers (arguing that these might be specifically targeted to unique sites in a complex genome). They also added a 43-amino acid peptide representing the minimal Krüppel-associated box-A repression domain (28Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K.-H. Vissing H. Thiesen H.-J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Liu et al. report 14-fold repression for their construct when it binds to a promoter that contains six tandem copies of the binding site for this polydactyl protein. Thus, they have good evidence for repression of the targeted gene, but many questions remain about the utility and specificity of these six-finger proteins and about the most effective methods of using zinc finger proteins as repressors. For repression of activated transcription, our strategy seems at least as efficient; we can obtain equal or greater levels of repression with a three-finger protein and a single binding site.

Some of these extracellular stimuli arrest cells in the G1 phase of the mitotic division cycle and modulate the activity of the tumor suppressor protein Rb and its partner E2F-1. Earlier studies indicated that E2F-1, a transcription factor that stimulates expression of S-phase-specific genes, is able to repress transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type-1 promoter in a variety of cells, including those of glial and lymphocytic origin. Here, we demonstrate that E2F-1 may regulate the activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through its ability to bind sequences in the NF-κB enhancer region and to interact with the NF-κB subunit, p50. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays show that E2F-1 is able to bind specifically to a site embedded within the two NF-κB elements. Gel retardation/immunoblot analysis using purified E2F-1 and p50 homodimers reveals the presence of complexes containing both proteins. Affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence for direct interaction of E2F-1 and p50 in the absence of their DNA target sequences. In vitro transcription assay demonstrates that E2F-1 represses NF-κB mediated transcription in a cell-free system.

The acute phase of infection occurs within 1–3 weeks after exposure and is characterized by mononucleosis-like symptoms and plasma viremia (1Clark S.J. Saag M.S. Decker W.D. Campbell-Hill S.

This initial phase is followed by an extended asymptomatic phase during which there is often a slow, but progressive decline in immune function that leads to the final stage, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). During the stage of clinical latency, the viral burden in the peripheral bloodstream is markedly diminished, but viral replication persists in the lymph nodes (4Embretson J. Zupancic M. Beneke J.

Although there is no direct correlation between clinical and viral latency, the discrepancy between the number of cells harboring viral DNA and the small number of cells expressing viral RNA during this phase, suggests that factors which regulate HIV-1 gene expression may play a role in delaying the onset of AIDS (4Embretson J.

Cellular proliferation and differentiation are among the many parameters involved in determining the extent of HIV-1 replication in different host cells. For example, mitogenic activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes and promonocytic cell lines to differentiate are required for productive replication of HIV-1 (8Margolick J.B. Volkman D.J. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schuitemaker H. Kootstra N.A. Koppelman M.H. Bruisten S.M. Huisman H.G. Tersmette M. Miedema F. J. Clin.

Quiescent (G0) T lymphocytes and monocytes and γ-irradiated (G1 arrested) monocyte-derived macrophages are not permissive to HIV replication because of their inability to complete the reverse transcription process (11He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Schuitemaker H. Res.

However, many agents that promote the arrest of proliferating T lymphocytes and monocytes in G1 (UV irradiation, transforming growth factor-β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, sodium butyrate, etc.) stimulate viral replication by facilitating later stages in the viral life cycle including transcription (14Ahuja S.S. Paliogianni F. Yamada H. Balow J.E. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3109-3118PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haapajarvi T. Kivinen L. Pitkanen K. Laiho M.

These observations suggest that although the macromolecular environment provided by cells during the G0and early G1 phase is not suitable for early steps in the viral life cycle, the repertoire of cellular transcription factors in the G1 phase can increase levels of HIV-1 transcription. Normal progression of cells from the G1 to S phase is regulated in part by E2F-1. E2F-1 belongs to family of proteins including E2F-1 to -5 which are thought to play an important role in both promoting and restricting cell cycle progression (19La Thangue N.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Slansky J.E. Farnhamm P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E2F-1 in tissue culture cells stimulates them to enter S-phase by activating transcription of a subset of S-phase genes. These genes contain the consensus E2F-binding site (5′-TTTRRCGC-3′) in their promoters (20Slansky J.E. Farnhamm P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). During early G1, the retinoblastoma protein, Rb p105, binds to E2F-1. This interaction not only prevents the latter from activating transcription, but also promotes active repression of some promoters by the complex (21Hsiao K. McMahon S. Farnham P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Johnson D. Ohtani K. Nevins J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Lam E.W.

Phosphorylation of Rb later in G1 abolishes the interaction between Rb and E2F-1 (25Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Subsequent completion of S-phase requires inactivation of E2F-1 DNA binding activity (26Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 27Krek W. Xu G. Livingston D.M.

Recently, E2F-1 knockout mice showed a high incidence of unusual tumors and abnormalities in T cell maturation suggesting that in vivo, E2F-1 may also play an important role in restraining cell growth (29Field S.J.

Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that E2F-1 represses HIV-1 transcription through the NF-κB enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR (31Kundu M. Srinivasan A. Pomerantz R.J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6940-6946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/Rel family of transcription factors regulate HIV-1 transcription primarily through two tandem consensus binding sites in the HIV-LTR (32Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that increased NF-κB binding during early G1 may be critical for HIV transcription and therefore replication. First, NF-κB/Rel family members are activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, sodium butyrate, retinoic acid, and UV irradiation that stimulate HIV-1 replication and promote G1 arrest (14Ahuja S.S. Paliogianni F. Yamada H. Balow J.E. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3109-3118PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haapajarvi T. Kivinen L. Pitkanen K. Laiho M.

Second, studies in mouse fibroblasts have shown increased NF-κB binding activity during the G0-G1transition (33Baldwin Jr., A. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the G0-G1 transition is traversed during both activation and differentiation; it is not surprising that NF-κB binding activity increases during mitogenic activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and differentiation of monocytes, correlating with the increase in HIV-replication observed in these cells (8Margolick J.B. Volkman D.J. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schuitemaker H. Kootstra N.A. Koppelman M.H. Bruisten S.M. Huisman H.G. Tersmette M. Miedema F. J. Clin.

Immunol. 1986; 136: 4049-4053PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies have demonstrated that the 65-kDa NF-κB subunit (p65) associates with G1cyclin-cdk complexes and that NF-κB mediated HIV-1 transcription is inhibited by their kinase activity (35Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K.Y. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide further evidence that the activity of NF-κB on the HIV-1 LTR may be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that the cell-cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1, suppresses the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR by interfering with NF-κB function. We present a model whereby E2F-1 represses HIV-LTR-driven transcription by interacting with the 50-kDa NF-κB subunit (p50), both on and off the DNA. Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (36Mudryj M. Hiebert S.W. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-E2F-1, GST-E2F-1-(88–437), GST-E2F-1-(88–241), and GST-E2F-1-(241–437) expression plasmids were kindly provided by David Hall (Thomas Jefferson University). GST fusion proteins were prepared according to standard protocol with minor modifications. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 500 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme; and incubated for 15 min on ice. Cells were sonicated three times (10-s pulses) and centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 rpm. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Sigma). Purified baculovirus-produced NF-κB subunits, p50 and p65, were kindly provided by Timothy Coleman (Human Genome Sciences). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in gel retardation assays: 2κB, 2κBmutant, 1κB, 1κBmutant, and DHFR E2F. The 2κB oligonucleotide spans the HIV-1 enhancer sequence and is depicted in Fig. 1, panel D. The 2κBmutant oligonucleotide is identical to 2κB, except for a 2-base pair substitution in the E2F-1-binding site (5′-TTTCCGC-3′ to 5′-TTTCCTA-3′). The 1κB oligonucleotide contains HIV-1 LTR sequences from −110 to −91 relative to the +1 transcription start site and includes the 5′ NF-κB-binding site (5′-ACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGG-3′). 1κBmutant is identical to 1κB, except for a 3-base pair substitution (GGG to CTC) which abolishes NF-κB binding activity (32Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). The DHFR E2F oligonucleotide contains one E2F-binding site from the DHFR promoter (5′-ATCTTTCGCGCGCGCTTTCTA-3′). Methylation interference assay was performed as described previously (37Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Briefly, individual strands of the 2κB probe were end-labeled and hybridized to the unlabeled complementary strand. The probe was methylated by incubation with dimethyl sulfate and then incubated with 250 ng of GST-E2F-1. Bands corresponding to the E2F-DNA complex and the free probe were cut out after separation by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA was retrieved by electroelution onto DEAE membrane followed by high salt extraction and then cleaved by incubation with piperidine. After removal of the piperidine by lyophilization, the cleaved DNA was run on a 6% denaturing (urea) polyacrylamide gel. Gel retardation assay was performed as described previously (36Mudryj M. Hiebert S.W. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Bands were excised, soaked in SDS sample buffer for 1 h, and loaded onto a 10% denaturing (SDS) polyacrylamide (29:1) gel. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot (37Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (37Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Subsequent steps were also performed at 4 °C. 300 μg of precleared nuclear extract were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated with Sepharose A. The pellets were washed three times with TNN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot (37Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Chanda V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). GST pull-down experiments were performed in GST binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride). GST fusion proteins were prepared as described above, and kept on the glutathione beads. 200 μg of bacterial lysate were included in reactions using recombinant NF-κB subunits to eliminate nonspecific interactions. Pellets were washed 3 times in GST binding buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. KH95 (Santa Cruz) is a mouse monoclonal specific for human and mouse E2F-1. PC10 (Santa Cruz) is a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes mouse and human PCNA. BF683 (Santa Cruz) is a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for human cyclin A. Sc-114 (Santa Cruz) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the nuclear localization signal of p50. NR1157 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody which recognizes p50 and was kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation using the conditions specified by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). 1 × 107 cells were cotransfected with a total of 20 μg of DNA. Whole cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing cells harvested 48 h after transfection. Chlorampheicol acetyltransferase assay was performed as described previously (38Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R.J. Bagasra O. Chowdhury M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Amini S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The following chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids were used in transient transfection assay: −117/+3, mtE2F, mtκB1, mtκB2. The plasmid −117/+3 has been described previously (38Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R.J. Bagasra O. Chowdhury M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Amini S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The name delineates the portion of the HIV-1 LTR included in each construct; nucleotide positions are described with respect to the +1 transcription start site. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutations in the −117/+3 CAT reporter construct (39Rashtchian A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mtE2F construct contains CC to AT substitution in the putative E2F-binding site (5′-TTTCCGC-3′) and the mtκB1 construct contains a GGG to CTC substitution in the first κB site (GGGACTTTCC). The plasmid, mtκB2, was constructed by isolating the TaqI-BglII fragment from the HIV-CATΔκB construct which contains a GGG to TCT substitution in both NF-κB-binding sites. TheTaqI-BglII fragment spans from nucleotides −117 to +24 of the HIV-1 LTR. The CMV-neo-E2F-1 expression plasmid has been described previously (36Mudryj M. Hiebert S.W. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription using a highly purified reconstituted system was performed as described previously (40Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 41Segil N. Guermah M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The reactions contained purified general transcription factors, the co-activator fraction (USA) and flag-tagged TFIID. The HIV-1 LTR (pMHIV wt) and the adenovirus major late promoter (pMLΔ53)-driven constructs served as templates (42Kretzschmar M. Meisterernst M. Scheidereit C. Li G. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that a functional E2F-1 responsive element lies within the enhancer region of the HIV-1 LTR (31Kundu M. Srinivasan A. Pomerantz R.J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6940-6946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of E2F-1 to bind to this element in vitrowas demonstrated with gel retardation (GR) and methylation interference assays. GR analysis using recombinant GST-E2F-1 and a 37-base pair oligonucleotide probe containing the minimal responsive region (nucleotides −117 to −80 with respect to the transcription start site, +1) showed that E2F-1 is able to interact with this LTR sequence (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3). The E2F element from the DHFR promoter served as a positive control demonstrating the fidelity of the recombinant GST-E2F-1 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6). The GST component of the fusion protein had no binding activity for either the HIV-LTR or DHFR E2F elements (data not shown). Specificity of E2F-1 binding to the HIV-LTR was verified by competition analysis utilizing a variety of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. The wild type HIV-1 sequence containing two copies of the κB motif (2κB) and the DHFR E2F sequences competed for E2F-binding (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3, 8, and 9), while the oligonucleotide containing one copy of κB sequence (1κB) and its mutant variant (1κBmt) were less effective (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–5 and 6–7). The addition of an E2F-1 specific monoclonal antibody (KH95, Santa Cruz) to the binding reaction decreased the intensity of the major complex and induced the formation of a novel band with slower electrophoretic mobility, demonstrating the presence of E2F-1 in the original complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 10). Methylation interference assay using purified components revealed that GST-E2F-1 interacts with the guanine residues on both strands of the sequence (Fig. 1, C and D). Mutation of two critical guanine and cytosine residues of the coding strand completely abrogated the association of E2F-1 with the 2κB probe (Fig. 1 E, compare lanes 1 and 2to 3 and 4). Gel retardation analysis using various E2F-1 deletion constructs demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix domain of E2F-1 which is responsible for binding to the consensus E2F-1 site also mediates its interaction with the site in the HIV-1 LTR (data not shown). Since the binding site for E2F-1 partially overlaps the cis-elements recognized by the NF-κB subunits, we speculated that E2F-1 may prevent association of NF-κB with their targets in the LTR. Results from the gel retardation assay indicated that the addition of increasing amounts of E2F-1 to binding reactions containing p50 homodimers alters the electrophoretic mobility of the p50 complex and leads to the formation of novel bands (Fig. 2 A). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis where the individual bands from the GR assay were analyzed for their protein content by Western blot analysis indicated that the intermediate complexes contain both E2F-1 and p50 (Fig. 2 B). Novel complexes containing E2F-1, p50, and p65 were formed when E2F-1 and baculovirus-produced p50/p65 heterodimers were used in an identical assay (data not shown). The E2F-1 deletions containing amino acids 88–241 or amino acids 241–437 were used to further analyze the binding of E2F-1 and p50 in GR assay (Fig. 3 A). The appearance of distinct novel complexes containing both the DNA-binding domain of E2F-1 (88–241) and p50 (Fig. 3, A, lanes 1–5; B, lanes a-d) demonstrated that both proteins can bind simultaneously to the HIV-1 LTR. This suggests that the novel complexes seen in Fig.2 A may represent displacement of p50 homodimers by E2F-1. However, the E2F-1 mutant (241–437) that does not interact with DNA participates in a DNA-binding complex when incubated with p50 (Fig. 3,A, lanes 6–10; B, lanes e-g). This indicated that in addition to displacing p50, E2F-1 may interact directly with p50.Figure 3Formation of novel complexes containing E2F-mutants and p50 in vitro. A, gel retardation assay was performed using 250 ng of recombinant p50 and 250 or 500 ng of the indicated GST-E2F-1 fusion protein. The E2F-1 deletion mutants containing amino acids 88–241 and amino acids 241–437 were used because the former binds to the 2κB probe, while the latter does not.Lanes 1–10 represent a 2-h exposure of the film.Lanes *4 and *5 are identical to lanes 4 and 5, but are derived from an overnight exposure of the same gel. B, the complexes labeled a-g inpanel A were excised from the gel, soaked in SDS sample buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Membranes were incubated first with an anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody to detect the E2F-1 fusion proteins, and then with NR1157 to detect p50. The asterisks (*) indicate a degradation product of E2F-1 (amino acids 241–437).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation assay was performed to detect the presence of endogenous p50/E2F-1 heterodimers. Since deletion of the first 88 amino acids of E2F-1 did not alter its ability to repress the HIV-1 LTR when used in transient transfection assays (data not shown), nuclear extract was prepared from NIH3T3 cells that constitutively expressed detectable levels of a truncated version of human E2F-1 containing amino acids 88–437. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for E2F-1 resulted in the precipitation of p50 (Fig.4 A, lane 1) and E2F-1 (88–437) (data not shown). The control antibodies against PCNA and human cyclin A were unable to precipitate significant amounts of p50, demonstrating the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). The small amount of p50 in lane 2is likely to result from an indirect interaction, as the truncated ectopically expressed E2F-1 was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against PCNA (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a weak interaction between PCNA and p50. GST pull-down assays demonstrated that GST-E2F-1 binds directly to the baculovirus-produced p50 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and2), but interacts to a lesser extent when p50 is in the form of a complex with its cellular partner, p65 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). This suggests that the ratio between E2F-1, p50, and p65 may dictate the extent of their interactions and consequent modulation of transcription. GST pull-down assay using various E2F-1 deletions indicated that the C-terminal region of E2F-1 (amino acids 241–437) contains the p50-binding domain (Fig.4 C). Furthermore, since deletion of amino acids 1–88 reduced the amount of p50 pulled down (Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 2 and 3), a region within the first 88 amino acids may be an important contributor to the interaction between p50 and E2F-1 in vitro. However, it is important to note that this region does not appear to have a critical functional role with respect to HIV-1 transcription (as discussed above). To assess the relative contributions of NF-κB and E2F-1 to the observed regulatory eventin vivo, transient transfection studies were performed. Since treatment of cells with phorbol myristate acetate induces nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 and increases NF-κB-mediated transcription of HIV-1 promoter (32Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the effect of E2F-1 overexpression on HIV-1 transcription in phorbol myristate acetate-treated T-lymphocytic cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, E2F-1 was able to repress phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated levels of HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription. This observation confirms that E2F-1 suppresses κB-mediated activation. In the next series of experiments, several mutant reporter constructs containing nucleotide substitutions in the κB and E2F-binding sites were creat"

Most of the hK2 in seminal plasma forms an inactive complex with protein C inhibitor (PCI), a serpin secreted by seminal vesicles. As serpin inhibitors behave as suicide substrates that are cleaved early in the interaction with their target enzyme, and kallikreins have different sensitivities to serpin inhibitors, we prepared a series of substrates with intramolecularly quenched fluorescence based on the sequences of the serpin reactive loops. They were used to compare the substrate specificities of hK1 and hK2, which both have trypsin-like specificity, and thus differ from chymotrypsin-like hK3. The serpin-derived peptides behaved as kallikrein substrates whose sensitivities reflected the specificity of the parent inhibitory proteins. Substrates derived from PCI were the most sensitive for both hK1 and hK2 with specificity constants of about 107m−1. s−1. Those derived from antithrombin III and α2-antiplasmin were more specific for hK2 while a kallistatin-derived substrate was specifically cleaved by hK1. hK1 and hK2 substrates of greater specificity were obtained using chimeric peptides based on the sequence of serpin reactive loops.The main difference between specificities of hK1 and hK2 arise because hK2 can accommodate positively charged as well as small residues at P2 and requires an arginyl residue at P1. Thus, unlike hK1, hK2 does not cleave kininogen-derived substrates overlapping the region of N-terminal insertion of bradykinin in human kininogens.

The human kallikrein gene family contains three well-characterized members, hKLK1, hKLK2 and hKLK3 (1Berg T. Bradshaw R.A. Carretero O.A. Chao J. Chao L. Clements J.A. Fahnestock M. Fritz H. Gauthier F. MacDonald R.J. Margolius H.S. Morris B.J. Richards R.I. Scicli A.G. Agents Actions. 1992; 38: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar). These genes have been mapped to chromosome 19 (2Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. Suurmeijer L. Cleutjens C.B.J.M. Trapman J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and are translated to give rise to proteinases hK1, hK2, and hK3 respectively (1Berg T. Bradshaw R.A. Carretero O.A. Chao J.

The only human tissue kallikrein with an undisputed function is hK1, which releases vasoactive kinins from kininogens, but these proteinases may have several other functions, including the processing of hormone and other peptide precursors (reviewed in Refs. 3MacDonald R.J.

Its mRNA concentration in the prostate gland is 4–7 times lower than that of hK3 (9Chapdelaine P. Paradis G. Tremblay R. Dubé J.Y.

Its biological function remains unknown, but it has been suggested that it participates in the liquefaction of seminal coagulum (12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). Interest has recently focused on this protein since it appears to be a novel marker of prostate cancer and/or benign prostate adenoma (13Kumar A. Goel A.S. Hill T.M. Mikolajczyk S.D. Millar L.S.

Klee G.G. Young C.Y. Tindall D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but it has also been recently isolated as an active enzyme from seminal plasma (17Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Preliminary investigations of its substrate specificity have shown that it has a trypsin-like specificity, cleaving chromogenic substrates with Arg and Lys, but not Phe, at P1(17). This agrees with the presence of an aspartyl residue at position 187 (chymotrypsin numbering) in the substrate binding pocket (18Vihinen M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Bridon D.P. Dowell B.L. Urology. 1995; 45: 801-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). hK2 seems to be more closely related to hK1 than to hK3 enzymatically, though it shares 78% sequence homology with the latter and only 57% with hK1 (16Saedi M.S. Cass M.M. Goel A.S. Grauer L. Hogen K.L. Okaneya T. Griffin B.Y. Klee G.G. Young C.Y. Tindall D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A recent in vitrostudy showed that both hK3 and hK2 cleaved proteins forming the seminal plasma coagulum, but at different sites (12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). hK2, therefore, differs in specificity from hK3, which means that the proteinases may have different physiological targets. Whether hK2 has some enzymatic properties in common with hK1, especially the ability to release vasoactive kinins, is not known. The restricted specificity of kallikreins, resulting from their extended site of interaction with the substrate, argues against this. This study was done to further investigate the substrate specificity of kallikrein hK2, to distinguish its activity from that of hK1 and therefore identify its physiological function in the prostate, in seminal fluid, and at metastatic sites. As kallikreins are inhibited differently by natural inhibitors of the serpin family (17Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), that probably all behave as suicide substrates (20Patston P.A. Gettins P. Beechem J. Schapira M.

Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 503-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we used the peptide sequences of several serpin reactive loops to prepare specific, sensitive substrates capable of discriminating between the activities of these proteinases. The following materials were obtained from commercial sources: DEAE-Sephadex A50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.); SBTI (Boehringer Mannheim); 4-methylumbelliferone, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, (D)PFR-AMC, IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma); 4-methylumbelliferyl-4-guanidinobenzoate (Fluka Chemie AG); EDTA, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile (Merck); and TFA (Perkin-Elmer). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Kallikrein hK2 was purified from human seminal plasma after dissociation of the PCI-hK2 complex (17Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human kallikrein hK1 was purified to homogeneity from urine essentially as described (22Irie A. Takahashi S. Katayama Y. Ito K. Miyake Y. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 375-382PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6.5 liters of human urine were concentrated to 200 ml by passage through an Amicon PM10 membrane, dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, and applied to a DEAE A50 column (4 × 2.6 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 200 ml of equilibrium buffer and proteins were eluted with a 50–500 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions were assayed for their enzymatic activity toward (D)PFR-AMC in the presence of SBTI. Fractions resistant to SBTI inhibition were pooled and titrated with aprotinin (23Gutman N. Moreau T. Alhenc Gelas F. Baussant T. El Moujahed A. Akpona S. Gauthier F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The active site of hK2 was titrated using 4-methylumbelliferyl-4-guanidinobenzoate (24Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides were synthesized by classical solution methods; glutamine was the C-terminal residue in all peptides due to a requirement of synthesis strategy (25Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). All syntheses were performed with Fmoc methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu Co.). Intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrates were prepared as 2 mm stock solutions inN,N-dimethylformamide and diluted with activation buffer. Substrate purity was checked by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TofSpec-E, Micromass) and by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column eluted with a 10-min linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.075% TFA at 2.0 ml/min. Bz-VKKR-AMC and (D)PFF-AMC were synthesized as described previously (26Alves L.C. Almeida P.C. Franzoni L. Juliano J. Juliano M.A. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 92-96PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.02% IGEPAL (previously Nonidet P-40). Specificity constants (k cat/K m ) were determined for peptidyl-AMC and Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates under pseudo-first order conditions, using a substrate concentration far below theK m (27Elmoujahed A.

For AMC substrates, the spectrofluorometer excitation was 350 nm and emission was 460 nm, and experiments were carried out using 0.5 μm AMC for calibration. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 320 and 420 nm for experiments with intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrates. The system was standardized using Abz-FR-OH prepared by total tryptic hydrolysis of Abz-FR-pNA, and its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 410 nm, assuming ε410 nm = 8,800m−1 cm−1 forp-nitroanilide. Substrate concentrations of Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp were determined by measuring the absorbance at 365 nm, assuming ε365 nm = 17,300m−1 cm−1 for EDDnp.K m constants were measured using eight substrate concentrations (0.1–15 μm), the final concentrations of hK1 and hK2 were 10 pm to 10 nm, depending on the substrate used. Fluorogenic peptides (15–30 μm final) were incubated with purified kallikreins (0.75–1.50 nm final) at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% IGEPAL. Aliquots (200 μl) were removed at different times (5 min to 10 h depending on the peptide and enzyme used). The reaction was blocked by adding 4 μl of TFA, and the sample was fractionated on a C18 cartridge column (5 μm, 30 × 2.1 mm) eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%, v/v) in 0.075% TFA for 10 min at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min with simultaneous recordings at 3 wavelengths (220, 320, and 360 nm), which allowed the direct identification of EDDnp-containing peptides prior to N-terminal sequencing. All cleavage sites of significant importance identified by HPLC were determined by N-terminal sequencing for all substrates used in this study. The hydrolysis products of the bradykinin-containing Abz-peptide were separated on an Aquapore RP 300 cartridge column (7 μm, 100 × 2.1 mm), using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5–25 min, 0–60% acetonitrile, v/v) in 0.075% TFA for 35 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Cleavage sites were identified by N-terminal sequencing. The amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer with the chemicals and program recommended by the manufacturer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified using an on-line model 120A PTH analyzer. Preliminary attempts to identify the biological targets of hK2 have shown that coagulum-forming proteins, including semenogelins and fibronectin, are cleaved at Arg sites by hK2 and at Tyr sites by hK3in vitro (12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet clear, however, whether hK2 participates in sperm liquefaction and, if so, the extent to which it cleaves coagulum-forming proteins. hK2 is present in seminal plasma mainly as a tight complex with protein C inhibitor (11Deperthes D. Chapdelaine P. Tremblay R.R. Brunet C. Berton J. Hébert J. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whose concentration in seminal plasma is more than 40 times that in the blood plasma (28España F. Gilabert J. Estelles A. Romeu A. Aznar J. Cabo A. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition of hK2 in seminal plasma roughly follows that of semenogelin proteolysis after ejaculation (12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). PCI also inhibits human kallikreins hK3 and hK1, forming SDS-stable complexes (29Christensson A. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30España F. Fink E. Sanchez-Cuenca J. Gilabert J. Estellés A. Witzgall K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This inhibitor belongs to the serpin family and interacts with target proteinases to form enzymatically inactive, tight-binding complexes. This involves the cleavage of the reactive loop and insertion of the cleaved loop into a β-sheet structure of the protein, leading to the trapping of the proteinase as a stable complex (21Engh R.A. Huber R. Bode W. Schulze A.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 503-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). But the reactive loop mobility is not required for enzyme recognition, so that its blocking by mutation or with synthetic loop peptides converts the inhibitor into a substrate (31Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, synthetic peptides derived from the variable loop structure of individual serpin inhibitors are potential substrates for serine proteinases that are inhibited by serpins. A prerequisite, however, is that the conformation of the loop within the native protein is not essential for cleavage. Because of the flexibility of the reactive loop in the free inhibitor, it is unlikely that any structural constraint is required for interaction and cleavage by the proteinase. The differences in the sequences of the reactive loops in serpin family members (Table I) indicate that it should be possible to develop specific substrates for individual serine proteinases.Table IAlignment of the reactive-centre loop sequences of human serpinsSerpinP5P4P3P2P1P′1P′2P′3P′4P′5PCIIFTFRSARLNα1-PiEAIPMSIPPEACTKITLLSALVEATIIIVIAGRSLNPNα2-APAMSRMSLSSFKallistatinAIKFFSAQTNThe scissile bond is at P1-P′1 site.

Sanchez-Cuenca J. Gilabert J. Estellés A. Witzgall K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptide substrates of increasing length reproducing the sequence of human PCI from P4 to P′3, with respect to the putative cleavage site in the reactive loop, were first synthesized and assayed as substrates of hK1 and hK2. Kinetic constants were measured by varying the substrate concentration and calculating kinetic parameters by linear regression analysis, ork cat/K m ratios were determined from direct measurements under pseudo-first order conditions. This method avoids the intermolecular quenching that increases with peptide length and concentration. In keeping with the wide inhibition spectrum of PCI, PCI-derived peptides were hydrolyzed by the two human proteinases with similar specificity constants (TableII). However, the K m and k cat values for hK1 were significantly lower than those for hK2, suggesting that substrate binding and cleavage by the two kallikreins differ, probably because of the extended binding site of interaction with the substrate (32Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Gauthier F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Del Nery E. Chagas J.R. Juliano M.A. Prado E.S. Juliano L. Biochem.

But both enzymes cleaved all PCI-derived peptides at a single site at the expected R-S bond as illustrated in Fig. 1.Table IIKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis by hK1 and hK2 of fluorogenic peptides derived from reactive-center loop of human serpinsSerpinSubstratehK1hK2K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 2-aPseudo-first order.K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 2-aPseudo-first order.μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1PCIAbz-FRSARQ-EDDnp0.4 ± 0.11.70 ± 0.144,2509,0008.5 ± 2.024.30 ± 3.652,85010,500PCIAbz-TFRSARQ-EDDnp0.4 ± 0.16.40 ± 0.5016,00016,0005.3 ± 2.141.00 ± 3.007,75020,000PCIAbz-FTFRSARQ-EDDnp0.3 ± 0.13.20 ± 0.3810,65011,5001.1 ± 0.217.60 ± 1.5816,00010,900KallistatinAbz-AIKFFSAQ-EDDnp1.790.543042-bFrom reference (35).440ND2-cND, not determined.NDND4ATIIIAbz-VIAGRSLNPNQ-EDDnpNSH2-dNSH, no significant hydrolysis.NSHNSHNSHNDNDND90α2-APAbz-AMSRMSLSSFSVNRQ-EDDnpNDNDND15NDNDND108Kallistatin-modifiedAbz-AIKFFSRQ-EDDnp0.6 ± 0.22.00 ± 0.203,3502,900NDNDND30PCI-modifiedAbz-TFFSARQ-EDDnpNDNDND1,700NDNDNDNSHValues are means ± S.D.2-a Pseudo-first order.2-b From reference (35Zhou G.X.

Enzymol. 1981; 80: 466-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kallistatin is the more specific and inhibits hK1 much faster than does α1-Pi, but its action is blocked by heparin (36Chen L.M. Chao L. Mayfield R.K. Chao J. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reactive loop of kallistatin is cleaved after an FF pair (35Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an unexpected feature that has been recently exploited to develop new, sensitive hK1 substrates (37Pimenta D.C. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Whether hK2 is inhibited by kallistatin and cleaves after the FF pair is not known. The tissue kallikrein substrates (D)PFR-AMC and (D)PFF-AMC were assayed with hK1 and hK2, but only (D)PFR-AMC was cleaved by both enzymes (Table IV). This suggests that hK2 does not cleave the kallistatin reactive loop, at least at the FF site, and therefore that this serpin does not inhibit hK2. A kallistatin-derived peptide could therefore discriminate between hK1 and hK2 activities. Such a substrate including the FF pair (Abz-AIKFFSAQ-EDDnp) was synthesized and assayed with both enzymes. It was rapidly cleaved by hK1 with a specificity constant of about 105m−1 s−1, but was resistant to hydrolysis by hK2 (Table II). hK1 cleaved at the expected FF-S site, as shown by N-terminal sequencing of the EDDnp-containing cleavage product obtained from reverse phase HPLC (data not shown).Table IVKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis by hK1 and hK2 of fluorogenic peptides derived from the N and C-terminal insertion sequences of human bradykininSubstratehK1hK2K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 4-aPseudo-first order.K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 4-aPseudo-first order.μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1Ahx-FR-AMC0.5 ± 0.11.53 ± 0.113,0601,3902.8 ± 1.50.21 ± 0.0275100(D)PFR-AMC0.8 ± 0.10.70 ± 0.038751,0303.6 ± 0.90.31 ± 0.0486120(D)PFF-AMC7012.51794-bFrom reference (35).330NSH4-cNSH, no significant hydrolysis.NSHNSHNSHAbz-FRSSRQ-EDDnp1.3 ± 0.31.32 ± 0.071,0151,750ND4-dND, not determined.NDND1,250Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnpNDNDND1,350NSH 4-cNSH, no significant hydrolysis.NSHNSHNSHValues are means ± S.D.4-a Pseudo-first order.4-b From reference (35Zhou G.X.

Open table in a new tab Values are means ± S.D. Unlike hK1, hK2 is inhibited by several other serpin inhibitors, including ATIII and α2-AP (17Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We used the sequences of the reactive loops of these serpin inhibitors to develop hK2 substrates that are resistant to hK1 hydrolysis. They were assayed under similar conditions with identical amounts of active-site titrated enzymes. Results were in accordance with the inhibitory properties of the serpin inhibitors. Peptide substrates derived from ATIII and α2-AP were cleaved by hK2 but not, or far slower, by hK1, possibly because of the presence of small or charged residues at P2 (Table II). The ATIII-derived peptide was cleaved at the GR-S bond by hK2 which corresponds to the sensitive bond in the protein. But the α2-AP-derived peptide was cleaved at the SR-M bond, which flanks the RM-S sensitive bond in the serpin. The value of the specificity constant for this substrate was altered however, due to additional cleavage by hK2 at the NR-Q bond, which further demonstrates the P1/Arg specificity of this kallikrein. This cleavage appeared because of the prolonged incubation that was necessary to measure kinetic data. However, the R-Q bond is not present in α2-AP or any other serpin reactive loop but was introduced here by the accelerated procedure of multi-synthesis which uses Q-EDDnp as starting material (25Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The absence of an arginyl residue from α1-Piand ACT-derived sequences may explain why hK2 does not cleave these substrates (not shown). Unlike α1-Pi however, ACT binds to hK2 in vitro (17Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dubé J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It could be that hK2 cleaves the ACT reactive loop at a site remote from L-S chymotrypsin cleavage site, which is not present in the peptide. Cleavage at several sites within the α1-Pi reactive loop has already been demonstrated (38Komiyama T. Gron H. Pemberton P.A. Salvesen G.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Though specific for hK1, the kallistatin-derived substrate is less well hydrolyzed by this proteinase than those derived from the PCI reactive loop. We attempted to improve its sensitivity by changing the P′2 Ala to Arg (Abz-AIKFFSRQ-EDDnp), as the presence of Arg at P′2 or P′3 greatly improves hydrolysis by hK1 (39Chagas J.R. Portaro F.C. Hirata I.Y. Almeida P.C. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Prado E.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cleavage occurred at the same site as before, but the specificity constant was significantly greater. However, this chimeric substrate was also cleaved to some extent by hK2 although cleavage was at the R-Q bond, as for the α2-AP-derived peptide (Table II). As the Phe at P1 in the kallistatin-derived peptide is mainly responsible for the limited specificity of hK1, we replaced the P1 Arg with Phe in the sensitive PCI-derived substrate Abz-TFRSARQ-EDDnp. The resulting substrate, Abz-TFFSARQ-EDDnp, was completely resistant to hK2 hydrolysis but remained an excellent hK1 substrate, though of slightly lower sensitivity. It thus allowed complete discrimination between the two kallikreins (Table II). Another characteristic of hK1, which is shared by its mammalian homologues having kininogenase properties, is that it prefers a large hydrophobic residue at P2 for substrate recognition and cleavage (40Fiedler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This holds true for serpin inhibitors of hK1 that all have a phenylalanyl residue at P2. Unlike hK1, hK2 cleaves ATIII and α2-AP-derived peptides at sites having a small residue at P2 (Table II). Previous experiments carried out on several members of the rat tissue kallikrein family showed that some of them, which also accommodated small, uncharged residues at P2, cleaved substrates with positively charged residues at that position (41Moreau T. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bouhnik J. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10045-10051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Shori D. Proctor G.B. Chao J. Chan K.-M. Garrett J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 45: 1209-1217Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We measured the hydrolysis of a similar substrate, Bz-VKKR-AMC, by hK1 and hK2. The substrate was totally resistant to hK1, but was readily cleaved by hK2 (TableIII). The peptide sequence was therefore used as the P fragment of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrate having the P′ sequence of the PCI-derived substrates to enhance the sensitivity and specificity to hK2. The resulting chimeric sequence, Abz-VKKRSARQ-EDDnp, was hydrolyzed by hK2 at the R-S site with a k cat/K m about 50 times greater than that for the AMC derivative (Table III). However, hK1 also cleaved this substrate, mainly at the K-K site, in keeping with its P2 specificity and secondarily at the R-Q site. We removed the Val at P2 in this substrate to reduce cleavage by hK1. Abz-KKRSARQ-EDDnp was hydrolyzed more slowly by hK1 but dramatically faster by hK2, so that it is the most sensitive substrate for hK2 (Table III).Table IIIKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptides by hK1 and hK2SubstratehK1hK2K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 3-aPseudo-first order.K mk catk cat/K mk cat/K m 3-aPseudo-first order.μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1μms −1mm −1 s −1mm −1 s −1Bz-VKKR-AMCNSH3-bNSH, no significant hydrolysis.NSHNSHNSH0.5 ± 0.10.08 ± 0.01160150Abz-VKKRSARQ-EDDnp1.5 ± 0.20.70 ± 0.064701,8002.3 ± 0.514.30 ± 1.206,2007,250Abz-KKRSARQ-EDDnp1.1 ± 0.20.20 ± 0.021802101.2 ± 0.233.00 ± 1.9827,50050,000Values are means ± S.D.3-a Pseudo-first order.3-b NSH, no significant hydrolysis. Open table in a new tab Values are means ± S.D. All cleavages of serpin-derived substrates by hK2 were at a P1/Arg site (Table II). In contrast, hK1 hydrolyzes kallistatin and kallistatin-derived substrates at a P1/Phe site and also cleaves kininogens at a P1/Met site to release Lys-bradykinin. The apparent P1/Arg restricted specificity of hK2 suggests that this protease does not release a vasoactive kinin from its precursors, unless cleavage occurs at a different site. This could happen because the P2 specificity of hK2 is broader than that of hK1. We investigated this possibility by measuring the activities of hK1 and hK2 under similar experimental conditions using fluorogenic substrates that reproduced the sequences at both ends of the bradykinin moiety in human kininogens (TableIV) and on a peptide spanning the complete bradykinin sequence with N- and C-terminal extensions (Abz-LGMISLMKRPPGFSPFRSSRI-NH2) (33Del Nery E. Chagas J.R. Juliano M.A. Prado E.S. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since the latter peptide was too long for efficient quenching of the intramolecular fluorescence, it was labeled only N-terminally with Abz, and cleavage products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and protein sequencing (Fig. 2). Both proteinases cleaved at the C-terminal cleavage site of bradykinin (R-S site), generating the Abz-LGMISLMKRPPGFSPFR peptide. This peptide was further processed by hK1 (but not by hK2) to generate Lys-bradykinin after cleavage at the M-K bond (Fig. 2). The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrate (Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnp) was specifically cleaved by hK1 at the same M-K bond (Table IV). These results suggest that hK2 has no kininogenase properties of biological relevance. The kinetic approach used here shows that the specificity of hK2 differs significantly from that of kallikrein hK1, and therefore that it has different biological targets. But these targets remain to be identified. The hK2 concentration in seminal plasma is estimated at 0.1 μm, 2D. Deperthes and J-Y. Dubé, unpublished results. much like that of prostasin (43Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but at least 100 times lower than that of hK3/prostate-specific antigen (44Wang M.C. Valenzuela L.A. Murphy G.P. Chu T.M. Invest. Urol. 1979; 17: 159-163PubMed Google Scholar). But hK2 is rapidly bound by PCI in seminal plasma, so that almost no free, active enzyme is present in this fluid. The rate at which hK2 is inhibited by PCI is roughly the same as that of the degradation of the coagulum-forming proteins, whereas considerable hK3 remains free after protein degradation (12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). Though hK2 hydrolyzes semenogelins and fibronectin in vitro(12Deperthes D. Frenette G. Brillard-Bourdet M. Bourgeois L. Gauthier F. Tremblay R.R. Dubé J.Y. J. Androl. 1996; 17: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar), it is not known whether the process also ocurs in vivo, where the concentration of hK3 is far higher. If hK2 participates in sperm liquefaction or any other process generating biologically active peptide from coagulum-forming proteins, it would be a unique example of the regulation of proteolytic activity by the simultaneous delivery of appropriate concentrations of substrate and inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2051695848,"Osteocalcin (OC) is a matrix calcium-binding protein expressed in osteoblasts and odontoblasts undergoing mineralization. OC expression is up-regulated in part by signals initiated by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), cyclic AMP or forskolin (FSK), and calcitriol via defined elements and DNA-protein interactions in the OC promoter. We identified the OC gene as a target for transcriptional suppression by Msx2, a homeodomain transcription factor that controls ossification in the developing skull. In this study, we examine the effects of Msx2 expression on OC promoter activation (luciferase reporter) by FGF2/FSK and calcitriol in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Expression of Msx2 decreases basal activity of the 1-kilobase (−1050 to +32) rat OC promoter by 80%; however, the promoter is still inducible 3-fold by calcitriol. By contrast, OC promoter induction by FGF2/FSK is completely abrogated by Msx2. Because intrinsic Msx2 DNA binding activity is not required for the Msx2 suppressor function, we assessed whether Msx2 represses OC activation by regulating DNA-protein interactions at the FGF2 response element (OCFRE) and compared these interactions with those occurring at the calcitriol response element (VDRE). Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with FGF2/FSK or calcitriol up-regulates specific DNA-protein interactions at the OCFRE or VDRE, respectively, as detected by gel shift assay. Preincubation of crude nuclear extracts with recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Msx2 dose-dependently inhibits OCFRE DNA binding activity, whereas GST has no effect. Msx2 itself does not bind the OCFRE. Residues 132–148 required for Msx2 core suppressor function in transfection assays are also required to inhibit OCFRE DNA binding activity. By contrast, GST-Msx2 has no effect on calcitriol-regulated DNA-protein interactions at the VDRE. Using gel shift as an assay, the OCFRE DNA-binding protein OCFREB was purified to about 50% homogeneity from MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Recombinant Msx2 inhibits purified OCFREB DNA binding activity, whereas the Msx2 variant lacking residues 132–148 is inactive. Thus, Msx2 abrogates up-regulation of the OC promoter by FGF2/FSK in part by inhibiting OCFREB binding to the OCFRE."

Many such compounds are widespread environmental contaminants, produce similar patterns of toxicity, and appear to share the same receptor-mediated mechanism of action. Because TCDD is the most potent, it has been studied much more extensively than other compounds. TCDD is generated during combustion processes, enters the atmosphere, contaminates the food chain, and persists in the environment, because it is resistant to biological degradation. In animals, TCDD elicits numerous adaptive and/or adverse effects, including enzyme induction, epithelial hyperplasia, teratogenesis, tumor promotion, liver toxicity, thymic atrophy, and immunosuppression. In humans, the most well documented adverse response to TCDD is chloracne; there is also concern that TCDD produces cancer, birth defects, and immunotoxicity (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 2Safe S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 371-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holsapple M.P. Snyder N.K. Wood S.C. Morris D.L. Toxicology. 1991; 69: 219-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of TCDD action probably involves alterations in gene expression, which are mediated by the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a cytoplasmic, basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds TCDD saturably and with high affinity, thereby activating signaling pathways that modulate gene expression (4Whitlock Jr., J.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).The best understood AhR-regulated response to TCDD is the induction ofCYP1A1 gene transcription (5Whitlock Jr., J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H.P. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). CYP1A1 encodes the microsomal enzyme cytochrome P4501A1, which catalyzes the oxygenation of lipophilic aromatic hydrocarbons during their metabolic processing to water-soluble derivatives (6Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917PubMed Google Scholar). TCDD binds to AhR in the cytoplasm; subsequently, the liganded AhR enters the nucleus and heterodimerizes with a second basic helix-loop-helix protein known as the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt). The AhR/Arnt heterodimer functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor; it binds to a specific DNA sequence, termed a xenobiotic-responsive element, within an enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene (7Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 8Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). This protein-DNA interaction is associated with disruption of nucleosomes, occupancy of the CYP1A1 promoter by transcription factors, and activation of gene expression (9Okino S.T. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell.

In comparison with activation of transcription, we know relatively little about the down-regulation of gene expression by TCDD.One way to increase our understanding of TCDD action is to analyze additional TCDD-responsive genes. To address this issue experimentally, we used differential display, a versatile method that can identify both up- and down-regulated genes (12Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar, 13Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968PubMed Google Scholar). We studied mouse hepatoma cells, because the availability of AhR-defective and Arnt-defective mutants permits both genetic and biochemical analyses of the regulatory mechanism (14Miller A.G. Israel D. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hankinson O. Somat. Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 497-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we show that TCDD down-regulates the expression of a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene, which we designate as MHC Q1 b , and we examine the mechanism of the down-regulation.DISCUSSIONTo generate a broader perspective on the biological effects of TCDD and to uncover novel mechanistic aspects of TCDD action, we used differential display to find new dioxin-responsive genes in mouse hepatoma cells. We isolated full-length cDNA for the TCDD-responsive MHC Q1 b gene, and we analyzed the mechanism of its down-regulation.Sequence analyses of MHC Q1 b cDNA clones reveal high homology to the MHC Q1 k gene. The analyses also imply the existence of several splicing variants. However, none of the MHC Q1 b clones is spliced as predicted for MHCQ1 k (22Watts S. Davis A.C. Gaut B. Wheeler C. Hill L. Goodenow R.S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1749-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Three of seven clones are spliced from exon 5 to exon 8, which deletes the protein's cytoplasmic domain. Two clones contain intron 5, which produces an abnormal shortening of the cytoplasmic domain. Multiple spliced transcripts have been observed in studies of other nonclassical class I MHC mRNAs (27Waneck G.L. Sherman D.H. Calvin S. Allen H. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1358-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Cheroutre H. Kronenberg M. Brorson K. Hunt III, S.W. Eghtesday P. Hood L. Nickerson D.A. J.

A. 1988; 85: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our observations extend these previous findings and suggest that multiple mRNA splicing may be common in nonclassical class I MHC gene expression.Classical class I MHC proteins, which are encoded by the H-2 K, D, and L regions of mouse chromosome 17 (see Ref. 40Kaliyaperumal A. Falchetto R. Cox A. Dick II, R. Shabanowiz J. Chien Y. Matis L. Hunt D.F. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2379-2386PubMed Google Scholar and references therein) present foreign peptides primarily to cytotoxic T cells, which lyse the cells that harbor the antigen (such as a viral peptide). In contrast, the function of nonclassical class I MHC proteins, which are encoded by the Q and T regions, is not well understood; these proteins may have diverse functions. For example, the product of the MHC Q10gene is secreted (30Kress M. Cosman D. Khoury G. Jay G. Cell. 1983; 34: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Devilin J.J. Lew A.M. Flavell R.A. Coligan J.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the product of the MHC Q5gene is cytoplasmic (32Reyes-Engel A. Le Roy E. Diegues J.L. Fernendez N. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1993; 23: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, MHC Q10 andQ5 are unlikely to be involved in antigen presentation to cells of the immune system. On the other hand, the nonclassical class I MHC T10 and T22 gene products may participate in presenting antigen to T cells with γδ receptors (33Schild H. Mavaddat N. Litzenberger C. Ehrich E.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11396-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal that each MHC Q1 b cDNA encodes the α3 domain and the transmembrane domain; these observations imply that the MHC Q1 b gene product could interact with β2-microglobulin and could be a membrane protein. Therefore, we envision that MHC Q1 b could function in antigen presentation; however, this hypothesis remains to be tested. We used RT-PCR to analyze MHC Q1 b gene expression in tissues, and we detected Q1 b mRNA in mouse liver, testis, kidney, lung, and spleen. 2L. Dong, Q. Ma, and J. P. Whitlock, Jr., unpublished observations. Therefore, MHCQ1 b might function in numerous tissues.TCDD elicits a variety of immunological effects in experimental animals, including suppression of both T cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity (3Holsapple M.P. Snyder N.K. Wood S.C. Morris D.L. Toxicology. 1991; 69: 219-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of a class I MHC gene(s) represents a direct mechanism by which TCDD could suppress T cell-mediated immunity, because it might adversely affect antigen presentation. For example, mice exposed to TCDD exhibit enhanced susceptibility to viral infection (35Thigpin J.E. Faith R.E. McConnell E.E. Moore J.A. Infect. Immun. 1975; 12: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that down-regulation of MHC gene expression by TCDD could hinder the presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic T cells, thereby enhancing survival of the virus and increasing the susceptibility of the host to its adverse effects.The mechanism by which TCDD down-regulates gene expression has not been studied in detail. Our findings indicate that down-regulation of MHCQ1 b mRNA is an AhR/Arnt-mediated response and occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We can envision several possible mechanisms for transcriptional down-regulation: 1) the AhR/Arnt heterodimer could interact directly with a silencer-like element(s) (36Murphy C. Nikodem D. Howcroft K. Weissman J.D. Singer D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30992-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on the MHC Q1 b gene; 2) AhR/Arnt could disrupt the DNA binding of a positive regulatory factor(s) by interacting at an overlapping AhR/Arnt recognition sequence (37Krishnan V. Porter W. Santostefano M. Wang X. Safe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); 3) AhR/Arnt could interact directly with another transcription factor(s), thereby squelching constitutive expression of MHC Q1 b ; 4) AhR/Arnt could induce a gene whose product down-regulates MHC Q1 b transcription (38Lee D.C. Barlow K.D. Gaido K.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The identification of MHC Q1 b transcriptional regulatory elements and analyses of protein-DNA interactions at these elements may enable us to test these hypotheses in the future.Our findings imply that post-transcriptional regulation must be important in TCDD-induced down-regulation of MHC Q1 b gene expression, because MHC Q1 b mRNA is stable in the absence of ongoing RNA synthesis. We note that the 3′-untranslated region of MHC Q1 b contains four adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AUREs), AUUUA. Such elements can function as mRNA-destabilizing signals by an unknown mechanism (39Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the AUREs destabilize MHCQ1 b mRNA in TCDD-treated cells. Our observations also suggest that destabilization of MHC Q1 b mRNA is a secondary response to TCDD. Therefore, as a working hypothesis, we envision that TCDD induces the transcription of a gene whose product destabilizes MHC Q1 b mRNA by recognizing its AUREs. Such post-transcriptional control is a novel aspect of TCDD action; we hypothesize that it may affect the expression of additional TCDD-responsive genes, thereby contributing to the diversity of dioxin's biological effects. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 1The abbreviations used are: TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AhR, aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; Arnt, Ah receptor nuclear translocator; AURE, adenylate-uridylate-rich element; DIG, digoxigenin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AhR, aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; Arnt, Ah receptor nuclear translocator; AURE, adenylate-uridylate-rich element; DIG, digoxigenin; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). represents the prototype for a class of structurally related halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and biphenyls.

On the other hand, the nonclassical class I MHC T10 and T22 gene products may participate in presenting antigen to T cells with γδ receptors (33Schild H. Mavaddat N. Litzenberger C. Ehrich E.W.

Our findings reveal that each MHC Q1 b cDNA encodes the α3 domain and the transmembrane domain; these observations imply that the MHC Q1 b gene product could interact with β2-microglobulin and could be a membrane protein. Therefore, we envision that MHC Q1 b could function in antigen presentation; however, this hypothesis remains to be tested. We used RT-PCR to analyze MHC Q1 b gene expression in tissues, and we detected Q1 b mRNA in mouse liver, testis, kidney, lung, and spleen. 2L. Dong, Q. Ma, and J. P. Whitlock, Jr., unpublished observations. Therefore, MHCQ1 b might function in numerous tissues. TCDD elicits a variety of immunological effects in experimental animals, including suppression of both T cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity (3Holsapple M.P. Snyder N.K. Wood S.C. Morris D.L. Toxicology. 1991; 69: 219-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of a class I MHC gene(s) represents a direct mechanism by which TCDD could suppress T cell-mediated immunity, because it might adversely affect antigen presentation. For example, mice exposed to TCDD exhibit enhanced susceptibility to viral infection (35Thigpin J.E. Faith R.E. McConnell E.E. Moore J.A. Infect. Immun. 1975; 12: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that down-regulation of MHC gene expression by TCDD could hinder the presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic T cells, thereby enhancing survival of the virus and increasing the susceptibility of the host to its adverse effects. The mechanism by which TCDD down-regulates gene expression has not been studied in detail. Our findings indicate that down-regulation of MHCQ1 b mRNA is an AhR/Arnt-mediated response and occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We can envision several possible mechanisms for transcriptional down-regulation: 1) the AhR/Arnt heterodimer could interact directly with a silencer-like element(s) (36Murphy C. Nikodem D. Howcroft K. Weissman J.D. Singer D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30992-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) on the MHC Q1 b gene; 2) AhR/Arnt could disrupt the DNA binding of a positive regulatory factor(s) by interacting at an overlapping AhR/Arnt recognition sequence (37Krishnan V. Porter W. Santostefano M. Wang X. Safe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); 3) AhR/Arnt could interact directly with another transcription factor(s), thereby squelching constitutive expression of MHC Q1 b ; 4) AhR/Arnt could induce a gene whose product down-regulates MHC Q1 b transcription (38Lee D.C. Barlow K.D. Gaido K.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The identification of MHC Q1 b transcriptional regulatory elements and analyses of protein-DNA interactions at these elements may enable us to test these hypotheses in the future. Our findings imply that post-transcriptional regulation must be important in TCDD-induced down-regulation of MHC Q1 b gene expression, because MHC Q1 b mRNA is stable in the absence of ongoing RNA synthesis. We note that the 3′-untranslated region of MHC Q1 b contains four adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (AUREs), AUUUA. Such elements can function as mRNA-destabilizing signals by an unknown mechanism (39Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the AUREs destabilize MHCQ1 b mRNA in TCDD-treated cells. Our observations also suggest that destabilization of MHC Q1 b mRNA is a secondary response to TCDD. Therefore, as a working hypothesis, we envision that TCDD induces the transcription of a gene whose product destabilizes MHC Q1 b mRNA by recognizing its AUREs. Such post-transcriptional control is a novel aspect of TCDD action; we hypothesize that it may affect the expression of additional TCDD-responsive genes, thereby contributing to the diversity of dioxin's biological effects.

https://openalex.org/W2047663500,"A microsomal GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase activity from human bronchial mucosa, able to transfer a sulfate group from adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate onto methyl-N-acetylglucosaminides or terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues of carbohydrate chains from human respiratory mucins, has been characterized. The reaction products containing a terminal HO3S-6GlcNAc were identified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography. Using methyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide as a substrate, the optimal activity was obtained with 0.1% Triton X-100, 30 mm NaF, 20 mm Mn2+, 5 mm AMP in a 30 mm MOPS (3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid) buffer at pH 6.7. The apparent K m values for adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate and methyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide were observed at 9.1 × 10−6m and 0.54 × 10−3m, respectively. The enzyme had more affinity for carbohydrate chains with a terminal GlcNAc residue than for methyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide; it was unable to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of the GlcNAc residue contained in a terminal Galβ1–4GlcNAc sequence. However, oligosaccharides with a nonreducing terminal HO3S-6GlcNAc were substrates for a β1–4 galactosyltransferase from human bronchial mucosa. These data point out that GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase must act before β1–4 galactosylation in mucin-type oligosaccharide biosynthesis.

Human respiratory epithelium is covered by a gelatinous layer of mucus, situated on the top of the cilia, and continuously moved toward the pharynx where it is swallowed (1Lamblin G. Lhermitte M. Klein A. Houdret N. Scharfman A. Ramphal R. Roussel P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: S19-S24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mucins are the main components of the respiratory mucus and are responsible to a large extent for the characteristic rheological properties of respiratory mucus, necessary for the efficiency of the mucociliary system. Human respiratory mucins consist of a broad family of polydisperse and high molecular mass glycoproteins synthesized by the respiratory mucosa. The peptide diversity stems from the expression of several genes (2Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 3Porchet N. Pigny P. Buisine M.P. Debailleul V. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, this mucin diversity is increased widely by post-translational phenomena, mostly O-glycosylation but also sulfation, which are responsible for 70–80% of the mass of the mucin molecule. These phenomena lead to a remarkable diversity of carbohydrate chains (4Roussel P. Lamblin G. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins and Disease. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 351-393Google Scholar) allowing the recognition of inhaled microorganisms (for review, see Ref. 5Roussel P. Lamblin G. Ramphal R. Chrétien J. Dussier D. Environmental Impact on the Airways, from Injury to Repair. 93. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 437-469Google Scholar) which are then eliminated by the activity of the mucociliary system. Thus mucins play an essential role in the defense of the respiratory mucosa. Any change in the glycosylation or sulfation of mucins may affect the rheological properties of respiratory mucus and the efficiency of the mucociliary system, leading to bronchial obstruction as observed in cystic fibrosis (CF). 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HPAEC, high performance anion-exchange chromatography; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sLex, sialyl Lewis x; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; HPAEC, high performance anion-exchange chromatography; PAPS, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sLex, sialyl Lewis x; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. CF, a general exocrinopathy, is the most common severe genetic disease among Caucasians. In its most typical form, the severity of CF is the result of chronic lung infection and mucus hypersecretion. This infection is very peculiar and characterized by the predominance ofStaphylococcus aureus in early life and, later on, ofPseudomonas aeruginosa which is almost impossible to eradicate and is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality of the disease (6Høiby N. Chest. 1988; 94: 97S-103SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (7Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelckzak Z. Zielenski J.

ΔF508 deletion is the most frequent mutation (about 70% of the CF chromosomes) and leads to a misfolding of CFTR which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded (12Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This mislocation of mutated CFTR may have consequences for other cell compartments. In CF cells, a defect in the acidification of endosomes, prelysosomes, ortrans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network has been observed and could be responsible for abnormal glycosylation and sulfation processes (13Barasch J. Kiss B. Prince A. Saiman L. Gruenert D. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 14Barasch J. Al-Awqati Q. J.

Mucin sulfation affords a strong negative charge to carbohydrate chains influencing the viscoelastic properties of bronchial mucus. Moreover, sulfated carbohydrate sequences, identical to those found in respiratory mucins, have been shown to be specific ligands for selectins (22Sanders W.J. Katsumoto T.R. Bertzzi C.R. Rosen S.D.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9283-9288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The development of a protocol of purification based mainly on high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) has allowed the structural determination of sulfated carbohydrate chains from CF and non-CF mucins in which sulfation occurs either on the C-3 of a terminal galactose (Gal) residue or on the C-6 of anN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue (25Lo-Guidice J.M.

These data suggest that sulfation of respiratory mucins involves at least two sulfotransferases. Lo-Guidice et al. (26Lo-Guidice J.M. Perini J.M. Lafitte J.J. Ducourouble M.P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol.

In this paper we report the characterization of a microsomal GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase activity from human bronchial mucosa. This enzyme is able to transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to a terminal GlcNAc residue contained in a carbohydrate chain. The GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation is inhibited by the prior β1–4 galactosylation of the GlcNAc residue, indicating that 6-O-sulfation has to precede galactosylation during biosynthesis of sulfated mucin-type oligosaccharides. The main difference in the enzymatic properties of the 3-O-Gal- and the 6-O-GlcNAc-sulfotransferase is their optimum pH, 6.1 and 6.7, respectively. Tissues collected in macroscopically healthy areas of the bronchial tree from patients undergoing surgery for bronchial carcinoma were placed in Leibovitz L15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transported immediately on ice to the laboratory and processed for mucosa isolation. Mucosae (2–3 cm2) were cut into 1-mm2 pieces, and homogenates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mm potassium chloride, 250 mmsaccharose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, using a glass-Teflon homogenizer (1,400 rpm, five strokes). The mixture obtained was submitted to 16,000 ×g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were ultracentrifuged further at 180,000 ×g for 1 h at 10 °C. The resulting pellet containing microsomal fractions was stored at −80 °C until used (26Lo-Guidice J.M. Perini J.M. Lafitte J.J. Ducourouble M.P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27544-27550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide-alditols of respiratory mucins from a patient suffering from CF were released by alkaline borohydride treatment of mucin glycopeptides, then fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on an AG 1-X2 column (Bio-Rad) and then by gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P4 column (Bio-Rad) according to Lamblin et al.

Fraction IIIc1 containing mono- or disialyloligosaccharide-alditols was fractionated by HPAEC on a CarboPac PA-100 column (Dionex), and the structures of the main oligosaccharide-alditols were determined by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in combination with fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (25Lo-Guidice J.M.

The different compounds also used for acceptor specificity studies were from the following sources: GlcNAcα1-O-Met, GlcNAcβ1-O-Met, GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met were from Sigma; NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc-O-Met (α2–3sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine-O-Met), and NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc-O-Met (sialyl-Lewis x-O-Met or sLex-O-Met) were from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. We also used three oligosaccharide-alditols OS1, OS2, and OS3, whose structures are described in Table I. The oligosaccharide-alditol OS1 was from Collocalia mucins (28Strecker G. Wieruszeski J.M. Cuvillier O. Michalski J.C. Montreuil J. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and OS3 was from human bronchial mucins. OS2 was obtained by treating OS1 with Streptococcus pneumoniae β-galactosidase (Sigma) according to Paulson et al. (29Paulson J.C. Prieels J.P. Glasgow L.R. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The galactose was then removed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P2 column (Bio-Rad). Fraction IIIc1 was also treated with S. pneumoniae β-galactosidase using the same protocole.Table IStructures of oligosaccharide-alditols OS1, OS2, and OS3Oligosaccharide-alditolStructureOS1Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–6)\GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3)/NeuAc(α2–3)OS2GlcNAc(β1–6)\GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3)/NeuAc(α2–3)OS3GalNAc-ol/GlcNAc(β1–3) Open table in a new tab Sulfated oligosaccharide-alditols (fraction IVc) were prepared from the respiratory mucins of a CF patient using the same methods as for fraction IIIc1 (25Lo-Guidice J.M.

(30Van Kuik J.A. Breg J. Kolsteeg C.E.M. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1978; 221: 150-154Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) specific for sulfation of -CH2OH. Briefly, 50 mg of GlcNAcβ1-O-Met was dissolved in 1.25 ml of dry pyridine. The mixture was cooled to 5 °C, and 18.5 μl of chlorosulfonic acid in 75 μl of dry chloroform was added. After stirring for 30 min at 5 °C and then for 2 h at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of water. The solvent was then evaporated to dryness. The sulfated GlcNAcβ1-O-Met was purified on a silica column (1.2 × 13 cm) (Florisil, Merck) eluted by a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol (5:3, v/v), and their structure was determined by 400 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy on a two-dimensional homonuclear COSY spectrum. The analysis proved the presence of two sulfated products: HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met, which was the main synthesized product; and HO3S-3GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (90%/10%). The sulfation of GlcNAcβ1-O-Met on the C-6 was confirmed by the strong downfield shift for the AH6/AH6′ protons (+0.45 ppm and +0.49 ppm, respectively). HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met was a generous gift from K. L. Matta (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY) (31Jain R.K. Xiao-Gao L. Matta K.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 268: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (100 μl) for the sulfotransferase assays was performed as follows. 50–100 μg of microsomal protein was incubated with 0.5 μCi of [35S]PAPS (NEN Life Science Products, 2.48–2.50 Ci/mmol), 5 mm of methylglycosides (GlcNAcβ/α1-O-Met, GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4 GlcNAc-O-Met, or sLex-O-Met), or 100 μg of one of the oligosaccharide-alditols (OS1, OS2, OS3) in a 30 mmMOPS/NaOH buffer, pH 6.7, containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm MnCl2, 30 mm NaF, 5 mm AMP, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). After incubation for 60 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of ice-cold methanol. The resulting mixture was kept overnight at 4 °C, and the formed precipitates were eliminated by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold methanol and centrifuged. The supernatants were collected, evaporated to dryness, and then submitted to HPAEC. After incubation of GlcNAcβ1-O-Met or OS2 with radiolabeled [35S]PAPS and microsomal preparation for 60 min at 30 °C as described above, UDP-Gal (Sigma) was added to the mixture to have a final concentration of 5 mm. The mixture was kept for 1 h 30 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped as described for the sulfotransferase assays. The synthesized products were identified by HPAEC. To compare the activity of this galactosyltransferase on GlcNAcβ1-O-Met/HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met and OS2/IVc-19, each substrate (1 mm) was incubated with 1 μCi of radiolabeled UDP-[6-3H]Gal (Sigma, 17.65 Ci/mmol) for 1 h 30 min at 30 °C in a 30 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer containing 5 mm AMP, 30 mm NaF, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm AEBSF, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped as described for the sulfotransferase assays, and the radiolabeled products were studied by HPAEC. To obtain a standard of Galβ1–4(HO3S-6)GlcNAc-O-Met, chemically synthesized HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (5 mm) was incubated with 1 μCi of radiolabeled UDP-[6-3H]Gal (Sigma, 17.65 Ci/mmol) and 150 milliunits of β1–4 galactosyltransferase from bovine milk (Sigma) in 50 μl of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 154 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm AMP, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (32Cacan R. Delannoy P. Verbert A. Verbert A. Methods on Glycoconjugates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Switzerland1995: 201-210Google Scholar). After 1 h 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped as described for the sulfotransferase assays, and the synthesized product was characterized by HPAEC. Dry samples of sulfated or galactosylated products were dissolved in water and injected directly onto a CarboPac PA-100 column (4 × 250 mm) for HPAEC (Dionex Corp.). The elution of neosynthesized products was monitored both by pulsed amperometric detection (PAD 2 model, Dionex Corp.) and by radioactivity on line (high performance liquid chromatography radioactivity detector LB 506 C-1, EG & G, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Elution of sulfated GlcNAcβ1-O-Met and sulfated products synthesized from methylglycosides (GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc-O-Met, and sLex-O-Met) was performed at alkaline pH at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 0.05 m NaOH, 0.2 msodium acetate with a linear gradient of sodium acetate to 0.05m NaOH, 0.3 m sodium acetate at 22 min, to 0.05m NaOH, 0.95 m sodium acetate at 24 min, and followed by isocratic elution with 0.05 m NaOH, 0.95m sodium acetate for 10 min (gradient I). The standards used were HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met and HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met for sulfated GlcNAcβ1-O-Met and sulfated GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-O-Met, respectively. The same gradient I was used for elution of the35S-sulfated and galactosylated products synthesized from GlcNAcβ1-O-Met. The standard used was Galβ1–4(HO3S-6)GlcNAc-O-Met (resulting from incubation of HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met with UDP-[6-3H]Gal and β1–4 galactosyltransferase from bovine milk). Elution of neosynthesized radiolabeled sulfated oligosaccharide-alditols was performed at alkaline pH at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 0.1 m NaOH for 10 min, then with a linear gradient of sodium acetate to 0.1 m NaOH, 0.07m sodium acetate at 16 min, to 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1m sodium acetate at 30 min, to 0.1 m NaOH, 0.45m sodium acetate at 80 min, to 0.1 m NaOH, 0.95m sodium acetate at 82 min and followed by isocratic elution with 0.1 m NaOH, 0.95 m sodium acetate for 10 min (gradient II). Fraction IVc containing 11 sulfated oligosaccharide-alditols was used as a standard (25Lo-Guidice J.M. Wieruszeski J.M. Lemoine J. Verbert A. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18794-18813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For elution of both 35S-sulfated and galactosylated products synthesized from OS2, we also used gradient II and fraction IVc as a control. The protein content of the microsomal fractions was determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) (33Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fulimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Methyl-N-acetylglucosaminides were first used to test the N-acetylglucosamine-sulfotransferase activity since it is difficult to obtain enough oligosaccharide-alditols from human respiratory mucins to characterize the enzyme completely. After incubation of methyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide (GlcNAcβ1-O-Met) with microsomes and [35S]PAPS and separation of the radiolabeled products by HPAEC, two peaks were observed: a peak at 11 min 30 s corresponding to free [35S]sulfate (this peak is still present when incubation is performed without any carbohydrate acceptor) and another peak at 9 min 30 s, absent when there is no GlcNAcβ1-O-Met in the incubation mixture, corresponding to a sulfated GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (Fig.1 a). Unreacted [35S]PAPS or [35S]APS, which are very acidic compounds, are eluted with high concentrations of sodium acetate, and so they are not visualized on the elution profile. To find out the position of the sulfate group on the GlcNAc residue, the radiolabeled products were chromatographed with a mixture (90%/10%) of HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met and HO3S-3GlcNAcβ1-O-Met that was chemically synthesized. The sulfated GlcNAcβ1-O-Met synthesized during incubation with microsomes and [35S]PAPS coeluted with the standard HO3S-6GlcNAcβ1-O-Met. This showed that the sulfotransferase was able to transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to the C-6 of GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (Fig.1 b). A very low sulfotransferase activity was found when methyl-α-N-acetylglucosaminide (GlcNAcα1-O-Met) was used as substrate acceptor, showing that the enzyme was more active on the β anomers than on the α anomers. The activity was about 120-fold higher for GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (17.27 pmol/mg of protein/min) than for GlcNAcα1-O-Met (0.14 pmol/mg of protein/min) using the same conditions of incubation. We first looked at the effect of pH on the transfer of sulfate group from PAPS to GlcNAcβ1-O-Met, using MES buffer (pH 5.4–6.4) and MOPS buffer (pH 6.1–7.9). The optimal conditions for sulfation of GlcNAcβ1-O-Met were obtained with 30 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer at pH 6.7 (data not shown). The influence of divalent cations on the activity of this GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase from respiratory mucosa was also studied. Mn2+ and Mg2+ had a stimulatory effect on the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase with an optimal activity at 20 mm Mn2+. The sulfotransferase activity was 4-fold higher with 20 mm Mn2+ than without this cation. Ca2+ had an inhibitory effect even at very low concentrations (data not shown). We also studied the influence of AMP, ATP, and NaF on the transfer of [35S]sulfate to GlcNAcβ1-O-Met. Both AMP and ATP had a stimulatory effect at a concentration of 1 mm. Above this concentration, ATP abolished the sulfotransferase activity, whereas AMP had an increased stimulatory effect up to a 5 mm concentration. The presence of NaF in the incubation mixture stimulated the sulfotransferase activity, with a maximal effect at 30 mm NaF (Fig. 2). These three compounds had an inhibitory effect on the liberation of free [35S]sulfate from [35S]PAPS during the incubations, allowing an increase of sulfotransferase activity. There was a free [35S]sulfate decrease, 10, 85, and 80%, when the incubations were performed with 30 mm NaF, 5 mm AMP, and 10 mm ATP, respectively. Concerning ATP, the stimulatory effect was only observed at low concentrations (1 mm). Above this concentration, ATP had an inhibitory effect. This compound, which can be considered as a structural analog of PAPS has already been shown to inhibit sulfotransferase activities (34Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At high concentrations, the impact on PAPS degradation would be lower than the inhibitory effect. The optimal sulfotransferase activity was obtained with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 30 mm NaF, 20 mmMnCl2, and 5 mm AMP in a 30 mmMOPS/NaOH buffer at pH 6.7. When using these conditions, the sulfotransferase activity increased linearly up to 360 min, in the range of 2–96 μg of microsomal proteins (data not shown). Kinetic measurements of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase activity with different concentrations of [35S]PAPS (Fig.3 a) and GlcNAcβ1-O-Met (Fig. 3 b) allowed the determination of K m values from Lineweaver-Burk plots for these two components, 9.1 μm and 0.54 mm, respectively. The sulfotransferase activity was measured on different oligosaccharide-alditols: OS1, OS2, OS3 (Table I), and fraction IIIc1 (sialylated oligosaccharide-alditols from human bronchial mucins (25Lo-Guidice J.M.

These oligosaccharides were incubated with microsomal preparation and [35S]PAPS in conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 35S-radiolabeled products were analyzed by HPAEC using a CarboPac PA-100 column and gradient II and compared with a mixture of 11 sulfated oligosaccharide-alditols whose structures have been determined previously (IVc) (25Lo-Guidice J.M.

The oligosaccharide-alditol IVc-10 had the same structure as OS1 with a sulfate group on the C-3 of the terminal galactose residue; IVc-12 had the same structure as OS1 with a sulfate group on the C-6 of the internal GlcNAc residue, and IVc-19 corresponded to OS2 with a sulfate group on the C-6 of the terminal GlcNAc residue. The structure of the oligosaccharide-alditol IVc-2 was also very useful for this study (TableII).Table IIStructures of oligosaccharide-alditols IVc-2, IVc-10, IVc-12, and IVc-19 from human respiratory mucinsOligosaccharide-alditolStructureIVc-23Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–6)/ / \HO3S Fuc(α1–3) GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3) /NeuAc(α2–3)IVc-103Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–6)/ \HO3S GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3)/NeuAc(α2–3)IVc-12HO3S\Gal(β1–4)6GlcNAc(β1–6)\GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3)/NeuAc(α2–3)IVc-19HO3S\6GlcNAc(β1–6)\GalNAc-ol/Gal(β1–3)/NeuAc(α2–3) Open table in a new tab After sulfation of OS1, two radiolabeled peaks were obtained (Fig.4 a). The first peak was eluted at 45 min 24 s and was also present when the incubation mixture did not contain any acceptors; it corresponded to free [35S]sulfate. The second peak was eluted at 46 min 36 s; it corresponded to the product synthesized from OS1. When this product was injected with a mixture of sulfated oligosaccharides (fraction IVc), it coeluted with oligosaccharide-alditol IVc-10, which corresponds to OS1 with a sulfate group on the C-3 of the terminal galactose residue. No radiolabeled peak had the same retention time as oligosaccharide-alditol IVc-12, which corresponds to OS1 with a sulfate group on the internal GlcNAc residue (Table II). Thus the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase activity from human bronchial mucosa was not directly active on the internal GlcNAc residue of OS1 (Scheme FS1).Figure FS1Sulfation of oligosaccharide-alditols OS1 and OS2 by microsomal sulfotransferases from human bronchial mucosa. The mucin carbohydrate chains can be substrates for either a Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase or for a GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase. The Gal-3-O-sulfotransferase is active on terminal Gal residues.

In these cancer patients, PTHrP is secreted into the circulation and acts on classical PTH receptors in kidney and bone to conserve calcium and reproduce many of the features of hyperparathyroidism. In normal physiology, PTHrP acts largely as a paracrine regulator in several tissues (1Moseley J.M. Gillespie M.T. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

PTHrP is an example of a peptide possessing discrete structural domains for receptor binding and agonist activity. Small structural modifications are able to transform a fully functional receptor agonist into a strong competitive antagonist. Only the N-terminal domain (residues 1–34) of PTHrP shares any sequence homology with PTH (3Suva L. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Rodda C.P. Kemp B.E.

These demonstrated that agonist activity is dependent on the presence of the intact N-terminal residues while receptor binding was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal residues. Hence, the signal transduction site is confined to the N terminus, whereas the bulk of the receptor binding site is located within the C-terminal region of the sequence 1–34.

PTH and PTHrP both exhibit nascent structures in water, which are stabilized in dilute F3EtOH-d2.

These investigations not only revealed the presence of separate N- and C-terminal helices, but with the exception of PTH in the presence of 10% F3EtOH-d2, a reverse turn was found in the intervening segment.

F3EtOH/water mixtures possess altered hydrogen-bonding properties compared with water alone, and thus amide proton exchange rates are reduced, leading to improved resolution and an increase in NOE intensities (22Llinas M.

Thus, any interaction between the N- and C-terminal helices in PTH/PTHrP-(1–34) would be expected to be weakened under these conditions. In an attempt to disrupt the relatively strong and consistent hydrophobic packing found between residues 15 and 23 in both PTH (16Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7126-7132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,21Marx U.C. Austermann S. Bayer P. Adermann K. Ejchart A. Sticht H. Walter S. Schmid F.-X. Jaenicke R. Forssmann W.-G.

Acta. 1994; 1208: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a new active analog of PTHrP-(1–34)-amide was synthesized with Ile15 replaced by an Ala. The structure was examined to check for any changes to the hydrophobic packing that could then be quarantined from involvement in direct receptor binding. The intention was to determine the part or parts of the structure remaining unaltered that could be responsible for receptor binding. Since signal transduction is separate from receptor binding and since it appeared that the residues responsible for receptor binding, confined to the C-terminal half of the peptide, were not closely associated with the N terminus, then the antagonist- and agonist-specific sites could have been well separated. A comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationship of the PTHrP/PTH pair of molecules requires a detailed knowledge of their structure and mobility. In particular, the design of antagonists useful for the control of hypercalcemia of malignancy firstly requires that the stabilized structure of the receptor binding domain be determined. We have thus studied the stabilized structure of the active mutant PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide in 8% F3EtOH-d2 and compared the principal structural features of the hormone with the tertiary solution structures of other homologous hormones to identify the residues responsible for receptor binding and their spatial relationship with residues responsible for signal transduction. Human PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using t-butyloxycarbonyl amino acid derivatives (26Hodges R.S. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 241-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Glu, Ser, and Thr side chains were protected using dinitrophenol while the Lys side chains had chlorobenzyl protection, and Arg side chains were protected with the nitro group. Dinitrophenol deprotection of the peptide was performed with 20% β-mercaptoethanol in dimethylformamide. Cleavage from the benzhydrylamine resin was achieved with anhydrous HF containing 10% (v/v) anisole (27Stewart J.M. Young J.P. Solid-state Peptide Synthesis. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1966: 44Google Scholar). The peptide was extracted with 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid solvent (0.1% v/v) in water, after which it was rotary evaporated. The aqueous solution was lyophilized, and the crude peptide was purified using preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The remaining trifluoroacetic acid was removed using G-10 gel filtration, and the peptide was lyophilized. Amino acid analyses of the peptide were in close accordance with the theoretical values. The C-terminal residue was amidated. Adenylate cyclase activation, in response to PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide, was assessed in PTH-receptor positive osteogenic sarcoma cells UMR-106–01 by measurement of cAMP produced (pmol of cAMP produced per million cells (4Kemp B.E. Moseley J.M. Rodda C.P. Ebeling P.R. Wettenhall R.E.H. Stapleton D. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Ure F. Michelangeli V.P. Simmons H.A. Raisz L.G. Martin T.J.

(Lond .). 1980; 58: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide was compared with human PTHrP-(1–34)-amide in the same assay over the concentration range 0.1–100 nm. Potency in the assay (EC50) is the peptide concentration producing half-maximal enzyme activation. PTH-receptor binding of PTHrP peptides to PTH-receptor positive UMR-106–01 cells was assessed as described previously (29Schneider H.-G. Allan E.H. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by competition of increasing amounts of PTHrP-(1–34)-amide or PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide with iodinated PTHrP(Tyr36)PTHrP-(1–35) and the IC50 recorded. PTHrP[Ala15]-(1–34)-amide was dissolved in 92% H2O, 8% (2H2) F3EtOH to give a final concentration of 2.0 mmat pH 4.1 and 294 K in 5-mm precision tubes. Chemical shifts of the resonances remained unaltered over the concentration range 0.5–3.0 mm, indicating the molecule remained monomeric at this pH and concentration as found in earlier studies of PTH and PTHrP (5Barden J.A. Cuthbertson R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Barden J.A. Kemp B.E.

Sample pH was adjusted with dilute HCl and NaOH and measured with an Activon BJ51130 thin stem micro-electrode. NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer operating in the Fourier transform mode with quadrature detection in both directions without sample spinning and with the use of a calibrated external temperature control unit. One-dimensional spectra were collected using a spectral width of 6024 Hz with pre-acquisition delay of 2 s. A total of 256 summed free induction decays were collected in a data block of 32 K. Signal-to-noise ratio was 670 with the dedicated proton probe. Spin systems were assigned using standard procedures (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The complete spin systems from all residues were identified using two-dimensional TOCSY and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectra. The TOCSY spectra were obtained with a MLEV-17 pulse sequence (33Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 34Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) using a mixing time of 100- and 2.5-ms trim pulses, which enabled connectivities from the amino acid backbone NH resonances to all the coupled side chain proton resonances to be measured. Spin-lock field strength was 9 kHz. Suppression of the water resonance was achieved using continuous low power (65 db) O1/O2 coherent irradiation throughout the relaxation (1.8 s) and mixing periods (35Zuiderweg E.R.P. Hallenga K. Olejniczak E.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 70: 336-343Google Scholar) with a stimulated cross-peaks under bleached α modification to reduce cross-peak suppression under the solvent (36Brown S.C. Weber P.L. Müller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 166-169Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phase-sensitive NOESY experiments (37Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4857) Google Scholar, 38Macura S. Huang Y. Sutter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were used to make sequence-specific resonance assignments as well as for estimations of proton-proton distance constraints. These were recorded using the time-proportional phase-increments method in ω1 (39Redfield A. Kunz S.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 250-254Google Scholar) and also using the stimulated cross-peaks under bleached α modification. A mixing time of 200 ms was used to provide the distance constraints table since it provided sufficient cross-peak intensity without spin-diffusion effects becoming problematical. The sweep widths in both ω1 and ω2 were 6024 Hz. 4 K data points were acquired in ω2 with 512–1024 data points collected in ω1, with each free induction decay consisting of 128–160 scans. The data were zero-filled to 4–8 K × 1–2 K and then apodized using Gaussian multiplication in ω2 and shifted sine-bell in ω1 prior to Fourier transformation. Third-order polynomial functions were employed to correct base lines. Data were analyzed using XWIN NMR on a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation. Chemical shifts were referenced to trimethylsilylpropanesulfonic acid. The 365 measured NOE cross-peaks, of which 195 were structure-determining interresidues, were separated into three conservative distance categories depending on contour intensity. Strong NOE were given an upper distance constraint of 0.30 nm, medium NOE a value of 0.40 nm, and weak NOE a value of 0.45 nm. Corrections for pseudoatoms were applied wherever stereospecific identifications were not obtained. A total of 2000 distance geometry structures were calculated from random starting configurations using the program DIANA 2.8 (40Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation. This technique utilizes least squares minimization in torsion angle space incorporating a variable target function, which considers progressively longer range constraints as the global structure is generated. The best 20 distance geometry structures possessing the lowest penalty values were refined in X-PLOR 3.1 (41Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1, User Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1994Google Scholar) utilizing a dynamic simulated annealing protocol (42Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) run on Silicon Graphics Indigo R4000 and Indy work stations. Non-bonded interactions were not considered in the DIANA distance geometry structures. Consequently, they possessed poor potential energies. 500 cycles of computationally inexpensive conjugate gradient energy minimization were applied in the initial stage of the simulation keeping the atom co-ordinates fixed to improve the distance geometry starting structures. Covalent geometry was constrained with parametersk bond = 20 kJ·mol−1·nm−2,k angle = 2000 kJ·mol−1·rad−2,k improper = 2000 kJ·mol−1·rad−2, andk cdihed = 0 kJ·mol−1·rad−2 (41Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1, User Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1994Google Scholar). The non-bonded interactions were modelled with the function repel = 1 and the non-bonded repel term C rep = 7.5 × 10−7 kJ·mol−1·nm−4, which ignored electrostatic interactions. Interatomic distances, and the χ1 angles were constrained by the experimental energy terms k NOE = 2 kJ·mol−1·nm−2 andk cdihed = 200 kJ·mol−1·rad−2, with asymptote = 0.1 (NOE restraint term). Stage 2 involved assigning high kinetic energies to the atoms from a Maxwellian distribution equivalent to heating the molecule to a temperature of 1000 K. At this stage, the dynamic trajectory of the molecule was followed for 75 ps in steps of 2 fs. The NOE restraint term was thereafter linearly increased to 1.0 over 25 ps in 2 fs steps. This procedure gradually increased the influence given to the covalent geometry in the calculations from zero to 100%. Stage 4 of the simulation involved cooling the system over 10 ps from 1000 to 300 K, with the repel term set to 0.9 and C rep = 1.5 × 10−3kJ·mol−1·nm−4. Equilibration of the molecule then commenced at 300 K for 5 ps using Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials for non-bonded interactions setting repel = 0. Each structure was then refined with 2000 cycles of energy minimization. Molecular graphics were processed using Insight II operating on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2. The IC50 was measured for both native human PTHrP-(1–34)-amide and the Ala15 analog used in the structure analysis with values of 0.7 and 4.5 nm obtained, respectively, from the data in Fig. 1. The PTH-like activities of the peptides were assayed for stimulation of [3H]cAMP formation in intact UMR-106–01 cells pre-labeled with [3H]adenine (4Kemp B.E. Moseley J.M. Rodda C.P. Ebeling P.R. Wettenhall R.E.H. Stapleton D. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Ure F. Michelangeli V.P. Simmons H.A. Raisz L.G. Martin T.J. Science. 1987; 238: 1568-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The PTHrP analog exhibited only slightly lower relative adenylate cyclase activity than that of native PTHrP based on reduced binding (Fig. 1). Points are means of at least triplicates, and basal activity is shown as the asymptote at the bottom of the figure. Values for the EC50of 0.7 and 9.5 nm were obtained for native and mutant peptides, respectively. Activity was reduced only 2-fold in relation to the weaker binding exhibited by the mutant. While reduced, the binding is still a third of the level recorded for human PTH-(1–34)-amide in the same assay (15Ray F.R. Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating that little has changed in the binding site structure. A TOCSY NMR spectrum of Ala-Val-Ser-Glu-His-Gln-Leu-Leu-His-Asp-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ser-Ala-Gln-Asp-Leu-Arg-Arg-Arg-Phe-Phe-Leu-His-His-Leu-Ile-Ala-Glu-Ile-His-Thr-Ala-amide in 8% F3EtOH-d2 was recorded using a mixing time of 100 ms as described previously (5Barden J.A. Cuthbertson R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7126-7132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among the 34 spin systems in the peptide, the unique residues Ala1, Val2, Gly12, and Thr33 were assigned sequence specifically from the spectrum. Each of the remaining spin systems was assigned to residue type by the TOCSY and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectra. Coherence transfers were detected in the TOCSY as far apart as the seven bonds separating the NH backbone and the εCH2 protons of Lys residues. Several entry points were available in the sequence-specific assignment analysis that utilized NOESY measurements of the distances between adjacent residues, including the NH, Hα, and Hβ protons of residue (i) coupled to the NH proton of residue (i + 1) (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Some sequential connectivities are shown in Fig. 2 between Hα i and NH i +1, which enabled most resonance assignments to be determined. The complete list of chemical shifts is shown in Table I. The numerous sequential NH resonances in Fig. 3 reveal the likely presence of a substantial quantity of helix. Connectivities from Phe22 through to Ala34 at the C terminus are certainly indicative of the presence of a long stretch of continuous helix within this segment. The overall pattern of sequential and non-sequential inter-residue backbone and side chain NOEs is summarized in Fig. 4. The relative intensity of the inter-residue NOE is represented by the line thickness. The shortest inter-proton distances are those with the strongest NOE and are represented by the thickest lines. Degenerate NOEs which are probably present are shown by the asterisks and dotted lines. These were used only for qualitative purposes and remained excluded from structure calculations.

Reversal of this state can be mediated by high (20%) serum treatment, which induces new Ca2+ pump protein, return of Ca2+ pools, and reentry of cells into the cell cycle; the effect of serum can be mimicked by the essential fatty acids (EFA), arachidonic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids (Graber, M.N., Alfonso, A., and Gill, D.L., (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 883–888). The possible requirement for EFA metabolism in inducing recovery of Ca2+ pool-depleted growth-arrested cells was investigated. Neither cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase inhibitors had any effect on arachidonic acid-induced growth recovery of thapsigargin-treated cells. In contrast, the cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitors, SKF525A and metyrapone, substantially reduced arachidonic acid-induced recovery of growth while having minimal effects on control cell growth. Both epoxygenase inhibitors completely prevented the arachidonic acid-induced recovery of bradykinin-releasable Ca2+-pumping pools, whereas cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors had no effect. The effectiveness of the four cytochrome P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid on recovery of Ca2+ pools were compared; 8,9- and 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) at 1.5 μm were completely effective in recovering agonist-sensitive Ca2+pools, whereas the 5,6- and 14,15-EETs were without effect. SKF525A did not block the action of 8,9- or 11,12-EET indicating further P-450 metabolism was not required. Hydration of the active EET molecules prevented Ca2+ pool recovery since the dihydroxy-derivatives of both 8,9- and 11,12-EET were ineffective. The specificity of effectiveness among EET molecules for subsequent resumption of growth of thapsigargin-treated cells was the same as for Ca2+ pool recovery. Significantly, the P-450 inhibitors, SKF525A and metyrapone, both prevented the action of 20% serum in inducing recovery of thapsigargin-treated cells, whereas cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors were ineffective, indicating that EFAs are the active component within serum that is responsible for recovery of Ca2+ pool-depleted cells. The specific action of EETs in mediating recovery of Ca2+ pools and growth of thapsigargin-treated cells represents not only a novel action of epoxygenase products from EFAs, but also a potentially significant new signaling pathway that may effect translational control and regulate transition from a stationary to proliferative growth state.

Cytosolic Ca2+ signals activate numerous rapid cellular responses including contraction, secretion, and excitation; Ca2+ signals also mediate control over longer term responses such as cell division and growth (1Berridge M.J.

A significant source of Ca2+ for these signals is the Ca2+ stored within intracellular pools, which can be released through the activation of intracellular release Ca2+ channels (1Berridge M.J.

In addition to serving as a source of Ca2+ for the generation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals, the Ca2+accumulated within pools may effect control over a number of cellular functions. Thus, the intraluminal Ca2+ level appears to be the primary trigger for activating Ca2+ influx channels in the plasma membrane following Ca2+ pool release (1Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 312: 1-11Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 2Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci.

Although growth-arrested, these Ca2+ pool-depleted cells remain intact and viable, and maintain normal cellular and subcellular morphology and mitochondrial function for up to one week (13Ghosh T.K.

High serum induces expression of new functional Ca2+pump protein within 1–3 h and the reappearance of agonist-releasable Ca2+ pools within 6 h (15Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Meadows J.J. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11927-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells begin to enter the S phase 16 h later and thereafter continue to divide normally (14Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Recently we revealed that each of the essential fatty acids, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), can mimic the action of high serum treatment on Ca2+ pool-depleted growth-arrested cells, inducing reappearance of agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pools and re-entry of cells into the cell cycle. It was shown that either high serum or EFA treatment can induce recovery of Ca2+ pools, the actions of both being dependent upon protein synthesis (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Experiments indicated that the EFAs within serum could be the component responsible for stimulating pool reappearance and growth recovery. Thus, the EC50 values for the action of each of the three EFAs on growth induction of thapsigargin-arrested cells were similar, approximately 5 μm, corresponding with the total EFA concentration present in the 20% serum treatment conditions (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 inhibitors did not inhibit high serum-induced recovery suggesting that serum does not stimulate phospholipase A2-induced formation of free EFAs. We postulated that the EFAs themselves may not be the agents directly involved in recovery, but instead, active metabolite(s) of these lipid species might be responsible. This was supported by studies showing that the nonmetabolizable analogue of arachidonic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), was unable to induce recovery (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ETYA has been shown to mimic the actions of arachidonic acid in systems where metabolism of the fatty acid is not required (23Tobias L.D. Hamilton J.G. Lipids. 1978; 14: 181-193Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Damron D.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 376-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kohout T.A. Rogers T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20432-20438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, ETYA is an effective blocker of the entry of EFAs into each of the pathways through which eicosanoids are formed, including the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and epoxygenase (or monooxygenase) pathways (26Cunningham F.M. Lipid Mediators. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar). Our observations that ETYA is effective in blocking arachidonic acid-induced recovery provided further support for the possible requirement for metabolism of arachidonic acid in inducing cell recovery (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The metabolism of EFAs within cells is complex, and at least three major pathways are known (27Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). It was important to determine whether metabolism of EFAs through one of these pathways was required for the activation of recovery of pools and cell growth following Ca2+ pool emptying. In addition, it was important to try to identify whether any of the many products of metabolism might be active in mediating this response. Presented here are studies examining the role of each of the three major pathways of eicosanoid synthesis in mediating the action of EFAs. The results indicate that the cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathway is required to give rise to active products. Studies further reveal that the effect is induced by only two specific epoxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolites of arachidonic acid and not observed with other cytochrome P-450 metabolites or mimicked by products from other eicosanoid pathways. The results also provide evidence indicating that the EFAs contained within serum are indeed the active components mediating serum-induced recovery of Ca2+pool-depleted cells. The results not only provide further information on the link between Ca2+ pools and cell growth but also shed light on a possible new signaling pathway controlling transition from a stationary to proliferative growth state.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe intracellular Ca2+ pump blockers, thapsigargin, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone, and cyclopiazonoic acid, induce profound changes in the growth of DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells in culture (2Gill D.L.

In previous studies, we described how Ca2+ pool emptying with these agents induced entry of the normally rapidly dividing DDT1MF-2 cells into a growth-arrested state (13Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D.

After treatment of cells with pump blockers, cells can progress through S phase before entering a stable G0-like quiescent growth state (13Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this state, the cells remain viable with normal morphology and mitochondrial function for up to 1 week; protein synthesis continues but at a substantially reduced rate, approximately 20% of that in normal dividing cells (13Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl.

Bian J. Short A.D. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that treatment of the pool-depleted growth-arrested cells with high serum (20%) could rescue the cells (14Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) lead to a search for active components within serum responsible for this effect. We determined that the essential fatty acids, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid, each were able to induce similar recovery of Ca2+ pools and the resumption of growth (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The levels of free EFAs present in effective serum concentrations (approximately 5 μm) were close to the EC50 values for EFAs in inducing recovery, suggesting, but not proving, that EFAs might be the active component within serum inducing recovery. This view was supported by the lack of effect of phospholipase A2inhibitors on serum-induced recovery indicating that serum does not activate breakdown of cellular phospholipids, but more likely supplies the fatty acids directly. The observation that the nonmetabolizable structural analogue of arachidonic acid, ETYA, did not mimic the action of arachidonic acid (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) provided further support for the view that metabolism of arachidonic acid was required for the recovery-inducing action. Important to investigate was the basis of action of EFA-induced pool recovery and reentry of pool-depleted cells into the cell cycle, specifically, to assess whether metabolism is in fact required, through which pathway(s) active metabolites might be produced, and which of the many possible metabolic products of EFA metabolism might be the active species.Initial experiments were designed to determine the role of essential fatty acid metabolism through dissection of the three major components of the eicosanoid synthesis pathway (26Cunningham F.M. Lipid Mediators. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar). Studies utilized a range of specific inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathways. Thapsigargin-treated cells were either induced to recover with 100 μm arachidonic acid or pretreated with an eicosanoid synthesis pathway inhibitor followed by arachidonic acid in the continued presence of the inhibitor. All fatty acids and derivatives were utilized in the presence of 1% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, and measurements of cell number were undertaken after 72 h in culture (see “Experimental Procedures”).The lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways have been extensively studied, and the actions of a number of well characterized inhibitors of these pathways were examined for their effects on arachidonic acid-induced growth recovery in Ca2+ pool-depleted growth-arrested cells. Their effects on the growth of untreated control cells were also examined. As shown in Fig.1 A, the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, aspirin (32Vane J. Botting R.

Lecomte M. Dunn J. Morgans D.J. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in each case did not prevent arachidonic acid-induced growth recovery of thapsigargin-arrested cells. Each of these inhibitors did have a small retarding effect on the growth of control cells and this limited growth-slowing effect was also evident on the growth of pool-depleted cells induced to recover with arachidonic acid.Investigations also examined inhibitors of the second eicosanoid synthesizing pathway, the lipoxygenase pathway. As shown in Fig.1 A, the lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5,8,11-eicosatriynoic acid (ETI) (38Byczkowski J.Z. Ramgoolie P.J. Kulkarni A.P. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1691-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 39Joseph P. Srinivasan S.N. Kulkarni A.P. Biochem.

Physiol. 1989; 257: H434-H443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induced little significant change in either control growth of cells or arachidonic acid-induced recovery. Similarly, the dual cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors, BW755c (42Cucurou C. Battioni J.P. Thang D.C. Nam N.H. Mansuy D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8964-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Oyekan A.O. McGiff J.C. Quilley J. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and octadeca-9,12-diynoic acid (ODYA) (44Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Schilstra M.J. Van der kerk-Van Hoof A. Brandsma L. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10538-10545Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), were ineffective on control growth or arachidonic acid-induced recovery. These results indicate that the more thoroughly studied eicosanoid synthesizing pathways, the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, are unlikely to be involved in the arachidonic acid induced recovery mechanism.In contrast, experiments utilizing inhibitors of the third eicosanoid pathway, the cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathway, consistently indicated that the actions of arachidonic acid on inducing recovery of pool-depleted cells, were dependent on this pathway. As shown in Fig.1 B, the cytochrome P-450 inhibitors, metyrapone (45Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 229-241Google Scholar) and SKF525A (45Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 229-241Google Scholar, 46Kauser K. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ma Y.H. Harder D.R. Roman R.J. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), each prevented arachidonic acid-induced growth recovery but had only marginal effects on the growth of control cells. Interestingly, the “classic” lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordiydroguaiuretic acid (NDGA), also prevented growth recovery induced by arachidonic acid. However, there is an interesting consistency in these results; NDGA in addition to acting as a lipoxygenase inhibitor, is also a potent cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitor (47Agarwal R. Wang Z.Y. Bik D.P. Mukhtar H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 620-624PubMed Google Scholar, 48Sarubbi D. Quilley J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 197: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), therefore the inhibitory effect is consistent with the involvement of only the epoxygenase pathway in arachidonic acid-induced recovery. It is important to note that, whereas each of these cytochrome P-450 inhibitors greatly reduced (by 80–90%) the ability of arachidonic acid to induce growth recovery of quiescent pool-depleted cells, each had little or no effect upon control cell growth. This indicates that there is a specific requirement for arachidonic acid-derived products of the P-450 epoxygenase pathway in mediating the transition from growth arrest back into the cell cycle and that this effect does not reflect a generalized action of these products on cell growth per se.As mentioned above, we previously reported that the nonmetabolizable arachidonic acid analogue, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), is unable to induce growth recovery of pool-depleted cells (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This analogue also acts as an inhibitor of all three eicosanoid synthesizing pathways (23Tobias L.D. Hamilton J.G. Lipids. 1978; 14: 181-193Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Cunningham F.M. Lipid Mediators. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar, 27Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Experiments revealed that ETYA up to 10 μm did, at least partially inhibit the growth recovery of thapsigargin-arrested cells induced by arachidonic acid (data not shown). However, we also noted that above 10 μm, ETYA has a significant inhibitory effect on normal cell growth therefore it was not possible to effectively gauge its inhibitory action on growth recovery. The basis of the inhibitory action of ETYA on normal cell growth is unknown but may be related to the inhibition of normal cell growth seen with high concentrations (>100 μm) of arachidonic acid, as described earlier (22Graber M.N. Alfonso A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).From the above experiments it"

To gain insight into the role of DMK during myogenesis, we have examined the effect of DMK overexpression on the terminal differentiation of the murine myoblast cell line C2C12. We demonstrate that a 4–10-fold constitutive overexpression of DMK mRNA in myoblasts caused a marked inhibition of terminal differentiation. Surprisingly, this activity was mapped to a 239-nucleotide region of the 3′-UTR of the DMK transcript. When the DMK3′-UTR was placed downstream of a reporter gene, the same inhibition of myogenesis was observed. Following the induction of differentiation of myoblast clones overexpressing the DMK 3′-UTR, the levels of myogenin mRNA were reduced by approximately 4-fold, whereas the steady state levels of mef-2c transcripts were not affected. These data suggest that overexpression of the DMK3′-UTR may interfere with the expression of musclespecific mRNAs leading to a delay in terminal differentiation.

DM is an autosomal dominant and multisystemic disorder characterized mainly by myotonia and progressive muscle weakness and wasting (1Harper P.S. Myotonic Dystrophy. 2nd Ed. W. B.

Affected individuals present with a highly variable phenotype, ranging from an asymptomatic condition to a severe and frequently fatal congenital form. Congenital DM patients display marked hypotonia, neonatal respiratory distress, and severe mental retardation.

However, in over 98% of DM individuals, this region has been shown to be significantly amplified, ranging from approximately 50, in mild cases, to several thousand repeats in severely affected individuals. The degree of this amplification has been strongly correlated with disease severity (10Barcelo J.M. Mahadevan M.S. Tsilfidis C. Mackenzie A.E. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol.

Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the normal function of the protein is still unknown. In research concerning the expression of the DMK gene, controversial observations have been reported on the effect of CTG amplification. Using different assays, overexpression (18Sabourin L.A.

Others have reported that the total activity of the DM locus was unaffected in DM patients but that the levels of processed mutant transcripts were decreased (23Krahe R. Ashizawa T. Abbruzzese C. Roeder E. Carango P. Giacanelli M. Funanage V.L. Siciliano M.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In another analysis, Wang et al. (24Wang J. Pegoraro E. Menegazzo E. Gennarelli M. Hoop R.C. Angelini C. Hoffman E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have shown that the levels of both mutant and wild typeDMK mRNAs were markedly reduced in poly(A)+RNA samples. These authors have proposed that the expanded CTG repeat may act as a dominant-negative mutation that affects RNA processing intrans. Recently, the expanded repeat has been shown to repress, in cis, the downstream gene DMAHP(25Thorton C.A. Wymer J.P. Simmons Z. McClain C. Moxley III, R.T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Klesert T.R. Otten A.D. Bird T.D. Tapscott S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in the disease process. However, it has been demonstrated that, when normalized to type I myosin heavy chain, the relative levels of DMK protein were elevated in skeletal muscle from DM individuals (15Dunne P.W. Ma L. Casey D.L. Harati Y. Epstein H.F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, targeted inactivation of the murine DMK gene has been shown to result in a normal phenotype in one case (27Jansen G. Groenen P.T.J.A. Bachner D. Jap P.H.K. Coerwinkel M. Oerlemans F. van den Broek W. Gohlsch B. Pette D. Plomp J.J. Molenaar P.C. Nederhoff M.G.J. van Echteld C.J.A. Dekker M. Berns A. Hameister H. Wieringa B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), whereas a late onset progressive muscle weakness has been demonstrated by Reddy et al. (28Reddy S. Smith D.B.J. Rich M.M. Leferovich J.M. Reilly P. Davis B.M. Tran K. Rayburn H. Bronson R. Cros D. Balice-Gordon R.J. Housman D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no congenital DM phenotype has been observed in any of the null homozygous mice. Taken together these results suggest that the congenital phenotype is not mediated by a decrease inDMK expression. Therefore, to gain insight into the role of DMK during myogenesis and the mechanism underlying DM, we have characterizedDMK expression during the terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and investigated the effect of DMK overexpression on myogenesis. Our results show that DMK is expressed in various myoblast cell lines and slightly up-regulated during skeletal myogenesis in vitro. Importantly, a 4–10-foldDMK overexpression markedly inhibits myogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that this activity maps to the 3′-UTR of theDMK mRNA. In contrast to previous observations (29Rastinejad F. Blau H. Cell. 1993; 72: 903-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) where muscle-specific 3′-UTR enhanced differentiation, we show that overexpression of the 3′-UTR may function in a feedback loop and interfere with the expression of muscle-specific mRNAs required for muscle terminal differentiation. DMK expression vectors consisted of full-length or partial DMK cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using standard cloning protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, pCMV-DMK comprises a full-length DMK cDNA bearing both 5′- and 3′-UTRs in pcDNA3. pDΔ35 was obtained from B. Perryman (University of Colorado, Denver) and was generated by cloning a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment corresponding to the coding portion of the full-length DMK cDNA. pDΔ5 was generated by replacing the 5′ KpnI-XhoI portion of pCMV-DMK by the corresponding segment of pDΔ35. Plasmid pK100R was obtained by in vitro mutagenesis of pCMV-DMK using the Muta-gene II kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A point mutation was introduced at amino acid residue 100, converting the conserved lysine residue of the ATP-binding site to an arginine. To construct HT3′ and HT3′R, a 1.0-kilobase pairBamHI fragment encompassing the DMK 3′-UTR was cloned in both orientations, into the BglII site downstream of the hygromycin-tk hybrid gene encoded by ptgCMV/Hy-tk (31Lupton S.D. Brunton L.L. Kalberg V.A. Overell R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3374-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The control plasmid HT-PGK was generated by cloning a 1.0-kilobase pair XhoI-HindIII fragment, comprising the mouse pgk 3′-UTR, into theSalI-HindIII sites of ptgCMV/Hy-tk. Plasmid pHTΔR was generated by SacII-PstI digestion and religation of HT3′, resulting in deletion of the CTG repeat region. Plasmids pHTΔ3′ and pHTΔ5′ were generated by blunt end cloning of polymerase chain reaction products encompassing nucleotides 2002–2278 and 2204–2726, respectively, of the human DMK cDNA (GenBank accession no. L19268). C3H10T1/2, C2C12, and NIH 3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC. C3H10T1/2 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in α-minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmglutamine. C2C12 myoblasts were grown in α-minimal Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and glutamine. All cultures were maintained under 70–80% confluency and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For stable transfections, C2C12 cells were plated at 5 × 105 in 100-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfections. The cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for 8 h and then refed with fresh growth medium. Following a 24-h incubation, G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.) or hygromycin B (Sigma) was added at final concentrations of 0.4 or 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. After a 14-day incubation, resistant clones (or pools) were isolated using cloning rings and grown for RNA, protein, and fusion analyses. To avoid the isolation of non-differentiating C2C12 clones, cells that had undergone 15 passages or less were used for each independent transfection experiment. For Northern blotting experiments, total RNA was extracted from confluent cultures of each individual clones and analyzed as described previously (18Sabourin L.A. Mahadevan M.S. Narang M. Lee D.S.C. Surh L.C. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For analysis of DMKexpression during differentiation, C2C12 cultures were grown to 80% confluency and then transferred to differentiation medium (α-minimal Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum), and RNA was analyzed forDMK at various times as indicated. For myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 fibroblasts, 2 × 104 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and grown for a further 24 h. The cultures were then treated with 3 mm 5-azacytidine (Sigma) for 24 h. The cells were then refed with fresh medium (day 0), and DMKexpression was analyzed by Western blotting at different time points. For fusion assays, C2C12 clones overexpressing the various DMK 3′-UTR constructs were plated at 4 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes and incubated for an additional 16–20 h. The resulting confluent cultures were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 48 h in differentiation medium. The cultures were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 100% methanol. Following myosin heavy chain staining using the monoclonal antibody MF20 (32Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, the cultures were counterstained with Giemsa for visualization of the nuclei. In some assays, the fixed cultures were stained with Giemsa only, which was found to preferentially stain myotubes. The fusion index was calculated as the percent ratio of the number of nuclei in myotubes over the total number of nuclei in one field ((number of nuclei in myotubes/total number of nuclei) × 100). For each culture, at least 1500 nuclei were counted from several random fields, and the fusion index was taken as the average ± S.E. of all calculated indices for one culture. The indices for the other cultures were graphed as the average index with the standard error of the proportion. For each clone, the fusion index was determined in at least two separate experiments. The results shown are from one representative experiment. Previous studies have demonstrated that DMK is highly expressed in smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle tissues (13Jansen G. Mahadevan M. Amemiya C. Wormskamp N. Segers B. Hendricks W. O'Hoy K. Baird S. Sabourin L. Lennon G. Jap P.L. Iles D. Coerwinkel M. Hofker M. Carrano A.V. de Jong P.J. Korneluk R.G. Wieringa B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Sabourin L.A. Mahadevan M.S. Narang M. Lee D.S.C. Surh L.C. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This muscle-specific pattern of expression and the primary involvement of skeletal muscles in DM suggest a functional role for DMK in normal muscle function and development. To begin to investigate this role, several myogenic cell lines were grown, and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from undifferentiated cells. The analyzed cell lines included the following: the skeletal myoblast line C2C12; BC3H1, a skeletal myoblast line defective for terminal differentiation; the rat myogenic line H9C2, and the multipotent embryocarcinoma cell line P19. Following Northern blot analysis, DMK was found to be expressed at similar levels in the skeletal myoblast lines (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, relative to the pgk control, DMK expression was found to be significantly higher in the cardiac myoblast cell line. In contrast, remarkably low levels of DMK were observed in the multipotent stem cell line P19, suggesting that DMK is up-regulated during myogenic lineage determination. Similarly, NIH 3T3 and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts expressed very low levels of DMK(data not shown). As a first step into the characterization of DMK expression during myogenesis, we determined DMK mRNA levels during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Cells were grown to 80% confluency and induced to differentiate in low serum medium. Total RNA was isolated at various times and analyzed for DMKexpression. Northern blot analysis and normalization to pgkmRNA levels showed a modest increase (1.5- to 2-fold) in the steady state levels of DMK transcripts following transfer of the cells to differentiation medium (Fig. 1 B). The major increase in DMK levels occurred 72–96 h following the induction of differentiation, suggesting that up-regulation follows the commitment to myogenic differentiation. Similarly, when the cells were allowed to differentiate following confluency in growth medium,DMK mRNA levels were found to increase approximately 2-fold during differentiation (Fig. 1 C). Under low serum conditions, myoblast fusion was found to be approximately 37 and 60% after 2 and 4 days, respectively, in parallel cultures following myosin heavy chain immunostain (see “Materials and Methods”). For both time courses, myosin light chains 1 and 3 (mlc 1/3) and α-skeletal actin levels (data not shown) increased significantly, indicative of muscle cell terminal differentiation. Our expression results with the various cell lines suggest thatDMK may become up-regulated during myogenic determination (see above). To investigate this possibility, DMK expression was analyzed in the mesodermal precursor cell line C3H10T1/2 that has been demonstrated to differentiate predominantly into myoblasts as well as chondrocytes and adipocytes following a brief treatment with 5-azacytidine (33Konieczny S.F. Emerson Jr., C.P. Cell. 1984; 38: 791-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 D, the presence of the 82-kDa DMK isoform is apparent 4 days after treatment of 10T1/2 cells with 5-azacytidine. Similarly, DMK mRNA was found to be up-regulated following 5-azacytidine treatment, and this induction coincided with an increase in myoD mRNA in these cells (data not shown). The observed low level of DMK protein is presumably due to the fact that only 25% of the cells get converted to myoblasts under these conditions (33Konieczny S.F. Emerson Jr., C.P. Cell. 1984; 38: 791-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Myogenic conversion by transient transfection of a myoD expression vector resulted in higher expression of DMK (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the observed DMK expression in 5-azacytidine-treated cultures is not likely to be due to the presence of the other cell types. Therefore, our observations suggest that DMK is up-regulated during myogenic determination of precursor cells. Supporting this is the recent observation that DMK is expressed in murine somites of day 10.5 embryos (27Jansen G. Groenen P.T.J.A. Bachner D. Jap P.H.K. Coerwinkel M. Oerlemans F. van den Broek W. Gohlsch B. Pette D. Plomp J.J. Molenaar P.C. Nederhoff M.G.J. van Echteld C.J.A. Dekker M. Berns A. Hameister H. Wieringa B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), at which time the myogenic factorsmyoD and myf-5 are expressed (34Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Previous histological studies have shown a marked delay of muscle cell terminal differentiation (2Farkas-Bargeton E. Barbet J.P.

Neuromuscular Disorders. 1991; 1: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that CTG expansion caused an increase ofDMK mRNA steady state levels in muscle tissues from congenital DM individuals (18Sabourin L.A. Mahadevan M.S. Narang M. Lee D.S.C. Surh L.C. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These data suggest that DMKoverexpression could directly inhibit or delay myogenesis in these patients. Our working hypothesis, therefore, was that the dominant nature of the disease, and the ultimate effect on myogenesis, was due to the overexpression of the DM kinase gene and/or protein. To this end, an expression vector, carrying a full-length humanDMK cDNA was constructed. The cDNA, bearing 325 bp of 5′-UTR, the coding region, and the entire 3′-UTR, with 11 CTG repeats (14Mahadevan M.S. Amemiya C. Jansen G. Sabourin L. Baird S. Neville C.E. Wormskamp N. Segers B. Batzer M. Lamerdin J. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was introduced into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCMV-DMK (Fig.2 A). Transcription is under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV; Ref. 35Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was transfected into C2C12, and 24 G418-resistant clones were randomly isolated and analyzed for DMK mRNA expression. When normalized to pgk, all the clones surveyed displayed a 4–10-fold higher level of DMK mRNA relative to untransfected C2C12 myoblasts (for example, those clones designated B6 and C4 shown in Fig. 3 A) and were morphologically similar to the parent cell line (data not shown). In parallel, all clones were subjected to Western blot analysis and myoblast fusion assays under low serum conditions. Following myosin heavy chain or Giemsa staining of the fixed cultures, the fusion index (number of nuclei in myotubes/total number of nuclei) was calculated from several random fields and used as an indicator of terminal differentiation. Although the mRNA was highly expressed in all clones, DMK protein levels were found to be only slightly elevated (ranging from 1.5- to 2-fold in some clones) or relatively unchanged compared to C2C12 (Fig. 3 B). This could be due to the presence of two other AUGs in the 5′-UTR which may considerably reduce the translational efficiency or, alternatively, the 5′-UTR could play a significant role in the control of DMK mRNA translation in myoblasts. Therefore, the ability of the mRNA transcribed from pCMV-DMK to be translated was verified in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pCMV-DMK expressed extremely low levels of DMK protein, whereas high levels were observed when they were transfected with pDΔ5 (a DMK construct lacking the 5′-UTR; Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the presence of the DMK5′-UTR in pCMV-DMK significantly alters the efficiency of translation (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Expression of DMK mRNA and protein in myoblast clones and COS-1 cells. A, example of a Northern blot analysis of two independent myoblast clones (B6 and C4) isolated from CMV-DMK-transfected C2C12 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1995981903,"Bacterial detoxification of mercuric ion depends on the presence of one or more integral membrane proteins (MerT and/or MerC) whose postulated function is in transport of Hg2+ from a periplasmic Hg2+-binding protein (MerP) to cytoplasmic mercuric reductase. In this study, MerC from the Tn21-encoded mer operon was overexpressed and studied in vesicles and in purified form to clarify the role played by this protein in mercuric ion resistance. MerC-containing vesicles were found to take up mercuric ion independently of MerP. Since uptake correlated with the level of MerC expression was unaffected by osmotic pressure, and was only partially decreased in the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100, the observed uptake appears to represent mainly binding to MerC. Binding was inhibited by thiol-specific reagents, consistent with an essential role for cysteine residues. The essential thiol groups were inaccessible to hydrophilic thiol reagents, whereas hydrophobic reagents completely abolished Hg2+ binding. These observations are consistent with the predicted topology of the protein, wherein all 4 cysteine residues are either in the cytoplasm or the bilayer. A role for MerC in Hg2+ transport is thus also likely. Based on these results, a modified model for bacterial Hg2+ transport is proposed.

A role for MerC in Hg2+ transport is thus also likely. Based on these results, a modified model for bacterial Hg2+ transport is proposed. Bacteria that are resistant to mercuric ions contain a flavoenzyme, mercuric reductase (MerA), that catalyzes the reduction of Hg2+ to the volatile and less toxic form, Hg0. Besides merA, mer operons on the transposons Tn21 and Tn501 also encompass the genesmerR, merT, merP, merC (which is unique to Tn21), and merD (1Ni'Bhriain N. Foster T.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 42: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both merR and merDencode proteins involved in the regulation of the operon (2Foster T.J. Nakahara H. Weiss A.A. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 167-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ni'Bhriain N.N. Silver S. Foster T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 690-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lund P.A. Ford S.J. Brown N.L.

The other operon-encoded polypeptides are thought to be intimately involved in the detoxification process, although only the functions of MerA and MerP have been reasonably well defined at both the genetic and biochemical levels. Even before mer operons had been sequenced, it was known that proteins other than mercuric reductase were involved in mercuric ion resistance. For example, an early observation was that some mercuric ion-resistant bacteria became hypersensitive to Hg2+ via mutation (6Nakahara H. Silver S. Miki T. Rownd R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 161-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypersensitivity was explained by postulating the existence of a transport system for mercuric ion: mutant strains with a functional transport system and a deficient mercuric reductase pump themselves full of toxic mercuric ions without being able to reduce Hg2+ to Hg0. Amino acid sequences deduced from DNA sequences (7Barrineau P. Gilbert P. Jackson W.J. Jones C.S. Summers A.O. Wisdom S. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1984; 2: 601-619PubMed Google Scholar, 8Misra T.K. Brown N.L. Fritzinger D.C. Pridmore R.D. Barnes W.M. Haberstroh L. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5975-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9Misra T.K. Brown N.L. Haberstroh L. Schmidt A. Godette D. Silver S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), combined with minicell expression experiments (10Jackson W.J. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 479-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jackson W.J. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 962-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that MerP is a periplasmic protein, and MerT and MerC are integral membrane proteins. This arrangement is reminiscent of transport systems involving periplasmic binding proteins, which bind ligands such as maltose and histidine in the periplasmic space and then interact with one or more integral membrane transport protein(s) (for reviews, see Refs. 12Ames G.F.-L. Mimura C.S. Shyamala V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 429-446Crossref Google Scholar, 13Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 14Shuman H.A. Panagiotidis C.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar). Such observations led to the proposal (15Brown N.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 400-403Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that mercuric ions cross the outer membrane, bind to MerP, and are transported across the inner membrane by MerT/MerC to cytoplasmic mercuric reductase (MerA). Upon reduction of mercuric ion, metallic mercury diffuses out of the cell, and is removed from the environment of the cell by virtue of its volatility. Throughout this transport process it has been postulated that mercuric ion is always bound to pairs of cysteines on the different transport proteins: data supporting the importance of thiols has been reported for MerP and MerT (16Morby A.P. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 129-134PubMed Google Scholar). A number of features of the original model have been confirmed by studying resistance and/or Hg2+ uptake in genetically manipulated strains, but conflicting data have been reported on the role of the merC gene product. Deletions of the genesmerT, merC, and/or merP of the Tn21-encoded system showed that merT andmerP were essential for full resistance (16Morby A.P. Hobman J.L. Brown N.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Hamlett N.V. Landale E.C. Davis B.H. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Lund P.A. Brown N.L. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but that merC could be deleted without any effect on resistance, at least as measured (18Hamlett N.V. Landale E.C. Davis B.H. Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, in Thiobacillus ferrooxidans there is no gene corresponding to merT, but rather one that is similar to merC (55% homology at the amino acid level) (20Inoue C. Sugawara K. Kusano T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies of Escherichia coliexpressing merC from T. ferrooxidans indicated that MerC was involved in the uptake of mercuric ions (21Kusano T. Ji G. Inoue C. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Inoue C. Kusano T. Silver S. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1289-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the light of these results, it would be curious if MerC of the Tn21-encoded system were merely a non-functional bystander. The ultimate goal of the work in our laboratories is to understand how the three proteins MerP, MerC, and MerT interact with Hg2+and each other, and how this interaction brings about the translocation of Hg2+ to mercuric reductase inside the cell. MerP has already been quite well characterized by ourselves and others (23Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Sahlman L. Skärfstad E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Eriksson P.-O. Sahlman L. J. Biomol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but biochemical information about MerT and MerC is lacking. As with other bacterial membrane transport systems, it will be necessary to purify the separate components and reconstitute them in artificial membranes to understand the complete mechanism of Hg2+detoxification. This paper describes the purification and partial characterization of Tn21-encoded MerC, which appears to be involved in mercuric ion uptake and binding. E. coli C600 harboring the plasmid pDU1003 was used for the cloning ofmerC. This plasmid contains the mer operon from plasmid R100 cloned into pBR322 (3Ni'Bhriain N.N. Silver S. Foster T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 690-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain was a gift from Dr. S. Silver, University of Illinois at Chicago. Plasmids generated during cloning procedures were first introduced into E. colistrains K12Tc or JM83. The merC gene was introduced into the vectors pCA (27Nair S.K. Calderone T.L. Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17320-17325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or pET3d (28Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.-S. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The vector pET3d containing the merC insert on an NcoI fragment will be referred to as pPOW200. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression of merC from the T7 promoter of pET3d. DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, Sephacryl S-200, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 2-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and the Sephaglas Bandprep kit were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All detergents, and the restriction enzyme NcoI, were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Millipore filters HA, pore size 0.45 μm, were used in the transport assays. Radioactive mercuric chloride (203Hg) was purchased from Amersham International. 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. The ScreenTest kit for screening for the correct orientation in the plasmid was obtained from Stratagene. GeneClean was purchased from Biolab 101. The Silver Sequence DNA Sequencing System and Wizard miniprep DNA purification system were obtained from Promega. Polymerase chain reaction was conducted using a GeneAmp kit with AmpliTaq polymerase obtained from Perkin-Elmer. An Amicon stirred cell and filters were used for protein concentration, while Microsep concentrators came from Filtron Technology. Benzophenone-4-maleimide and fluorescein-5-maleimide were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc., and bicinchoninic reagent was purchased from Pierce Chemical Co.N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), iodoacetic acid, iodoacetamide, and cysteine were obtained from Sigma. Pico-Fluor 40 was purchased from Packard. Primers for mutagenesis and DNA sequencing were ordered from Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. DNA manipulations were performed using standard techniques (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pDU1003 containing themer operon from plasmid R100 was used as template for polymerase chain reaction. The primers used were: 5′-GCGAGAGCCGCTCCATGGGACTGAT-3′ (Primer 1) and 5′-TTTGAGGCCCATGGCATCGTTCCTT-3′ (Primer 2). Primer 1 is identical to the coding strand at the start of MerC, bases 1265–1289 (numbered as in Tn21), except that it introduces an NcoI site at the ATG start codon. The second primer is complementary to the coding strand at bases 1740–1767, and also introduces a newNcoI site at the beginning of the next gene of the operon,merA. Two rounds of polymerase chain reaction were performed, and product was cleaved using NcoI and purified using a GeneClean kit. The resulting NcoI fragment was ligated into the vector pCA followed by transformation into E. coli K12Tc. An insert-containing plasmid was isolated and after cleavage with NcoI, a 465-base pair DNA fragment was extracted from an agarose gel using the Sephaglas Bandprep Kit and inserted at the NcoI site of pET3d. After transformation into E. coli JM83, plasmids were screened for insert in the correct orientation using the Screen Test Kit and amerC-specific primer. Out of 18 screened plasmids, 9 had the fragment in the correct orientation. One of the plasmids, pPOW200, with the insert in the correct orientation was sequenced in its entirety, and agreed at all positions with previously published ones (7Barrineau P. Gilbert P. Jackson W.J. Jones C.S. Summers A.O. Wisdom S. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1984; 2: 601-619PubMed Google Scholar, 9Misra T.K. Brown N.L. Haberstroh L. Schmidt A. Godette D. Silver S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was freshly transformed with plasmid pPOW200 each time cells were required. A single colony was picked, resuspended in LB, and then plated on LB/agar containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). After overnight growth at 37 °C, cells from the plate were suspended in LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an OD600 between 0.1 and 0.2, and grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.8. At this stage IPTG was added (0.5 mm) and the cells were harvested 2 h later and either frozen as a paste at −20 °C or used immediately for vesicle preparations. Cells (6 g wet weight) from 2 liters of culture were thawed and suspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl (40 ml). Since these cells produce their own lysozyme, they are very susceptible to lysis. After thawing out frozen cells and suspending them in buffer, lysis was complete without further treatment (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with DNase (0.01 mg/ml) and Mg2+ (1 mm). The suspension was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 35 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m NaCl (40 ml). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.3%. After incubation with stirring for 1 h at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged as above, and the pellet was discarded. The remaining 43 ml of supernatant was diluted with 172 ml of 10 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex Fast Flow column equilibrated in 25 mmTris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer. Fractions were collected and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels for the presence of MerC. MerC eluted with the sample application and wash. Fractions containing MerC were pooled and concentrated on a YM5 ultrafilter. The concentrated sample was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column which had been equilibrated in 25 mmMOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 75 mm NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100. Fractions containing MerC were pooled and concentrated and frozen at −50 °C until further use. MerC purification was also carried out using buffers containing 1 mm cysteine, which has been found to keep thiol groups reduced during purification of MerP (23Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring either pPOW200 (expressing merC) or pET3a (vector control) were grown and induced using IPTG as described above. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were transformed with the plasmid pDU1003 and grown on LA plates containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Single colonies were suspended in LB and replated: after overnight growth, colonies from one plate were suspended in 400 ml of LB broth containing tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and grown to OD600 = 0.9. At this point expression from themer operon was induced by the addition of Hg2+(20 μm). Since Hg2+ is volatilized during further growth, another addition of Hg2+ (10 μm) was made after 1 h. Samples of cells were harvested before induction and at 20 and 80 min after the start of induction. Vesicles were prepared according to a method based on that described by Kaback (31Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Thus, the procedure of Witholt et al. (32Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. van Heerikhuizen H. de Leij L. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was used for making spheroplasts, followed by vesicle preparation described by Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), except the preparation buffer was Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, instead of 7.5. The relative concentrations of vesicles were estimated by measuring the optical density at 550 nm. The relative amounts of MerC present in vesicles were estimated by scanning a polyacrylamide SDS gel using a LKB 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer. A Perkin-Elmer 320 spectrophotometer was used for UV visible absorbance measurements. Gradient gels (4–20%) (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) were used to analyze for the presence of MerC. Samples were incubated at 40 °C in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for 30 min before application to gels. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay, as described by Smith et al. (35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18645) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing was performed by Dr. P.-I. Ohlson, Dept. of Medical Chemistry, University of Umeå. The number of accessible thiol groups in purified MerC was estimated using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) according to previously described methods (36Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Determinations were carried out in 0.1m sodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.27, 1 mm EDTA, and in this buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride (5.8 m). 0.07 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, was used when the determination was carried out in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (2%). Excess cysteine in preparations of MerC that contained it was removed by filtration through a small Sephadex G-25 column, equilibrated in 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 75 mm NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100. Thiol determinations were also carried out on samples of MerC that had been reduced using dithiothreitol: excess reducing agent was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography in 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 75 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA. Uptake of Hg2+by vesicles was measured by following the incorporation of radioactively labeled Hg2+. These assays involved incubation of vesicles in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.3 or 8.0, for 1 min at room temperature. Hg2+ and cysteine in a 1:4 ratio, also containing 203Hg2+, were then added. At various times, samples of 0.5 or 1.0 ml were loaded by vacuum onto a filter (0.45 μm) and washed with 1.0 ml of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.3. The filters were counted in Pico-Fluor scintillation (4 ml) fluid in a LKB-Wallac liquid scintillation counter 1214 Rackbeta. Approximately 30% of the vesicle protein typically washed through the 0.45-μm filter. No adjustment was routinely made for this. When transport was measured in the presence of thiol-modifying reagents, vesicles were preincubated for 10 min or 1 h at room temperature, in the dark with NEM, benzophenone-4-maleimide, fluorescein-5-maleimide (1 mm), or iodoacetamide/iodoacetate (10 mm). Binding of Hg2+to purified MerC was measured in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with Hg2+ and cysteine, in a ratio of 1:4. The substrate solution was mixed 1:1 with purified MerC in a Microsep concentrator, cutoff 3000 Da, which was centrifuged for 15 min at 4400 ×g. The concentrations of Hg2+ in the upper and lower reservoir were measured and the amount bound to the protein was calculated using the method previously described (23Sahlman L. Jonsson B.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Purified MerC used in the assay was first preincubated with a 30-fold excess of DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The protein was separated from the DTT by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column prior to the binding assay. The gene merCwas introduced into the T7 promoter-based expression plasmid, pET3d, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” By running samples of the insoluble fractions of cells harvested from uninduced and induced cultures on polyacrylamide gels, it was possible to identify a band corresponding to MerC (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and2). Compared with the molecular mass standards, MerC migrated at a molecular mass corresponding to 15 kDa, which agrees well with that (14.8 kDa) predicted from the amino acid sequence. Vesicles were prepared from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring the merC expression plasmid, pPOW200, or the vector control, pET3a. Uptake of radioactively labeled mercuric ions by these vesicles was measured in the presence of a 4-fold excess of cysteine to minimize nonspecific interactions (Fig.2 A). There is clearly a difference between vesicles containing MerC and the control lacking MerC. In the experiment shown, uptake in MerC vesicles was approximately 6 times higher than in the pET3a vesicles, and was generally between 5- and 8-fold higher in different experiments. In the experiments described above the total concentration of Hg2+ was 1 μm, while the amount taken up by the vesicles was 60%, or 11 nmol of Hg2+/mg of protein. Considering that up to 30% of the vesicles were typically lost in the filtration process, it is possible that all of the Hg2+ was taken up and therefore may have been limiting. However, when the concentration of Hg2+ was increased to 10 μm, the total amount of Hg2+ taken up by the vesicles was the same (data not shown), so this does not appear to be the case. Since MerC contains two pairs of cysteine residues, Cys22-Cys25 and Cys127-Cys132, and cysteines have high affinity for mercuric ions, the effects on Hg2+ uptake of the membrane-permeable thiol-modifying reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), were also examined. As is shown in Fig. 2 A, uptake of Hg2+ was completely inhibited by preincubation of the vesicles with NEM (1 mm), indicating that cysteine residues are indeed important for the observed uptake. By contrast, inhibition by the hydrophilic thiol modifying reagents, iodoacetate and iodoacetamide (10 mm), was much less complete in the same time period (Fig. 2 B). Since NEM is membrane permeable, these results suggested that the essential cysteines are not accessible on the periplasmic side of the membrane. Thiol accessibility has been probed in other membrane proteins using hydrophobic benzophenone-4-maleimide and hydrophilic fluorescein-5-maleimide to distinguish between surface-accessible and thiol groups buried in the membrane (37Jones P.C. Sivaprasadarao A. Wray D. Findlay J.B.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The effects of these reagents on uptake of Hg2+ by MerC-containing and control vesicles are shown in Fig. 3. While the hydrophilic reagent inhibited the uptake in MerC and control vesicles by approximately 30%, practically all uptake was abolished in the MerC vesicles treated with the hydrophobic reagent. The hydrophobic reagent will pass into the membrane and thus modify cysteine residues located in the membrane, or close to it on the cytoplasmic side. These results strongly suggest that the essential cysteine residues of MerC are not accessible on the periplasmic surface. Although MerC was clearly responsible for Hg2+ uptake, it was not clear whether the uptake exemplified by Fig. 2 represents transport to the vesicle interior or whether it represents binding to the overexpressed MerC located in the cell membrane. If it is the former, the level of uptake should be independent of the amount of MerC in the membrane, whereas in the case of binding, the observed uptake should depend on the amount of MerC present. To prepare vesicles with varying levels of MerC, samples of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring pPOW200 were harvested just before induction (t = 0), and at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, after the addition of IPTG. Vesicles were prepared and samples of them were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to confirm the amount of MerC present at different time points: the amount of MerC increases with the induction time (Fig.4 A). The protein migrating at the position of MerC in the uninduced sample (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) may either be a normal E. coli protein, since it is present even in a strain lacking merC altogether, or it may represent the basal expression level of MerC (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Laser densitometry of the gel shown in Fig. 4 A revealed that MerC present in vesicles from cells induced for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min represented 1, 6, 9, and 8% of total protein, respectively. Results of Hg2+ uptake assays using these vesicles are shown in Fig. 4 B. The vesicles were diluted for the uptake assay so that the relative concentration of vesicles, as judged from the OD at 550 nm, was the same. From these data it is clear that the uptake level is dependent on the amount of MerC present in the vesicles. This indicates that Hg2+ remains bound to MerC, rather than being released into the interior of the vesicle. The total amount of protein was measured and the amount of MerC in picomoles was calculated using the data from the gel shown to estimate mole of Hg2+ bound per mol of MerC. This value varied between 1.3 and 2.6 Hg2+ per MerC, regardless of whether the total concentration of Hg2+ was 1 or 10 μm, and this too is consistent with uptake and binding to MerC rather than uptake and release. To probe the nature of Hg2+ uptake further, the ability of MerC-containing vesicles to take up mercuric ions under other conditions were examined. First, MerC vesicles were preincubated with 20 mm potassium ascorbate, pH 6.8, and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. These conditions have been shown to drive numerous other periplasmic protein-dependent transport systems by creating an electrochemical gradient across the membrane and/or generating ATP inside vesicles (13Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 38Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation under these conditions did not increase the observed uptake of Hg2+ (Fig.5). Vesicles were also preincubated in Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.3, containing sucrose (0–1 m). Under conditions of increased osmotic pressure one would expect to see decreased uptake, if Hg2+ were transported across the membrane and released into the interior, as has been observed for histidine uptake (38Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there was no effect of increasing sucrose concentrations on the uptake of mercuric ions (Fig. 5). Finally, vesicles were also preincubated for 1 h with 0.05% Triton X-100. This treatment should render the vesicles leaky, so that any substance released into the vesicle interior could leak out again. The Triton X-100-treated vesicles exhibited reduced Hg2+uptake, to about 60% of that shown by vesicles not treated with Triton X-100, but still 4 times higher uptake than the control vesicles (Fig.5). All these data provide further evidence that Hg2+ is not transported across the membrane and released, but rather that the ions remain bound to MerC in the vesicle membrane. MerC was purified both in the presence and absence of cysteine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After cell breakage and ultracentrifugation MerC was found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4), so initially several different detergents were tested for their ability to solubilize it. Tween 20, n-octyl glucoside, CHAPS, and deoxycholate all solubilized MerC poorly (data not shown), whereas both Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100 gave good and relatively selective solubilization (Fig. 1, lanes 5"

Previous studies conducted with nuclear extracts suggested an ATP requirement for the cleavage step. We have reexamined the cofactor requirement, initially with the SV40 late pre-mRNA, which requires for cleavage four protein factors, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, cleavage stimulation factor, cleavage factor I, and cleavage factor II. Using highly purified preparations of these factors, which lacked detectable creatine phosphokinase and ATPase activities, creatine phosphate (CP) was, surprisingly, found to be sufficient to promote efficient cleavage.

Notably, ATP was neither necessary nor sufficient, and could in fact inhibit the reaction. Treatment of the purified factors with hexokinase plus glucose (to deplete any contaminating ATP) was without effect, as was addition of EDTA. Using32P-labeled CP, we found that neither hydrolysis of CP nor phosphate transfer from CP occurred during the cleavage reaction. CP also allowed cleavage of the adenovirus 2 L3 pre-mRNA. However, in this case, ATP both enhanced the reaction and influenced the precise site of cleavage, perhaps reflecting the requirement of poly(A) polymerase for cleavage of this RNA.

All eukaryotic mRNAs, with the exception of major histone mRNAs, have a poly(A) tail at their 3′ end. The process generating the poly(A) tail, referred to as 3′ end formation, involves endonucleolytic cleavage of the precursor RNA followed by the sequential addition of adenylate residues. 3′ end formation is an essential step in the maturation of pre-mRNAs, and it appears to be coupled with other events in the nucleus, including transcription termination (1Whitelaw E.

In mammalian cells, two RNA sequence elements are essential for efficient 3′ end formation. One is the highly conserved hexanucleotide AAUAAA located 10–30 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site, and the other is a less conserved GU- or U-rich sequence that lies just downstream of the cleavage site (for review, see Ref. 14Proudfoot N. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Accurate and efficient cleavage requires five protein factors: cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), two cleavage factors (CFI and CFII), and, in many cases, PAP (15Takagaki Y.

CPSF consists of at least three subunits (160, 100, and 73) and likely a fourth (30 kDa) that is nonessential in vitro (19Bienroth S. Wahle E. Satler-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) has been purified from HeLa cells and appears also to be a multisubunit factor (31Rηegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), although the roles of both CFI and CFII in cleavage have not been well defined.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is dispensable for cleavage of SV40 late pre-mRNA in vitrobut is required for efficient cleavage of other substrates (Ref. 15Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Following cleavage, CPSF, PAP, and poly(A) binding protein II participate in poly(A) addition (34Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35Sheets M.D. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CstF, CFI, and CFII are not necessary for this reaction in vitro, although whether these factors dissociate from the complex at this stage is not clear. Although the RNA sequences and protein factors responsible for 3′ end formation have been well studied, cofactor requirements for the reaction have been examined only with relatively crude extracts (for review, see Refs. 37Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 38Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Early experiments conducted with unfractionated nuclear extracts suggested that ATP is a necessary cofactor for the cleavage reaction (39Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 40Zhang Z. Cole C.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and for formation of polyadenylation-specific complexes (40Zhang Z. Cole C.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Skolnik-David H. Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 1: 672-682Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Moore C.L.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, several observations have confused the issue. First, the cleavage reaction was found to proceed in the absence of divalent cation and the presence of EDTA (39Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 44Zarkower D. Stephenson P. Sheets M.D. Wickens M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2317-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which would not be expected for an ATP-requiring reaction. Second, the addition of creatine phosphate (CP), commonly used to regenerate ATP by phosphate transfer from CP to ADP (catalyzed by creatine phosphokinase (CPK)), was shown to be sufficient for cleavage in the absence of exogenously added ATP and divalent cation (15Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations could reflect an unusual mechanism of ATP regeneration from endogenous ATP/ADP in the crude protein fractions or indicate that ATP is not in fact necessary for cleavage. We therefore reexamined the cofactor requirement for in vitro cleavage using highly purified factors. Here we present evidence that CP can in fact function as a necessary and sufficient cofactor for efficientin vitro cleavage. Although ATP is not required, it can function as either an inhibitor or an activator of the reaction, depending on the specific substrate, and can also affect the precise cleavage site in PAP-dependent cleavage. Possible mechanisms of CP-activated cleavage are discussed. Creatine phosphate was purchased from Sigma, Calbiochem, and Boehringer Mannheim. Arginine phosphate was from Sigma.32P-Labeled creatine phosphate (2.3 × 107cpm/μg) was enzymatically synthesized from [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN) and creatine (Sigma) by creatine phosphokinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and then purified by MonoQ FPLC. Partial purification of CPSF, CFI, and CFII from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was performed as described (16Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CPSF (0.12 μg/μl) was further purified by heparin-5PW FPLC. CFI (0.4 μg/μl) and CFII (0.15 μg/μl) were MonoS fractions (16Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CstF (0.15 μg/μl) was also a MonoS fraction (purity greater than 90%; Ref. 23Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). CFI was further purified by phenyl-Superose FPLC (PS-CFI; 0.12 μg/μl). Alternatively, the MonoQ low salt fraction (mixture of CFI and CFII; Ref. 16Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was fractionated by heparin-5PW FPLC, MonoS FPLC, and heparin-5PW FPLC (HP-CFI; 0.15 μg/μl). CFII was further purified by MonoS (MSS-CFII; 50 ng/μl), or the MonoQ low salt fraction was fractionated by heparin-5PW FPLC (HP-CFH; 40 ng/ml). Histidine-tagged recombinant bovine PAP (50 ng/μl) was purified fromEscherichia coli (gift of K. G. K. Murthy). All protein fractions were stored in Buffer D (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Details of the CFI and CFII purification procedures will be described elsewhere. 2Y. Hirose, unpublished data. 32P-labeled pre-mRNAs were prepared by SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) from linearized plasmids pG3SVL-A and pG3L3-A, which contain the SV40 late site and adenovirus 2 L3 poly(A) site, respectively (15Takagaki Y. Ryner L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A standard 12.5-μl cleavage reaction mixture contained 0.25 μl of CstF; 2.0 μl of CPSF; 1.75 μl of CFI; 2.0 μl of CFII; 0.25 μl of either Buffer D (for SV40 pre-mRNA) or recombinant bovine PAP (for L3 pre-mRNA); 10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9; 10% glycerol; 25 mm(NH4)2SO4; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.25 mm dithiothreitol; 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol; 0.2–0.5 ng of substrate RNA; 500 ng of E. coli tRNA; and 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, or no divalent cation as indicated, plus the indicated amounts of CP, ATP, or other potential cofactors. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 90–120 min at 30 °C, and purified RNAs were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide, 8.3 m urea gels. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 25 μl of protein mixture (8 μl of CPSF, 1 μl of CstF, 7 μl of CFI, 8 μl of CFII, and 1 μl of Buffer D), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmglucose, 0.6 unit of hexokinase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Selecto Scientific) were washed by elution with deionized water and dried before use. Aliquots (1 μl) taken from reaction mixtures at various time points were diluted with 20 mm EDTA to 20 μl and frozen on dry ice until use. After thawing, diluted samples were spotted on the prepared polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates and developed in 1 mformic acid and 0.5 m LiCl (Figs. 5 A and6 C) or in 0.25 m LiCl (Fig. 6 B).32P-Labeled compounds were visualized by autoradiography.Figure 6CP is not hydrolyzed and ATP is not generated during cleavage.

Ryner L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This observation suggested either that the protein fraction employed contained high ATPase levels, as well as sufficient CPK to regenerate ATP, or that CP functioned as a necessary cofactor for cleavage. We therefore reinvestigated the requirement of CP and/or ATP for 3′ cleavage using protein factors that were more purified than those used in the previous experiments. We first assayed in vitro cleavage reconstituted with an RNA precursor containing the SV40 late poly(A) signal (SV40 pre-mRNA) with highly purified CstF and CPSF and partially purified CFI and CFII prepared from HeLa cell nuclear extracts under standard cleavage conditions, which included 2 mm EDTA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Importantly, these factors all lacked detectable CPK (measured as in Ref. 45Oliver I.T. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and ATPase (measured by hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP) activities when assayed under cleavage reaction conditions, whereas in the presence of Mg2+, CPK activity was again undetectable, and only trace levels of ATPase were observed (data not shown). Fig.1 A shows that, as observed previously with less purified factors, addition of 20 mm CP alone was sufficient to allow efficient cleavage (lane 3), whereas no phosphate compound (lane 1) or ATP alone (1 mm) (lane 4) did not result in detectable cleavage. In fact, the presence of both ATP and CP in the reaction mixture reduced cleavage efficiency (compare Fig. 1, lanes 2and 3, and see below). Fig. 1 B shows that cleavage efficiency increased according to the concentration of CP. Cleavage was greatly reduced at concentrations below 10 and above 60 mm CP (data not shown). We next examined whether a number of other compounds could function as cofactors in the cleavage reaction. Creatine, NaCl, sodium pyrophosphate, and a number of nucleotide tri-, di- or monophosphates were unable to allow cleavage over a wide range of concentrations (Fig.2 A and data not shown; note that GTP reproducibly caused degradation of the substrate). On the other hand, NaPO4 and to a somewhat lesser extent KPO4 did allow cleavage (Fig. 2 B). However, the optimal efficiency of cleavage observed was lower by a factor of six than that observed with CP, as determined by PhosphorImager analysis. Importantly, the same high concentrations of these compounds were required to induce cleavage as was observed with CP. This is significant because NaPO4 can be a trace contaminant of CP, but since such high amounts were necessary, it cannot be the active component in CP (concentrations lower than those shown in Fig.2 B were inactive; data not shown). Given the high concentration of CP required for cleavage, we were concerned about the possibility that a contaminant in the CP preparation other than inorganic phosphate might be the actual cofactor (see also below). To address this, we tested four different preparations of CP obtained from three different sources (one was prepared synthetically, whereas the others were prepared enzymatically; see “Experimental Procedures”) and found that all four preparations of CP behaved identically (data not shown). The Tris and sodium salts of CP also gave indistinguishable results (data not shown). We also tested whether another phosphoguanidine compound, arginine phosphate (AP), which exists only in invertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 46Lyzlova S.N. Stefanov V.E. Phosphagen Kinases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-20Google Scholar), could substitute for CP in the cleavage assay. Strikingly, AP also activated cleavage, and it did so as efficiently as CP (Fig. 2 C). This implies that the phosphoguanido group may be an important structural motif of the cofactor. Importantly, the fact that AP can substitute for CP further argues against the possibility that the CP requirement in fact reflects an ATP requirement, through the activity of undetectable contaminating CPK in the purified factors, because AP can not be used as a substrate by CPK (47Ennor A.H. Morrison J.F. Physiol. Rev. 1958; 38: 631-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the above experiments, we utilized highly purified preparations of CPSF and CstF, whereas the CFI and CFII fractions were less pure (although, as mentioned above, they were free of detectable CPK and ATPase). To provide additional evidence that contaminants in the protein fractions were not in some way responsible for the CP effect, both CFI and CFII were subjected to additional purification steps (see “Experimental Procedures”), and two different preparations of each were used in cleavage assays, as above. Under standard reaction conditions (a solution containing 2 mm EDTA and no ATP), CP was again found to be essential for cleavage, activating the reaction in a concentration-dependent manner, nearly identical to the results observed with the less pure cleavage factors (Fig.3). The above results suggest that CP, not ATP, can be a necessary and sufficient cofactor for efficient 3′ cleavage in vitro. However, given the unexpected nature of this finding, we investigated more extensively the possible role of ATP in 3′ cleavage of the SV40 pre-mRNA. We first tested the effect of increasing concentrations of exogenous ATP on cleavage. Fig. 4 A shows that ATP concentrations as high as 10 mm did not allow detectable cleavage in the presence of either 0.5 mmMgCl2 (lanes 2–4) or 2 mm EDTA (lanes 7–9), whereas CP alone allowed efficient cleavage under both reaction conditions (lanes 5 and 10). As shown above (Fig. 1 A), cleavage in the presence of both ATP and CP appeared less efficient than cleavage in the presence of CP alone. We therefore examined the effect of increasing ATP concentrations on cleavage activated by 40 mm CP. Fig.4 B shows that ATP indeed inhibited cleavage effected by CP in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of either 0.5 mm MgCl2 (lanes 2–4) or 2 mm EDTA (lanes 6–8). In contrast, high concentrations of EDTA (up to 8 mm) had no significant effect on cleavage efficiency (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–4). These findings strengthen the conclusions that divalent cations are not required for cleavage and that ATP is not only not required but can in fact be inhibitory. We next examined the possibility that a bound form of ATP, perhaps tightly associated with a purified factor(s), might participate in cleavage. To this end, cleavage was assayed using factors treated with hexokinase and glucose to remove any endogenous ATP. Depletion of endogenous ATP by conversion to glucose 6 phosphate was monitored via addition of trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP and was analyzed by TLC. After incubation of purified factors with hexokinase and glucose for 10 min in the presence of MgCl2, the exogenous ATP was entirely depleted (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and 5). EDTA and substrate pre-mRNA were then added, and reaction mixtures were incubated for the times indicated in Fig. 5, after which RNA products and ATP were both analyzed. Although no labeled ATP was generated at any time during the incubation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–4 and lanes 6–8), efficient cleavage was detected when CP was added (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4), but not when ATP was added (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6–8). Identical results (not shown) were obtained in the absence of added EDTA, which would allow the hexokinase to remain active throughout the incubation. Taken together, the above results indicate that 3′ cleavage occurs efficiently in the absence of ATP. CP has a large free energy of hydrolysis (−10.3 kcal/mol; reviewed in Ref. 46Lyzlova S.N.

These points raise the possibility that CP could function as a direct energy donor during the cleavage reaction. To examine this, we tested whether hydrolysis of CP occurs during the cleavage reaction.32P-Labeled CP was prepared by enzymatic reaction from [γ-32P]ATP and creatine and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hydrolysis of CP during the cleavage reaction was monitored by removing small aliquots from reaction mixtures containing trace amounts of 32P-labeled CP and 40 mm unlabeled CP at the times indicated in Fig.6 and then analyzing the fate of the CP by TLC. Whereas efficient cleavage proceeded during the incubation (Fig. 6 A), neither hydrolyzed inorganic phosphate (Fig.6 B) nor ATP, conceivably generated by transferring the phosphate group from CP to possible endogenous ADP (Fig.6 C), was detected. These results suggest that CP is neither an energy donor for cleavage nor a phosphate source to produce ATP. This latter finding further excludes the possibility that the observed CP requirement reflects ATP regeneration by CPK contamination in the purified factors. Also, SDS gel electrophoresis of reaction mixtures following incubation with labeled CP failed to provide any evidence of protein phosphorylation (results not shown). We next wished to determine whether our findings could be extended to other pre-mRNAs, which, unlike SV40 late, require PAP for cleavage. We therefore examined the substrate specificity of the CP effect on cleavage by using a pre-mRNA containing the adenovirus L3 poly(A) signal (48Ryner L.C. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), purified factors as above, and recombinant bovine PAP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 7shows that no cleavage was detected in the absence of CP (lanes 1 and 5), but processing was observed as the concentration of CP was increased (lanes 2–4 and6–8). However, in this case, cleavage was inefficient, and addition of 1 mm ATP with CP greatly enhanced cleavage efficiency (compare lanes 2–4 and lanes 6–8). Note, however, that reaction mixtures contained no divalent cation, suggesting that the role of ATP is likely unusual. It is also noteworthy that assays with ATP yielded two different size upstream cleavage products (Fig. 7, lanes 6–8), whereas assays without ATP yielded only the longer one (Fig. 7, lanes 2–4). These results suggest that ATP can influence the precise site of endonucleolytic cleavage. Such heterogeneity in cleavage site specification with L3 pre-mRNA has also been observed by other groups in the presence of 3′ dATP (49Gilmartin G.M. McDevitt M.A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Prescott J.C. Falck-Pedersen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8175-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed similar heterogeneity in the presence of 3′ dATP, but in this case, the shorter upstream cleavage product was less prominent than in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggest that CP also functions as a necessary cofactor for cleavage of L3 pre-mRNA, but ATP enhances cleavage efficiency and affects the local choice of cleavage sites. ATP has until now been thought to be an essential cofactor for endonucleolytic cleavage of pre-mRNAs containing 3′ end processing signals. In contrast, CP has been assumed to act as a reservoi"
https://openalex.org/W2053813388,"The mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is an oligomeric complex composed of three membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum: ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. In addition, sequence homology between the Ost2 subunit of the yeast OST complex and Dad1 (defender against apoptotic death) suggests that Dad1 may represent a fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex. In attempts to elucidate the structural organization of this complex, we have studied the interactions among its subunits. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have shown that the luminal domains of RI and RII (RIL and RIIL, respectively) interacted with the luminal domain of OST48 (OST48L), but no direct interaction was observed between RIL and RIIL.

Deletion analyses using the yeast two-hybrid system showed that subdomain of RIL or RIIL adjacent to the respective transmembrane domains interacted with OST48L. Of the three equal length subdomains of OST48L, the one at the N terminus and the one next to the transmembrane domain interacted with RIL. None of these three subdomains of OST48L interacted with RIIL. The yeast two-hybrid assay also revealed affinity between the cytoplasmically located N-terminal region of Dad1 and the short cytoplasmic tail of OST48, thus placing Dad1 firmly into the OST complex.

It was found that the OST forms an oligomeric complex that sediments in a sucrose gradient as a 10 S particle. This complex was composed of three integral membrane proteins, of which ribophorin I (RI) (5Harnik-Ort V. Prakash K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are type I transmembrane proteins with most of their polypeptide chains facing the lumen of the ER (Fig. 1). The third member of the complex, ribophorin II (RII), also has a large luminal domain, but the disposition of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is less clear: although this region bears three hydrophobic domains (6Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Pirozzi G. Zhou Z. D'Eustachio P. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), only the one most proximal to the N terminus is of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to function as a typical transmembrane domain and RII may, therefore, also have a type I disposition, like RI and OST48 (Fig. 1).

Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the basis of homology to the yeast OST proteins, it was possible to identify another mammalian protein as a potential OST component. Dad1 (defender against apoptotic death) was originally cloned by Nakashimaet al. (17Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as a gene with a temperature-sensitive point mutation that triggers apoptosis at the non-permissive temperature. On the basis of its 40% sequence identity with the yeast Ost2 protein, a membrane protein that copurified with the yeast OST complex (11Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Dad1 represented a possible fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex. This conclusion was most recently confirmed when Dad1 was shown to copurify with RI, RII, and OST48 (18Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Dad1 is a small hydrophobic protein with a cytoplasmically located N terminus and up to three transmembrane domains (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As is true for the other subunits of the OST, the precise role of Dad1 inN-glycosylation is not known.In native rough microsomal membranes, components of the OST complex such as the ribophorins are in close proximity to membrane-bound ribosomes, since they can be chemically cross-linked to the 60 S ribosomal subunit (19Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-specific antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic domain of RI, but not those against the luminal domain of the protein, inhibited the targeting to microsomal membranes of ribosome-nascent chain complexes formed in a cell-free translation mixture (20Yu Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ribophorins are also adjacent to the polypeptide translocation site. This conclusion is in agreement with recent studies, showing that during the purification of the Sec61p complex, in which dog pancreas rough microsomes were extracted with certain detergents at different ionic strength, the subunits of the OST complex, RI and RII and OST48, remained tightly associated with the Sec61p complex (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The Sec61p complex, which is composed of an α, β, and γ subunit, is a key component of the translocation apparatus since it not only forms the translocation pore but has also ribosome binding activity (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 22Kalies K.-U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).It may be expected that the enzymatic activity of the OST complex is dependent on the integrity of the oligomeric assembly of its subunits. The long range goal of our studies is to understand the contribution of each OST protein to the overall function of the complex, which is likely to be related to the spatial relationship among the components of OST complex. We present here the first information about specific interactions among the OST subunits. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach in conjunction with in vitro binding studies, we demonstrated that the luminal domain of OST48 interacts with the luminal domains of RI and RII, but we detected no direct interactions between RIL and RIIL. Furthermore, we found that the cytoplasmically located N-terminal region of Dad1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of OST48 and that cytoplasmic domains of RI interact with each other in a homotypic fashion.DISCUSSIONThe yeast two-hybrid system has been used successfully to characterize interactions of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic proteins and the cytoplasmic or extracellular domains of membrane proteins from a variety of organisms (30Fields S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed for the first time to detect interactions between protein domains that are normally within the ER lumen, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. In contrast to the cytosol and the nucleoplasm, the lumen of the ER is characterized by high calcium concentrations. It is also the site where RIL and RIIL are normally N-glycosylated (1Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 459-553Google Scholar). Since the yeast two-hybrid test functions in the nucleoplasm of yeast cells, which is not a high calcium environment, it appears that interactions between the luminal domain of OST48 and those of RI and RII are not dependent on the presence of high calcium levels. Likewise, it appears that RI and RII, which are glycosylated in the native state, but not in the yeast two-hybrid system, do not need to be glycosylated to interact with OST48. Evidence that N-glycosylation of RII may not be required for its proper oligomerization and functioning is provided by the fact that, in vivo, only about half of the molecules are glycosylated (6Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).As mentioned in the Introduction, the oligosaccharyltransferase activity was first purified from canine pancreas rough microsomal membranes, and initially three subunits RI, RII, and OST48 were identified as part of an oligomeric complex (4Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Later the corresponding yeast enzyme was isolated and shown to contain Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, and Ost2p (which are homologous to the mammalian OST subunits RI, RII, OST48, and Dad1, respectively) as well as two additional polypeptides (Ost3p and Ost5p). The first four subunits are essential for viability of haploid yeast cells and are required for oligosaccharyltransferase activity as demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro assays (11Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 83-92Google Scholar). It was observed that Ost2p, a subunit of the yeast complex, showed 40% sequence identity with the mammalian protein Dad1 as described before. Dad1 was characterized as an integral membrane protein that suppresses apoptotic cell death and a specific temperature-sensitive mutation in the corresponding gene triggered apoptosis at the non-permissive temperature (17Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that Dad1 is a fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex, which was recently confirmed by biochemical means (18Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It appears therefore that underglycosylation of certain proteins caused by the temperature-sensitive point mutation in the dad1 gene results in apoptosis. The notion that inhibition ofN-glycosylation may indeed lead to apoptosis was recently demonstrated by treating human promyelocytic HL-60 cells with tunicamycin. It was shown that this drug, which interferes with the synthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide, triggers the apoptotic death of these cells (35Perez-sala D. Mollinedo F. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence that Dad1 interacts with OST48 via cytoplasmically exposed domains, which strongly supports the notion that Dad1 is indeed a fourth subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complex.The finding that the cytoplasmic domains of RI interact with each other in a homotypic fashion is not completely unexpected. Our previous analysis of the conformation of the RI sequence revealed that the cytoplasmic portion of RI is likely to form α-helical domains (5Harnik-Ort V. Prakash K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and helical wheel analysis provided evidence for two short heptad repeats (amino acids 527–537 and 572–583). The formation of leucine zipper-like structures may, therefore, interconnect adjacent oligosaccharyltransferase complexes. This type of interaction may be part of the mechanism that integrates the OST complex into a proteinaceous network formed by the components of translocation apparatus. The existence of such a proteinaceous network has been inferred from our previous results showing that the components of the translocation apparatus, including membrane-bound ribosomes, form large oligomeric arrays that define the domain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are physically excluded from small transport vesicles that bud from the transitional elements of the ER (1Sabatini D.D.

Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the oligosaccharyltransferase complex is located in the immediate vicinity of the protein translocation channel (19Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Yu Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and tightly bound to the Sec61p complex (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), interactions among these components would provide a mechanism to segregate the components of the translocation apparatus, including the OST complex, to the rough domain of the ER (36Kreibich G. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic domain of RI is not conserved in its yeast homologue Ost1, the homotypic interaction between RIC may be a unique feature of mammalian cells.Our findings concerning the interactions between the mammalian OST subunits, OST48 and RII, are also supported by genetic tests and chemical cross-linking studies performed on the yeast OST. te Heesenet al. (12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression ofSWP1 results in the suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the WBP1-2 mutation and that Swp1p can be cross-linked to Wbp1p when yeast membrane fractions, solubilized with Triton X-100, are treated with a reversible cross-linking reagent (12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of RII with its yeast homologue Swp1p reveals that the Swp1p represents a truncated form of RII lacking about two-thirds of the N-terminal portion of the luminal domain (13Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conserved luminal domain of Swp1p is homologous to the subdomain of RIIL (RII388–516) that is responsible for the interaction with OST48L. By analogy to our findings on the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complex, this portion of Swp1p is expected to interact with the luminal domain of Wbp1. Support for the observed interaction between Dad1 and OST48 was also obtained for the yeast homologues. Silberstein et al. (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated that theOST2 gene is a suppressor of the WBP1-2 mutation and that overexpression of Ost2p increases the stability of Wbp1p and Swp1p (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct physical interaction among Wbp1, Swp1, and Ost2, which is analogous to the interactions that occur among the mammalian homologues OST48, RII, and Dad1. Although the sequence homology between the mammalian OST subunits and their yeast counterparts is not very high (22–28% identity for RII, OST48, and RI and 40% for Dad1) (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the near neighbor relationships between the subunits of the OST complexes of these phylogenetically distant species appear to be well conserved. This may be expected, since the reactions catalyzed by the yeast or the mammalian enzyme complexes are identical. A more detailed structural analysis of both OST complexes may, in fact, allow us to identify functionally important domains within the respective subunits. During their translocation into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, polypeptides made on membrane-bound polysomes may be cotranslationally modified by N-glycosylation (1Sabatini D.D.

This complex was composed of three integral membrane proteins, of which ribophorin I (RI) (5Harnik-Ort V. Prakash K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are type I transmembrane proteins with most of their polypeptide chains facing the lumen of the ER (Fig. 1). The third member of the complex, ribophorin II (RII), also has a large luminal domain, but the disposition of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is less clear: although this region bears three hydrophobic domains (6Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Pirozzi G. Zhou Z. D'Eustachio P. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), only the one most proximal to the N terminus is of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to function as a typical transmembrane domain and RII may, therefore, also have a type I disposition, like RI and OST48 (Fig. 1). The OST complex was later purified from other mammalian species (9Breuer W. Bause E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Kumar V. Heinemann F.S. Ozols J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast OST complex contains apparently six subunits (11Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol.

Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the basis of homology to the yeast OST proteins, it was possible to identify another mammalian protein as a potential OST component. Dad1 (defender against apoptotic death) was originally cloned by Nakashimaet al. (17Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) as a gene with a temperature-sensitive point mutation that triggers apoptosis at the non-permissive temperature. On the basis of its 40% sequence identity with the yeast Ost2 protein, a membrane protein that copurified with the yeast OST complex (11Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Dad1 represented a possible fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex. This conclusion was most recently confirmed when Dad1 was shown to copurify with RI, RII, and OST48 (18Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Dad1 is a small hydrophobic protein with a cytoplasmically located N terminus and up to three transmembrane domains (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As is true for the other subunits of the OST, the precise role of Dad1 inN-glycosylation is not known. In native rough microsomal membranes, components of the OST complex such as the ribophorins are in close proximity to membrane-bound ribosomes, since they can be chemically cross-linked to the 60 S ribosomal subunit (19Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-specific antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic domain of RI, but not those against the luminal domain of the protein, inhibited the targeting to microsomal membranes of ribosome-nascent chain complexes formed in a cell-free translation mixture (20Yu Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ribophorins are also adjacent to the polypeptide translocation site. This conclusion is in agreement with recent studies, showing that during the purification of the Sec61p complex, in which dog pancreas rough microsomes were extracted with certain detergents at different ionic strength, the subunits of the OST complex, RI and RII and OST48, remained tightly associated with the Sec61p complex (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The Sec61p complex, which is composed of an α, β, and γ subunit, is a key component of the translocation apparatus since it not only forms the translocation pore but has also ribosome binding activity (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 22Kalies K.-U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It may be expected that the enzymatic activity of the OST complex is dependent on the integrity of the oligomeric assembly of its subunits. The long range goal of our studies is to understand the contribution of each OST protein to the overall function of the complex, which is likely to be related to the spatial relationship among the components of OST complex. We present here the first information about specific interactions among the OST subunits. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach in conjunction with in vitro binding studies, we demonstrated that the luminal domain of OST48 interacts with the luminal domains of RI and RII, but we detected no direct interactions between RIL and RIIL. Furthermore, we found that the cytoplasmically located N-terminal region of Dad1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of OST48 and that cytoplasmic domains of RI interact with each other in a homotypic fashion. DISCUSSIONThe yeast two-hybrid system has been used successfully to characterize interactions of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic proteins and the cytoplasmic or extracellular domains of membrane proteins from a variety of organisms (30Fields S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Zhang Y.X. Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed for the first time to detect interactions between protein domains that are normally within the ER lumen, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. In contrast to the cytosol and the nucleoplasm, the lumen of the ER is characterized by high calcium concentrations. It is also the site where RIL and RIIL are normally N-glycosylated (1Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 459-553Google Scholar). Since the yeast two-hybrid test functions in the nucleoplasm of yeast cells, which is not a high calcium environment, it appears that interactions between the luminal domain of OST48 and those of RI and RII are not dependent on the presence of high calcium levels. Likewise, it appears that RI and RII, which are glycosylated in the native state, but not in the yeast two-hybrid system, do not need to be glycosylated to interact with OST48. Evidence that N-glycosylation of RII may not be required for its proper oligomerization and functioning is provided by the fact that, in vivo, only about half of the molecules are glycosylated (6Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).As mentioned in the Introduction, the oligosaccharyltransferase activity was first purified from canine pancreas rough microsomal membranes, and initially three subunits RI, RII, and OST48 were identified as part of an oligomeric complex (4Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Later the corresponding yeast enzyme was isolated and shown to contain Ost1p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, and Ost2p (which are homologous to the mammalian OST subunits RI, RII, OST48, and Dad1, respectively) as well as two additional polypeptides (Ost3p and Ost5p). The first four subunits are essential for viability of haploid yeast cells and are required for oligosaccharyltransferase activity as demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro assays (11Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 83-92Google Scholar). It was observed that Ost2p, a subunit of the yeast complex, showed 40% sequence identity with the mammalian protein Dad1 as described before. Dad1 was characterized as an integral membrane protein that suppresses apoptotic cell death and a specific temperature-sensitive mutation in the corresponding gene triggered apoptosis at the non-permissive temperature (17Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that Dad1 is a fourth subunit of the mammalian OST complex, which was recently confirmed by biochemical means (18Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It appears therefore that underglycosylation of certain proteins caused by the temperature-sensitive point mutation in the dad1 gene results in apoptosis. The notion that inhibition ofN-glycosylation may indeed lead to apoptosis was recently demonstrated by treating human promyelocytic HL-60 cells with tunicamycin. It was shown that this drug, which interferes with the synthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide, triggers the apoptotic death of these cells (35Perez-sala D. Mollinedo F. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 163: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study we provide evidence that Dad1 interacts with OST48 via cytoplasmically exposed domains, which strongly supports the notion that Dad1 is indeed a fourth subunit of the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complex.The finding that the cytoplasmic domains of RI interact with each other in a homotypic fashion is not completely unexpected. Our previous analysis of the conformation of the RI sequence revealed that the cytoplasmic portion of RI is likely to form α-helical domains (5Harnik-Ort V. Prakash K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and helical wheel analysis provided evidence for two short heptad repeats (amino acids 527–537 and 572–583). The formation of leucine zipper-like structures may, therefore, interconnect adjacent oligosaccharyltransferase complexes. This type of interaction may be part of the mechanism that integrates the OST complex into a proteinaceous network formed by the components of translocation apparatus. The existence of such a proteinaceous network has been inferred from our previous results showing that the components of the translocation apparatus, including membrane-bound ribosomes, form large oligomeric arrays that define the domain of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and are physically excluded from small transport vesicles that bud from the transitional elements of the ER (1Sabatini D.D.

Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the oligosaccharyltransferase complex is located in the immediate vicinity of the protein translocation channel (19Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Yu Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and tightly bound to the Sec61p complex (21Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), interactions among these components would provide a mechanism to segregate the components of the translocation apparatus, including the OST complex, to the rough domain of the ER (36Kreibich G. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 464-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic domain of RI is not conserved in its yeast homologue Ost1, the homotypic interaction between RIC may be a unique feature of mammalian cells.Our findings concerning the interactions between the mammalian OST subunits, OST48 and RII, are also supported by genetic tests and chemical cross-linking studies performed on the yeast OST. te Heesenet al. (12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression ofSWP1 results in the suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the WBP1-2 mutation and that Swp1p can be cross-linked to Wbp1p when yeast membrane fractions, solubilized with Triton X-100, are treated with a reversible cross-linking reagent (12te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of RII with its yeast homologue Swp1p reveals that the Swp1p represents a truncated form of RII lacking about two-thirds of the N-terminal portion of the luminal domain (13Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conserved luminal domain of Swp1p is homologous to the subdomain of RIIL (RII388–516) that is responsible for the interaction with OST48L. By analogy to our findings on the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complex, this portion of Swp1p is expected to interact with the luminal domain of Wbp1. Support for the observed interaction between Dad1 and OST48 was also obtained for the yeast homologues. Silberstein et al. (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated that theOST2 gene is a suppressor of the WBP1-2 mutation and that overexpression of Ost2p increases the stability of Wbp1p and Swp1p (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct physical interaction among Wbp1, Swp1, and Ost2, which is analogous to the interactions that occur among the mammalian homologues OST48, RII, and Dad1. Although the sequence homology between the mammalian OST subunits and their yeast counterparts is not very high (22–28% identity for RII, OST48, and RI and 40% for Dad1) (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the near neighbor relationships between the subunits of the OST complexes of these phylogenetically distant species appear to be well conserved. This may be expected, since the reactions catalyzed by the yeast or the mammalian enzyme complexes are identical. A more detailed structural analysis of both OST complexes may, in fact, allow us to identify functionally important domains within the respective subunits. The yeast two-hybrid system has been used successfully to characterize interactions of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic proteins and the cytoplasmic or extracellular domains of membrane proteins from a variety of organisms (30Fields S.

The conserved luminal domain of Swp1p is homologous to the subdomain of RIIL (RII388–516) that is responsible for the interaction with OST48L. By analogy to our findings on the mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase complex, this portion of Swp1p is expected to interact with the luminal domain of Wbp1. Support for the observed interaction between Dad1 and OST48 was also obtained for the yeast homologues. Silberstein et al. (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated that theOST2 gene is a suppressor of the WBP1-2 mutation and that overexpression of Ost2p increases the stability of Wbp1p and Swp1p (16Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results suggest a direct physical interaction among Wbp1, Swp1, and Ost2, which is analogous to the interactions that occur among the mammalian homologues OST48, RII, and Dad1. Although the sequence homology between the mammalian OST subunits and their yeast counterparts is not very high (22–28% identity for RII, OST48, and RI and 40% for Dad1) (2Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the near neighbor relationships between the subunits of the OST complexes of these phylogenetically distant species appear to be well conserved. This may be expected, since the reactions catalyzed by the yeast or the mammalian enzyme complexes are identical. A more detailed structural analysis of both OST complexes may, in fact, allow us to identify functionally important domains within the respective subunits.

We previously showed that RXR self-associates into tetramers with a high affinity and that ligand binding induces rapid dissociation of receptor tetramers to smaller species. Here, the RXR region that is responsible for mediating tetramer formation is identified. It is shown that this interface, which we term the “tetramerization domain,” critically contains two consecutive phenylalanine residues located at the C-terminal region of the receptor. Mutation of these residues is sufficient to disrupt RXR tetramers without affecting the overall fold of the protein or interfering with ligand binding, dimer formation, or DNA binding by the receptor. Nevertheless, the tetramer-impaired mutant was found to be transcriptionally defective. The newly characterized tetramerization domain and the previously identified main dimerization interface of RXR act autonomously to affect separate intersubunit interactions that, overall, lead to formation of tetramers. Protein-protein interactions mediated by the tetramerization domain, but not those that involve the dimerization interface, are disrupted following ligand binding by RXR. Overall, these data attest to the specificity of the interaction and implicate the tetramerization interface in playing a direct role in regulating transcriptional activation by RXR.

RXR can bind to cognate DNA with a high affinity as a homodimer (16Zhang X.-K. Lenmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M.

In contrast, homodimers of other members of the hormone nuclear receptor family, such as RAR, VDR, PPAR, and TR, bind to cognate DNA weakly and are inefficient transcriptional regulators. Instead, these receptors form heterodimers with RXR and their activities seem to be exerted mainly via these heterodimers (24Yu V. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y.

The precise role of RXR within heterodimers is not completely understood at the present time. It has been proposed that RXR within RXR-RAR heterodimers does not associate with its ligand and thus serves as a transcriptionally silent partner (31Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 32Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 542-550Google Scholar). In conflict with this notion, it has been demonstrated that neither the equilibrium binding affinity nor the kinetic parameters of the interactions of RXR with its ligand are affected by formation of RXR-RAR heterodimers regardless of whether the heterodimers are in solution or bound to cognate DNA (33Apfel C.M.

It is well documented that ligands are important for transcriptional regulation by hormone nuclear receptors, but the molecular mechanisms by which ligands modulate the activities of their receptors have only recently begun to be elucidated. Binding of ligands to RAR and to TR results in the release of a corepressor that associates with the unliganded receptors (41Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

This corepressor associates only very weakly with RXR, suggesting that ligand-dependent activation of RXR operates via a different mechanism (42Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B.

Activation of RXR is likely to involve several coactivators and general transcription factors that have been shown to associate with this receptor in a ligand-enhanced fashion (47Le Douarin B.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Another important clue regarding the mechanism of activation of RXR emerged from the recent reports that RXR self-associates to form tetramers with a high affinity and that the oligomeric state of the receptor is regulated by its ligand (55Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 56Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 57Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14263-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggested that ligand-dependent modulation of the oligomeric state of RXR might serve to regulate the activity of the receptor. It was demonstrated that, in the absence of ligand, RXR tetramers comprise the predominant species of the receptor at concentrations that are higher than about 70 nm. It was shown further that upon addition of ligand, RXR tetramers rapidly dissociate to dimers and monomers (18Kersten S. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12771-12777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,56Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations led to the suggestion that RXR serves as its own “corepressor,” i.e. that tetramer formation by this receptor functions to sequester active species, i.e. dimers and monomers, into a transcriptionally inactive, tetrameric complex. Ligand binding induces a conformational change that results in dissociation into dimers and monomers, thereby activating both the homodimeric and the heterodimeric RXR signaling pathways. It was therefore proposed that ligand-induced dissociation of RXR tetramers is an essential step in transcriptional activation mediated by this receptor. Inherent in the hypothesis that RXR tetramers serve to silence the transcriptional activity of the receptor is that a region in RXR that is necessary for transcriptional activation is masked within tetramers. One region of RXR that is expected to be masked within tetramers is the interface that mediates tetramer formation. The present work was undertaken to identify this region and to explore whether it is important for the transcriptional activity of the receptor. The results of this work led to the identification of the RXR region that mediates tetramer formation. It is demonstrated that mutation of two amino acid residues within this region results in disruption of RXR tetramers without affecting the overall fold of the receptor and without impairing its ligand binding, dimerization, or DNA binding functions. Nevertheless, it is shown that disruption of the tetramerization interface diminishes the ability of RXR to activate transcription of a reporter gene. These results implicate the tetramerization region in playing a direct role in transcriptional activation by RXR. All Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed with Vent-polymerase using the following cycling times: 90 s at 94 °C, 120 s at 55 °C, and 180 s at 72 °C. mRXRα-LBD, mRXRαΔAB, and mRXRα-LBDΔH12 were prepared by PCR amplification of the respective regions of mRXRα. Primer sequences are available upon request. Purified PCR fragments were subcloned either into theNdeI-EcoRI sites of pET15b or into theNdeI-XhoI sites of pET28a. Plasmids were initially transfected into the Escherichia coli strain DH5 and, following verification and amplification, into E. coliBL21 (DE3) for protein expression. For preparation of site-specific mutants of mRXRαΔAB, two separate, partially overlapping PCR fragments were generated using either wild-type mRXRα or mutant mRXRαΔAB as a template. The sequences of the primers used for PCR are available upon request. Mutant sequences were verified by automated sequencing carried out at the Cornell Biotechnology Center.

All proteins used in the current study exhibited equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) for 9cRA in the range of 4–26 nm and a number of ligand binding sites in the range of 0.65–0.9 mol/mol of protein, i.e. all mutant proteins possessed wild-type affinity for this ligand.

A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) by following the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of RXR (λex = 280 nm, λem = 340 nm) upon titration with ligand. Protein (1 μm) was titrated with 9cRA from a concentrated solution in ethanol. The dissociation constant and number of binding sites were calculated by fitting the fluorescence data to an equation derived from simple binding theory. Non-linear least squares regressions were carried out using the software Origin (MicroCal, Inc.). DNA encoding RXR (or mutant), CAT reporter vector, and pCH110 (ratio 1:20:20) at a final concentration of 20 mg/100-mm plate was used to transfect HeLa cells following a standard calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol (59Ostrowski J.

Cells with DNA precipitates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 17–20 h, washed with PBS, and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% delipidated serum. After several hours of recovery, cells were treated with various concentrations of 9cRA in the range of 10−10–10−6m and incubated at 37 °C for another 18 h. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of cold PBS, transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and kept on ice. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 5 min in a Beckman GPKR centrifuge. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were drained for several minutes. Drained pellets were resuspended in 250 ml of cold 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were prepared by three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles (5 min on dry ice, 5 min at 37 °C). Cellular debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microfuge for 10 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of cell extracts were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. Retinoid efficacy was measured by the concentration of induced CAT gene product in the extracts from transfected cells, using CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder CO). CAT activity was routinely normalized for transfection efficiency by the β-galactosidase activity. We previously suggested that ligand binding activates RXR by inducing dissociation of receptor tetramers into dimers and monomers (18Kersten S. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12771-12777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 55Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). According to this model, RXR dimers and monomers (via heterodimers) are able to activate transcription, while tetramers are transcriptionally silent. This model proposes further that the inability of RXR tetramers to activate transcription might be due to masking of region(s) necessary for transcriptional activation within the tetrameric structure. One region of RXR that is expected to be masked within tetramers is the interface that mediates the formation of tetramers. We thus set out to localize the region responsible for tetramerization of RXR. A scheme outlining the domain structure of mRXRα and detailing the amino acid residues that are of particular interest in the context of the present study is shown in Fig. 1. The search for the region in RXR that is involved in tetramer formation by the receptor could be somewhat narrowed based on our previous observations that the N-terminal A/B region of RXRα is not required for tetramerization (18Kersten S. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12771-12777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 55Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the tetramerization interface of RXR is likely to reside within domains C–E of the receptor. Dimer formation by retinoid receptors is known to be mediated by a strong dimerization function in the ligand binding domain (LBD) and a weaker dimerization function in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of these proteins (61Mader S. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 62Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The main homodimerization function of RXR was shown by x-ray crystallography to be located within helix 10 of the LBD (64Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Formation of tetramers often requires protein-protein interactions involving two protein regions, such that one of these regions is involved in formation of dimers while the second region acts to attach two dimers together. In principle, these two regions might operate independently. Helix 10 of the LBD is thus expected to participate in tetramer formation by RXR as it contains one of the interaction interfaces. The second interaction surface necessary for tetramer formation could potentially be located within the RXR-DBD, a domain that by itself forms dimers when bound to cognate DNA (61Mader S. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To examine whether the RXR-DBD contributes to tetramer formation, an RXR deletion mutant lacking this domain was prepared. The mRXRα-LBD was expressed inE. coli as a histidine-tagged protein and purified, and its oligomeric state was examined by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2). It was previously shown that truncated RXR lacking the A/B domain (RXRΔAB) is resolved by native PAGE into three distinct bands corresponding to protein monomers, dimers, and tetramers, where the dimeric and tetrameric bands display a high intensity and the monomeric band is faint and, in some cases, not observed (55Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding of ligand by the receptor induces dissociation of RXR tetramers leading to a significant decrease in the intensity of the slower moving, tetrameric band and to an enhancement in the faster moving, dimeric band (56Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 Ashow that the RXR-LBD was similarly resolved by native PAGE into two bands with differential mobilities and that the intensity of the slower moving band significantly decreased while the faster moving band was enhanced upon addition of an RXR ligand. A similar pattern was observed at RXR-LBD concentrations as low as 1 μm. Ferguson analysis of the two bands revealed that their mobilities corresponded to molecular masses of 52 and 112 kDa (data not shown), verifying that the two bands reflect the presence of RXR-LBD dimers and tetramers (calculated molecular masses of 56 and 112 kDa, respectively). As previously noted for RXRΔAB (56Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), ligand binding resulted in a conformational change in rece"

We have carried out a systematic analysis of the phenotypes associated with Ala insertions into transmembrane helices in lactose permease, a multispanningEscherichia coli inner membrane protein. Insertion of alanine into the center of 7 transmembrane helices was found to abolish stable integration of lactose permease into the membrane or uphill lactose transport. A more detailed Ala insertion scan was made of transmembrane helix III. The results pin-point a central region of ∼2 helical turns that is crucial for lactose permease stability and/or activity. A Trp scan in this region identified 2 residues essential for lactose permease stability. From these results, it appears that transmembrane helices have differential sensitivities to single residue insertions and that such mutations may be useful for identifying structurally and/or functionally important helix segments.

Like globular proteins, integral membrane proteins appear to be highly resilient to point mutations, both in their membrane-spanning and extra-membraneous domains (1Wen J.A. Chen X. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Insertion mutants, on the other hand, are expected to be generally disruptive, at least when introduced into the transmembrane α-helices (2Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the phenotypic effects of insertion mutants in transmembrane helices have not been systematically tested nor have their potential use as a general approach to discriminate between structurally and functionally important and unimportant parts of transmembrane helices been assessed.In an initial study, we demonstrated that Ala insertion scanning could be used to identify segments in the glycophorin A transmembrane helix that contribute to the dimerization of this protein in vitro(3Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To explore the phenotypes associated with insertion mutants in large multispanning membrane proteins, we have now performed a systematic Ala insertion scan analysis of lactose permease (lac permease; LacY), a sugar transporter that catalyzes the coupled translocation of a single β-galactoside molecule with a single proton through the plasma membrane of Escherichia coli.Lactose permease was chosen for this study since it is one of the best characterized integral membrane proteins to date and has become a paradigm for mutagenesis-based structure-function analysis of membrane proteins. A two-dimensional topological model with 12 putative transmembrane domains in α-helical conformation connected by hydrophilic loops has been proposed (4Foster D.L. Buoblik M. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed by analyses of LacY-PhoA fusions (5Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Extensive site-directed and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies in which each of the 417 residues in the permease have been mutagenized reveal that only 4 residues, Glu269 (helix VIII), Arg302 (helix IX), His322 (helix X), and Glu325 (helix X), are irreplaceable with respect to active lactose transport (reviewed in Refs. 6Kaback H.R.

Moreover, site-directed excimer fluorescence, site-directed mutagenesis, and second-site suppressor studies have led to a model describing the packing of helices VII to XI (6Kaback H.R. Frillingos S.

The model has been confirmed and extended recently by engineering divalent metal binding sites (bis- or tris-His residues) within the permease (8Jung K. Voss J. He M. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6272-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9He M.M. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and site-directed spin labeling (12Wu J.H. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10123-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) .We find that insertion of alanine into 7 different transmembrane helices in lactose permease results in one of three phenotypes: rapid degradation of the protein, lack of uphill lactose transport activity, or no effects on stability and function. A detailed Ala insertion scan of transmembrane helix III, a segment previously shown to be able to accommodate cysteine residues in every position without significant effects on permease expression or activity (13Sahin-Toth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), shows that a central core of ∼9 residues is crucial for stability and/or activity. Ala insertions outside this central core have surprisingly mild effects, and the distal segments in helix III thus appear to play only a minor role in supporting protein stability and lactose uptake activity. A Trp scan of the core region identifies residues Ile92 and Gly96 as important for the stability of the permease.Together with our previous results for the glycophorin A transmembrane helix dimer (3Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that single residue insertions near the center of transmembrane helices are generally disruptive to protein structure and/or function, whereas more distal segments can be less sensitive. This not only has implications for our understanding of structural stability in membrane proteins, but also suggests that Ala insertion scanning may be used to identify critical segments in transmembrane helices that can then be further analyzed by,e.g. replacement mutagenesis.DISCUSSIONHow do integral membrane proteins react to single residue insertions into their transmembrane helices? Our analysis of Ala insertions in the multispanning inner membrane protein lactose permease from E. coli suggests that insertions near the center of the transmembrane helices are generally highly disruptive to protein structure and/or function (7 helices out of 7 tested), but that the more distal segments of a transmembrane helix can be less sensitive. A series of Leu and Val insertions in helix X of lactose permease confirms this conclusion (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although expression levels were not reported for these mutants.Insertions near the center of transmembrane helices I and X give rise to structurally stable proteins unable to carry out uphill lactose transport. Helix I has previously been shown to be important for the membrane insertion of lactose permease (32Stochaj U. Ehring R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Stochaj U. Fritz H.-J. Heibach C. Markgraf M. von Schaewev A. Sonnewald U. Ehring R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no functionally essential residues have been found in this helix by replacement (26Sahin-Toth M. Persson B. Schwieger J. Cohan P. Kaback R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or deletion mutagenesis (27Bibi E. Stearns S.M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results, nevertheless, show that mutations in helix I can affect the activity of the permease. Interestingly, it has been reported that helix I undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change (34Wu J. Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8257-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alanine was inserted at only one position in this helix, and thus it cannot be excluded that helix I is important for structural stability as well.Given that helix X contains 2 functionally essential residues (His322 and Glu325), the inactivity of the Ala insertion in position 325 between these 2 residues is not surprising. Furthermore, recent data indicate that Glu325 interacts with helices VIII (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and IX (7Kaback H.R. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biophysics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 203-227Google Scholar, 31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on replacement and insertion mutagenesis of helix X it has been proposed that Leu321, Met323, Phe328, Leu330, and Gly332 interact with other helices in the permease (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Ala insertion before Glu325 may displace the N-terminal half of helix X and thus disrupt the putative helix-helix interactions of Met323 and Leu321but keep the interactions of Glu325, Phe328, Leu330, and Gly332 intact, as reflected in the stable but inactive expression of the Ala insertion mutant.Ala insertions near the center of helices III, V, VII, IX, and XII give rise to unstable mutant proteins as assessed by immunoblotting and pulse-chase analysis (the helix XII mutant is stable when highly overexpressed but not otherwise, Figs. 2 and 3), demonstrating that these helices contain packing interfaces required either for proper membrane insertion or for the formation of a membrane-embedded structure that is stable to endogenous proteolysis. Due to their instability, it cannot be determined whether the mutants with insertions in helices V and IX are intrinsically nonfunctional as well. The helix V and helix XII mutants retain marginal activity, suggesting that the Ala insertions affect stability rather than specific activity in these cases.The detailed Ala insertion scan of helix III indicates that this helix is divided into segments, with each having distinct effects on the stability or function of the permease. Insertions in the N-terminal part of helix III, up to position 87, result in stable molecules with somewhat reduced lactose transport activity. Thus, this part of the helix does not seem to be involved in critical packing interactions but may contain a functionally important interface, as suggested previously (24Sahin-Toth M. Frillingos S. Bibi E. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutants with insertions in positions 90–93 are unstable and do not carry out uphill lactose transport. This segment thus seems to contain residues indispensable for the stability (and hence function) of lactose permease. The segment after residue 96 seems to be of little importance for the packing of helix III and does not seem to contain functionally essential residues, since the mutant with an Ala insertion in position 96 is stable and has nearly wild-type lactose transport activity.The Trp scan of region 87–96 identifies 2 residues, Ile92and Gly96, as critical for the assembly of lactose permease. The Ile92 → Trp mutant is undetectable by Western blotting, and the level of mutant Gly96 → Trp is only 10% of the wild-type protein. It should be noted, however, that Trp may not be sufficiently different from Phe, which comprises 5 out of the 9 residues tested, to disrupt critical interactions mediated by such residues.Gly96 in helix III of the lactose permease has been shown to be more accessible to N-ethylmaleimide in the presence than in the absence of substrate, indicating that Gly96 is not lipid exposed and that interactions involving Gly96change during transport-induced conformational changes (24Sahin-Toth M. Frillingos S. Bibi E. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gly96 is on the same face of helix III as Ile92 (Fig. 1). Gly residues are mostly found buried between transmembrane helices in membrane proteins of known structure (35Wallin E. Tsukihara T. Yoshikawa S. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that Ile92 and Gly96 are part of the buried face of helix III.With the information that position 92 is critical for the assembly of lactose permease, it may be rationalized that the Ala insertions in positions 90 and 91 result in unstable mutants because in both cases the bulky side chain of Phe is moved into position 92. Likewise, the insertion in position 93 moves a Phe residue into the position normally occupied by Gly96, which may be the reason for its instability. The stable and active Ala insertion in position 96, in contrast, places a much smaller and thus less perturbing Ala residue in position 96.The observation that Ala insertions in the N-terminal half of helix III are tolerated quite well, whereas those in the C-terminal half are not, may also be interpreted to mean that the effect of a given insertion is to displace the part of the helix nearest to the surface of the membrane (or that contributes less to the overall stability of the protein) relative to the other helices in the protein while leaving the remainder of the helix in its original position. This is similar to the structural perturbations caused by Ala insertions in an α-helix in the globular protein lysozyme, which in most cases are accommodated within the helix with the residues N- and C-terminal of the insertion shifted by 100° relative to each other (36Heinz D.W. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Blaber M. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 869-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Based on these results, we suggest that Ala insertion scans can be used to distinguish between helix sections that contain structurally important residues, which contain functionally important residues, and those that contain neither structurally nor functionally important residues. After an initial Ala insertion scan, residues in the identified critical regions may be individually targeted by replacement mutagenesis.From an evolutionary point of view this study appears to convey an important message; that amino acid insertions in the central portion of transmembrane helices are generally highly disruptive to protein function, as the results imply. This is in contrast to substitution mutations, which are well accommodated in all parts of an integral membrane protein without significant effects on the protein's stability and function (1Wen J.A. Chen X. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Kaback H.R. Frillingos S. Jung H. Jung K. Prive G.G. Ujwal M.L. Weitzman C. Wu J. Zen K. J. Exp.

In sequence alignment studies, high gap penalties should thus be imposed on transmembrane helices, similar to the position-dependent gap penalties often used in the alignment of globular proteins (37Luthy R. Mclachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 10: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Like globular proteins, integral membrane proteins appear to be highly resilient to point mutations, both in their membrane-spanning and extra-membraneous domains (1Wen J.A. Chen X. Bowie J.U. Nat.

The model has been confirmed and extended recently by engineering divalent metal binding sites (bis- or tris-His residues) within the permease (8Jung K. Voss J. He M. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6272-6277Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9He M.M. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and site-directed spin labeling (12Wu J.H. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10123-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) . We find that insertion of alanine into 7 different transmembrane helices in lactose permease results in one of three phenotypes: rapid degradation of the protein, lack of uphill lactose transport activity, or no effects on stability and function. A detailed Ala insertion scan of transmembrane helix III, a segment previously shown to be able to accommodate cysteine residues in every position without significant effects on permease expression or activity (13Sahin-Toth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), shows that a central core of ∼9 residues is crucial for stability and/or activity. Ala insertions outside this central core have surprisingly mild effects, and the distal segments in helix III thus appear to play only a minor role in supporting protein stability and lactose uptake activity. A Trp scan of the core region identifies residues Ile92 and Gly96 as important for the stability of the permease. Together with our previous results for the glycophorin A transmembrane helix dimer (3Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that single residue insertions near the center of transmembrane helices are generally disruptive to protein structure and/or function, whereas more distal segments can be less sensitive. This not only has implications for our understanding of structural stability in membrane proteins, but also suggests that Ala insertion scanning may be used to identify critical segments in transmembrane helices that can then be further analyzed by,e.g. replacement mutagenesis. DISCUSSIONHow do integral membrane proteins react to single residue insertions into their transmembrane helices? Our analysis of Ala insertions in the multispanning inner membrane protein lactose permease from E. coli suggests that insertions near the center of the transmembrane helices are generally highly disruptive to protein structure and/or function (7 helices out of 7 tested), but that the more distal segments of a transmembrane helix can be less sensitive. A series of Leu and Val insertions in helix X of lactose permease confirms this conclusion (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although expression levels were not reported for these mutants.Insertions near the center of transmembrane helices I and X give rise to structurally stable proteins unable to carry out uphill lactose transport. Helix I has previously been shown to be important for the membrane insertion of lactose permease (32Stochaj U. Ehring R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Stochaj U. Fritz H.-J. Heibach C. Markgraf M. von Schaewev A. Sonnewald U. Ehring R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no functionally essential residues have been found in this helix by replacement (26Sahin-Toth M. Persson B. Schwieger J. Cohan P. Kaback R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or deletion mutagenesis (27Bibi E. Stearns S.M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results, nevertheless, show that mutations in helix I can affect the activity of the permease. Interestingly, it has been reported that helix I undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change (34Wu J. Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8257-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alanine was inserted at only one position in this helix, and thus it cannot be excluded that helix I is important for structural stability as well.Given that helix X contains 2 functionally essential residues (His322 and Glu325), the inactivity of the Ala insertion in position 325 between these 2 residues is not surprising. Furthermore, recent data indicate that Glu325 interacts with helices VIII (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and IX (7Kaback H.R. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biophysics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 203-227Google Scholar, 31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on replacement and insertion mutagenesis of helix X it has been proposed that Leu321, Met323, Phe328, Leu330, and Gly332 interact with other helices in the permease (31Goswitz V.C. Matzke E.A. Taylor M.R. Jessen-Marshall A.E. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21927-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Ala insertion before Glu325 may displace the N-terminal half of helix X and thus disrupt the putative helix-helix interactions of Met323 and Leu321but keep the interactions of Glu325, Phe328, Leu330, and Gly332 intact, as reflected in the stable but inactive expression of the Ala insertion mutant.Ala insertions near the center of helices III, V, VII, IX, and XII give rise to unstable mutant proteins as assessed by immunoblotting and pulse-chase analysis (the helix XII mutant is stable when highly overexpressed but not otherwise, Figs. 2 and 3), demonstrating that these helices contain packing interfaces required either for proper membrane insertion or for the formation of a membrane-embedded structure that is stable to endogenous proteolysis. Due to their instability, it cannot be determined whether the mutants with insertions in helices V and IX are intrinsically nonfunctional as well. The helix V and helix XII mutants retain marginal activity, suggesting that the Ala insertions affect stability rather than specific activity in these cases.The detailed Ala insertion scan of helix III indicates that this helix is divided into segments, with each having distinct effects on the stability or function of the permease. Insertions in the N-terminal part of helix III, up to position 87, result in stable molecules with somewhat reduced lactose transport activity. Thus, this part of the helix does not seem to be involved in critical packing interactions but may contain a functionally important interface, as suggested previously (24Sahin-Toth M. Frillingos S. Bibi E. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutants with insertions in positions 90–93 are unstable and do not carry out uphill lactose transport. This segment thus seems to contain residues indispensable for the stability (and hence function) of lactose permease. The segment after residue 96 seems to be of little importance for the packing of helix III and does not seem to contain functionally essential residues, since the mutant with an Ala insertion in position 96 is stable and has nearly wild-type lactose transport activity.The Trp scan of region 87–96 identifies 2 residues, Ile92and Gly96, as critical for the assembly of lactose permease. The Ile92 → Trp mutant is undetectable by Western blotting, and the level of mutant Gly96 → Trp is only 10% of the wild-type protein. It should be noted, however, that Trp may not be sufficiently different from Phe, which comprises 5 out of the 9 residues tested, to disrupt critical interactions mediated by such residues.Gly96 in helix III of the lactose permease has been shown to be more accessible to N-ethylmaleimide in the presence than in the absence of substrate, indicating that Gly96 is not lipid exposed and that interactions involving Gly96change during transport-induced conformational changes (24Sahin-Toth M. Frillingos S. Bibi E. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2302-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gly96 is on the same face of helix III as Ile92 (Fig. 1). Gly residues are mostly found buried between transmembrane helices in membrane proteins of known structure (35Wallin E. Tsukihara T. Yoshikawa S. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that Ile92 and Gly96 are part of the buried face of helix III.With the information that position 92 is critical for the assembly of lactose permease, it may be rationalized that the Ala insertions in positions 90 and 91 result in unstable mutants because in both cases the bulky side chain of Phe is moved into position 92. Likewise, the insertion in position 93 moves a Phe residue into the position normally occupied by Gly96, which may be the reason for its instability. The stable and active Ala insertion in position 96, in contrast, places a much smaller and thus less perturbing Ala residue in position 96.The observation that Ala insertions in the N-terminal half of helix III are tolerated quite well, whereas those in the C-terminal half are not, may also be interpreted to mean that the effect of a given insertion is to displace the part of the helix nearest to the surface of the membrane (or that contributes less to the overall stability of the protein) relative to the other helices in the protein while leaving the remainder of the helix in its original position. This is similar to the structural perturbations caused by Ala insertions in an α-helix in the globular protein lysozyme, which in most cases are accommodated within the helix with the residues N- and C-terminal of the insertion shifted by 100° relative to each other (36Heinz D.W. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Blaber M. Dahlquist F.W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 869-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Based on these results, we suggest that Ala insertion scans can be used to distinguish between helix sections that contain structurally important residues, which contain functionally important residues, and those that contain neither structurally nor functionally important residues. After an initial Ala insertion scan, residues in the identified critical regions may be individually targeted by replacement mutagenesis.From an evolutionary point of view this study appears to convey an important message; that amino acid insertions in the central portion of transmembrane helices are generally highly disruptive to protein function, as the results imply. This is in contrast to substitution mutations, which are well accommodated in all parts of an integral membrane protein without significant effects on the protein's stability and function (1Wen J.A.

In sequence alignment studies, high gap penalties should thus be imposed on transmembrane helices, similar to the position-dependent gap penalties often used in the alignment of globular proteins (37Luthy R.

Evidence of these changes was obtained through the lack of recognition of TPO2 by half of the 13 TPO monoclonal antibodies tested in immunoprecipitation experiments. Our data suggest that because of an improper folding, TPO2 is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and rapidly degraded.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 266 (FEBS Lett.266, 133–141): 133-141Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which suggests that His-586 may be a critical residue for the enzymatic activity of the protein by being the putative distal heme binding site. Four potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites are also present in the extracellular region, and there is some evidence for at least one disulfide bond in this part of the molecule (12Taurog A. Doris M.L. Yokoyama N. Slaughter C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Distribution and delivery of TPO are apically polarized, but only ∼30% TPO is detected at the thyrocyte surface (13Kuliawat R. Lisanti M.P. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2478-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mistargeting of another small fraction of TPO to the basolateral surface seems to occur (13Kuliawat R. Lisanti M.P. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2478-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Zimmer K.P. Scheumann G.F.W. Bramswig J. Bocker W. Harms E. Schmid K.W.

This may account for the hypothetical presentation of TPO to the circulating immune system, resulting in its antigenicity and its part in autoimmune thyroid diseases. In the presence of H2O2, TPO catalyzes the iodide organification of thyroglobulin, which is processed mainly at the apical membrane of the thyrocyte (15Ekholm R. Bjorkman U. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1558-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Elkolm R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1981; 24: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Gruffat D.

However, a quantitatively minor iodination of thyroglobulin appears to occur intracellularly (18Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4922-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPO gene codes for the full-length TPO (TPO1) and generates alternatively spliced forms (for review see Ref. 5McLachlan S. Rapoport B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 192-206PubMed Google Scholar). The main alternatively spliced TPO mRNA species described so far has a 171-base pair deletion (exon 10) and codes for a protein of 876 amino acids (TPO2) (19Kimura S. Kotani T. McBride O.W. Umeki K.

Metab. 1990; 72: 700-702Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TPO2 is 57 amino acids shorter than the major protein and lacks one of the potential glycosylation sites and His-586. TPO2 mRNA has been detected in normal and Graves thyroids (19Kimura S. Kotani T. McBride O.W. Umeki K. Hirai K. Nakayama T. Ohtaki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Waelkens J.J.J. Bravenboer B. de Vijlder J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2076-2079PubMed Google Scholar). Note that 10 years after the discovery of TPO2-specific mRNA, nothing is known about the protein. Hence no further information is available on its enzymatic and immunological activities. Using CHO cell lines expressing TPO2 and TPO1, we investigated the structural and functional aspects of TPO2. With reference to the major protein TPO1, we determined how changes of the primary sequence affected the conformational structure of the protein, as shown through its epitopic recognition by TPO mAbs. We determined the effects of those structural modifications on the intracellular trafficking, the localization, and the enzymatic activity of the protein. Full-length 3060-kilobase human TPO1 cDNA kindly provided by B. Rapoport, University of California, San Francisco, CA, was cloned into HindIII andXbaI sites of the eukaryotic transfer vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leak, The Netherlands). A 578-nucleotide cDNA fragment corresponding to a region of TPO2 (1411–1989 base pairs) around the splicing was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the λgt11 human thyroid cDNA library (22Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides FP, 5′-TATGAATTCTATGACTCCACCGCC, and RP, 5′-GTCTCTAGACTCAAAGTCTTC, were used as primers (23Tonacchera M. Cetani F. Costagliola S. Alcalde L. Uibo R. Vassart G. Ludgate M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This 578-base pair-amplified fragment containing at both extremities the NcoI restriction site was cleaved by this enzyme. TPO1 cDNA was was released from TPO1-pcDNA3 construction and subcloned in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). TPO1-pBluescript was then cleaned of the 748-base pair fragment containing the sequence that corresponds to exon 10 by double cleavage with NcoI and dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase. TPO1-pBluescript and the TPO2-NcoI fragment were then ligated. TPO2-pBluescript construct was cleaned of the TPO2 cDNA, which was cloned into HindIII and XbaI sites of the eukaryotic transfer vector pcDNA3. The nucleotide sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-derived NcoI fragment was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing to verify that the engineered TPO2-pcDNA3 construct was correct. Escherichia coli strain XL1 Blues (Stratagene) was transformed with the TPO2-pcDNA3 construct, and pure plasmid DNA preparations were obtained with the Wizard midipreps kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Enzyme reactions and DNA manipulations were done as in Sanbrooket al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CHO cells (ECACC n°85050302) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were transfected by the lipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either pcDNA3-TPO1 or pcDNA3-TPO2 or pcDNA3 alone as control. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of geneticin (400 μg/ml) and were subcloned by limiting dilutions. Positive TPO-expressing cell lines were identified by Western blotting or by immunoprecipitation after [35S]Met + [35S]Cys labeling (Expre35S35S protein labeling mix, DuPont NEN Life Science Products). A significant TPO1 and TPO2 expression was obtained by culturing CHO TPO cell lines with 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were incubated in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met + [35S]Cys. Incubation was done for 5 or 48 h. In pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated 1 h in Cys- and Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were then pulsed for 30 min in the presence of 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met + [35S]Cys. After the pulse, the labeling medium was removed, and the cell surface was washed three times with PBS and then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 mm Met, and 5 mm Cys. Chases were performed for 1, 5, 22, 48, and 72 h. After being metabolically labeled, cells were harvested on ice by scraping in 1 ml of PBS and centrifuging at 700 × g for 7 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 μl of TPO extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Boehringer Mannheim), vortexed every 2 min during 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Radiolabeled supernatants were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mAbs recognizing either a sequential region (mAb 47) or conformational epitopes (mAb 15 and mAb 53) on the surface of the TPO molecule (25Ruf J. Toubert M.A. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde M.J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). mAbs 47 and 53 were used for TPO2, and mAbs 47 and 15 were used for TPO1. The use of two TPO mAbs in immunoprecipitation experiments allowed us to recover more than 90% of both TPO1 and TPO2 expressed by CHO cells (data not shown). mAbs were chosen for their strong recognition of each isoform (see “Results”) through a panel of TPO mAbs. These mAbs were previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then retrieved by a brief centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 s) and were washed 6 times with 1 ml of TPO extraction buffer and once with 1 ml of PBS. Immunoprecipitated TPO was recovered from mAb-protein A-Sepharose 4B complexes by boiling for 5 min in 80 μl of electrophoresis buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Protein-associated radiactivity was visualized and quantified by phosphoimager (Fudjix BAS 1000). TPO was also immunoprecipitated with a panel of mAbs directed against various antigenic domains of the TPO1 molecule (25Ruf J. Toubert M.A. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde M.J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this experiment, [35S]Met + [35S]Cys-radiolabeled CHO TPO cell lysates were precleared with zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) before being immunoprecipitated 4 h at 25 °C with 50 μg of each of the TPO mAbs previously complexed with protein A-Sepharose 4B. CHO TPO2 cell lysates were also tested against TPO autoantibodies in the sera from two patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who exhibited titers of TPO autoantibodies higher than 10,000 IU/ml as measured by a two-site chemoluminescent assay (Lumitest anti-TPO, Brahms, Berlin, Germany). Each sera (500 μl) was precleared with zysorbin before being complexed with protein A-Sepharose 4B by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The serum of a normal individual was used as a control. Metabolically labeled TPO2 was extracted as described previously and then incubated 2 h at room temperature with complexes of autoantibodies and protein A-Sepharose 4B. These complexes were retrieved by a brief centrifugation and treated as the mAbs. TPO2 immunoprecipitated by autoantibodies was eluted from complexes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. [35S]Met + [35S]Cys-labeled TPO2 was immunoprecipitated with mAb 47 and mAb 53 as described previously. TPO2 was eluted from the immunocomplexes by incubation with 5 μl of 10% SDS, diluted in the incubation buffer with either endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H or peptide-N-glycanase F, centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 10 s), and boiled for 5 min. Treatment with 0.2 unit of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) was done in 0.15 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 16 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylation by 1 unit of peptide-N-glycanase F (Boehringer Mannheim) was done in 0.15m phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CHO TPO1 and CHO TPO2 confluent monolayers were metabolically labeled for 16 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met + [35S]Cys in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate and cell surface-biotinylated as in Ref.26Zurzolo C. Le Bivic A. Quaroni A. Nitsh L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2337-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and exposed to a 0.5 mg/ml Immunopure NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) 20 min at 4 °C. Cross-linker was removed, and the same procedure was repeated once. The biotin reagent was quenched by incubation with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested. To recover the immunoprecipitated antigens, we supplemented the complexes with 10 μl of 10% SDS, boiled them for 5 min, diluted them with 600 μl of TPO extraction buffer, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 3 min). Supernatant containing total TPO was incubated 2 h with avidin-agarose (Pierce). Biotinylated surface TPO and intracellular TPO were separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 3 min). The beads were washed four times with TPO extraction buffer and once with PBS, resuspended in electrophoresis buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were incubated in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1% FBS, and 5 μCi/ml [14C]aminolevulinic acid (NEN Life Science Products) for 16 or 48 h. Cells were then harvested, and TPO was immunoprecipitated as described previously before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were cultured in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate for 48 h and washed once with PBS. Cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and centrifuged at 200 × g for 7 min. Pellets were resuspended in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cells were ruptured by a Teflon glass homogenizer, and the suspension was centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000 × g. Microsomal fraction pellets were solubilized by resuspension in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm KI. Microsomes prepared from CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as a negative control. Microsomal fractions were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min), and the supernatant was used for the enzymatic assay. Extracts containing the same amounts of TPO1 and TPO2 and extracts from cells transfected with pcDNA3 were added to 1 ml of 40 mm guaiacol (Fluka Chimie, St. Quentin-Fallavier, France) and 67 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was done at room temperature and initiated by adding H2O2 to reach a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Guaiacol oxidation was measured by absorbance at 470 nm and spectrophotometrically monitored every 30 s for 3 min. Variation of absorbance for each assay was calculated on the basis of a mean of three experiments. To investigate the structure-function relations and the intracellular trafficking of TPO2 isoform as compared with the major variant TPO1, we generated two CHO cell lines stably expressing TPO2 and TPO1. CHO cells were transfected with either TPO2-, TPO1-pcDNA3 constructs or with pcDNA3 alone as control. After obtaining several clones expressing TPO2 and TPO1, we did the experiments in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate, which made TPO2 and TPO1 expression levels higher than those obtained without butyrate addition (data not shown). After metabolic labeling of CHO TPO cells with [35S]Met + [35S]Cys for 5 h, we immunoprecipitated TPO2 and TPO1 with a combination of two TPO mAbs. As expected (28Bradbury F.A. Kawate N. Foster C.M. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5921-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), TPO1 gave a 110-kDa specific band (Fig. 1, lane A), whereas TPO2 was a 98-kDa band on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1,lane B). The difference in apparent molecular mass between TPO1 and TPO2 isoforms reflects the lack of 57 amino acids in the extracytoplasmic domain of the TPO2 molecule. This difference may also be explained by the loss of a potential asparagine N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-569). These two bands were shown to specifically represent TPO1 and TPO2 isoforms, as they correspond to a binding with TPO mAbs and were not present in CHO cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone (Fig. 1, lane C). Similar results were obtained by Western blotting analysis of TPO1 and TPO2 with mAb 47 as first antibody (data not shown). During the subcloning of the transfected cells, we constantly found a higher amount of TPO1 than of TPO2 in the clones. Within the selected clones, quantification of each of the TPO band intensities after either steady-state labeling with [35S]Met + [35S]Cys for 48 h or Western blotting revealed a strong difference between TPO1 and TPO2 levels recovered. We always recovered 25-fold less TPO2 than TPO1. We believe that post-translational modification events or differences in processing of the TPO2 isoform through the cell occur. To get more insight on these findings, we used a structural approach of the TPO2 isoform before studying the intracellular trafficking of both isoforms. In all the experiments, we took into account the quantitative difference between TPO1 and TPO2 levels in CHO cells. We thus established experimental conditions to reliably compare similar amounts of both isoforms. To investigate some of the structural aspects of TPO2, we did glycosylation studies. TPO2 was immunoprecipitated from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]Met + [35S]Cys for 5 h and then treated with either endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H or peptide-N-glycanase F before analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). TPO2 was sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion (lane 2) and a similar pattern was obtained after deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycanase F (lane 3), suggesting that TPO2 bears high mannose-type structures exclusively. We then determined TPO2 immunological reactivity against a panel of mAbs directed to TPO1 (25Ruf J. Toubert M.A. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde M.J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After [35S]Met + [35S]Cys metabolic labeling for 5 h, TPO1 and TPO2 were tested by immunoprecipitation with each of the 13 TPO mAbs. TPO1 immunoreactivity was observed with all the mAbs tested (Fig.3 A). For TPO2, a strong recognition was observed with mAb 47 and mAb 53, which led us to use these mAbs in immunoprecipitation experiments on TPO2 (Fig.3 B). Four other mAbs also clearly recognized TPO2 (mAbs 1, 15, 24, and 30), although 7 out of 13 had slight or no reactivity to the protein (Fig. 3 B). That TPO2 exhibited either a weaker or no immunoactivity to some of the mAbs suggests that the molecule changed conformation. Given these structural changes, we questioned whether the TPO2 molecule is still recognized by TPO autoantibodies. The 57-amino acid region deleted in TPO2 is upstream from the main epitope recognized by autoantibodies, but the conformational changes previously deduced may be expected to modify the exposition of some autoepitopes. We thus determined the antigenic immunoreactivity of TPO2 against sera of patients with high titers of TPO autoantibodies. Using immunoprecipitation experiments, we showed that serum TPO autoantibodies specifically bound TPO2 (Fig.4, lanes 2 and 3), whereas the serum of normal individuals did not (Fig. 4, lane 4). This suggests that TPO2 remained recognized by autoantibodies and exhibited all or part of the autoepitopes at the surface of the molecule. To investigate whether the loss of exon 10 and the structural changes in TPO2 alter the stability of the glycoprotein, we did pulse-chase studies and determined the half-life of TPO1 and TPO2. Cells were pulsed for 30 min in the presence of [35S]Met + [35S]Cys and chased at various times. Immunoprecipitated TPO1 and TPO2 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). [35S]Met + [35S]Cys TPO1 was still detected after 72 h of chase (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, radiolabeled TPO2 was not detected at 22 h of chase (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that TPO2 is degraded more rapidly than the major variant in the cell. Phosphoimager quantification of both TPO1 and TPO2 in several experiments revealed a shorter half-life for TPO2 (3 h) than for TPO1 (11 h) (Fig. 5 C). The short half-life of the TPO2 isoform may explain the lower amounts of TPO2 than TPO1 recovered from CHO TPO cell lines, as in immunoprecipitation or Western blotting experiments. We then investigated whether the structural changes in the TPO2 variant modify the localization and the intracellular trafficking of the molecule. We thus evaluated the cell surface expression of the TPO1 and TPO2 isoforms by surface biotinylation experiments. Cells were [35S]Met + [35S]Cys metabolically labeled to steady state (48 h), and surface proteins were tagged by vectorial biotinylation with NHS-SS-biotin, a reagent that reacts with the amino groups of extracytoplasmic lysine residues. TPO was recovered by immunoprecipitation, released from the mAb by denaturation in SDS, and incubated with avidin-agarose. This procedure separated biotinylated surface TPO bound to avidin-agarose from intracellular TPO, which is hence inaccessible to the tagging agent. TPO1 was found predominantly in the intracellular compartments; a small fraction was present at the cell surface (Fig. 6, lanes 2and 6). Quantification of the bands revealed that only 15% of TPO1 reached the cell surface. On the contrary, TPO2 remained in the intracellular compartment exclusively and did not reach the cell surface (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 8). Another important post-translational event for TPO is its incorporation of heme, which occurs most likely in the ER. We were interested in the consequence of the modification of the three-dimensional structure of TPO2 on such incorporation, which is required for the enzyme to function. We thus evaluated whether TPO1 and TPO2 were able to bind to the heme by adding14C-radiolabeled aminolevulinic acid heme precursor to cell cultures. 14C-labeled immunoprecipitated TPO1 was detected after 16 h of labeling and markedly increased at 48 h (Fig.7, lanes 1 and 3). In the same experiment, no 14C-labeled TPO2 was detected, showing its inability to bind to heme (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and4). As TPO2 did not reach the cell surface, extracts from microsomes were used to detect peroxidase activity. Guaiacol oxidation was measured for the two TPO variants and the control pcDNA3. As expected, we detected a significant and reproducible peroxidase activity for TPO1 as compared with the negative control (Fig.8). Conversely, TPO2 guaiacol oxidation curves remained at the same basal level of those for the negative control. This result allows us to conclude that TPO2 is enzymatically inactive. To establish the role of TPO2 in the thyroid function, we studied the intracellular trafficking and the enzymatic activity of this protein. We transfected the cDNA of TPO1 and of the alternatively spliced form (TPO2) in CHO cells. We generated cell lines stably expressing significant levels of each protein but observed a lower cell expression of the alternatively spliced isoform. When we immunoprecipitated the cells metabolically labeled with [35S]Met + [35S]Cys, we found that the amounts of TPO2 recovered were 25-fold lower than those of TPO1. We first investigated the stability of the glycoprotein within the cell by pulse-chase experiments. Labeled TPO2 was not detected in the cell up to 5 h. TPO2 half-life was dramatically decreased as compared with TPO1 (3 versus 11 h), suggesting TPO2 degrades faster than TPO1. This could explain the low amount of TPO2 recovered from cells. Cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that TPO1 is mainly intracellular and only 15% of the protein reaches the cell surface. Similar data were reported for the thyrocyte by Arvan's group (13Kuliawat R. Lisanti M.P. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2478-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who found no more than 30% TPO at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that no TPO2 reaches the cell surface, hence the whole protein remains intracellular. This suggests that TPO2 does not exhibit the structural features required to come out from the intracellular compartments and that it is retained in the cell. It was reported that differences in the processing of a protein may lead to a diminished trafficking to the cell surface and that incorrectly folded proteins are retained mainly in the ER (28Bradbury F.A.

To investigate the interactions of membrane proteins with coated pits at the cell surface, we applied image correlation spectroscopy to measure directly and quantitatively the clustering of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein mutants carrying specific cytoplasmic internalization signals. The HA system enables direct comparison between isolated internalization signals, because HA itself is excluded from coated pits. The studies presented here provide, for the first time, a direct quantitative measure for the degree of clustering of membrane proteins in coated pits at the cell surface. The degree of clustering depended on the strength of the internalization signal and on the integrity of the clathrin lattices and correlated with the internalization rates of the mutants. The clustering of the HA mutants fully correlated with their ability to co-precipitate α-adaptin from whole cells, the first such demonstration for a membrane protein that is not a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Furthermore, both the clustering in coated pits and the co-precipitation with α-adaptin were dramatically reduced in the cold, suggesting that low temperature can interfere with the sorting of proteins into coated pits.

The clathrin-coated pits, which are the major port of entry into the endocytic pathway in many cell types, represent the best studied example of a sorting domain where a coat of proteins at the cytosolic face of the membrane selectively binds membrane proteins containing specific motifs that serve as internalization signals (5Kirchhausen T.

Recent evidence identifies several distinct classes of cytoplasmic internalization signals (reviewed in Refs. 3Trowbridge I.S. Curr. Opin.

They conform mostly to one of two major subclasses: NPXY, where Tyr is preceded by an asparagine-proline dipeptide and a random amino acid, or YXXZ, where Z is an amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain (3Trowbridge I.S.

However, a recent study employing combinatorial selection methods on the binding of YXXZ-containing peptides to the μ2 chain of AP-2 indicated no requirement for a prefolded structure around the tetrapeptide signal (31Boll H.O.

A different class of internalization signals contains a di-leucine motif (LL or LI) (24Sandoval I.V. Bakke O.

Although much has been learned about clathrin-mediated endocytosis in recent years, currently it is not well understood how membrane proteins bind to coated pits at the surface of the intact cell. In vivo endocytosis studies generally measured the sequestration of proteins into vesicles or deeply invaginated pits and did not allow direct measurement of many events that occur earlier during coated vesicle formation (e.g. the selection of certain proteins for inclusion in coated pits and the exclusion of others). Furthermore, experimental evidence for interactions of the internalization signals of membrane receptors with AP-2 subunits has been limited mostly toin vitro assays employing solubilized and immobilized proteins (16Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Beltzer J.P.

These assays have detected only a subset of the sequences known or suspected to function as internalization signals in vivo (36Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, association of AP-2 with receptors by co-immunoprecipitation from cells has thus far been demonstrated only for receptors from the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family (14Nesterov A. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6320-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Sorkin A. Carpenter G.

Even for these receptors, it is not clear whether this in vitro association is directly related to the efficiency of their internalization via coated pits (21Boll W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1168-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is therefore important to explore the relationships between binding to AP-2, clustering in coated pits, and the efficiency of the internalization process as a function of the internalization signal; this manuscript presents measurements to that end. Our studies were performed on a series of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mutants carrying specific cytoplasmic internalization signals (37Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,42Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This system is advantageous, because wild-type HA (HA wt) lacks internalization signals and serves as a natural control, enabling investigation of specific internalization sequences introduced into its cytoplasmic tail (41Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21075-21081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using this system, we employed comparative studies of the lateral mobility of these mutants to characterize the mode of their interactions with coated pits at the surface of intact cells (43Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Fire E. Gutman O. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21075-21081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, measurement of the binding of internalization-competent HA mutants to immobile structures presumed to represent coated pits was indirect and was inferred from the reduction in the lateral diffusion rate or mobile fraction of the mutants relative to HA wt. Because numerous factors (and not only interactions with coated pits) may inhibit the lateral mobility of membrane proteins, it was important to measure the association of the HA mutants with coated pits at the cell surface in a direct and independent manner. The current studies, which are potentially applicable for studying any type of clustering or oligomerization at the cell surface, provide a direct demonstration and measure for internalization signal-dependent clustering of HA mutants in cell surface coated pits. Together with the findings on signal-dependent co-precipitation of AP-2 with the various HAs in strict correlation with the ICS data, our results suggest that the degree of clustering in coated pits for a given protein depends on the strength of the association of its internalization signal with the clathrin-associated adaptor complexes. In turn, this clustering plays an important role in determining the endocytosis rate and restricts the lateral mobility of the internalization-competent proteins at the cell surface. Restriction enzymes and T4-DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Trypsin, amiloride hydrochloride, protein A-Sepharose 4B, BSA, and n-propylgallate were from Sigma.

Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin) and streptavidin-peroxidase were from Pierce, and ECL reagent (Renaissance) was from NEN Life Science Products. Airvol 205 was from Air Products and Chemicals (Allentown, PA). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum that recognized all the mutants of the Japan HA (A/Japan/305/57 strain) was employed throughout (43Fire E.

Fluorescein-labeled affinity purified F(ab′)2 of goat IgG directed against rabbit F(ab′)2 (FITC-GAR F(ab′)2) and normal goat IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Monovalent Fab′ fragments were prepared from the IgG fraction of the anti-HA antibodies and from normal goat IgG as described (45Henis Y.I. Gutman O. Loyter A. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The FITC-GAR F(ab′)2were converted to monovalent Fab′ fragments (FITC-GAR Fab′) by reduction with mercaptoethanol followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide (45Henis Y.I. Gutman O. Loyter A. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To eliminate any possible IgG traces, all Fab′ preparations were treated with protein A-Sepharose. The resulting Fab′ were free of contamination by IgG or F(ab′)2 as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. AC1-M11 mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the αa and αc chains of AP-2 (46Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were donated by Dr. Margaret S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, UK). The cDNA encoding the HA wt protein from the A/Japan/305/57 strain or several HA mutants were introduced into the SV40-based vector pkSVE (47Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mutants are depicted in Table I. The derivation of the mutants HA+8 (containing a carboxyl-terminal extension of eight amino acids, which generates a strong internalization signal based on the motif YKSF) and HA+4 (which is HA+8 minus the last four residues, with the internalization motif truncated after YK) is detailed elsewhere (42Zwart D.E.

HA-Y543, which is a point mutant of HA wt (cysteine 543 replaced by tyrosine), was described previously (41Lazarovits J. Roth M.G.

Recombinant SV40 virus stocks were prepared in CV-1 monkey fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) using the appropriate pkSVE vector together with the dl1055 helper virus as described (48Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (from Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel, or from Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries or Life Technologies, Inc.). For ICS experiments on the degree of aggregation and for co-immunoprecipitation studies, subconfluent CV-1 cells were infected in suspension with second or third passage recombinant virus stocks as described (37Naim H.Y.

The cells were plated either on glass coverslips (for immunofluorescent labeling and ICS studies) or in 150-mm dishes (for co-immunoprecipitation studies). Experiments were performed 36–38 h post infection (for HA wt, HA+4, and HA-Y543) or after 44–46 h (for HA+8). The longer post infection time for HA+8 was selected to achieve cell surface density closer to that of the other mutants, because the percentage of HA+8 at the cell surface is significantly lower (42Zwart D.E.

CV-1 cells infected and grown as above were washed twice with cold HBSS containing 20 mm HEPES and 2% BSA (HBSS/HEPES/BSA, pH 7.2) and labeled successively in this buffer at 4 °C (washing three times after each incubation) with the following antibodies: (a) anti-HA Fab′ (100 μg/ml, 30 min); (b) Fab′ of normal goat IgG (to block nonspecific staining; 200 μg/ml, 20 min); and (c) FITC-GAR Fab′ (30 μg/ml, 30 min). The labeling was done in the cold to allow only surface labeling and to avoid endocytosis. In cases where the cells were preincubated in specific buffers to alter coated pit structure (see below), the specific buffers employed for each treatment were used throughout all antibody incubation and subsequent steps. In most cases (except where indicated), the labeled cells were warmed to 22 °C for 10 min prior to fixation in methanol (−20 °C, 5 min) and acetone (−20 °C, 2 min) to enable stronger interactions with coated pits while avoiding significant internalization of some mutants at 37 °C (43Fire E.

It is sensitive to and capable of quantifying differences in the aggregation state and distribution of fluorescently labeled components at the cell surface. In fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, one examines the volume or area illuminated by a laser beam, usually in a microscope. In ICS, instead of observing fluorescent particles as they diffuse in and out of a fixed laser beam, one generates an image of the distribution of the fluorescence intensity on the cell surface by scanning a fluorescently labeled cell with a laser beam, recording fluctuations in fluorescence intensity as a function of position rather than of time (49Petersen N.O.

A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The signal analysis is based on calculating the correlation function of the fluorescence intensity fluctuations. When a single fluorescently labeled component is analyzed (as in the current measurements), the autocorrelation function, g(ξ,η), is derived and fitted to a two-dimensional gaussian function determined by the intensity profile of the laser beam (49Petersen N.O.

Importantly, 1/g(0,0) is equal toN p, the average number of independent fluorescently labeled particles in the area illuminated by the beam (49Petersen N.O. Hoddelius P.L. Wiseman P.W. Seger O.

The term “particles” refers to any fluorescently labeled species, i.e. a fluorescent monomer is one particle, and an aggregate containing many monomers is also one particle. Therefore, aggregation leads to a reduction in N p (larger and fewer particles), which is measured by the 1/g(0,0) value (49Petersen N.O. Hoddelius P.L. Wiseman P.W. Seger O. Magnusson K.-E. Biophys.

After labeling and fixation as described under “immunofluorescent labeling”, fluorescent images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope, illuminating at 488 nm with a 25 mW argon ion laser attenuated to 1%. Images were collected in the photon-counting mode (accumulating 25 scans) to ensure linear scaling. Zoom-10 images of flat 16.3 × 16.3-μm2 areas on the cell surface (avoiding regions around the nuclei, which are not in the same focal plane) were submitted for autocorrelation analysis (49Petersen N.O.

In the inside-out patch configuration a 50-picosiemens (pS) anion channel of the chloroplast envelope membrane was identified. The open time probability of the channel was decreased by the addition of the wild type precursor protein of ferredoxin (wt-prefd) to the pipette-filling solution in the presence of 0.5 mmATP. In the absence of ATP or in the presence of 50 μmATP, wt-prefd did not affect the open time probability of the channel. A deletion mutant of prefd, Δ6–14-prefd, which is inactive inin vitro import, was also unable to affect the open time probability of the 50-pS anion channel. In the presence of 100 μm ATP, wt-prefd decreased the open time probability of the channel to a lesser extent, as did the transit peptide alone. It is concluded that the 50-pS anion channel could be part of the protein import machinery of the inner membrane. In addition the precursor protein under import conditions induced burst-like increases of the envelope conductivity.

The implication of both responses for the chloroplast protein import process are discussed. A large part of the chloroplast proteins is nuclear encoded. These proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and have to be imported into the chloroplast. Nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins are therefore synthesized with an N-terminal extension called the transit sequence. The transit sequence is both necessary and sufficient to target a protein to the chloroplast (1De Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Several components of the chloroplast import machinery have been identified (2Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1033-1039Google Scholar, 3Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A role for chloroplast envelope channels has been proposed in protein import (2Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1033-1039Google Scholar, 3Perry S.E. Keegstra K.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the function of channels in the import process and the response of the envelope during protein import. An increase in envelope conductivity during protein import is shown to occur inPeperomia metallica chloroplasts (4Bulychev A. Pilon M. Dassen H. van't Hof R. Vredenberg W. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This increase was identified using electrophysiological measurements in the whole chloroplast configuration. It was suggested that the opening of protein translocation channels is the cause of the observed response of the envelope. Ion channels in the chloroplast envelope are also thought to be involved in osmoregulation during photosynthesis. Several ion channels of the inner as well as the outer envelope membrane have been identified by reconstitution of the channels in giant liposomes or in planar lipid bilayers (5Mi F. Peters J.S. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Schwarz M. Gross A. Steinkamp T. Flügge U. Wagner R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15906-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Direct electrophysiological measurements on isolated chloroplasts have also revealed a number of envelope ion channels (9Pottosin I.I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Pottosin I.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this report the use of single channel recordings in investigating the role of chloroplast envelope components in protein import is described for the first time. The involvement of a chloroplast envelope anion channel in protein import is identified. A hitherto unidentified electrical response of the chloroplast envelope associated with protein import is also described. The implications of both responses for the chloroplast protein import process are discussed. The precursor of the Silene Pratensis stromal protein ferredoxin (prefd) 1The abbreviations used are: prefd, precursor of ferredoxin; wt, wild type; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethane-sulfonic acid; MCC, multiple conductance channel; trfd, ferredoxin transit peptide; pS, picosiemens. was overexpressed inEscherichia coli and isolated as described before (11Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mutant precursor of ferredoxin (Δ6–14-prefd) is a deletion mutant lacking amino acids 6–14 from the N terminus of the transit sequence. This mutant is shown to be greatly impaired in initial binding and import efficiency in in vitro import into pea chloroplasts (11Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The transit peptide used here is a synthetic peptide. Chloroplasts were isolated from pea leafs by cutting them gently with a razor blade in buffer containing 2.5 mm TES/KOH, pH 7.2, 225 mm sorbitol, 25 mm KCl, and 2 mm CaSO4. The sliced preparation was transferred directly to a 2-ml chamber, which was mounted on a light microscope to allow visual selection of single intact chloroplasts. For recording the currents across the chloroplast envelope, a standard patch clamp technique was used (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 391: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass by a two-step pull and extensively fire polished. Electrodes were filled with buffer containing 2.5 mm TES/KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm KCl, and 2 mm CaSO4, leading to a 10-fold KCl gradient. Electrode resistances were found to be typically around 20 MΩ. To identify the electrical response of the chloroplast envelope during protein import, precursor protein or transit peptide was added to the pipette-filling solution. Different amounts of MgATP were added to the bath solution in these experiments. Currents were measured using an EPC-7 (List-Medical) or an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). The data were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, or the internal filter of the Axopatch 200B) at a minimum cut-off frequency of 1 kHz. The filtered data were digitized at 10 kHz using a CED 1401+ (Cambridge Electronic Design). The data were analyzed with the patch and voltage clamp software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Current recordings were made from inside-out patches obtained by lifting the pipette away from the chloroplast after giga-seal formation (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 391: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). Potentials are given with regard to the pipette interior; the bath was kept electrically at ground using a 1 m KCl agar bridge. The data are given as mean ± the standard deviation. In the inside-out patch configuration single channel, recordings of the pea chloroplast envelope could be obtained. Regarding the high seal resistances, it is highly unlikely that the seals consist of the outer membrane alone due to the abundance of large pores in the outer membrane (13Flügge U. Benz R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 85-89Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). No light-induced currents (14Vredenberg W. Bulychev A. Dassen H. Snel J. Van Voorthuysen T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 77-80Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were ever observed directly after making the patch (i.e. in the attached configuration) or after excision of the patch. This indicates that the thylakoid membrane was not included in the patch. The observed current is likely to run mainly across the inner membrane in a seal consisting of a sandwich-like structure of the outer and the inner membrane. A 50-pS anion channel was found to be involved in protein import. The channel could be blocked by the precursor of the stromal protein ferredoxin in the presence of ATP. Preferredoxin also induced a burst-like increase in the envelope conductivity. Activity of other ion channels could be observed only very rarely under the experimental conditions used here. An anion selective channel in the chloroplast envelope could be identified in the inside-out patch configuration. Small portions of single channel recordings of this channel at different holding potentials are shown as an example in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 B shows an I/V plot of the channel in 25/250 mm KCl. The single channel conductance of the channel as calculated from the slope of the I/V plot is 50 pS. The selectivity of the channel was derived from the reversal potential (V R), which is +35 mV in the applied 10-fold KCl gradient. At holding potentials above theV R, the channel did not show any activity (not shown). The channel is mainly in the fully open state at holding potentials lower than V R, showing few but relatively long closures. The open time probability of the channel is independent of V H at holding potentials lower then V R (data not shown). Several authors have described anion channels in the chloroplast envelope. The properties of the 50-pS anion channel described here differ from those described before. Most of the anion channels described have a considerably larger single channel conductance than the 50 pS found for the channel described here (7Fuks B. Homblé F J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9947-9952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Heiber T. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S. Schwarz M. Flügge U. Weber A. Wagner R.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anion channels with smaller single channel conductance found before all have one or more substates, in contrast to the channel described here (6Schwarz M. Gross A. Steinkamp T. Flügge U. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29481-29489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Heiber T. Steinkamp T. Hinnah S. Schwarz M. Flügge U. Weber A. Wagner R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15906-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.5 mm MgATP in the bath solution, the 50-pS anion channel could be blocked by 0.8 μg/ml precursor of ferredoxin (prefd) in the pipette-filling solution (i.e. the outside of the envelope). This blockade is concluded from a decrease of the open time probability (P o) of the channel. TheP o was decreased from 0.86 ± 0.10 (n = 10) in the control situation to 0.16 ± 0.08 (n = 5) in the presence of wt-prefd in the pipette solution and ATP in the bath solution. The data on open time probabilities were calculated from the all point amplitude histograms of single channel recordings of individual chloroplasts. The single channel conductance is not affected by the addition of wt-prefd. In Fig. 2 A a single gating event taken from two individual single channel recordings is shown to illustrate the effect of wt-prefd on the 50-pS anion channel. Fig.2 B shows as an example the corresponding all point amplitude histograms of the whole single channel recording (approximately 2 min), reflecting the distribution of current levels (15Heinemann S.H. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 53-91Google Scholar). The all point amplitude histograms in Fig. 2 B show that in the presence of wt-prefd the channel was mainly in the closed state. The single channel recordings illustrate that there were few but relatively long openings in the presence of wt-prefd (Fig. 2 A). A flickering block as described for the multiple conductance channel (MCC) of the mitochondrion inner membrane (16Lohret T.A. Kinally K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15950-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was not observed. In contrast to the channel described here, the MCC is slightly cation-specific and has a considerably larger conductance than the chloroplast envelope channel that is blocked by precursor protein. A further difference is the occurrence of multiple subconductance levels of MCC, whereas the channel described in this report completely lacks subconductance levels. In a further comparison between the chloroplast and mitochondrion protein import systems it would be interesting to determine if the anion channel described here is also tightly associated with components of the import machinery. MCC can only function normally if associated with a component of the mitondrial import machinery, namely Tim22 (17Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At a MgATP concentration of 50 μm or in the absence of ATP the anion channel was not affected by the presence of prefd in the pipette-filling solution. In Fig. 3 the open time probabilities of the 50-pS anion channel with different pipette-filling solutions and different ATP levels of the bath solution are represented. When 100 μm MgATP was present in the bath solution, prefd decreased the Po of the channel to a lesser extent than in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP (Fig.3). The addition of 0.8 μg/ml of the deletion mutant of preferredoxin Δ6–14-prefd to the pipette-filling solution in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP in the bath solution did not block the 50-pS anion channel (Fig. 3). This deletion mutant of preferredoxin has been shown to be greatly reduced in initial binding and import efficiency (11Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the decrease in the open time probability caused by prefd is associated with binding of the precursor to the protein import machinery and subsequent translocation across the chloroplast envelope. The presence of 1.5 μg/ml ferredoxin transit peptide (trfd) in the pipette-filling solution and 0.5 mm ATP in the bath solution also resulted in a decrease of the open time probability of the anion channel. The decrease caused by trfd is, however, less than that caused by prefd (Fig. 3). Addition of 0.8 μg/ml of the transport-competent wt-prefd to the pipette-filling solution also causes transient, burst-like increases in conductivity of the chloroplast envelope. A typical example of such a response at a holding potential of 0 mV is represented in Fig.4. The burst-like increase in the conductivity of the envelope could be observed in about 50% of the single channel recordings, when wt-prefd was present in the pipette-filling solution and 0.5 mm ATP was present in the bath solution. The addition of the deletion mutant (0.8 μg/ml), Δ6–14-prefd to the pipette solution in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP does not result in a chloroplast envelope response, like that shown by the wild type precursor (not shown). This implies that only a transport-competent precursor can trigger the observed response. This strongly suggests that the envelope response triggered by wt-prefd is a result either of the binding of the precursor to or of the translocation of the precursor across the envelope. In the presence of 50 μm or 100 μm ATP, which is needed to support binding in an in vitro import assay, prefd is unable to trigger the envelope response. Also in the absence of MgATP in the bath solution, wt-prefd was unable to trigger the envelope response. The dependence of the wt-prefd-triggered response on high ATP concentrations strongly suggests that the response is associated with protein translocation across the envelope and not with binding of the precursor to the chloroplast import machinery. The wt-prefd-triggered burst-like response of the chloroplast envelope is consistent with the conductivity increase observed in whole chloroplast recordings with the chloroplasts of P. metallica(4Bulychev A. Pilon M. Dassen H. van't Hof R. Vredenberg W. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 204-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently an increase in permeabillity has also been described for the mitochondrial envelope in response to a presequence (20Lu Y. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13555-13561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 50-pS anion channel might represent the protein import channel of the inner membrane. The decrease in open time probability caused by prefd and trfd in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP could be a consequence of the translocation of the precursor or transit peptide through the channel. Because trfd is smaller than prefd, the decrease in open time probability caused by trfd is smaller than that caused by prefd. It is also possible that binding of the precursor protein to the outer membrane import machinery induces a change in conformation of components of this machinery in the intermembrane space. Due to this change in conformation the 50-pS anion channel of the inner membrane could be blocked. Binding of the precursor to the chloroplast has been shown to require low levels of ATP in the intermembrane space (18Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas translocation of the precursor requires higher amounts of ATP (19Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of the blockade of the anion channel on low amounts of ATP suggests that this blockade is already induced by the binding of prefd to the chloroplast import machinery and that the subsequent translocation of the precursor protein increases the blockade. This and the fact that the 50-pS anion channel is likely to be a component of the inner membrane favor the last possibility as an explanation for the blockade of the channel by prefd. The dependence of the burst-like response on higher amounts of ATP suggests that this response is the result of translocation of the precursor protein across the envelope rather than only binding to the import machinery. During this translocation the import machineries of the outer and the inner membrane become linked (21Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This process might induce a change in orientation between the outer and the inner membrane, e.g. the formation of a contact site. The burst-like response observed could be caused by such a change in orientation of the outer membrane relative to the inner membrane in the patch during protein import. The use of different deletion mutants of prefd with known import properties (11Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) can give further insight into the mechanisms that lead to the two effects of protein import on the chloroplast envelope observed.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). The receptor is expressed predominantly on cells of the neutrophil lineage (2Nicola N.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 9-14Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), hence interaction with G-CSF stimulates proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils from precursor cells (3Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D.

This model has been confirmed by determination of the crystal structures of several receptors including the growth hormone receptor (GH-R) (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

Zauodny P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The highly conserved Cys residues and WSXWS sequence are likely to be required for maintenance of the structure of the CRH domain. In the G-CSF-R, each of the CRH domain modules (termed BN and BC) have been expressed as soluble proteins, both of which bind G-CSF with low affinity (14Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Anaguchi H. Hiraoka O. Yamasaki K. Naito S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27845-27851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In both the BN and BC domains, the disulfide bonds were critical for maintaining a stably folded protein and the WSXWS sequence in the BC domain was also important for maintaining structure rather than ligand binding (14Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Anaguchi H. Hiraoka O. Yamasaki K. Naito S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27845-27851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to the CRH domain, the extracellular region of the receptor contains an N-terminal Ig-like domain and three FnIII domains that are C-terminal to the CRH domain (16Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Mizushima S. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8702-8706Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorenson E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of the receptor established that the CRH BN domain was essential for ligand binding and signal transduction, while the Ig-like domain also contributed to receptor function (18Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The soluble form of the extracellular region of the receptor forms a complex with G-CSF that has a 2:2 stoichiometry (7Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the Ig-like domain is required for receptor dimerization in solution (6Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the receptor that blocked G-CSF binding mapped to the Ig and CRH domains, further implicating these domains in ligand binding (19Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results of Hiraoka et al. (6Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that there are two binding sites for G-CSF on the receptor, one of which is in the CRH domain. Their model is compatible with a recent mutagenesis study which identified two regions of G-CSF apparently required for interaction with the receptor (20Reidhaar-Olson J.F. De Souza-Hart J.A. Selick H.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9034-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, Horan et al. (7Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have suggested that there is one binding site on the receptor and that dimerization involves a conformational change that follows ligand binding (7Horan T. Wen J. Narhi L. Parker V. Garcia A. Arakawa T. Philo J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4886-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of receptor dimerization is likely to be different from that of the GH-R, it is possible that one binding site on the G-CSF-R is similar to the ligand-binding site on the GH-R. We have therefore modeled the structure of the G-CSF-R CRH domain on the GH-R structure (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and predicted regions likely to be involved in ligand binding. These regions have been substituted with alanine residues to determine their contribution to ligand binding and receptor function. This approach has enabled us to define a likely ligand-binding site. The sequences of CRH domains were aligned by primarily manual means. Special care was taken to align conserved sequence patterns like the “WSXWS” motif, conserved disulfide bonds between β-strands, tyrosine corners (21Hemmingsen J.M. Gernert K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the proline-rich linker between the two FnIII domains, and the alternating pattern of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues observed in β-sandwich proteins. To find an optimal alignment between the CRH domains of G-CSF-R and the human GH-R, the only structure of a CRH domain available at that time, multiple alignments were performed using CRH domains of different species of the growth hormone receptor, G-CSF-R, the prolactin receptor, IL-6 receptor, gp130, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. 2D. K. Smith and H. R. Treutlein, submitted for publication. A β-bulge was introduced into the F-strand of the BC domain to maintain the pattern of positively charged residues forming part of the “WSXWS” structural motif. This was also required for the alignment of gp130. The model of the CRH domain of the G-CSF receptor is based on the sequence alignment described in the preceding paragraph and the coordinates of the site I growth hormone receptor (chain B of protein data bank entry 3HHR) (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The growth hormone receptor coordinates were used as a template for the β-sheet regions of the receptor and some of the loops. Other loops were taken from available structures of other FnIII domains or from a search of the protein data bank (22Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 112: 535-542Crossref Scopus (8176) Google Scholar). The model building and refinement procedure followed in general the procedure described in detail by Smith et al. 2(23Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Maurer T. Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used to construct models of IL-6 (24Hammacher A. Ward L.D. Weinstock J. Treutlein H.R. Yasukawa K. Simpson R.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2280-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (25Groenen L.C. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Treutlein H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3826-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An initial model was built using the Homology module of InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). This structure was refined using the X-PLOR program (26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for Crystallography and NMR. Anonymous Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) in conjunction with the OPLS force field (27Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar). The two conserved disulfide bridges of the BN domain formed naturally in the model building. The third disulfide bridge (14Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Yamasaki K. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22412-22419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) between the C-C′ loop and the F-strand was created using Xplor and refined separately to have reasonable stereochemical parameters before proceeding with the molecular dynamics stages. In the BC domain the modeling suggested the two disulfide bridges subsequently confirmed by Anaguchi et al. (15Anaguchi H. Hiraoka O. Yamasaki K. Naito S. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27845-27851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The quality of the model was examined as described elsewhere (23Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Maurer T. Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Nicola N.A. Norton R.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).2 All irregularities observed during our modeling procedures were analyzed in detail and subjected to further refinement with additional or modified restraints, or the initial sequence alignment was modified and the model was rebuilt. As one method to find possible dimerization sites of the G-CSF-R, we performed an analysis of the electrostatic potential generated by the CRH of the G-CSF-R. The isopotential surfaces of the model were calculated by following, in general, the method described elsewhere (23Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Maurer T. Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Nicola N.A.

Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) with the following parameters: a probe radius of 1.4 Å, an ion exclusion layer of 2.0 Å, a salt concentration of 0.145m, standard van der Waals radii, partial charges from the OPLS force field (27Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar), a solvent dielectric of 80, and a solute dielectric of 2. Histidine residues were treated as having a net charge of +0.5 e. Site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 82: 488-492Crossref Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations into the receptor cDNA in most cases. A few mutants were made with a mutagenesis kit (Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized incorporating the desired mutation(s) and usually a silent restriction enzyme site for identification of mutant cDNAs. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and the mutant cDNAs were subcloned into pEFBOS expression vector (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) for transfection. Ba/F3 murine myeloid cells (33Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) were transfected with wild type or mutant cDNAs by electroporation. Cells (4 × 106) in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 20–30 μg of G-CSF-R cDNA and 1.5–2 μg of pGKneo (34Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) were treated at 960 microfarads and 270 volts. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% WEHI-3B D− cell conditioned medium. After 48 h, 1.2 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) was added for selection of transfectants. Once cell lines were established, the G418 was discontinued and cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% WEHI-3B D−cell conditioned medium. G-CSF-R expression in transfected cell lines was determined by fluorescence analysis. Cells were stained with 10 μg/ml LMM741, an antireceptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes the FnIII domains (19Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothoicyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Silenus, Amrad, Melbourne, Australia) and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide to enable exclusion of dead cells from analysis. Cells were analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer with Lysis II software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Transfected cell lines were selected on the basis of apparent homogeneity of receptor expression and were not further cloned. To probe the structural integrity of the mutant receptors, binding of a panel of anti-G-CSF-R mAbs (19Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was assessed. The panel contained 5 conformation-dependent, neutralizing mAbs that recognize 3 epitopes and 3 mAbs that are not conformation-dependent or neutralizing and recognize 3 epitopes on the FnIII domains. A semiquantitative assay was established by titrating the mAbs and selecting a concentration for staining that was slightly suboptimal. Binding of each antibody (median fluorescence channel) was compared with that of LMM741 (used as standard) and with binding of the same pair to the wild type receptor. YPY-G-CSF (Tyr 1,3-G-CSF, Kirin, Japan) was iodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as described previously (19Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The bindability of each batch was greater than 60% and the specific activity was 4–10 × 107 cpm/μg as determined by self-displacement analysis (35Calvo J.C. Radicella J.P. Charreau E.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Data were corrected for bindability of ligand. In most cases, binding affinity was determined by titration of 125I-G-CSF up to saturating concentration, but the lower affinity mutant receptors were assessed by cold competition as described previously (19Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with the EBDA (36McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) and LIGAND (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) programs (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Ba/F3 cells expressing wild type or mutant G-CSF-R were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 104 cells/well with serial 3-fold dilutions of rhG-CSF (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) in triplicate. The 96-well plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) for the last 4 h before harvest. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Betaplate, LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland). At least three independent cell lines were tested for each mutant and each assay was repeated at least once. We created a model of the CRH domain of G-CSF-R based on its homology to the human growth hormone receptor and conserved sequence patterns found for 9 known members of closely related cytokine receptors, the so called “gp130” family of cytokine receptors. Between the sequences of the CRH domains of G-CSF receptor and growth hormone receptor we found a 34% sequence similarity and 13% sequence identity, which is in a range where homology modeling is difficult, but still feasible. The final alignment of the CRH domains of G-CSF-R with human growth hormone receptor and the gp130 family members is shown in Fig.1. The known β-strands of GH-R and the prolactin receptor are underlined, together with the predicted β-strands of the G-CSF-R. In addition to a reasonable sequence similarity, we observed a highly conserved core region in the known structures of FnIII domains: pairwise structural alignments of the β-strands B, C, E, and F among eight known FnIII domain structures show values of the root mean square deviation of atomic positions of about 1.2 Å, although all eight FnIII domains show only very low levels of pairwise sequence identities.2 This observed close structural similarity for the core region of FnIII domains considerably improves the chances of creating a reliable homology model of G-CSF-R. The primary aim of our modeling was to assist site-directed mutagenesis in identifying G-CSF-binding sites on G-CSF-R, and further to investigate the possibility of G-CSF and G-CSF-R forming a receptor complex analogous to the growth hormone receptor complex (9de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The binding site on GH-R consists mainly of four loops in the hinge region between the BN and BC domains. Based on the sequence alignment and our three-dimensional model, we identified the main regions on the CRH domain homologous to the binding site observed on GH-R. The 4 loop regions are highlighted in Fig. 1. Because there was little sequence similarity in these regions, charged, aromatic, or large hydrophobic residues were chosen for alanine substitutions as indicated in Fig. 1and Table I.Table IReceptor expression and conformation of mutants of the GHR homologous siteMutantMutation positionResidues mutatedBa/F3 transfectantsNo. receptors per cell1-aNumber of receptors per cell determined by Scatchard analysis of binding data.

Open table in a new tab The residues indicated in Fig. 1 and Table I were substituted with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis of the G-CSF-R cDNA. Mutant receptor DNAs were transfected into Ba/F3 cells and transfected cell lines were selected after analysis of receptor expression by flow cytometry. The binding of a panel of conformation-dependent anti-receptor mAbs was also tested in comparison with conformation-independent mAbs to determine whether the mutation affected the conformation of the receptor. Binding of all mAbs except LMM774 was not affected by the mutations (data not shown). Three of the mutations had little effect on LMM774 binding but mutant hGR2 showed a reduction in binding (Fig.2 A). Since this antibody is one of a pair binding to an epitope on the CRH BN domain, and the binding of the other mAb was not affected, it is likely that the residues mutated form part of the epitope recognized by this mAb. The transfectants were tested for proliferation in response to G-CSF and binding affinity for G-CSF. A representative assay of each mutant is shown in Fig. 3 and a summary of assays of at least three independent cell lines expressing each mutant or the wild-type receptor is given in TableII. All the mutant receptors were expressed at similar levels to the wild type receptor as determined by Scatchard analysis of binding data (Table I) and flow cytometry (Fig.2 A). Three of the mutations resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in both binding affinity for G-CSF and proliferation in response to G-CSF. Two of these mutants (hGR2 and hGR3) contained three amino acid substitutions located on the E-F loop and the G-A′ loop, respectively. The third was a single residue mutation, H238A, in the B′-C“ loop.Table IIEffect of mutations on G-CSF-R functionMutantProliferationEC50ratioBindingK d ratioEC 50 pmMutant/WTK d pmMutant/WTWild-type20 ± 5141 ± 31hGR 192 ± 454.762 ± 121.5hGR 24500 ± 11002302-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.420 ± 68102-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.hGR 3790 ± 270402-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.140 ± 323.32-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.hGR 4210 ± 49112-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.79 ± 91.92-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.2-a Significantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest. Open table in a new tab The residues mutated in hGR2 (E-F loop) and hGR3 (G-A′ loop) were mutated singly to alanine to determine the contribution of each residue to receptor function. In addition, we used the G-CSF-R model to identify new residues with side chains near those already identified. Five such residues in the G-A′ loop (Val201), B′-C“ loop (Ile239, Asn240), and the F′-G′ loop (Arg288, Trp289) were also mutated to alanine. All these single residue mutants were expressed in Ba/F3 cells at levels similar to the wild type receptor (2, 600–16,000 receptors/cell) and were able to bind the conformation-dependent mAbs, indicating that the mutations did not affect the structure of the receptor (data not shown). Of the residues from the hGR2 mutant, which showed reduced binding of LMM774, only the L172A mutation resulted in reduced binding of this antibody (Fig. 2 B). The effect of these mutations was tested in proliferation and binding assays (Table III). Of the residues from the hGR2 mutant (E-F loop), substitution of Tyr173 had the greatest effect, with a 30-fold reduction in proliferative response to G-CSF and a 5-fold loss of binding affinity. Mutation of Leu172 also reduced activity but had no detectable effect on binding affinity, whereas mutation of Gln174 had no effect. Mutation of the residues from hGR3 (G-A′ loop) identified one (Asp200) that significantly reduced activity, but the effects of the individual mutations did not appear to account for the loss of activity of hGR3, suggesting a synergistic effect of multiple substitutions. Mutation of the additional neighboring residues identified two that had significant effects: Ile239 from the B′-C“ loop and Arg288 from the F′-G′ loop. The R288A mutation had the greatest effect of any of the single residues, causing greater than 100-fold loss of activity and 8-fold loss of binding affinity.Table IIIEffect of additional mutations on G-CSF-R functionMutantMutation positionProliferationEC50ratioBindingK d ratioEC 50 pmMutant/WTK d pmMutant/WTWild-type20 ± 5141 ± 31L172AE-F loop110 ± 225.63-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.48 ± 41.2Y173A660 ± 130333-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.199 ± 224.83-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.Q174A24 ± 31.329 ± 20.7D197AG-A′12 ± 50.6326 ± 10.6M199A39 ± 62.059 ± 111.4D200A97 ± 195.03-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.82 ± 22.03-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.V201A24 ± 41.244 ± 11.1I239AB′-C′′1100 ± 360593-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.140 ± 103.43-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), determined by Student's ttest.N240A23 ± 31.239 ± 0.31.0R288AF′-G′5500 ± 16002803-aSignificantly different from wild-type (p < 0.01), d"
https://openalex.org/W1999622514,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor plays an important role in normal cell cycle progression and tumor growth, and it is thought to be essential for cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis, we stably transfected a GTPase-deficient mutant human Gα13, which is highly oncogenic when overexpressed in vitro, into R− fibroblasts derived from IGF-I receptor-deficient mice. Northern blots of multiple clones revealed the expression of a 1.8-kilobase pair mutant Gα13 transcript in transfected cells, in addition to the 6-kilobase pair endogenous mRNA. The transfection resulted in a doubling of the expression of Gα13 protein in these cells as assessed by Western blot analysis. The transforming ability of the mutant Gα13 was tested using the soft agar assay. Nontransfected R− cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum failed to form colonies after 3 weeks. Most of the mutant Gα13-expressing clones formed significant numbers of colonies (11–50 colonies/1000 cells plated). Overexpression of the IGF-I receptor enabled R− cells to form colonies (27 colonies), and co-transfection of the mutant Gα13 caused a further increase in colony formation (117–153 colonies) in three of five clones analyzed. Apparently Gα13 works through pathways other than mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in transforming R− cells, because their activities were not significantly altered by the mutant Gα13 expression. These results demonstrate that Gα13 can induce cellular transformation through pathways apparently independent of the IGF-I receptor and that activation of the IGF-I receptor signaling pathways, although not essential for the transforming phenotype, enhances the effect of other pathways. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor plays an important role in normal cell cycle progression and tumor growth, and it is thought to be essential for cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis, we stably transfected a GTPase-deficient mutant human Gα13, which is highly oncogenic when overexpressed in vitro, into R− fibroblasts derived from IGF-I receptor-deficient mice. Northern blots of multiple clones revealed the expression of a 1.8-kilobase pair mutant Gα13 transcript in transfected cells, in addition to the 6-kilobase pair endogenous mRNA. The transfection resulted in a doubling of the expression of Gα13 protein in these cells as assessed by Western blot analysis. The transforming ability of the mutant Gα13 was tested using the soft agar assay. Nontransfected R− cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum failed to form colonies after 3 weeks. Most of the mutant Gα13-expressing clones formed significant numbers of colonies (11–50 colonies/1000 cells plated). Overexpression of the IGF-I receptor enabled R− cells to form colonies (27 colonies), and co-transfection of the mutant Gα13 caused a further increase in colony formation (117–153 colonies) in three of five clones analyzed. Apparently Gα13 works through pathways other than mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase in transforming R− cells, because their activities were not significantly altered by the mutant Gα13 expression.

Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, IGF-I receptor undergoes autophosphorylation on intracellular tyrosine residues and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase. Mice without the IGF-I receptor gene invariably die of respiratory failure at birth and exhibit severe intrauterine growth retardation, general organ hypoplasia, and delayed ossification, demonstrating the essential role of the IGF-I receptor in normal growth and development (1LeRoith D.

Overexpression of the IGF-I receptor can transform mouse fibroblasts (4Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The presence of the IGF-I receptor was found to be necessary for proteins such as SV40 large T antigen, Ha-Ras, EWS/FLI-1 (a fusion protein produced by Ewing's family of tumors), v-Src, and bovine papilloma virus to transform target cells (5Sell C.

Furthermore, decreasing the number of IGF-I receptors by antisense RNA technology causes a reversal of the transforming phenotype, including arrest ofin vivo tumor growth (7Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the IGF-I receptor is also essential for oncogene-induced cellular transformation. Heterotrimeric (α, β, and γ subunits) guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) couple to hundreds of different receptors in mammals and are central to the signaling processes of multicellular organisms (9Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). The α subunits of G proteins belong to a large group of GTPases, which are classified into four sub-families based on amino acid homology: Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 (10Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Stimulatory (Gs) and inhibitory (Gi) G protein subtypes have been implicated in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase and the gating of certain ion channels (11Brown A. Birnbaumer L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The Gq family of proteins couple to the phospholipase C pathway (12Taylor S.J. Smith J.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17150-17156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed Gα12/13 proteins are involved in mitogenesis and transformation probably through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and activation or inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (13Strathmann M.P.

To test the hypothesis that IGF-I receptor is essential for cellular transformation, we stably transfected a GTPase-deficient mutant human Gα13 (Q226L) into R− fibroblasts derived from IGF-I receptor-deficient mice. These cells cannot be transformed by SV40 large T antigen and other oncoproteins (5Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, we found that activated human Gα13 (hGα13) is able to transform R− cells independent of the IGF-I receptor and that overexpression of both Gα13 and IGF-I receptor caused synergistic enhancement in cellular transformation. A GTPase-deficient mutation was introduced into hGα13cDNA (Ref. 14Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol.

The codon corresponding to glutamine (Q) at residue 226 was mutated to express leucine (L) and thereby generated a new restriction site Bsu361. The mutant cDNA (BglII-EcoRI) was then subcloned into the vector pcDNAIIIHA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resulting construct pcDNAIIIHAG13QL(A) (276) contains the mutant hGα13cDNA (1.5 kb) downstream of a HA tag (derived from influenza protein hemagglutinin) sequence, driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter, and genes whose products confer resistance to neomycin and ampicillin. R− cells are fibroblasts prepared from IGF-I receptor-deficient mice (5Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All cells have been cultured in complete medium consists of Dulbecco's modified Essential medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). R− cells were transfected using electroporation (6Toretsky J.A. Kalebic T. Blakesley V. LeRoith D. Helman L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Geneticin (G418 sulfate, 567 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.)-resistant colonies were selected, expanded, and tested for expression of the mutant hGα13 expression. W6+ cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (24Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) with Gα13and pZeoSV (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected with complete medium containing zeocin (150 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. The expression of the mutant hGα13 was evaluated by Northern blot analysis (25Liu J.-L. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2389-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The specific bands of expected sizes were illustrated, together with ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNAs, demonstrating equal loading of total RNA on the gel. The expression of the Gα13 protein was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using standard procedures (26Kalinec G. Nazarali A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-Gα13 antiserum (1:1000, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), which is specific to an 11-amino acid (LHDNLKQLMLQ) C-terminal region of hGα13. The level of MAPK activity was determined by using phospho-specific MAPK and p44/42 MAPK antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal Crk-L (C20) and mouse monoclonal JNK1 (F3) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) were also employed in Western blots. For assays of anchorage-independent growth, suspensions of 1000 cells in 1 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2% agarose were lain onto 1.5 ml of 0.4% agarose-containing medium in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (27Esposito D.L. Blakesley V.A. Koval A.P. Scrimgeour A.G. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2979-2988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies >0.05 mm in diameter were scored after 3 weeks of incubation at 37 C, 5% CO2 and humidified (90%) atmosphere. Three dishes were plated each time for each clone. To determine the level of IGF-I receptor expression, displacement binding of125I-IGF-I was done as described previously (28Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Scatchard analysis was performed using Scapre v4.42 and MacScafit v4.94 computer programs (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Confluent cells in 100-mm diameter dishes was incubated with serum-free medium for 20 h and stimulated with 10% FBS for 10 min. Whole cell lysate (1 mg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of JNK1 (C17) antibody and 2.5% protein A-Sepharose (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, washed twice in ice-cold RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNaV3O4, 3% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and washed twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm NaV3O4, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 3 μg of GST-Jun (Santa Cruz), 5 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). The reactions were terminated after 15 min at room temperature by adding 5 × Laemmli buffer (29Scrimgeour A.G. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B.S. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2552-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Protran membrane (Scheicher & Schuell). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the blot was first exposed to a Kodak X-Omat film and then blotted with mouse monoclonal JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz) to determine the amount of JNK1 present in the reaction. Unpaired t test was performed with InStat 2.03 computer program (GraphPad Software, San Diago, CA) Three cell lines were used in transformation studies. Previously, IGF-I receptor gene-deficient R− cells have been demonstrated to not express IGF-I receptor using immunoprecipitation, IGF-I-cross-linking, and RNase protection assay, in contrast to wild type mouse fibroblasts (5Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 6Toretsky J.A. Kalebic T. Blakesley V. LeRoith D. Helman L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Indeed, R− cells demonstrate a total lack of binding to 125I-IGF-I as determined by Scatchard analysis (data not shown). W6+ cells that overexpress IGF-I receptors demonstrate a level of IGF-I receptor expression (730,000 receptors/cell, K d of 0.16 nm) comparable with that of NWTb3 (550,000 receptors/cell,K d of 0.55 nm), which are NIH 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the IGF-I receptors (30Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To study the role of the IGF-I receptor in Gα13-induced cellular transformation, we transfected a constitutive active mutant hGα13 into R− cells. All G418 resistance transfected R− clones express a 1.8-kb mRNA hybridized to an antisense hGα13 riboprobe (Fig.1, upper panel). This band is absent in untransfected cells, despite equal amounts of total RNA loaded as shown by staining of the rRNA bands (middle panel). A 6-kb endogenous mouse Gα13 mRNA has been observed in all clones (data not shown). At the protein level, Gα13 (wild type and mutant forms) are present mainly as a 40-kDa band (lower panel), which is increased 2-fold upon transfection in all the clones selected (clones 5–26), as analyzed by densitometry. Gα13 transfection caused no morphological change in R− cells. The effect of the constitutively active mutant hGα13 on cellular transformation was tested using the soft agar assay (TableI). In three experiments each with triplicate dishes, 5 of 6 mutant hGα13-expressing clones (except 12) formed significant numbers of colonies (11–50 colonies/1000 cells plated, p < 0.05) as compared with untransfected R− cells, which formed only 1–3 tiny colonies as shown in Fig. 2. Cells expressing mutant hGα13 protein formed either significant number albeit small colonies (clones 17 and 20) or many colonies comparable in size with the ones seen in NWTb3 control cells (clones 7 and 26) (Table Iand Fig. 2). This result suggests that hGα13 can transform R− cells in the absence of the IGF-I receptor.Table IThe effect of G α13 expression in R− and W6+ cells on cell growth in the soft agar assayClonesnColonies (Mean ± SE)NWTb3993 ± 18R−92 ± 0.2R−Gα13-5911 ± 31-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.R−Gα13-7950 ± 81-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.R−Gα13-1296 ± 2R−Gα13-17912 ± 51-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.R−Gα13-20935 ± 131-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.R−Gα13-26916 ± 21-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.W6+327 ± 21-bp < 0.001 versus untransfected R− cells.W6-Gα13-3320 ± 2W6-Gα13-12315 ± 2W6-Gα13-183145 ± 381-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.W6-Gα13-193117 ± 91-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.W6-Gα13-213153 ± 161-ap < 0.05 versusuntransfected R− or W6+ cells.One thousand cells were plated on soft agar with 10% FBS and allowed to grow for 3 weeks.

Open table in a new tab One thousand cells were plated on soft agar with 10% FBS and allowed to grow for 3 weeks. Colony formation was analysed using a 10× reverse microscope. n indicates numbers of individual plates analyzed. To determine if overexpression of IGF-I receptor can further enhance the transforming ability of hGα13, W6+ cells were transfected and analyzed for the expression of hGα13 using Northern and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). Abundant hGα13 mRNA is expressed in all the clones transfected with the construct. In transfected W6+ cells, hGα13mRNA is present in two molecular forms (2.2 and 1.8 kb, upper panel); the reason for the two bands is under investigation. Mutant hGα13 expression is undetectable in untransfected R− and W6+ cells. At the protein level, Gα13 is present in two molecular forms as well (44 and 40 kDa, lower panel), co-migrating with the positive control sample (lane C). Both forms of Gα13 are increased at least 2-fold in clones 3, 12, and 19 but to a lesser degree in 18 and 21. The transforming ability of the transfected IGF-I receptor and hGα13 was tested using the soft agar assay. As shown in Table I and Fig. 2, overexpression of the IGF-I receptor enabled R− cells to form colonies (27 versus 2,p < 0.001). Transfection of W6+ cells with hGα13 caused no phenotypical change except a further increase in colony formation (117 to 153, p < 0.05) in 3 of 5 clones analyzed (although without further increase in the colony size formed by W6+ cells, Fig. 2). This effect is much greater than simple addition of the effects of hGα13 and IGF-I receptor alone, suggesting a synergism between them. In an attempt to identify signaling pathways involved in Gα13-activated cellular transformation, MAPK and JNK activities were analyzed. As shown in Fig.4 A, a 10-min incubation with 10% FBS dramatically induced MAPK phosphorylation in both untransfected R− and W6+ cells. Although basal level of MAPK phosphorylation was elevated to various degree in clones that form colonies (RG7, RG20, WG18, and WG21), transfection of Gα13 caused no obvious change in serum-activated MAPK activity. In Fig. 4 B, JNK activity was studied by in vitro GST-Jun phosphorylation. As in the case of MAPK, serum incubation-activated JNK activity dramatically in both untransfected cells. With 10% serum, Gα13 transfection caused no significant change in maximum JNK activation. Only in one clone (RG20, of six tested) Gα13 increased basal JNK activity. Therefore, we conclude that Gα13-induced cellular transformation is apparently not accompanied by changes in MAPK and JNK activities. In this study, we have confirmed that IGF-I receptor-deficient R− fibroblasts are incapable of forming colonies in soft agar and that active mutant Gα13 is highly oncogenic. The unique finding is that Gα13 is able to transform fibroblasts independent of IGF-I receptor. The role of Gα12/13, a novel class of Gα proteins, in signal transduction is under intense investigation. The Gα12/13 proteins are known to be coupled to two receptors: thyrotropin receptors in the thyroid gland, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C pathways (31Laugwitz K.L. Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and the thrombin receptor in platelets, which stimulates platelet aggregation (32Offermanns S. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26044-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is relatively clear that constitutively active Gα12/13activates Ras, which recruits the small G protein Rac, and leads to activation of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and enhanced transcriptional activity of c-Jun (14Vara Prasad M.V.V.S.

Although the Gα12/13 proteins do not activate MAPK directly, there have been reports that these activated G proteins can enhance epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced MAPK activation in Rat-1 cells (18Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibit EGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression in COS-7 cells (17Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Harhammer R. Nurnberg B. Soling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells, Gα12/13 regulate Rho-dependent responses in actin polymerization (28Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active mutants of Gα12/13 have also been known to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger (22Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.

Indeed, oncogenes including SV40 T antigen and Ha-Ras and overexpressed EGF receptors all failed to transform R− cells (5Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar); the resistance of R− cells to transformation can be abolished by expressing IGF-I receptors (5Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A.

Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a decrease in the number of IGF-I receptors caused a reversal of the transformed phenotype (7Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). C6 rat glioblastoma cells failed to grow into tumors in syngeneic rats when antisense IGF-I receptor mRNA is expressed (36Resnicoff M. Sell C. Rubini M. Coppola D. Ambrose D. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2218-2222PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that R− cells can be transformed by Gα13 in contrast to other oncogenes suggests that IGF-I receptor is not required for all the transformation processes. Nevertheless, Gα13 is not the only signaling protein capable of transforming R− cells. When transfected with constitutively active Ras or Ras plus the SV40 T antigen, R− cells were partially transformed (23Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAnglis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Most recently, Valentinis et al. (37Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oncoprotein v-Src can also bypass the requirement for a functional IGF-I receptor in transforming mouse fibroblasts. However, c-Src was unable to do so. Taken together, the results of these studies suggested that Gα13 acts independently of the IGF-I receptor in cellular transformation. Another interesting observation from this study is that Gα13 and the overexpressed IGF-I receptor act in concert in transforming R− cells. This is a very similar scenario with the reported synergism between Gα12 and c-Raf-1 in transforming NIH 3T3 cells (38Zhang Y. Saez R. Leal M.A. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2377-2383PubMed Google Scholar). In that case, the synergism seemed to occur between two parallel pathways: MAPK activated by c-Raf-1 and JNK/SAPK activated by Gα12. The IGF-I receptor is known to signal through the Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Therefore, our observation of similar synergism may well be explained by cooperation between a Gα13-activated pathway and overexpressed IGF-I receptor-induced MAPK activation. Analysis of MAPK and JNK activities upon serum stimulation revealed no change caused by mutant Gα13 expression, although in some clones their basal activities were elevated. Because the cell transformation was studied using 10% serum and the increase in basal kinase activities does not correlate with transforming ability of each clone, we propose that these two pathways are not apparently involved in Gα13-induced cellular transformation. Investigation is underway to explore the specific targets activated by Gα13 in R− cells. In summary, we have found that 1) IGF-I receptor-deficient R− fibroblasts did not form colonies in soft agar assay; 2) oncogenically active mutant hGα13 was able to transform the R− cells; 3) overexpression of the IGF-I receptor also enabled R− cells to form colonies; 4) the effects on transformation of hGα13 and the overexpressed IGF-I receptor were synergistic; and 5) Gα13-induced cellular transformation does not apparently work through MAPK or JNK pathways. Therefore, Gα13induces cellular transformation through pathways apparently independent of the IGF-I receptor. Furthermore, whereas IGF-I receptor is not essential for the transforming phenotype, it can enhance the effect of Gα13-activated pathways. We thank Dr. R. Baserga (Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA) for providing R− and W6+ cells; Dr. J. A. Toretsky (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) for help with electroporation; and Dr. A. M.

https://openalex.org/W1976976519,"A construct encoding a single chain variable fragment of the anti-P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibody C219 was made by combining the coding sequences for the heavy and light chain variable domains with a sequence encoding the flexible linker (GGGGS)3, an OmpA signal sequence, a c-myc identification tag, and a five-histidine purification tag. The construct was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the periplasmic fraction using a nickel chelate column and ion exchange chromatography. Three-step Western blot analysis showed that the construct retains binding affinity for P-glycoprotein. Crystals of 1.0 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm were grown in 100 mmcitrate, pH 4.5, 21% polyethylene glycol 6000 in the presence of low concentrations of subtilisin, resulting in proteolytic removal of the linker and purification tags. The structure was solved to a resolution of 2.4 Å with an R factor of 20.6, anR free of 28.5, and good stereochemistry. This result could lead to a clinically useful product based on antibody C219 for the diagnosis of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance.

The Fv portion of an antibody comprises the variable domains of a heavy and a light chain, and it is the smallest fragment that maintains the binding specificity and affinity of the entire antibody (1Bedzyk W.D. Weidner K.M. Denzin L.K. Johnson L.S. Hardman K.D. Pantoliano M.W. Asel E.D. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18615-18620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody fragment is produced most easily using recombinant DNA technology because, unlike Fab fragments (antigen-binding fragments), it cannot be readily produced proteolytically (2Huston J.S. Levinson D. Mudgett-Hunter M. Tai M.S. Novotna J. Margolies M.N. Ridge R.J. Bruecolen R.E. Haber E. Crea R. Oppermann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5879-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Usually a single chain construct (scFv) is made by linking the heavy and light chains with a flexible linker (3Glockshuber R. Malia M. Pfitzinger I. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4Johnson S.

This linker spans the 35-Å distance between the carboxyl terminus of one variable domain and the amino terminus of the other without distorting the conformation of the antigen binding site (3Glockshuber R. Malia M. Pfitzinger I. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because of their small size, scFv fragments could be useful in tumor imaging and therapeutic strategies (7Chaudhury V.K. Queen C. Junghans R.P. Waldmann T.A. FitzGerald D.J. Pastan I.

The murine monoclonal antibody C219 was raised against plasma membranes of multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Kartner N. Evernden-Porelle D. Bradley G. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 316: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), and is directed against Chinese hamster P-glycoprotein (Pgp), 1The abbreviations used are: Pgp, P-glycoprotein; scFv, single chain variable fragment; ABC, ATP binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; V L, light chain variable domain; V H, heavy chain variable domain; RMS, root mean square; CDR, complementarity-determining region;R, residual; Fo, observed structure factor amplitudes; Fc, calculated structure factor amplitudes. 1The abbreviations used are: Pgp, P-glycoprotein; scFv, single chain variable fragment; ABC, ATP binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; V L, light chain variable domain; V H, heavy chain variable domain; RMS, root mean square; CDR, complementarity-determining region;R, residual; Fo, observed structure factor amplitudes; Fc, calculated structure factor amplitudes. an ATP-dependent transporter. Pgp is a member of a large family of ATP-driven transmembrane transporters called ABC transporters, present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (11Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 67-113Crossref Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Pgp has been associated with multidrug resistance in some cancer cells undergoing chemotherapy (12Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Ling V. Science. 1983; 221: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence analysis, Pgp is thought to consist of two halves, each with six transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). C219 recognizes a continuous peptide epitope present in both NBDs of Pgp (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The sequence of the epitope has been determined by Georges et al. (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) to be VQ(E/A)ALD in Chinese hamster Pgp. C219 has been shown to react with all P-glycoproteins studied so far but not with other ABC transporters (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 14Barrand M.A. Twentyman P.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.J. Hughes C.S. Fine R.L. Page R.L. Cancer. 1996; 77: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The antibody therefore has been used widely for Pgp immunohistochemistry (14Barrand M.A. Twentyman P.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Lee J.J. Hughes C.S. Fine R.L. Page R.L. Cancer. 1996; 77: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Krishan A. Sauerteig A. Stein J.H. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and has also been used to characterize novel Pgp cDNAs (17Norris M.D. Gilbert J. Madafiglio J. Haber M. Gene. 1995; 1565: 313-314Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A potential disadvantage of using the whole C219 antibody in immunohistochemical studies or in immunotherapy might be that its epitope lies in the cytoplasmic portion of Pgp and is therefore relatively inaccessible. Furthermore, it has been shown that some commercial lots of the C219 monoclonal antibody contain antibodies to blood group A carbohydrate determinants (18Finstad C.L. Yin B.W.T. Gordon C.M. Federici M.G. Welt S. Lloyd K.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that commercially available C219 may cross-react with unrelated proteins (19Beaulieu E. Demeule M. Pouliot J.F. Averill-Bates D.A. Murphy G.F. Beliveau R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The use of a recombinant version of C219 may improve the uptake into cells and at the same time rule out contamination with other antibody specificities. Furthermore, it would facilitate mutagenic studies aimed at improving the binding and selectivity of the molecule and could form the basis for developing immunotoxins against cells overexpressing Pgp. Additionally, the scFv can be a useful tool in the process of crystallization of Pgp or of its separate NBDs. An atomic structure of P-glycoprotein would be of great interest in understanding the process of multidrug resistance, in particular, the atomic basis of substrate recognition and the mechanism by which ATP drives the transport process. Such a structure would also contribute valuable information on other members of the ABC superfamily. At present, structural information on ABC transporters is limited to a low resolution structure of Pgp determined by electron microscopy (20Rosenberg M.F. Callahan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and two recent theoretical models for NBDs (21Annerau J.-P. Wulbrand U. Vankeerberghen A. Cuppens H.

The protein product was purified and crystallized, and the three-dimensional structure was determined to a resolution of 2.4 Å. A cDNA clone encoding the antibody was obtained and sequenced previously. 2S. Sharma, unpublished results. The determination of its peptide epitope sequence has been described (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The expression vector pSJF2 was designed and donated by Dr. S. Foote (National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The vector is based on pUC8 (23Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar) and contains a multiple cloning site flanked by an amino-terminal OmpA leader sequence and a carboxyl-terminal c-myc epitope tag followed by a five-histidine tag for nickel chelate purification. A single chain Fv version of the monoclonal antibody C219 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The light chain sequence was amplified with the sense primer 5′-GGG-GCG-TACGAG-ACA-TTG-TGA-TGA-CAC-AG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAA-ATC-CGG-AGG-CGG-CGG-CGA-GGT-TCA-GCT-GCA-G-3′. The heavy chain sequence was amplified with the sense primer 5′-TTT-TGGATC-CTG-AGG-AGA-CGG-TGA-CCG-TGG-TCC-C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTT-TTC-CGG-AGC-CGC-CGC-CGC-CCG-AGC-CGC-CGC-CGC-CCG-AGC-TCC-AGC-TTG-GTC-CCA-GCA-3′. The light chain polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with BsiWI and BspEI, and the heavy chain fragment was digested with BspEI and BamHI. Both fragments were simultaneously cloned into pSJF2 as aBsiWI/BamHI insert, thereby combining the light chain sequence, the linker, and the heavy chain sequence. The construct was expressed in Escherichia coli TG1 cells (F′ traD36 lacI q D(lacZ)M15 pro A + B + /supE D(hsdM-mcrB)5(r k −mk − McrB − ) thyD(lac-proAB)). TG1 cells containing the expression vector were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 2% casamino acids, vitamin B1, and 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin for 31 h at 24 °C. The culture was then induced with 10% (v/v) 10 × Terrific Broth (12% tryptone, 24% yeast extract, and 5% glycerol) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 64 h at 24 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 ×g and washed once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl and once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose. Cells were osmotically shocked by rapid dilution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, and the periplasmic fraction was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g. Osmoshock supernatant was concentrated using ultrafiltration in a stir cell with a 10-kDa cutoff (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and dialyzed against 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The protein was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA); washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol; and eluted with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The protein was further purified to homogeneity using anion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Hi-TRAP Q-column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels loaded with whole cell extracts of E. coli cells overexpressing a fusion of the carboxyl-terminal NBD of Pgp to maltose-binding protein (24Sharma S. Rose D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14085-14093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were treated with scFv C219 as a primary antibody, mouse anti-c-myc as a secondary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse as a tertiary antibody. Blots were stained with diaminobenzidine and compared with conventional Western blots using intact C219 antibody. The protein was concentrated to 7 mg·ml−1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and crystallized using standard vapor diffusion in hanging drops over reservoirs containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and 21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 (Fluka), in the presence of subtilisin Carlsberg (Sigma) in a molar ratios of 1:100. Polyethylene glycol was deionized before use with a mixed bed resin (Bio-Rad). Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal with dimensions 0.2 × 0.2 × 1.0 mm at room temperature with a multiwire area detector (San Diego Multiwire Systems) mounted on a rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 40 kV, 150 mA, and reduced using the software developed by Howardet al. (25Howard A.J. Neilsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The data were checked for systematic absences using the program PARITY (from S. Evans). An initial model was obtained by molecular replacement with AMORE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), using the coordinates of entry 1IGM in the Protein Data Bank (27Fan Z.C. Shan L. Guddat L.W. He X.M. Gray W.R. Raison R.L.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1989Google Scholar), with 8% of the reflections set aside to compute anR free value. Simulated annealing by slow cooling and positional refinements were performed using data within a resolution range of 8–2.36 Å, with F/s > 2, and an absolute amplitude range of 3–106. For the final B-value refinement a low resolution cutoff of 6 Å was used. Model building and real space refinement were carried out with O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 110-119Crossref Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Conventional 2Fo-Fc maps, as well as 2Fo-Fc systematic simulated annealing omit maps, for which all residues were omitted consecutively in groups of five, were used. The geometry of the model was checked throughout the refinement with PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final model has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and has been assigned entry code 1AP2 (28Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanovichi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). A single chain variable domain construct of monoclonal antibody C219 was made, expressed in E. coli, and purified from the periplasmic fraction. Typically, the yield was 1.5–4.5 mg of protein per liter of cell culture. The protein was soluble and active, as judged from three-step Western blot analysis (Fig.1). Preliminary crystallization conditions were identified by screening a standard set of solutions (CrystalScreen, Hampton Research). Initially, crystals appeared within 3 weeks and grew to a maximum size of 0.5 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of individual crystals indicated that the crystallizing species lacks the linker peptide, c-myc epitope, and His tag (data not shown). Degradation of scFv proceeded slowly upon prolonged storage, probably due to proteolysis by contaminating proteases (Fig.2). Therefore, in subsequent crystallization experiments, subtilisin was added directly to the hanging drops. Crystals then appeared within 3 days and grew to a maximum size of 1.0 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. A preliminary x-ray diffraction evaluation of these crystals showed significant intensities to a resolution of 2.2 Å and permitted the assignment of the crystallographic unit cell to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with dimensionsa = 59.04 Å, b = 64.35 Å, andc = 154.11 Å. Based on a calculated molecular weight of 25,630, there are two scFv molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (8 per unit cell), resulting in an expected unit cell volume to mass ratio (V M) of 2.85 Å3/dalton (32Matthews B.W.

The final model had 3620 non-H2O atoms, 468 residues, and 102 water molecules. Each scFv consists of two immunoglobulin fold units, as is seen in the variable regions of antibodies, one each from the light (L) and heavy (H) chains. The two units interact noncovalently to form an internal β-barrel with the antigen binding site at one end. As mentioned above, there are two scFv molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two molecules are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis approximately along the diagonal between the a andb axes. No noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used during refinement. The variable domains of the individual light and heavy chains (V L and V H) were virtually identical (RMS deviations for the light and heavy chains were 0.44 and 0.52 Å, respectively), but in one of the molecules, the domain interface was “twisted” by about 1.4° along an axis approximately perpendicular to the pseudo-2-fold axis relatingV L to V H. This led to a RMS deviation of 3.9 Å when the complete Fv fragments were superimposed. Fig. 4 shows a strong interaction between the heavy and light chains mediated by two glutamines (Gln-H39 and Gln-L44). In the second molecule in the asymmetric unit, the distance between these two residues was increased by about 1 Å because of the twist mentioned above, but the geometry was still suitable for the formation of two hydrogen bonds. Crystal contacts between the molecules are mainly formed by Van der Waals interactions, with the exception of a strong hydrogen bond (2.74 Å) between the side chain of Gln-H65 in molecule two and the main chain carbonyl of Thr-L12 in molecule one. Two of the CDR loops (L1 and H3) do form some weak crystal contacts between the two molecules, although both binding sites are largely accessible to the solvent channels. DNA sequencing revealed a number of discrepancies with the deposited C219 sequences (heavy chain, GenBank accession no. Z33491; light chain, GenBank accession no. Z33492): Ile-L92 → Tyr, Met-L96 → Asn+Asp, Thr-H71 → Ile, and Ser-H120 → Pro. These discrepancies could be due to sequencing errors or amplification errors. Only one of these (Met-L96 → Asn+Asp) affected the binding region, CDR L3. Because this sequence (Asn, Asp) is commonly found in this loop in related light chain sequences as revealed by a BLAST search (data not shown), we ascribed this discrepancy to an error in the original deposited sequence. The final electron density is consistent with our DNA sequencing results and unambiguous where the sequence differs from the GenBank entry. Analysis of the canonical structures of the six antigen binding loops (CDRs; Ref. 34Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) showed the following conformations 3S. Vasudevan, S. Shahi, and D. R. Rose, manuscript in preparation. : L1, type 3; L2, type 1; L3, type 1; H1, type 1; and H2, type 3. Apart from loop H3, for which no canonical classes have been defined to date,3the CDRs did not have novel main chain conformations. Fig. 5 A shows the antigen binding site in relation to neighboring molecules in the crystal. Although some of the CDRs, especially L1 and H3, are involved in crystal contacts, there appears to be space for the epitope peptide to bind without perturbing the crystal lattice, which would allow us to study the conformation of the peptide in the antigen binding site. Fig.5 B shows the molecular surface of the antigen binding site, colored for electrostatic potential on the left and exposed hydrophobic residues on the right. The antigen binding surface of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are not significantly different, despite the small distortion mentioned above (data not shown). The antigen binding surface shows a charged well formed by Arg-H99 (CDR H3) and Asp-L97 (CDR L3), as well as an exposed hydrophobic patch formed by Val-H101 (CDR H3) and Phe-H33 (CDR H1). Although many similar single chain antibody fragments have been made in the past, only nine have been crystallized successfully to date (28Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanovichi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). In the crystallization of scFv C219, once the crystals were found to contain molecules with a cleaved linker, a small amount of subtilisin was used as an additive to the crystallization droplet itself, rather than prereacted. Interestingly, in a previously reported scFv structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1MFA), no electron density was found for the (uncleaved) linker region, despite the high resolution of the diffraction data (38Zdanov A. Li Y. Bundle D.R. Deng S.J. MacKenzie C.R. Narang S.A. Young N.M. Cygler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The simple approach of adding subtilisin to the crystal drops may be applicable to other single chain products or to multidomain proteins in general. The electron density for the third light chain CDR convincingly clarified the ambiguity in the primary sequence results. Clear, continuous electron density with the appropriate shape for two side chains (Asn and Asp), as opposed to a single Met, was evident at position 96. This region is very well defined, with B values well below average. Asp-L97 interacts with Arg-H99 on the antigen binding surface and may well contribute directly or indirectly to antigen binding. The comparison of the two independent scFv molecules in the final model illustrates the flexibility inV L-V H interaction in antibodies. This type of flexibility has been observed commonly in antibodies and antibody fragments and can indeed be much more significant than that observed here (39Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 40Vasudevan S. Rose D.R. Subbiah S. Protein Motions. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1996: 109-134Google Scholar). In most cases, however, conformational changes of this nature have been reported upon binding of antigen. In this structure, the small interface twist is likely an adaptation to the crystal lattice. Nonetheless, it is an example of the inherent flexibility and adaptability of antibody molecules and may be an important factor in antigen binding. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the single chain variable fragment of C219 is a first step toward obtaining detailed information on the atomic structure of Pgp and its functional domains. The corresponding epitope peptide of Pgp has been synthesized (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and shows a slight helix propensity in solution, as determined by circular dichroism. 4S. Vasudevan, personal communication. A helical wheel plot of the sequence shows an amphiphilic helix (Fig.6), in which the residues implicated in C219 binding (13Georges E. Bradley G. Gariepy J. Ling V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) are clustered on one side of the helix. This is in agreement with our model of ABC transporter NBDs (22Hoedemaeker P.J. Davidson A.R. Rose D.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). A prediction of the detailed mode of epitope binding by simulated docking, solely based on the structure of an unliganded antibody molecule, is very difficult if not impossible. However, based on the surface plots depicted in Fig.5 B and the helical wheel plot in Fig. 6, a preliminary, qualitative proposal can be made. The Asp in the epitope, identified as the most crucial determinant of binding, would be exposed on the surface of Pgp and interact with Arg-H99 in a cleft in the antigen binding site of the antibody, between H1 and L1. The Val and Leu in the epitope could then bind to a hydrophobic patch on the antibody, formed by Phe-H33 in H1 and Val-H101 in H3. Crystals of scFv in the presence of its peptide epitope have been obtained but are not yet of sufficient size and quality to allow structure determination. Obtaining suitable crystals of the scFv with bound peptide epitope would provide a confirmation of the helical nature of the epitope as observed in solution and a test of the binding mode proposed here. Attempts to crystallize Pgp or its separate domains have not been successful so far. However, binding of the scFv to separately expressed and purified nucleotide binding domains of P-glycoprotein or to the intact molecule itself will be a valuable approach in attempts to enhance the chances of their crystallization. It has been shown that the crystallization of intrinsic membrane proteins can be facilitated by the use of Fv domains to form complexes that increase the extramembrane surface area available for making crystal contacts (41Ostermeier C. Iwata S. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,42Kovari L.C. Momany C. Rossmann M.G.

As discussed in the Introduction, the antibody C219 has been used extensively in the study of the localization and properties of P-glycoprotein, as well as in the detection of P-glycoprotein-mediated drug-resistant cells. This detection may be important clinically in the evaluation of the prognosis and treatment of certain types of cancer (35Chan H.S. De Boer G. Haddad G. Ling V. Hematol. Oncol. Clin.

The scFv described here may also be a useful reagent in such detection assays and is a starting point for future variants produced by genetic engineering techniques that have improved properties for clinical application. In particular, the design and production of immunotoxins based on this construct could have a significant clinical relevance (43Better M. Bernhard S.L. Williams R.E. Leigh S.D. Bauer R.J. Kung A.H.C.

Although C219 is directed toward a cytoplasmic epitope, there are a number of efforts under way to direct compounds to the cytoplasm either by using translocation signals (e.g.charged peptide sequences (45Sheldon K. Liu D. Ferguson J. Gariepy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) or by targeting cell surface receptors (e.g. the insulin receptor (46Al-yahyaee S.A.S. Ellar D.J. Bioconjugate Chem. 1996; 7: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). An alternative approach relevant to gene therapy protocols is to express products intracellularly (47Wright M. Grim J. Deshane J. Kim M. Strong T.V. Siegal G.P. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 48Alvarez R.D. Curiel D.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In either event, it would be of interest to develop products with higher affinity and specificity. The design of these variants will be facilitated by the atomic structural analysis of the scFv as presented here. Drs. Sadhana Sharma and Elias Georges provided cDNA samples to initiate this work.

We have previously shown that 151 base pairs of c-fes5′-flanking sequences are sufficient for myeloid cell-specific expression and include functional binding sites for Sp1, PU.1, and a novel nuclear factor (Heydemann, A., Juang, G., Hennessy, K., Parmacek, M. S., and Simon, M. C. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol.16, 1676–1686). This novel hematopoietic transcription factor, termed FEF (c-fes expression factor), binds to acis-acting element that is located at nucleotides −9 to −4 of the c-fes promoter between two Ets binding sites (at −19 to −15 and −4 to +1) which bind PU.1. We now show that a FEF binding site exists in the myeloid cell-specific regulatory region of a second gene, the −2.7-kilobase pair enhancer of chicken lysozyme. The lysozyme FEF site is immediately 5′ to a PU.1 site, analogous to their arrangement in the c-fes promoter, and allows the formation of a preliminary FEF consensus site, 5′-GAAT(C/G)A-3′. This consensus site does not match any sites for known transcription factors. Importantly, although PU.1 binds immediately 3′ of the FEF site in both the c-fes promoter and the chicken lysozyme enhancer (CLE), we show that they bind independently. The FEF sites are required for high levels of transcription by both the CLE and the c-fespromoter in transient transfection experiments. Importantly, elimination of the CLE FEF site abolishes all transcriptional activity of this enhancer element. Mutation of the adjacent PU.1 site in either the c-fes promoter or the CLE, reduces activity by approximately 50%. Therefore, transcription of both lysozyme andfes in myeloid cells requires FEF and PU.1. UV cross-linking experiments show that the FEF binding activity consists of a single 70-kDa protein in both human and murine cell lines. FEF binding activity is not affected by antibodies that specifically recognize a number of cloned transcription factors. Collectively, these data indicate that we have identified a novel transcription factor that is functionally important for the expression of at least two myeloid cell-specific genes.

Hematopoiesis is a dynamic developmental process whereby pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells give rise to monocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, megakaryocytes, and erythrocytes. Myeloid cells (monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes) are likely derived from a common multipotent precursor cell. As multipotent progenitors undergo monocytic development, they differentiate into monoblasts, promonocytes, monocytes, and finally macrophages. Granulocytic differentiation includes the production of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, and then neutrophils. The factors that regulate these events have not been completely elucidated but include myeloid cell-specific transcription factors, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and signaling molecules such as protein tyrosine kinases. Several mammalian tyrosine kinases exhibit restricted patterns of expression, suggesting that they encode lineage-specific functions (2Samelson L. Phillips A. Luong E. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Introduction of c-fes into K562 cells causes these differentiation resistant cells to produce mature macrophages (12Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Corresponding experiments using antisense oligonucleotides in HL60 cells demonstrate that decreased c-fes expression leads to apoptosis instead of myeloid differentiation upon treatment with the granulocyte inducer, retinoic acid (13Ferrari S. Donelli A. Manfredini R. Sarti M. Roncaglia R. Tagliafico E. Rossi E. Torelli G. Torelli U. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar, 14Manfredini R. Grande A. Tagliafico E.

Furthermore, c-fes tyrosine kinase activity increases following treatment of HL60 cells with differentiation inducers such as Me2SO (9Smithgall T.E. Yu G. Glazer R.I. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that c-fes (like c-abl and c-fer) is one of the rare nuclear tyrosine kinases (16Yates K.E. Lynch M.R. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1239-1242PubMed Google Scholar). This specific pattern of expression and its requirement for differentiation and survival strongly suggest a role for p92c- fes in successful myeloid differentiation. Despite the apparent importance of p92c- fes and its limited, myeloid cell-specific expression pattern, very little was known about its transcriptional regulation until recently (1Heydemann A.

Of primary interest are the three 5′ proximal nuclear protein binding sites shown in Fig. 1, Ets (−19 to −15), FEF (c- f es expressionfactor) (−9 to −4), and Ets (−4 to +1). Both the upstream and the downstream Ets sites bind PU.1 in myeloid cells, and the site at −19 is required for maximal transcriptional activity (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S.

Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 615-638PubMed Google Scholar)). The list of Ets transcription factor partners is rapidly expanding and currently includes Pip (PU.1interaction partner)/NF-EM5 (28Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 29Pongubala J. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R. Atchison M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Of note, the binding of Pip to its recognition element in the immunoglobulin light chain enhancer Eλ2–4 is dependent on the presence of DNA-bound PU.1 (28Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The partners are often differentially regulated, either spatially or temporally, and the target genes are transcribed only when all factors are present at correct levels. Likewise FEF, which binds to a DNA element 5′ and immediately adjacent to a PU.1 consensus site, may be important in the combinatorial regulation of lineage-specific genes by PU.1. In this report, we present data on the binding specificity, function, and biochemical characterization of FEF. We show that FEF, in conjunction with PU.1, is required for the transcription of at least two myeloid cell-specific genes (c-fes and chicken lysozyme) and that the FEF consensus binding site is 5′-GAAT(C/G)A-3′. The FEF DNA binding site is located immediately adjacent to a 3′ PU.1 site in both the c-fes and lysozyme genes. FEF, however, can bind to both sites independently of PU.1, unlike the PU.1 cofactor Pip (28Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,37Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Remarkably, both a 13-kb human c-fes and a 21.5-kb chicken lysozyme genomic fragment confer myeloid cell-specific expression independent of integration site (35Greer P. Maltby V. Rossant J. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2521-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bonifer C. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Sippel A.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). FEF may play a role in this process. Furthermore, FEF consists of a single 70-kDa polypeptide that is expressed in hematopoietic cells. The human myeloid cell lines U937 and K562 were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Mel cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing the same additives. The murine adherent macrophage cell line J774.1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal horse serum, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. For either electroporation or preparation of nuclear extracts, the appropriate cell lines were passaged 1:3 the evening before the procedure was performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (38Andrews N. Faller D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) were performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract with 10,000 cpm of end-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min at room temperature as described previously (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This represents 0.5 ng of probe with a specific activity of 1–2 × 107 cpm/μg of DNA. Binding buffers contained 7.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.74 mm EDTA, 3% Ficoll, 56 mm KCl, and 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, with or without 0.15 ng of bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, 100 ng of cold competitor oligonucleotide or 2 μl of specific antibody were included in the room temperature incubation. This constitutes a 200-fold molar excess when the cold competitor extends from −11 to +11 of c-fes and a 270-fold molar excess when the −11/+5 oligonucleotide is added. The following antibodies: Creb-1, ATF-2, YY1, Myb, NF-E2, Nrf1, Nrf2, pan-Fos, pan-Jun, PU.1, and Elf-1 specifically concentrated for EMSAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All antibodies have been tested against the specific transcription factor with either nuclear extracts or in vitrotranscription/translation reactions (data not shown). The various c-fes probes used for the EMSAs are illustrated in Fig. 1, and the mutations are illustrated under the appropriate figures. The c-fes probe used for UV cross-linking experiments extends from −11 to +11 (Fig. 1) and contains labeled dCTP and dGTP and unlabeled bromodeoxy-UTP on the bottom strand. UV cross-linking assays used typical EMSA conditions scaled up five times. The EMSA gel was exposed to 240 mJ of 260-nm ultraviolet light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and then exposed to BioMax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) so that gel-shifted bands could be excised and eluted. Shifted bands were eluted in 1% SDS sample buffer and run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with molecular weight markers. Methylation interference assays were performed as 5-fold scale-ups of the normal EMSA conditions using methylated probes labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reaction mixtures contained 50 μg of nuclear extract protein or 5 μl of in vitro translated protein and 5 × 105 cpm of methylated probe in a final volume of 100 μl. Wet gels were exposed to film overnight at 4 °C. Piperidine cleavage was performed on eluted DNA from specific shifted and free probe bands. The final 6.66% acrylamide/area gel contained an equal amount of radiation in each lane to facilitate comparisons between free probe and DNA-protein complexes. Transient transfections were performed as described previously (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The electroporations were performed with 100 μg (U937) or 50 μg (K562) of luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of human growth hormone (GH) reference plasmid. Following electroporation, the U937 cells received 54 nmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to increase transfection efficiency (39Pahl H. Burn T. Tenen D. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1038-1041PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 13 h later and assayed for protein content, level of secreted GH, and luciferase activity. Luciferase assays were performed on equivalent amounts of extracted protein. GH activity was measured in the media of transfected cells as specified by the Nichols Institute. As a control for transfection efficiency, luciferase plasmid expression is reported as relative light units normalized to nanograms of GH secreted into the medium. All transfections were performed six or more times to ensure reproducibility of cesium chloride DNA preparations. The constructs used to analyze the c-fes promoter contained −446 to +71 of 5′ sequences relative to the transcription start site (using the numbering assignment of Alcalay et al. (40Alcalay M. Antolini W. Van de Ven WJ Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. Pelicci P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar)). The PCR-engineered mutations within the c-fes promoter are the underlined letters in the following sequences, starting at bp −26: mPU.1 upstream, 5′-CGGGAGCACCGGGCGCGGAATCAGGAACTG-3′; mFEF, 5′-CGGGAGGAGGAAGCGCGCCACCAGGAACTG-3′; and mPU.1 downstream, 5′-CGGGAGGAGGAAGCGCGGAATCACCGGCTG-3′. These mutations match those used in the EMSAs to ensure that the specific mutation disrupts the binding of a single protein. The chicken lysozyme enhancer fragment used for these assays extends from −2694 to −2535 (41Ahne B. Stratling W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17794-17801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was retrieved via PCR and these primers: 5′-ttaggatccGTACATCTGCAGTTGGCAGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttagtcgacAGATCTGATCTCCGCTAACTC-3′ (reverse). The mutations engineered into the chicken lysozyme enhancer by PCR are the underlined bases in the following sequences starting at bp −2655: mFEF, 5′-GACCACGAGGAACTA-3′ and mPU.1, 5′-GAGAATGACCGGCTA-3′. Once again these mutations are specific for the designated factor based on EMSA analysis. The enhancer was placed into a vector containing either the c-fes or the chicken lysozyme promoter and the luciferase reporter gene. The chicken lysozyme promoter was also retrieved via PCR and the following primers: 5′-atagctagcTGCTTCAGATGCTGTTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ataaagcttCACACAGCGGGACTGCAA-3′ (reverse). The final construct extends from −439 to +14 (42Grez M. Land H. Giesecke K. Schutz G. jung A. Sippel A.E. Cell. 1981; 25: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All of the transfection constructs have been sequenced to guarantee that the desired mutations were made. This also ensures that no unwanted mutations have been introduced by any of the PCR manipulations. The proximal region of the c-fes promoter and the primary transcription initiation site in U937 cells (40Alcalay M. Antolini W. Van de Ven WJ Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. Pelicci P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar) are illustrated in Fig.1. We have shown previously that this region is required for high levels of myeloid cell-specific gene expression (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We identified a functional Ets binding site at −19 relative to the transcription start site, and showed that PU.1 binds here and transactivates the c-fes promoter in co-transfection assays. We also identified a nuclear protein binding site between −9 and −4 (previously called FP4-3′) which is required for high levels of expression in myeloid cells. This region includes a nonconsensus AP-1 family member binding site on the opposite strand (5′-TGATTCC-3′, nucleotides −10 to −4). However, we showed that AP-1 family members do not bind to FP4–3′. In the current study, we extend these data and show that the bound protein represents a novel transcription factor. We have therefore labeled the site FEF. Also shown is an immediately adjacent PU.1 binding site at nucleotide −4 (17Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to assess the role of each of these nuclear protein binding sites in the expression of c-fes and further characterize the FEF DNA-binding activity. Although the FEF binding activity was initially identified in the human monoblastic cell line U937, all human cell lines examined also contained an abundant, nonspecific binding activity which nearly co-migrated with the FEF·DNA complex in gel retardation assays (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Therefore, we tested the murine macrophage cell line J774.1 for the presence of FEF binding activity hoping to eliminate the nonspecific activity and thus simplify further analyses. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both human and murine myeloid cell lines contained FEF binding activity in EMSAs performed with a radiolabeled c-fes oligonucleotide extending from bp −11 to 5 (lanes 1 and 3). The FEF·DNA complex was specifically competed by 100 ng of wild-type cold competitor oligonucleotide (representing a 200-fold molar excess) in assays of both nuclear extracts (lanes 2 and 4). However, as expected, the nonspecific band detected in U937 nuclear extracts was not efficiently competed (open arrow, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, the J774.1 nuclear extracts did not contain the nonspecific activity (lane 3). Specific PU.1 DNA binding activity was detected in both human and murine myeloid cell lines (arrow). Because none of the tested murine cell lines contained a nonspecific binding activity (see Fig. 2 B), murine cell nuclear extracts were used for the EMSAs throughout this work. To determine the tissue distribution and cell lineage specificity of the FEF nuclear protein complex, EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from murine cell lines and tissues. The human FEF activity is largely restricted to myeloid cell lines, being present in U937, THP-1, HL60, K562, KG-1, and HepG2 cell lines and not present in Jurkat (T cells), Clone13 (B cells), or HeLa (epithelial carcinoma) cell lines (1Heydemann A. Juang G. Hennessy K. Parmacek M.S. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, in murine cell lines the factor is more widely distributed; FEF binding activity was detected in J774.1 (myeloid), Mel (erythroid), RMA (mature T), EL-4 (immature T), 38B9 and 70Z/3 (pre-B), and A20 and WEHI (B) cells (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, FEF was undetectable or expressed at lower levels in the A7R5 smooth muscle cell line (lane 10) or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (lane 11). PU.1 binding activity was detected in the J774.1, 38B9, 70Z/3, A20, and WEHI cell lines (lanes 1, 5–7, and 8). Based on these experiments, we concluded that the FEF transcription factor is broadly expressed in murine hematopoietic cells. We wished to identify the precise nucleotides required for FEF DNA recognition, therefore EMSAs were performed with various wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides as cold competitors. In a series of preliminary experiments, Mel cell nuclear extracts were incubated with increasing amounts of specific and nonspecific cold competitor oligonucleotides to verify the specificity of FEF binding activity. The wild-type oligonucleotide corresponding to bp -11 to +11 of the c-fespromoter began to compete for FEF binding when 10 ng (a 20-fold molar excess) were added to binding assays while 100 ng (a 150-fold molar excess) of a nonrelated Sp1 oligonucleotide failed to compete (data not shown). Therefore, all experiments were performed using 100 ng of cold competitor oligonucleotides. This represents a 200-fold molar excess of cold competitor over the −11/+11 oligonucleotide probe. Fig.3 C shows an EMSA performed with Mel cell extracts and radiolabeled c-fesoligonucleotide (−11/+11) as the probe. This cell line exhibits specific Elf-1 and FEF binding activities (lanes 1 and2). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, these Mel cells do not contain PU.1 DNA binding activity. However, we detected Elf-1 binding activity at the Ets site based on antibody “supershift” assays (see Fig. 9 A). As shown in lane 4 of Fig.3 C, a 3-bp mutation at positions −9, −8, and −6 of the oligonucleotide inhibits binding of FEF to the cold competitor, thereby identifying at least one of these bases as important for FEF-DNA interaction. The Elf-1 binding activity was not affected as the “mFEF” oligonucleotide still competes for the Elf-1 complex. A mutation at the −4 Ets site converting 5′-GGAA-3′ to 5′-CCGG-3′ eliminated the ability of the cold competitor oligonucleotide to compete for Elf-1 binding activity (lane 5). However, mutation of this Ets site does not interfere with FEF binding, indicating that the FEF site does not require the guanine at position −3 for protein binding (lane 4). Furthermore, an oligonucleotide with mutations at positions −10 and −11 had no effect on FEF-DNA recognition (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that FEF binds at positions −9 to −4 within the c-fes promoter which includes the nucleotides 5′-GAATCA-3′. Importantly, when the −11/+11 oligonucleotide containing mutations at positions −9, −8, and −6 (mFEF) was used as a probe, FEF binding activity in Mel cell extracts was not detected (Fig. 3 D, lanes 4 and5).Figure 9Investigation of the immunoreactivity of FEF·DNA complexes with antibodies to transcription factors found in hematopoietic cells. A, J774.1 and Mel cell extracts were assayed by EMSA and the listed antibodies. The Elf-1 and PU.1 complexes were “supershifted” or inhibited by the appropriate antibodies (lanes 3, 4, 10, and 11).B, Mel cell extracts were assayed by additional antibodies including those specific for Creb-1, ATF-2, and YY1.

Likewise, the detergent dodecylphosphoglycerol (PGD), with a phosphatidylglycerol-like headgroup, could also stimulate the MGlcDAG synthase activity efficiently with a concomitant protection toward proteolytic digestion. Neither proteolytic resistance nor restored enzyme activity was observed using soluble glycerol 3-phosphate. It is concluded that in addition to critical amounts, both the negatively charged headgroup and hydrophobic chains of the activator amphiphiles, but not a certain aggregate curvature, seem necessary for a proper conformation and the resulting active state of the MGlcDAG synthase. 1,2-Diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase synthesizes the major nonbilayer-prone lipid monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) in the membrane ofAcholeplasma laidlawii, which is important for the spontaneous curvature, and is a regulatory site for the lipid surface charge density.

The roles of native lipids are more and more evident in the function of membrane proteins, especially the influence of such lipids on protein conformation and folding state (e.g. 1Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2De Jongh H.H.J. Ritsma T. Killian A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). InAcholeplasma laidlawii membranes, the major phospholipids and glucolipids are extensively regulated under a variety of conditions to maintain certain properties like (i) a constant surface charge density (3Christiansson A. Eriksson L.E.G. Westman J. Demel R. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 3984-3990Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), (ii) a nearly constant spontaneous curvature (4Österberg F. Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Gruner S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and (iii) phase equilibria close to a potential bilayer to non-bilayer transition (5Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These properties seem to be sensed and regulated by the different lipid-synthesizing enzymes involved. The pathways of the syntheses in vivo of the major lipids (in bold) are as follows. MGlcDAG, a major nonbilayer-forming lipid synthesized from DAG, is the first glucolipid in the glucolipid pathway; this is catalyzed by 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (MGlcDAG synthase). 1The abbreviations used are: MGlcDAG-synthase, 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase; DAG, 1,2-diacylglycerol; DGlcDAG, 1,2-diacyl-3-O-[α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol; DO, dioleoyl; DOG, sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol; MGlcDAG, 1,2-diacyl-3-O-(α-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PGD, dodecylphosphoglycerol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; BM, benzophone-4-maleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. The major, bilayer-forming glucolipid DGlcDAG is consecutively synthesized from MGlcDAG (6Smith P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 480-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Derivatives of these two glucolipids, with an extra, third acyl chain may also be synthesized under certain conditions in vivo (9Andersson A.S. Rilfors L. Bergqvist M. Persson S. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11119-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The MGlcDAG synthase is dependent upon a lipid environment where a critical fraction of anionic amphiphiles, such as PG, must be present (10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This dependence of the enzyme seems most likely involved in keeping the rate balance between the PG and glucolipid pathways in vivo, maintaining a constant surface charge density of the lipid bilayer. The lamellar/nonlamellar balance and curvature are more likely regulated by the synthesis of DGlcDAG because this step is strongly affected by nonbilayer-forming additives in vitro (11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), thus increasing the turnover of the nonbilayer-prone MGlcDAG into the bilayer-forming DGlcDAG. Anionic lipids were essential for the recovery of MGlcDAG synthase activity in both membrane vesicles and for pure enzyme in micelles (7Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This followed a similar lipid dependence as for certain soluble proteins activated by membrane surface association,e.g. protein kinase C (12Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar, 13Parker P.J. Kour G. Marais R.M. Mitchell F. Pears C. Schaap D. Stabel S. Webster C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 65: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (14Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the MGlcDAG synthase is firmly anchored in the membrane and only solubilized efficiently by detergents and certain chaotrophic salts. 2O. P. Karlsson, unpublished data. Hence, activation must involve changes of either the membrane-bound enzyme or its local environment, like altered protein conformation or aggregation state, or lipid domain formation, respectively. Limited proteolysis by proteases is a useful method for the study of protein conformation (15Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Arnold U. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Ulbrich-Hofmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 862-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Webb T. Jackson P.J. Morris G.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) since such enzymes preferentially cleave at exposed regions between structural domains. Here we apply this to investigate the digestion resistance of the MGlcDAG synthase in different amphiphile mixtures. A very good correlation was observed between the extent of digestion resistance and enzyme activity for the MGlcDAG synthase. This indicates that between the active and inactive states in differently composed micelles, there is most likely a conformational change of this enzyme. The detergent dodecylphosphoglycerol (PGD), which has a headgroup similar to PG (18Chupin V. Leenhouts J.M. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3141-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), could also efficiently enhance the enzyme activity with a concomitant proteolytic resistance. Hence, an amphiphilic environment with a critical fraction of negatively charged headgroups induces a catalytic, active conformation of the MGlcDAG synthase. A.laidlawii strain A-EF22 was cultivated in an oleic acid (C18:1) supplemented medium and harvested, and the protein content of cells and membranes was determined as described by Dahlqvist et al. (11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG were prepared from A. laidlawii grown in the presence of oleic acid, which gives polar lipids with more than 90% (mol/mol) C18:1 acyl chains (11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Synthetic rac-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (1,2-DOG) was purchased from Larodan (Sweden). DOPG, DOPC, and DOPS were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, and PGD was from Alexis (Switzerland). Immobilized proteinase K was purchased from Merck (Germany), and trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). Fluorescein-5-maleimide (FM) and benzophone-4-maleimide (BM) were from Molecular Probes. Homogeneous MGlcDAG synthase was purified from detergent-solubilized A. laidlawii cells by three column chromatography methods, including ion exchange, gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite chromatography, according to the procedure by Karlsson et al. (10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). “Detergent-free” enzyme was accomplished using the same procedure with only the last method modified. Here, the buffers used for eluting the hydroxyapatite chromatography column were changed to be devoid of the detergent CHAPS. No analysis of CHAPS remains was done. However, if no high-affinity binding of CHAPS to the enzyme occurs, the elution procedure is expected to remove all detergent from the column. Lipid mixtures with desired composition were first dried under a stream of nitrogen, and then put in vacuum overnight to remove trace amounts of organic solvents. The lipids were then hydrated in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 20 mm MgCl2, pH 8. The mixtures were vortexed vigorously at room temperature until they became emulsified. These multilamellar vesicles were made and used the same day. In micelles, the assays were performed as described before (10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the assays in liposomes, MGlcDAG synthase was added to prepared liposomes and kept on ice for 30 min, followed by preincubation at 28 °C for 3 min. Enzyme reactions were started by addition of UDP-[C14]glucose (37–74 GBq/mol). After 10 min of incubation at 28 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of methanol/chloroform 2:1 (v/v), and lipids were extracted and subsequently separated by thin layer chromatography (8Dahlqvist A. Andersson S. Wieslander Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1105: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Wieslander Å. Rilfors L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Synthesized MGlcDAG was quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant ImagerTM). Lipids were mixed and dried under a stream of N2 and then under vacuum for 2 h. The lipid mixtures were totally solubilized in 20 μl of CHAPS buffer overnight at 4 °C. MGlcDAG synthase (0.1–0.5 μg, 10 μl) was incubated with lipid mixed micelles at a final concentration of 10 mm lipids, 110 mmTris-maleate, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmCHAPS, pH 8, for 30 min on ice. Immobilized proteinase K (>0.1 unit) was added to the mixed micelles or prepared liposomes. The mixtures were gently vortexed at 28 °C for 10 min. The proteolysis was terminated by removing the immobilized proteinase K using centrifugation at 2000 × g, and supernatants were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Likewise, 0.02 μg of trypsin or 0.1 μg of chymotrypsin was used to digest MGlcDAG synthase in lipid micelles at 28 °C for 10 min, respectively. Here, the reactions were stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The enzyme was incubated with a different concentration of urea in 110 mmTris-maleate, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmCHAPS, pH 8, plus/minus 9 mm DOPG for 30 min on ice. Proteinase K is resistant to fairly high urea concentration. Then the samples were used for the activity assays and proteolytic digestion in the presence of DOPG as in the methods described above. Purified MGlcDAG synthase was treated with 10 mm DTT at 30 °C for 10 min. Excess DTT was then removed by using dialysis overnight against 110 mm Tris-maleate, 20% glycerol, 20 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8. A lipid micellar solution containing 10 mm lipids, 20 mm CHAPS, 20 mmMgCl2, 110 mm Tris-maleate, pH 8, was mixed with 0.1 μg of MGlcDAG synthase for 30 min on ice. Fluorescein-5-maleimide or benzophone-4-maleimide was added to 2.5 mm, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, respectively. The reactions were stopped by adding 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (20Tao T. Scheiner C.J. Lamkin M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7633-7639Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Jones P.C. Sivaprasadarao A. Wray D. Findlay J.B.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from the micellar solution by partitioning in organic solvent (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed using 15% acrylamide in the resolving gel for proteolytically digested samples (23Nyström S. Wallbrandt P. Wieslander Å. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Quantification of protein bands in stained gels was carried out using an ImagerMaster™ (Pharmacia LKB). The relative intensity of the stained enzyme bands was presented as the relative proteolytic resistance. The MGlcDAG synthase has a strong dependence on a critical fraction of anionic lipids both in micelles and in bilayers. Uncharged, neutral charge, or positively charged lipids could not function as activators (7Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The relative activity and proteolytic digestion resistance of the MGlcDAG synthase in different lipid-CHAPS micelles are shown in Fig. 1. The resistance against proteinase K digestion in the different mixed micelles was visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). With no lipids present, the MGlcDAG synthase could be totally digested. However, the enzyme revealed high restored activity in DOPG- and DOPS-containing micelles, but no restored activity could be observed in DOPC- and DGlcDAG-containing micelles nor in CHAPS only. The lipids without negative charge, like DOPC and DGlcDAG, could not protect MGlcDAG synthase from proteolysis, whereas DOPG and DOPS could efficiently protect the enzyme from digestion. The same protective ability of DOPG could also be observed by using the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin (data not shown). The activity and proteolytic resistance of the MGlcDAG synthase varied in a correlated manner when the fraction of the activator DOPG in the lipid matrix (DGlcDAG or DOPC) was changed (Fig.2). The enzyme activity was enhanced when the DOPG ratio in total lipids was increased while the enzyme became more resistant to the digestion by proteinase K. However, it was found that by extending incubation times the enzyme could also be digested at the most protective conditions, i.e. the longer the proteolytic time the more digested was the enzyme, even in the presence of DOPG. Potential, large changes in orientation or exposure of the micelle-associated enzyme was monitored by the labeling of cysteine residues, present in local hydrophobic or hydrophilic environments, with two specific agents. Small and medium mass proteins reveal easily detectable changes of migration distance in SDS-PAGE when labeled with the large and bulky agents FM (hydrophilic) and BM (hydrophobic), respectively (21Jones P.C. Sivaprasadarao A. Wray D. Findlay J.B.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, no changes in labeling with these two agents, binding to hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, respectively, were observed (data not shown) as a function of different lipid composition (cf. Fig. 1). Hence, the overall membrane topology of the enzyme is most likely not changed by the lipid environment, but an orientational change of an exterior (hydrophilic) domain is possible. Furthermore, cross-linking studies in mixed micelles strongly indicate that the active enzyme is a monomer. 3L. Li, O. P. Karlsson, and Å. Wieslander, unpublished observation. The results above show that there is correspondence between the activity and proteolytic digestion resistance for the MGlcDAG synthase. When the enzyme showed high activity, it also had high digestion resistance in mixed lipid micelles. Some other proteins have also been found to have similar features. Anionic phospholipids could recover activity and protect the FAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium smegmatis, while zwitterionic phospholipids could not. At the same time, little secondary structure change could be detected (24Imai T. Kageyama Y. Tobari J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 is known to associate much more favorably with a negatively charged membrane surface compared with a zwitterionic one, with a conformational change upon activation (25van den Berg B. Tessari M. de Haas G.H. Verheij H.M. Boelens R. Kaptein R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4123-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The thermostability of MGlcDAG synthase in different micelles also varied according to the lipid environment. Fig.3 shows the correlation between the thermostability and digestion resistance of the enzyme. With prolonged incubation at 28 °C, the enzyme activity became lower both in DOPG and DOPC micelles, but the half-life differed. The half-time at 28 °C in DOPG-CHAPS micelles was more than 2 h, while in CHAPS and DOPC-CHAPS micelles it became less than 0.5 h. This suggests that the activator DOPG could stabilize the enzyme efficiently against thermo-deactivation. Similar features were also shown by the proteolysis experiments. Enzyme with low activity, due to longer incubation times both in the presence and in the absence of DOPG, also revealed a low digestion resistance. Does the negatively charged DOPG inhibit the activity of proteinase K? The denaturant urea was used to study whether the susceptibility of active or denatured MGlcDAG synthase to proteinase K was affected by DOPG since urea does not inhibit the activity of proteinase K (see “Experimental Procedures”). MGlcDAG synthase denatured by 3m urea for 30 min on ice had no activity at 28 °C, and it could be digested totally by proteinase K even if DOPG was added after the urea incubation while the enzyme without urea showed high activity and digestion resistance at the same conditions. In 1m urea, a low activity and proteolytic resistance were preserved (data not shown). It is also evident from Fig. 3 (no urea) that the MGlcDAG synthase became more easily digested by subsequently added proteinase K by prolonged time at 28 °C in the presence of DOPG. These results suggest that the negatively charged molecule PG itself does not interfere with proteinase K. When the enzyme was held at 28 °C for more than 2 h, DOPG could neither restore the activity nor protect the enzyme from digestion. In this case, both the deactivation and the conformational changes of the enzyme were irreversible. In contrast, the conformational changes by different amphiphile composition were reversible. This reversibility was valid both for activity and proteolytic resistance, which then must result from a conformational change of the enzyme. In lipid-CHAPS mixed micelles, the aggregate curvature might be influenced by the ratio between the bilayer-forming polar lipids and the micellar CHAPS. Hence, the enzyme stimulation may result from the negatively charged PG molecules but be influenced by the curvature of mixed-micelles. Potential enzyme activity in more highly curved aggregates were analyzed by using the micelle-forming detergent PGD, which has a negatively charged headgroup similar to PG but only one hydrophobic chain. Around 30% of PGD in total amphiphiles could restore the MGlcDAG activity (Fig. 4), and the highest restored activity was about the same as with DOPG as the activator. Proteolytic resistance was found to correlate with the activity also in PGD-CHAPS micelles (Fig. 4), similar to the PG-CHAPS micelles. However, an excess amount of activator PGD could neither stimulate the activity nor protect enzyme from digestion, which was also observed with excess amounts of DOPG. The enzyme activity became higher with the PG content, but a content of over 33% (mol %) decreased the enzyme activity (10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteolytic resistance in PG-CHAPS micelles showed the same pattern of variation. Glycerol 3-phosphate, a hydrophilic molecule with a negatively charged phosphate group, and an isomer of the PG head, could not restore the enzyme activity when used as a potential activator up to 2m. This suggests that a hydrophobic interaction with the activator, or a surface position of the negatively charged amphiphile headgroup, is important for the protein conformation and activity. It can be concluded that it is anionic amphiphiles like PG, PS, or PGD, but not the aggregate curvature or the negatively charged headgroup only, that are essential for the restoration of a proper conformation and enzyme activity of the MGlcDAG synthase. Can the stiff CHAPS molecule confer any conformational features to the enzyme? The purified MGlcDAG synthase, prepared free from CHAPS, was used to study how PG affects the enzyme in liposome bilayers (without CHAPS). Fig.5 shows that the activity was enhanced by increasing the PG content in liposomes. Activity could be restored, and the enzyme showed increasing digestion resistance to proteinase K when PG content was raised over 20% (mol/mol). The catalytic domain of the enzyme might bind to the bilayer at activating fractions of DOPG initially by an electrostatistic interaction and subsequently by more firm hydrophobic interactions. The latter can be of a slower rate compared with the former. It can be concluded that an electrostatistic interaction seems necessary for the restoration of the enzyme activity and the protective, catalytic conformation of the enzyme also in bilayer membranes. A strong dependence of enzyme activity on the Mg2+concentration, with a maximum at ∼20 mm, has been recorded (10Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, from proteolytic experiments it was shown that PG in CHAPS micelles could protect the enzyme from digestion also in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). It is thus likely that Mg2+ does not contribute to the tight conformation or binding of the enzyme in PG-CHAPS micelles. Another possibility is that Mg2+ alters the charge distribution on the enzyme or in the surrounding lipid surface or that the enzyme has a specific Mg2+ site. Neither of the substrates, 5 mol % 1,2-DOG and 1 mm UDP-glucose, seemed to have any evident influence on the conformation of the enzyme, as detected by proteolysis protection in micelles (data not shown). The results presented in this report show that activating amphiphiles could protect the MGlcDAG synthase from proteolytic digestion. However, longer digestion times in proteolytic experiments will result in nearly total digestion of the enzyme even in DOPG activator (data not shown). Similar behaviors were also found for the proteolytic susceptibility of ribonuclease A (26Arnold U. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Ulbrich-Hofmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and annexins IV and VI (27Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Sikorski A.F. Bialkowska K. Sobota A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The interaction between MGlcDAG synthase and the anionic activator amphiphiles could be of electrostatic origin and make part of the enzyme bind rather tightly to the membrane or micelle surface, and/or cause a more compact enzyme conformation. Both alternatives can make the enzyme less accessible to proteases. The MGlcDAG synthase is not considered to be very hydrophobic since it can be dissolved without detergent and can be released from A. laidlawii membrane by the chaotrophic salt KSCN.2However, as reported here, the amphiphilic property of the activator is necessary for the restoration of catalysis activity and the active state or conformation. Hence, there might be a hydrophobic anchor domain in the enzyme that is permanently inserted into the membrane interior, like in many eukaryotic glucosyltransferases (28Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme may be governed by the association of the exterior, hydrophilic domain of the enzyme with a properly charged (anionic) membrane surface. This activation is, from the data presented here, strongly indicated to involve significant conformational changes of the enzyme. Viola Tegman, Susanne Vikström, and Stefan Berg are acknowledged for excellent technical assistance and valuable discussions."

Possible implications of these observations for the effects of aminoglycosides on eukaryote cells are discussed. Aminoglycosides have gained widespread use over the last fifty years as antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria and some protozoa. In prokaryotes, aminoglycosides reduce the fidelity of protein synthesis on ribosomes and block polypeptidyl-tRNA translocation, through interactions with A-site 16 S rRNA (1Fourmy D. Recht M.I.

Chemother. 1995; 7: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that efforts to understand all possible mechanisms of action of these compounds must be re-doubled with the long term aim of designing new and possibly more effective drugs. Toxicity against mammalian cells (especially in the kidney) is one undesirable side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics (reviewed (7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). Removal of this side effect from the next generation of aminoglycoside antibiotics will require information on how these compounds affect mammalian cells. Molecular geneticists employ aminoglycosides to eliminate eukaryote cells that fail take up and/or express selectable markers (e.g. neomycin phosphotranferase) after DNA-mediated transformation. Although the exact mode of cell killing has not been worked out, the antibiotics interfere with RNA splicing (8von Ahsen U. Davies J. Schroeder R. Nature. 1991; 353: 368-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and interact with negatively charged phospholipids (7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The toxic effects on eukaryote cells is thought to be due in part, at least, to alterations of the properties of the plasma and other cellular membranes (7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A.

Ther. 1984; 231: 48-55PubMed Google Scholar) although it is not clear from those studies whether the aminoglycosides affected the PI-PLCs directly. Recently, a secreted PI-PLC from the prokaryoteBacillus cereus was shown to be activated by G418 (11Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Zhai H.-X. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15468-15477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From the last observation, it was proposed that the antibiotics might exert their cytotoxic effects, in part, by activation of cellular enzymes. Herein, we report stimulation of a purified eukaryotic enzyme, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, itself susceptible to the antibiotics, by members of the neomycin group. Neomycin B protected the enzyme from a reduction in reaction rate observed at slightly acidic pH and increased the turnover number (k cat) of GPI-PLC. Evidence is presented that 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diaminoglucose in the neomycin group of aminoglycosides is very important for activation of the PLCs from T. brucei and Bacillus thuringiensis. Recombinant GPI-PLC was purified by a published protocol (12Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purified PI-PLC from Bacillus thuringiensiswas a gift from Dr. Ming-Daw Tsai (Ohio State University). 2-Deoxy-streptamine, neamine, and ribostamycin were gifts from Dr. Julian Davies (University of British Columbia). Geneticin (G418) was from Life Technologies, Inc. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid (40 Ci/mmol) was supplied by NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents, unless otherwise indicated were from Sigma. [3H]Myristate-labeled membrane-form variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) ([3H]mfVSG) was purified from T. brucei (ILTat 1.3) as described previously (12Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were assembled on ice in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The quantity of enzyme used was determined empirically; the amount of enzyme that cleaved ∼50% of [3H]mfVSG was used in the kinetic analyses, to stay within the linear range of the assay (13Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GPI-PLC (9.5 units, 0.09 ng) was incubated with aminoglycoside antibiotics or control compounds in 20 μl of a mixed buffer (MES/Tris/CAPS, 50 mm final concentration) with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at 37 °C. Two μg of [3H]mfVSG in 10 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 was added, followed by further incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by chilling the mixture on ice and vortex mixing with 500 μl of water-saturated 1-butanol (at room temperature) to extract the cleaved [3H]dimyristoylglycerol. Phases were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 1 min, 25 °C), and enzyme activity was quantified by measuring the amount of [3H]dimyristoylglycerol released into the upper butanol phase using a Beckman LS 6000TA scintillation counter. Activity of GPI-PLC obtained in the absence of test compounds was determined and assigned a value of 100%. Radioactivity from a mock digest of [3H]mfVSG (no enzyme added) was subtracted (as background) from all counts obtained. Bacterial PI-PLC (0.03 ng, 1200 units/mg) was incubated with aminoglycoside antibiotics in a mixed buffer system (MES/Tris/CAPS, 25 mm final concentration) with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate for 10 min. [3H]mfVSG (in 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) was added, and product analysis was performed as described above forT. brucei GPI-PLC. The pH of the GPI-PLC assay (mixed) buffer was varied from pH 5.5 to pH 11.0. Buffer was added from a 500 mm stock (to 50 mm final concentration) with 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 1.0%) to 9.5 units of GPI-PLC. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with or without 0.3 mm neomycin B (from a 5 mm stock in H2O), followed by substrate addition, reaction initiation and termination as described above. (Purified substrate was in 1.0% Nonidet P-40 in H2O to avoid perturbing the pH of the reaction mixture.) Varying amounts of aminoglycoside antibiotics were incubated at pH 6.5 for 10 min at 37 °C with GPI-PLC (9.5 units) or at pH 6 for PI-PLC (3.6 × 10−5 units), followed by addition of substrate and reaction completion as described above. The concentration of aminoglycoside antibiotics required to stimulate the phospholipases 2-fold (SC 200) was obtained graphically (See Fig. 2). GPI-PLC is optimally active at about pH 9 (Fig.1 A). Enzyme activity is reduced 50% at pH 7.5 and 10, and nearly abolished at pH 6.5 or 11. In the presence of 0.3 mm neomycin B, the pH-activity profile of GPI-PLC is altered. The enzyme remains completely active at pH 7.5 and 60% active at pH 6.5, and neomycin B activated T. brucei GPI-PLC 6-fold as compared with a reaction in the absence of the aminoglycoside (Fig. 1). The pH optimum for the reaction decreased from pH 9.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 1). The activity of GPI-PLC under basic conditions is not altered by neomycin B (Fig. 1 A). PI-PLC from B. thuringiensis is optimally active against a GPI at pH 7.0. Loss of activity below pH 7.0 was forestalled by addition of neomycin B (Fig. 1 B). To dissect features of aminoglycosides that influence phospholipase C activation, structurally related aminoglycosides from the neomycin group were examined (Fig.2). 2-Deoxystreptamine stimulated GPI-PLC with a SC 200 (the concentration of aminoglycoside required to activate the enzyme 2-fold) of 310 μm (Fig. 2, inset, and TableI). Neamine (2-deoxy- streptamine substituted at the 4 position with 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diaminoglucose) was 150-fold more potent, with a SC 200 of 2 μm (Table I). Ribostamycin (neamine modified by the addition of a ribose) and neomycin B (ribostamycin with an additional 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-glucose group) were no more effective than neamine (SC 200 of 2 μm for both, Fig. 2 and Table I).Table IStimulatory potency of the neomycin B group of antibiotics1-a SC 200 = aminoglycoside antibiotic concentration (μm) required to activate a phospholipase 2-fold.1-b GPI-PLC activity was assayed in 1.0% NP-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5.1-c PI-PLC was assayed in 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. Open table in a new tab 1-a SC 200 = aminoglycoside antibiotic concentration (μm) required to activate a phospholipase 2-fold. 1-b GPI-PLC activity was assayed in 1.0% NP-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. 1-c PI-PLC was assayed in 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. Non-glycosidic oligo or polyamines were tested. Putrescine (1,4-butanediamine) had no effect on GPI-PLC at 0.3 mm. However, polymyxin B, spermidine [N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,4-butanediamine], and polylysine (all at 0.3 mm), stimulated GPI-PLC 3.0-, 1.75-, and 2-fold, respectively (data not shown). We conclude from this set of observations that mere possession of amino groups is not sufficient to activate GPI-PLC. Possibly the active compounds adopt a “three-dimensional” conformation that is recognized by the enzyme. B. thuringiensis PI-PLC was also activated by 2-deoxy-streptamine (SC 200 of 490 μm, Table I). Neamine was 17.5-fold more potent, with aSC 200 of 28 μm. Ribostamycin (SC 200 of 35 μm) was as potent as neamine, and neomycin B was 2.8-fold more active than neamine (SC 200 of 10 μm, Table I). After a 10-min incubation at pH 6.5, GPI-PLC is inhibited 90% as compared with enzyme that was kept at pH 9.0 (Figs. 1 and3). In the presence of neomycin B (0.3 mm), enzyme activity is maintained even after a 15-min incubation in pH 6.5 buffer (Fig. 3). (The inhibition at the zero time point in the absence of neomycin B exists because the GPI cleavage assay is performed at pH 6.5 following the preincubation.) Neomycin B can rescue, at least partially, activity of GPI-PLC that has been pre- incubated at pH 6.5. Following a 5–15-min incubation at pH 6.5, neomycin B increased GPI-PLC activity 3–4-fold, when compared with an untreated control (Fig. 3). GPI-PLC activity is not altered by a 45-min incubation at 37 °C at pH 8.0 (data not presented). Acidic phospholipids inhibit GPI-PLC (13Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Butikofer P. Boschung M. Brodbeck U. Menon A.K. J. Biol.

Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Either (or both) of these properties could reduce the extent of GPI-PLC activation by aminoglycosides in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of aminoglycosides on GPI-PLC in the presence of acidic phospholipids. At pH 6.5, 5 mm PI had no effect on GPI-PLC, but PS (5 mm) strongly inhibited the enzyme (Fig.4 A). Neomycin B (0.3 mm) activated GPI-PLC 3-fold in the presence of PI (5 mm). As compared with the 6-fold stimulation obtained in the absence of PI, the neomycin B stimulation was reduced 50%. PS inhibition, however, was not altered by the presence of 0.3 mm neomycin B (Fig. 4 A). Since the phospholipid concentration in these studies was in excess, we checked whether full stimulation by neomycin B would occur when the aminoglycoside was present at an equimolar concentration. Additional neomycin B (5 mm) stimulated GPI-PLC to extents similar to those of the control (i.e. neomycin B with enzyme alone) (Fig.4 B). Similar results were obtained when these experiments were performed at pH 8.0, with the exception that PI now inhibited GPI-PLC as previously reported (13Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We conclude from these observations that (i) aminoglycoside activation of GPI-PLC can occur in the presence of acidic phospholipids, that (ii) PI inhibition of GPI-PLC is pH-sensitive, but that (iii) inhibition by PS in not diminished by a reduction in the pH of the reaction. Eadie-Hofstee analysis indicated that neomycin B at pH 6.5 increased the apparent turnover number (k cat) of GPI-PLC 2.6-fold (Fig. 5, TableII), from 40 min−1 to 102 min−1. At pH 9.0, k cat of the enzyme increased to 144 min−1, and neomycin B had no effect. Similarly, neomycin B did not changek cat at pH 10.5 (k cat = 117 min−1).Table IIEffect of neomycin B on kinetic properties of T. brucei GPI-PLCpHNo addition+ 0.3 mmneomycin BK mk catK mk catnmmin −1nmmin −16.575401131029.023714417115410.5445117359114 Open table in a new tab A 5.9-fold increase in the K m of GPI-PLC occurred with rising pH, from 75 nm at pH 6.5 to 445 nmat pH 10.5 (Fig. 5, Table II). In general, a slight decrease inK m was observed in the presence of neomycin B but the magnitude of the change was not dramatic. Neomycin B affected B. thuringiensis PI-PLC differently. At pH 5.1, the apparent K m andk cat were 449 nm, and 231 min−1, respectively (TableIII). Addition of neomycin B caused an 8.9-fold increase in the apparent K m to 3980 nm, while the k cat increased 10.2-fold to 2349 min−1. At pH 8.0, neomycin B again increased both the K m andk cat of PI-PLC significantly (7.7 and 5.7-fold, respectively) (Table III).Table IIIEffects of neomycin B on kinetic properties of B. thuringiensis PI-PLCpHNo addition+0.3 mmneomycin BK mk catK mk catnmmin −1nmmin −15.1449231398023498.039518230601041 Open table in a new tab The three major families of aminoglycoside antibiotics (i.e. the gentamicin (e.g. G418), kanamycin (e.g. tobramycin), and neomycin (e.g. neomycin B) groups) all contain 2-deoxy-streptamine. Existence of 4 structurally related members of the neomycin family enabled us to explore possible roles of the components of the antibiotics in activation of GPI-PLC. In the neomycin group (Table I) substitution of 2-deoxy-streptamine with 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-glucose produces neamine, which can be derivatized with ribose to form ribostamycin. Substitution of the ribosyl group in ribostamycin with 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-glucose generates neomycin B. Two PLCs in hand, one from a eukaryote T. brucei and the other from a prokaryote B. thuringiensis, one could explore the relative contributions of the chemical modifications of 2-deoxy-streptamine on activation of the phospholipases. With both T. brucei GPI-PLC and B. thuringiensisPI-PLC, 2-deoxy-streptamine was the least effective at activating the GPI cleavage reaction (Table I). For GPI-PLC, introduction of the 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-glucose group (i.e. in neamine) onto this parent compound raised activation potency 150-fold. In comparison,B. thuringiensis PI-PLC was 17-fold more active in the presence of neamine (Table I). Hence, with both enzymes 2,6-dideoxy-2,6-diamino-glucose has a tremendous activation effect when suitably placed. One can rule out the increasing positive charge of the aminglycosides as a major contributor for stimulation of the eukaryoticT. brucei GPI-PLC since (i) 1,4-diamino-butane has no effect, and (ii) neomycin B, which has 6 positive charges, is not better than neamine, which has 4 positive charges (Table I). The more graded response to the four antibiotics displayed by B. thuringiensis PI-PLC but not by T. brucei GPI-PLC might be attributable to the fact that the proteins have very little sequence similarity at the polypeptide level although they are both highly specific for GPIs. Aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. G418, neomycin, and streptomycin) are used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria and by some protozoan parasites. In prokaryotes, misreading of the genetic code due to aminoglycoside occupancy of the A-site and interaction with 16 S rRNA (1Fourmy D. Recht M.I. Blanchard S.C. Puglisi J.D. Science. 1996; 274: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Hamasaki K. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) probably contributes to effectiveness of the antibiotics. In eukaryotes, inhibition of RNA splicing (8von Ahsen U. Davies J. Schroeder R. Nature. 1991; 353: 368-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), binding to acidic phospholipids (16Van Bambeke F. Tulkens P.M. Brasseur R. Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and reduction in the fidelity of codon-anticodon interactions (17Chernoff Y.O. Vincent A. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) may contribute to the cytostatic effects of aminoglycosides. Unfortunately, these antibiotics are nephrotoxic, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are under investigation. Cellular toxicity of aminoglycosides is thought to be initiated by interaction of the compounds with negatively charged phospholipids in biological membranes (reviewed in Ref. 7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Until now, no evidence existed for binding of aminoglycosides to cellular proteins of eukaryotic origin. When purified PI-PLC fromB. cereus was stimulated by G418 (13Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the possibility of direct binding became feasible. Strangely, the initial opportunity to demonstrate this phenomenon with a eukaryote GPI-PLC was missed (13Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) because the pH of the reaction (8.0) was higher by over a unit than the pH 6.5 required to document it (Fig. 1). Neomycin B can activate GPI-PLC from T. brucei by protecting the enzyme from mild acid-induced inhibition (Fig. 3). The small amount of neomycin B (2 μm) (Table I) needed to stimulate GPI-PLC 2-fold in a reaction that contains 50 mm of buffer at pH 6.5 suggests that one is not making the reaction more prolific by simply altering the pH of the buffer. In fact, no change in the pH of the buffer was measurable after addition of the aminoglycoside. Neomycin B acts on T. brucei GPI-PLC by stimulating more rapid conversion of the enzyme-substrate complex to product, sincek cat is increased without a significant change in K m (Table II). This contrasts with the effect obtained with B. thuringiensis PI-PLC, in which case bothk cat and K m are increased significantly (Table II) (11Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Zhai H.-X. Shen T.-Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15468-15477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Aminoglycosides cause necrosis in renal proximal kidney tubule cells. The molecular basis of such nephrotoxicity is under intense investigation (reviewed in Ref. 7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells can be killed by some aminoglycosides, as happens when compounds like neomycin and hygromycin are used to select for transfected cells in molecular genetics experiments. Studies on possible downstream effects following the interaction of aminoglycosides with cellular phospholipids have not focused on membrane bound proteins. These antibiotics interact with eukaryote 18 S rRNA (17Chernoff Y.O. Vincent A. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and phospholipids (7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Direct binding to eukaryote proteins as a possible contributor to the development of cytotoxicity/nephrotoxicity during administration of these compounds has received little attention for lack of evidence. Because a eukaryotic GPI-PLC can be stimulated by several aminoglycosides (TableII), the possibility that aminoglycosides exert their effects in part by modulating the activity of cellular phospholipases merits serious consideration, chiefly because persistent activation of a cellular phospholipase C, especially under conditions when one had expected the enzyme to be inactive, could have negative consequences on cellular physiology. In cells that are known to accumulate the antibiotics to millimolar concentrations in acidic compartments (e.g. kidney cells (7Mingeot-Leclercq M.P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (18Buchanan J.H. Stevens A. Sidhu J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 141-147PubMed Google Scholar)) the situation might be even more alarming."
