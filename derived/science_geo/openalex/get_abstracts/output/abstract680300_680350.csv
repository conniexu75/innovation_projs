https://openalex.org/W3197364483,"Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W3197248033,"Abstract Gene therapy would benefit from a miniature CRISPR system that fits into the small adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome and has high cleavage activity and specificity in eukaryotic cells. One of the most compact CRISPR-associated nucleases yet discovered is the archaeal Un1Cas12f1. However, Un1Cas12f1 and its variants have very low activity in eukaryotic cells. In the present study, we redesigned the natural guide RNA of Un1Cas12f1 at five sites: the 5′ terminus of the trans -activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), the tracrRNA–crRNA complementary region, a penta(uridinylate) sequence, the 3′ terminus of the crRNA and a disordered stem 2 region in the tracrRNA. These optimizations synergistically increased the average indel frequency by 867-fold. The optimized Un1Cas12f1 system enabled efficient, specific genome editing in human cells when delivered by plasmid vectors, PCR amplicons and AAV. As Un1Cas12f1 cleaves outside the protospacer, it can be used to create large deletions efficiently. The engineered Un1Cas12f1 system showed efficiency comparable to that of SpCas9 and specificity similar to that of AsCas12a."
https://openalex.org/W3198343275,"Activation of the immune system is implicated in the Post-Acute Sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) but the mechanisms remain unknown. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) resulting in decreased activation of the AT1 receptor and decreased immune system activation. We hypothesized that autoantibodies against ACE2 may develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as anti-idiotypic antibodies to anti-spike protein antibodies.We tested plasma or serum for ACE2 antibodies in 67 patients with known SARS-CoV-2 infection and 13 with no history of infection. None of the 13 patients without history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1 of the 20 outpatients that had a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 had levels of ACE2 antibodies above the cutoff threshold. In contrast, 26/32 (81%) in the convalescent group and 14/15 (93%) of patients acutely hospitalized had detectable ACE2 antibodies. Plasma from patients with antibodies against ACE2 had less soluble ACE2 activity in plasma but similar amounts of ACE2 protein compared to patients without ACE2 antibodies. We measured the capacity of the samples to inhibit ACE2 enzyme activity. Addition of plasma from patients with ACE2 antibodies led to decreased activity of an exogenous preparation of ACE2 compared to patients that did not have antibodies.Many patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have antibodies specific for ACE2. Patients with ACE2 antibodies have lower activity of soluble ACE2 in plasma. Plasma from these patients also inhibits exogenous ACE2 activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ACE2 antibodies develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection and decrease ACE2 activity. This could lead to an increase in the abundance of Ang II, which causes a proinflammatory state that triggers symptoms of PASC."

https://openalex.org/W3198725379,"Introduction Health care workers are the most affected part of the world population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries prioritize vaccinating health workers against COVID-19 because of their susceptibility to the virus. However, the acceptability of the vaccine varies across populations. Thus, this study aimed to determine the health care worker’s intentions to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and its associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia, 2021. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers in public hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from March 15 to 28, 2021. A simple random sampling method was used to select 405 participants from each hospital. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage, were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was also performed to identify factors associated with health care worker’s intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Statistically significant variables were selected based on p-values (&lt;0.05) and the adjusted odds ratio was used to describe the strength of association with 95% confidence intervals. Result Among the respondents, 48.4% [95% CI: 38.6, 58.2] of health care workers intended to accept COVID-19. Intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination was significantly associated with physicians (AOR = 9.27, 95% CI: 1.27–27.32), professionals with a history of chronic illness (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.02–8.21), perceived degree of risk of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.26–16.98), positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 6.08, 95% CI: 3.39–10.91) and good preventive practices (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.58–5.08). Conclusion In this study, the intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was low. Professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19 infection, attitude toward COVID-19 and preventive practices were found to be factors for intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine in professionals. It is important to consider professional types, history of chronic illness, perceived degree of risk to COVID-19, attitude of professionals and preventive behaviors to improve the intention of professionals’ vaccine acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3197882551,"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought significant pressure on nurses globally as they are the frontline of care. This study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges of nurses who worked with hospitalised patients with COVID-19. In this qualitative study, a purposive sample of 14 nurses participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Colaizzi’s phenomenological method. Five key themes emerged: (1) physical and psychological distress of nurses, (2) willingness to work, (3) the essential role of support mechanisms, (4) educational and informational needs of nurses and (5) the role of modern technology in COVID-19 care. Although the provision of care led to physical and psychological distress among nurses, with their commitment and professional obligation, it is a new experience that leads to personal satisfaction. Guilty feeling related to inefficiency of care, witnessing the suffering of patients, discomfort associated with wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), work-related issues (e.g., long hour shifts), negative impact to the family and rejection by others are the leading distress factors. Religious beliefs, including keeping trust in good and bad merits, have become a strong coping mechanism. Addressing distress among nurses is essential. The reported learning needs of nurses included skills related to donning and doffing PPE, skills in performing nursing procedures and breaking bad news. Nurse managers need to pay special attention to expanding training opportunities as well as support mechanisms, for example, welfare, appreciations and counselling services for nurses. Modern technology, particularly robots and telecommunication, can perform an essential role in COVID-19 care. The establishment of timely policies and strategies to protect health workers during a national disaster like COVID-19 is needed."

https://openalex.org/W3198426699,"In humans, epidermal melanocytes are responsible for skin pigmentation, defence against ultraviolet radiation and the deadliest common skin cancer, melanoma. Although there is substantial overlap in melanocyte development pathways between different model organisms, species-dependent differences are frequent and the conservation of these processes in human skin remains unresolved. Here, we used a single-cell enrichment and RNA-sequencing pipeline to study human epidermal melanocytes directly from the skin, capturing transcriptomes across different anatomical sites, developmental age, sexes and multiple skin tones. We uncovered subpopulations of melanocytes that exhibit anatomical site-specific enrichment that occurs during gestation and persists through adulthood. The transcriptional signature of the volar-enriched subpopulation is retained in acral melanomas. Furthermore, we identified human melanocyte differentiation transcriptional programs that are distinct from gene signatures generated from model systems. Finally, we used these programs to define patterns of dedifferentiation that are predictive of melanoma prognosis and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3198589828,"While the acquisition of cellular plasticity in adult stem cells is essential for rapid regeneration after tissue injury, little is known about the underlying mechanisms governing this process. Our data reveal the coordination of airway progenitor differentiation plasticity by inflammatory signals during alveolar regeneration. Following damage, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signalling-dependent modulation of Jag1 and Jag2 expression in ciliated cells results in the inhibition of Notch signalling in secretory cells, which drives the reprogramming and acquisition of differentiation plasticity. We identify the transcription factor Fosl2 (also known as Fra2) for secretory cell fate conversion to alveolar type 2 cells that retain the distinct genetic and epigenetic signatures of secretory lineages. We also reveal that human secretory cells positive for KDR (also known as FLK-1) display a conserved capacity to generate alveolar type 2 cells via Notch inhibition. Our results demonstrate the functional role of an IL-1β-Notch-Fosl2 axis in the fate decision of secretory cells during injury repair, proposing a potential therapeutic target for human lung alveolar regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3197414589,"Regeneration requires the coordination of stem cells, their progeny and distant differentiated tissues. Here, we present a comprehensive atlas of whole-body regeneration in Schmidtea mediterranea and identify wound-induced cell states. An analysis of 299,998 single-cell transcriptomes captured from regeneration-competent and regeneration-incompetent fragments identified transient regeneration-activated cell states (TRACS) in the muscle, epidermis and intestine. TRACS were independent of stem cell division with distinct spatiotemporal distributions, and RNAi depletion of TRACS-enriched genes produced regeneration defects. Muscle expression of notum, follistatin, evi/wls, glypican-1 and junctophilin-1 was required for tissue polarity. Epidermal expression of agat-1/2/3, cyp3142a1, zfhx3 and atp1a1 was important for stem cell proliferation. Finally, expression of spectrinβ and atp12a in intestinal basal cells, and lrrk2, cathepsinB, myosin1e, polybromo-1 and talin-1 in intestinal enterocytes regulated stem cell proliferation and tissue remodelling, respectively. Our results identify cell types and molecules that are important for regeneration, indicating that regenerative ability can emerge from coordinated transcriptional plasticity across all three germ layers."
https://openalex.org/W3196836994,"Background Research on COVID-19 during pregnancy has mainly focused on women hospitalized for COVID-19 or other reasons during their pregnancy. Little is known about COVID-19 in the general population of pregnant women. Objective To describe the prevalence of COVID-19, symptoms, consequent healthcare use, and possible sources of COVID-19 exposure among a population-based sample of pregnant women residing in Northern California. Methods We analyzed data from 19,458 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between January 2020 and April 2021 and responded to an online survey about COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, symptoms, and their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy was defined separately by self-report and by documentation in electronic health records (EHR). We examined relationships of COVID-19 with sociodemographic factors, underlying comorbidities, and survey measures of COVID-19-like symptoms, consequent healthcare utilization, and possible COVID-19 exposures. Results Among 19,458 respondents, the crude prevalence of COVID-19 was 2.5% (n = 494) according to self-report and 1.4% (n = 276) according to EHR. After adjustment, the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women aged &lt;25 years compared with women aged ≥35 years (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.75, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.49) and among Hispanic women compared with White women (PR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.53, 2.37). Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women affected by personal or partner job loss during the pandemic (PR, 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and among women living in areas of high vs. low neighborhood deprivation (PR, 1.74, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.27). We did not observe differences in self-reported COVID-19 between women with and without underlying comorbidities. Results were similar for EHR-documented COVID-19. Loss of smell or taste was a unique and common symptom reported among women with COVID-19 (42.3% in self-reported; 54.0% in EHR-documented). Among women with symptomatic COVID-19, approximately 2% were hospitalized, 71% had a telehealth visit, and 75% quarantined at home. Over a third of women with COVID-19 reported no known exposure to someone with COVID-19. Conclusions Observed COVID-19 prevalence differences by sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors underscore social and health inequities among reproductive-aged women. Women with COVID-19 reported unique symptoms and low frequency of hospitalization. Many were not aware of an exposure to someone with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3197235328,"Higher-order projections to sensory cortical areas converge on layer 1 (L1), the primary site for integration of top-down information via the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and L1 GABAergic interneurons. Here we investigated the contribution of early thalamic inputs onto L1 interneurons for establishment of top-down connectivity in the primary visual cortex. We find that bottom-up thalamic inputs predominate during L1 development and preferentially target neurogliaform cells. We show that these projections are critical for the subsequent strengthening of top-down inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex onto L1 neurogliaform cells. Sensory deprivation or selective removal of thalamic afferents blocked this phenomenon. Although early activation of the anterior cingulate cortex resulted in premature strengthening of these top-down afferents, this was dependent on thalamic inputs. Our results demonstrate that proper establishment of top-down connectivity in the visual cortex depends critically on bottom-up inputs from the thalamus during postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W3198504265,"The contribution of circulatory tau and β-amyloid in Parkinson's disease (PD), especially the cognitive function, remains inconclusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) cargo these proteins throughout the bloodstream after they are directly secreted from many cells, including neurons. The present study aims to investigate the role of the plasma EV-borne tau and β-amyloid as biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction in PD by investigating subjects with mild to moderate stage of PD (n = 116) and non-PD controls (n = 46). Plasma EVs were isolated, and immunomagnetic reduction-based immunoassay was used to assess the levels of α-synuclein, tau, and β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) within the EVs. Artificial neural network (ANN) models were then applied to predict cognitive dysfunction. We observed no significant difference in plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 between PD patients and controls. Plasma EV tau was significantly associated with cognitive function. Moreover, plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 were significantly elevated in PD patients with cognitive impairment when compared to PD patients with optimal cognition. The ANN model used the plasma EV α-synuclein, tau, and Aβ1-42, as well as the patient's age and gender, as predicting factors. The model achieved an accuracy of 91.3% in identifying cognitive dysfunction in PD patients, and plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 are the most valuable factors. In conclusion, plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 are significant markers of cognitive function in PD patients. Combining with the plasma EV α-synuclein, age, and sex, plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 can identify cognitive dysfunction in PD patients. This study corroborates the prognostic roles of plasma EV tau and Aβ1-42 in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3198092865,"Graspetides, also known as ω-ester-containing peptides (OEPs), are a family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) bearing side chain-to-side chain macrolactone or macrolactam linkages. Here, we present the molecular details of precursor peptide recognition by the macrocyclase enzyme PsnB in the biosynthesis of plesiocin, a group 2 graspetide. Biochemical analysis revealed that, in contrast to other RiPPs, the core region of the plesiocin precursor peptide noticeably enhanced the enzyme-precursor interaction via the conserved glutamate residues. We obtained four crystal structures of symmetric or asymmetric PsnB dimers, including those with a bound core peptide and a nucleotide, and suggest that the highly conserved Arg213 at the enzyme active site specifically recognizes a ring-forming acidic residue before phosphorylation. Collectively, this study provides insights into the mechanism underlying substrate recognition in graspetide biosynthesis and lays a foundation for engineering new variants."
https://openalex.org/W3196787701,"Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with comorbid conditions including diabetes, chronic lung, inflammatory and vascular disease, are at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with increased susceptibility and severity for COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether these associations are genetically determined or not. We used a Phenome-Wide Association (PheWAS) approach to investigate the role of genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility on disease related outcomes. PheWAS analyses were performed in order to identify traits and diseases related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, evaluated through a predictive COVID-19 risk score. We utilised phenotypic data in up to 400,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, including Hospital Episode Statistics and General Practice data. We identified a spectrum of associations between both genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with a number of traits. COVID-19 risk was associated with increased risk for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (OR = 1.11, p = 5.36e-08). We also identified significant signals between COVID-19 susceptibility with blood clots in the leg (OR = 1.1, p = 1.66e-16) and with increased risk for blood clots in the lung (OR = 1.12, p = 1.45 e-10). Our study identifies significant association of genetically determined COVID-19 with increased blood clot events in leg and lungs. The reported associations between both COVID-19 susceptibility and severity and other diseases adds to the identification and stratification of individuals at increased risk, adverse outcomes and long-term effects."
https://openalex.org/W3196303893,"Objectives High-speed tooth preparation requires effective cooling to avoid thermal damage, which generates spray mist, which is a mixture of an aerosol, droplets and particles of different sizes. The aim of this experimental study was to analyze the efficacy of spray mist reduction with an intraoral high-volume evacuation system (HVE) during simulated high-speed tooth preparation for suboptimal versus optimal suction positions of 16 mm sized cannulas and different flow rates of the HVE. Material and methods In a manikin head, the upper first premolar was prepared with a dental turbine, and generated particles of 5–50 microns were analyzed fifty millimeters above the mouth opening with the shadow imaging technique (frame: 6.6×5.3×1.1 mm). This setup was chosen to generate a reproducible spray mist in a vertical direction towards an imaginary operator head (worst case scenario). The flow rate (FR) of the HVE was categorized into five levels (≤120 l/min up to 330 l/min). The number of particles per second (NP; p/s) was counted, and the mass volume flow of particles per second (MVF; μg/s*cm 3 ) was calculated for 10 sec. Statistical tests were nonparametric and two-sided (p≤0.05). Results With increasing flow rate, the NP/MVF values decreased significantly (eta: 0.671/0.678; p≤0.001). Using a suboptimally positioned cannula with an FR≤160 l/min, significantly higher NP values (mean±SD) of 731.67±54.24 p/s (p≤0.019) and an MVF of 3.72±0.42 μg/s*cm 3 (p≤0.010) were measured compared to those of the optimal cannula position and FR≥300 l/min (NP/MVF: 0/0). No significant difference in NP and MVF was measurable between FR≥250 l/min and FR&gt;300 l/min (p = 0.652, p = 0.664). Conclusion Within the limitations of the current experimental study, intraoral high-flow rate suction with ≥300 l/min with an HVE effectively reduced 5–50 μm sized particles of the spray mist induced by high-speed tooth preparation with a dental turbine."
https://openalex.org/W3196955165,"Coix lacryma-jobi L. is a very important economic crop widely cultivated in Southeast Asia. Drought affects more than four million square kilometers every year, and is a significant factor limiting agricultural productivity. However, relatively little is known about how Coix lacryma-jobi L. responds to drought treatments. To obtain a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating the transcriptional responses of Coix lacryma-jobi L. to drought treatment, we employed high throughput short-read sequencing of cDNA prepared from polyadenylated RNA to explore global gene expression after a seven-day drought treatment. We generated a de novo assembled transcriptome comprising 65,480 unique sequences. Differential expression analysis based on RSEM-estimated transcript abundances identified 5,315 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when comparing samples from plants following drought-treatment and from the appropriate controls. Among these, the transcripts for 3,460 genes were increased in abundance, whereas 1,855 were decreased. Real-time quantitative PCR for 5 transcripts confirmed the changes identified by RNA-Seq. The results provide a transcriptional overview of the changes in Coix lacryma-jobi L. in response to drought, and will be very useful for studying the function of associated genes and selection of molecular marker of Coix lacryma-jobi L in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3197545994,"Social role disruption is a state involving upheaval of social identities, routines and responsibilities. Such disruption is presently occurring at a global scale due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which poses a threat not only to health and security but also to the social roles that underlie people’s daily lives. Our collective response to combat the virus entails, for example, parents homeschooling children, friends socializing online, and employees working from home. While these collective efforts serve the greater good, people’s social roles now lack continuity from what was authentic to the roles before the pandemic began. This, we argue, takes a psychological toll. Individuals feel inauthentic , or alienated and out-of-touch from their “true” selves, to the extent their social roles undergo change. As evidence, we report survey (Studies 1 &amp; 4) and experimental (Studies 2 &amp; 3) evidence that COVID-19-related role changes indeed increase inauthenticity. This effect occurs independent of (a) how positively/negatively people feel about COVID-19 (Study 2) and (b) how positively/negatively people feel about the role change itself (Studies 3 &amp; 4). Moreover, we identify two moderators of this effect. First, this effect occurs when (and ostensibly because) the social roles undergoing change are central to an individual’s sense of self (Study 2). Second, this effect depends on an individual’s temporal perspective. People can safeguard their self-authenticity in the face of changing social roles if they stay focused on the here-and-now (the present and immediate future), rather than focusing on the past (pre-COVID-19) or future (post-COVID-19) (Studies 3 &amp; 4). This advantage for present-focused coping is observed in both the U.S.A. (Study 3) and Hong Kong (Study 4). We suggest that the reason people feel more authentically themselves when they maintain a present focus is because doing so makes the discontinuity of their social roles less salient."
https://openalex.org/W3197027706,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have been linked to food-borne disease outbreaks. As PCR is routinely used to screen foods for STEC, it is important that factors leading to inconsistent detection of STEC by PCR are understood. This study used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate causes of inconsistent PCR detection of stx 1 , stx 2 , and serogroup-specific genes. Fifty strains isolated from Alberta feedlot cattle from three different studies were selected with inconsistent or consistent detection of stx and serogroup by PCR. All isolates were initially classified as STEC by PCR. Sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq® with sample library by Nextera XT. Virtual PCRs were performed using Geneious and bacteriophage content was determined using PHASTER. Sequencing coverage ranged from 47 to 102x, averaging 74x, with sequences deposited in the NCBI database. Eleven strains were confirmed by WGS as STEC having complete stxA and stxB subunits. However, truncated stx fragments occurred in twenty-two other isolates, some having multiple stx fragments in the genome. Isolates with complete stx by WGS had consistent stx 1 and stx 2 detection by PCR, although one also having a stx 2 fragment had inconsistent stx 2 PCR. For all STEC and 18/39 non-STEC, serogroups determined by PCR agreed with those determined by WGS. An additional three WGS serotypes were inconclusive and two isolates were Citrobacter spp. Results demonstrate that stx fragments associated with stx -carrying bacteriophages in the E . coli genome may contribute to inconsistent detection of stx 1 and stx 2 by PCR. Fourteen isolates had integrated stx bacteriophage but lacked complete or fragmentary stx possibly due to partial bacteriophage excision after sub-cultivation or other unclear mechanisms. The majority of STEC isolates (7/11) did not have identifiable bacteriophage DNA in the contig(s) where stx was located, likely increasing the stability of stx in the bacterial genome and its detection by PCR."
https://openalex.org/W3197286506,"Shallot is a national strategic commodity in Indonesia, but it is development has a fundamental technical, socioeconomic, and policy support problems. Therefore, it is essential to know the competitiveness of shallot in Indonesia and the incentive policy to implement the comparative advantage to become a sustainable competitive advantage. The purposes of this study are to (1) analyze the profitability of shallot farming privately and socially, (2) analyze the competitiveness of shallot farming from a competitive and comparative advantage perspective, (3) review the impact of government policy on shallot farming, and (4) formulate incentive policies in the development of shallot commodities. The empirical results of the Policy Analysis Matrix revealed that shallot farming in production centers in Indonesia has both competitive and comparative advantages. The highest competitive and comparative advantages were found in the dry season in the upland of Malang district with the coefficient values of PCR (Private Cost Ratio) of 0.268-0.508 and DRCR (Domestic Resource Cost Ratio) of 0.208-0.323. The lowest competitive advantage was found in the lowland of East Lombok district in the dry season with a coefficient value of PCR 0.728-0.844. The lowest comparative advantage in the dry season was found in East Lombok district with a DRCR of 0.448, while in the rainy season, it was found in Wonosobo district with a DRCR of 0.522. These results mean that it is more profitable for Indonesia to increase domestic shallot production than to import. Improving shallot competitiveness can be carried out by implementing advanced technology, agricultural infrastructure, capacity building of farmers' resources, and government incentive policies to increase productivity and competitiveness sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3196532916,"Increased blue light exposure has become a matter of concern as it has a range of detrimental effects, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Mitochondria absorb short wavelength light but have a specific absorbance at 420nm at the lower end of the human visual range. This 420nm absorption is probably due to the presence of porphyrin. We examine the impact of 420nm exposure on drosophila melanogaster mitochondria and its impact on fly mobility. Daily 15 mins exposures for a week significantly reduced mitochondrial complex activities and increased mitochondrial inner membrane permeability, which is a key metric of mitochondrial health. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were not significantly reduced and mobility was unchanged. There are multiple options for energy/time exposure combinations, but we then applied single 420nm exposure of 3h to increase the probability of an effect on ATP and mobility, and both were significantly reduced. ATP and mitochondrial membrane permeability recovered and over corrected at 72h post exposure. However, despite this, normal mobility did not return. Hence, the effect of short wavelengths on mitochondrial function is to reduce complex activity and increasing membrane permeability, but light exposure to reduce ATP and to translate into reduced mobility needs to be sustained."
https://openalex.org/W3197539218,"In this study, the feasibility of classifying soybean frogeye leaf spot (FLS) is investigated. Leaf images and hyperspectral reflectance data of healthy and FLS diseased soybean leaves were acquired. First, image processing was used to classify FLS to create a reference for subsequent analysis of hyperspectral data. Then, dimensionality reduction methods of hyperspectral data were used to obtain the relevant information pertaining to FLS. Three single methods, namely spectral index (SI), principal component analysis (PCA), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), along with a PCA and SI combined method, were included. PCA was used to select the effective principal components (PCs), and evaluate SIs. Characteristic wavelengths (CWs) were selected using CARS. Finally, the full wavelengths, CWs, effective PCs, SIs, and significant SIs were divided into 14 datasets (DS1-DS14) and used as inputs to build the classification models. Models' performances were evaluated based on the classification accuracy for both the overall and individual classes. Our results suggest that the FLS comprised of five classes based on the proportion of total leaf surface covered with FLS. In the PCA and SI combination model, 5 PCs and 20 SIs with higher weight coefficient of each PC were extracted. For hyperspectral data, 20 CWs and 26 effective PCs were also selected. Out of the 14 datasets, the model input variables provided by five datasets (DS2, DS3, DS4, DS10, and DS11) were more superior than those of full wavelengths (DS1) both in support vector machine (SVM) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. The models developed using these five datasets achieved overall accuracies ranging from 91.8% to 94.5% in SVM, and 94.5% to 97.3% in LS-SVM. In addition, they improved the classification accuracies by 0.9% to 3.6% (SVM) and 0.9% to 3.7% (LS-SVM)."
https://openalex.org/W3198075308,"Background Although fingerstick is often favorably compared to venipuncture as a less invasive method of drawing blood for clinical labs, there is little empirical research that compares physical and psychological stress responses to fingerstick vs. venipuncture (blood draw using a needle in the arm) within the same person. Methods and findings We assessed changes in cortisol (a stress hormone), heart rate variability (a marker of autonomic stress), and psychological stress in 40 healthy women who completed both venipuncture and fingerstick. Contrary to our predictions, there was a significant decline in cortisol across conditions, with greater decline from pre- to post-draw in response to venipuncture than fingerstick. There were similar patterns of rise and fall in heart rate variability in both types of blood draw, suggestive of mild vasovagal responses. Psychological measures of stress (such as negative emotion and perceived stress) were generally stronger predictors of participant’s reported pain and blood draw preferences than physical stress measures. Conclusions These findings challenge the characterization of fingerstick as necessarily “less invasive” than venipuncture, as participant’s stress responses to fingerstick were equivalent to (and for some measures greater than) their response to venipuncture. Heart rate variability response to fingerstick significantly predicted that individual’s vasovagal-like responses to venipuncture, suggesting that measuring heart rate variability during pre-donation hemoglobin testing may identify donors at risk for adverse events during venipuncture."
https://openalex.org/W3196770905,"The crustacean molting process is regulated by an interplay of hormones produced by the eyestalk ganglia and Y-organs (YO). Molt-inhibiting hormone and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone released by the sinus gland of the eyestalk ganglia (EG) inhibit the synthesis and secretion of ecdysteroid by the YO, hence regulating hemolymph levels during the molt cycle. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ecdysteroidogenesis pathway, specifically genes linked to changes in ecdysteroid levels occurring at early premolt (ePM). To this end, a reference transcriptome based on YO, EG, and hepatopancreas was de novo assembled. Two genes (cholesterol 7-desaturase Neverland and cytochrome p450 307a1-like Spook) involved in ecdysteroidogenesis were identified from the YO transcriptome using sequence comparisons and transcript abundance. Two other candidates, Hormone receptor 4 and probable cytochrome p450 49a1 potentially involved in ecdysteroidogenesis were also identified. Since cholesterol is the ecdysteroid precursor, a putative cholesterol carrier (Apolipoprotein D-like) was also examined to understand if cholesterol uptake coincided with the increase in the ecdysteroid levels at the ePM stage. The expression level changes of the five candidate genes in the YO were compared between intermolt (IM) and induced ePM (iePM) stages using transcriptomic analysis. Expression analysis using qPCR were carried out at IM, iePM, and normal ePM. The increase in Spook and Neverland expression in the YO at the ePM was accompanied by a concomitant rise in ecdysteroid levels. The data obtained from iePM stage were congruent with those obtained from the normal ePM stage of intact control animals. The present findings support the role of Halloween genes in the ecdysteroidogenesis and molt cycle in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus."
https://openalex.org/W3197031046,"Dimethyladenosine transferase 1 (DIMT1) is an evolutionarily conserved RNA N6,6-dimethyladenosine (m26,6A) methyltransferase. DIMT1 plays an important role in ribosome biogenesis, and the catalytic activity of DIMT1 is indispensable for cell viability and protein synthesis. A few RNA-modifying enzymes can install the same modification in multiple RNA species. However, whether DIMT1 can work on RNA species other than 18S rRNA is unclear. Here, we describe that DIMT1 generates m26,6A not only in 18S rRNA but also in small RNAs. In addition, m26,6A in small RNAs were significantly decreased in cells expressing catalytically inactive DIMT1 variants (E85A or NLPY variants) compared with cells expressing wildtype DIMT1. Both E85A and NLPY DIMT1 variant cells present decreased protein synthesis and cell viability. Furthermore, we observed that DIMT1 is highly expressed in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. Our data suggest that downregulation of DIMT1 in acute myeloid leukemia cells leads to a decreased m26,6A level in small RNAs. Together, these data suggest that DIMT1 not only installs m26,6A in 18S rRNA but also generates m26,6A-containing small RNAs, both of which potentially contribute to the impact of DIMT1 on cell viability and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3197579256,"Nitroreductases are emerging as attractive bioremediation enzymes, with substrate promiscuity toward both natural and synthetic compounds. Recently, the nitroreductase NfnB from Sphingopyxis sp. strain HMH exhibited metabolic activity for dinitroaniline herbicides including butralin and pendimethalin, triggering the initial steps of their degradation and detoxification. However, the determinants of the specificity of NfnB for these herbicides are unknown. In this study, we performed structural and biochemical analyses of NfnB to decipher its substrate specificity. The homodimer NfnB is a member of the PnbA subgroup of the nitroreductase family. Each monomer displays a central α + β fold for the core domain, with a protruding middle region and an extended C-terminal region. The protruding middle region of Val75-Tyr129 represents a structural extension that is a common feature to members of the PnbA subgroup and functions as an opening wall connecting the coenzyme FMN-binding site to the surface, therefore serving as a substrate binding site. We performed mutational, kinetic, and structural analyses of mutant enzymes and found that Tyr88 in the middle region plays a pivotal role in substrate specificity by determining the dimensions of the wall opening. The mutation of Tyr88 to phenylalanine or alanine caused significant changes in substrate selectivity toward bulkier dinitroaniline herbicides such as oryzalin and isopropalin without compromising its activity. These results provide a framework to modify the substrate specificity of nitroreductase in the PnbA subgroup, which has been a challenging issue for its biotechnological and bioremediation applications."
https://openalex.org/W3198495821,"Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dementia, psychiatric problems, and chorea, is known to be caused by CAG repeat expansions in the HD gene HTT. However, the mechanism of this pathology is not fully understood. The translesion DNA polymerase θ (Polθ) carries a large insertion sequence in its catalytic domain, which has been shown to allow DNA loop-outs in the primer strand. As a result of high levels of oxidative DNA damage in neural cells and Polθ's subsequent involvement in base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that Polθ contributes to CAG repeat expansion while repairing oxidative damage within HTT. Here, we performed Polθ-catalyzed in vitro DNA synthesis using various CAG•CTG repeat DNA substrates that are similar to base excision repair intermediates. We show that Polθ efficiently extends (CAG)n•(CTG)n hairpin primers, resulting in hairpin retention and repeat expansion. Polθ also triggers repeat expansions to pass the threshold for HD when the DNA template contains 35 repeats upward. Strikingly, Polθ depleted of the catalytic insertion fails to induce repeat expansions regardless of primers and templates used, indicating that the insertion sequence is responsible for Polθ's error-causing activity. In addition, the level of chromatin-bound Polθ in HD cells is significantly higher than in non-HD cells and exactly correlates with the degree of CAG repeat expansion, implying Polθ's involvement in triplet repeat instability. Therefore, we have identified Polθ as a potent factor that promotes CAG•CTG repeat expansions in HD and other neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3198587568,"Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury often results in sepsis and organ failure and is of major importance in the clinic. A potential strategy to reduce I/R-injury is the application of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) during which repeated, brief episodes of I/R are applied. The aim of this study was to evaluate physiological and cellular effects of intestinal I/R-injury and to compare the influence of in-vivo IPC (iIPC) with ex-vivo IPC (eIPC), in which blood derived factors and nerval regulations are excluded.Using an established perfused rat intestine model, effects of iIPC and eIPC on physiological as well as cellular mechanisms of I/R-injury (60 min hypoxia, 30 min reperfusion) were investigated. iIPC was applied by three reversible occlusions of the mesenteric artery in-vivo for 5 min followed by 5 min of reperfusion before isolating the small intestine, eIPC was induced by stopping the vascular perfusion ex-vivo 3 times for 5 min followed by 5 min of reperfusion after isolation of the intestine. Study groups (each N = 8-9 animals) were: iIPC, eIPC, I/R (iIPC group), I/R (eIPC group), iIPC+I/R, eIPC+I/R, no intervention/control (iIPC group), no intervention/control (eIPC group). Tissue morphology/damage, metabolic functions, fluid shifts and barrier permeability were evaluated. Cellular mechanisms were investigated using signaling arrays.I/R-injury decreased intestinal galactose uptake (iIPC group: p<0.001), increased vascular perfusion pressure (iIPC group: p<0.001; eIPC group: p<0.01) and attenuated venous flow (iIPC group: p<0.05) while lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (iIPC group, eIPC group: p<0.001), luminal flow (iIPC group: p<0.001; eIPC group: p<0.05), goblet cell ratio (iIPC group, eIPC group: p<0.001) and apoptosis (iIPC group, eIPC group: p<0.05) were all increased. Application of iIPC prior to I/R increased vascular galactose uptake (P<0.05) while eIPC had no significant impact on parameters of I/R-injury. On cellular level, I/R-injury resulted in a reduction of the phosphorylation of several MAPK signaling molecules. Application of iIPC prior to I/R increased phosphorylation of JNK2 and p38δ while eIPC enhanced CREB and GSK-3α/β phosphorylation.Intestinal I/R-injury is associated with major physiological and cellular changes. However, the overall influence of the two different IPC strategies on the acute phase of intestinal I/R-injury is rather limited."
https://openalex.org/W3198733593,"Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A) hydrolyzes glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position resulting in the release of fatty acids and lysophospholipids. C57BL/6 mice do not express Pla2g2a due to a frameshift mutation (wild-type [WT] mice). We previously reported that transgenic expression of human PLA2G2A in C57BL/6 mice (IIA+ mice) protects against weight gain and insulin resistance, in part by increasing total energy expenditure. Additionally, we found that brown and white adipocytes from IIA+ mice have increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling markers, such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator, and PR domain containing 16, suggesting that the energy expenditure phenotype might be due to an increased thermogenic capacity in adipose tissue. Here, we further characterize the impact of PLA2G2A on thermogenic mechanisms in adipose tissue. Metabolic analysis of WT and IIA+ mice revealed that even when housed within their thermoneutral zone, IIA+ mice have elevated energy expenditure compared to WT littermates. Increased energy expenditure in IIA+ mice is associated with increased citrate synthase activity in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increased mitochondrial respiration in both brown and white adipocytes. We also observed that direct addition of recombinant PLA2G2A enzyme to in vitro cultured adipocytes results in the marked induction of UCP1 protein expression. Finally, we report that PLA2G2A induces the expression of numerous transcripts related to energy substrate transport and metabolism in BAT, suggestive of an increase in substrate flux to fuel BAT activity. These data demonstrate that PLA2G2A enhances adipose tissue thermogenesis, in part, through elevated substrate delivery and increased mitochondrial content in BAT."
https://openalex.org/W3197354516,"Cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2 (CELSR2), a mammalian orthologue of drosophila flamingo, belongs to the cadherin subfamily. CELSR2 mainly function in neural development and cilium polarity. Recent studies showed that the CELSR2 gene is related to many human diseases, including coronary artery disease, idiopathic scoliosis, and cancer. Genome-Wide Association Studies data showed that SNP in the CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 gene loci has a strong association with circulating lipid levels and coronary artery disease. However, the function and underlying mechanism of CELSR2 in hepatic lipid metabolism remain unknown. Here, we found that CELSR2 expression is decreased in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients and db/db mice. Depletion of CELSR2 significantly decreased the lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by suppressing the expression of lipid synthesis enzymes. Moreover, CELSR2 deficiency impaired the physiological unfolded protein response (UPR), which damages the ER homeostasis, and elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by decreasing the antioxidant expression. Scavenging of ROS by N-acetylcysteine treatment could restore the decreased lipid accumulation of CELSR2 knockdown cells. Furthermore, CELSR2 loss impaired cell survival by suppressing cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Our results uncovered a new role of CELSR2 in regulating lipid homeostasis and UPR, suggesting CELSR2 may be a new therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W3198109759,"A new method for hemoglobin (Hb) deoxygenation, in suspension or within red blood cells (RBCs) is described using the commercial enzyme product, EC-Oxyrase®. The enzymatic deoxygenation method has several advantages over established deoxygenation methodologies, such as avoiding side reactions that produce methemoglobin (metHb), thus eliminating the need for an inert deoxygenation gas and airtight vessel, and facilitates easy re-oxygenation of Hb/RBCs by washing with a buffer that contains dissolved oxygen (DO). The UV-visible spectra of deoxyHb and metHb purified from human RBCs using three different preparation methods (sodium dithionite [to produce deoxyHb], sodium nitrite [to produce metHb], and EC-Oxyrase® [to produce deoxyHb]) show the high purity of deoxyHb prepared using EC-Oxyrase® (with little to no metHb or hemichrome production from side reactions). The oxyHb deoxygenation time course of EC-Oxyrase® follows first order reaction kinetics. The paramagnetic characteristics of intracellular Hb in RBCs were compared using Cell Tracking Velocimetry (CTV) for healthy and sickle cell disease (SCD) donors and oxygen equilibrium curves show that the function of healthy RBCs is unchanged after EC-Oxyrase® treatment. The results confirm that this enzymatic approach to deoxygenation produces pure deoxyHb, can be re-oxygenated easily, prepared aerobically and has similar paramagnetic mobility to existing methods of producing deoxyHb and metHb."
https://openalex.org/W3198563638,"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) are widely considered an offshore and oceanic species, but certain populations also use coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas. Based upon fifteen years of study, we report that Canadian Pacific fin whales (B. p. velifera) have returned to the Kitimat Fjord System (KFS) in the Great Bear Rainforest, and have established a seasonally resident population in its intracoastal waters. This is the only fjord system along this coast or elsewhere in which fin whales are known to occur regularly with strong site fidelity. The KFS was also the only Canadian Pacific fjord system in which fin whales were commonly found and killed during commercial whaling, pointing to its long-term importance. Traditional knowledge, whaling records, and citizen science databases suggest that fin whales were extirpated from this area prior to their return in 2005-2006. Visual surveys and mark-recapture analysis documented their repopulation of the area, with 100-120 whales using the fjord system in recent years, as well as the establishment of a seasonally resident population with annual return rates higher than 70%. Line transect surveys identified the central and outer channels of the KFS as the primary fin whale habitat, with the greatest densities occurring in Squally Channel and Caamaño Sound. Fin whales were observed in the KFS in most months of the year. Vessel- and shore-based surveys (27,311 km and 6,572 hours of effort, respectively) indicated regular fin whale presence (2,542 detections), including mother-calf pairs, from June to October and peak abundance in late August-early September. Seasonal patterns were variable year-to-year, and several lines of evidence indicated that fin whales arrived and departed from the KFS repeatedly throughout the summer and fall. Additionally, we report on the population's social network and morphometrics. These findings offer insights into the dynamics of population recovery in an area where several marine shipping projects are proposed. The fin whales of the Great Bear Rainforest represent a rare exception to general patterns in this species' natural history, and we highlight the importance of their conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3196908390,"To improve early detection of emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many of them zoonotic, numerous electronic animal disease-reporting systems have been piloted but not implemented because of cost, lack of user friendliness, and data insecurity. In Kenya, we developed and rolled out an open-source mobile phone-based domestic and wild animal disease reporting system and collected data over two years to investigate its robustness and ability to track disease trends.The Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS) application was built on the Java® platform, freely downloadable for android compatible mobile phones, and supported by web-based account management, form editing and data monitoring. The application was integrated into the surveillance systems of Kenya's domestic and wild animal sectors by adopting their existing data collection tools, and targeting disease syndromes prioritized by national, regional and international animal and human health agencies. Smartphone-owning government and private domestic and wild animal health officers were recruited and trained on the application, and reports received and analyzed by Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services. The KABS application performed automatic basic analyses (frequencies, spatial distribution), which were immediately relayed to reporting officers as feedback.Of 697 trained domestic animal officers, 662 (95%) downloaded the application, and >72% of them started reporting using the application within three months. Introduction of the application resulted in 2- to 14-fold increase in number of disease reports when compared to the previous year (relative risk = 14, CI 13.8-14.2, p<0.001), and reports were more widely distributed. Among domestic animals, food animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and chicken) accounted for >90% of the reports, with respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin diseases constituting >85% of the reports. Herbivore wildlife (zebra, buffalo, elephant, giraffe, antelopes) accounted for >60% of the wildlife disease reports, followed by carnivores (lions, cheetah, hyenas, jackals, and wild dogs). Deaths, traumatic injuries, and skin diseases were most reported in wildlife.This open-source system was user friendly and secure, ideal for rolling out in other countries in SSA to improve disease reporting and enhance preparedness for epidemics of zoonotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3197242292,"Road ecology has traditionally focused on the impact of in-situ and functional roads on wildlife. However, road construction also poses a major, yet understudied, threat and the implications for key aspects of animal behaviour are unknown. Badgers (Meles meles) have been implicated in the transmission of tuberculosis to cattle. There are concerns that environmental disturbances, including major road construction, can disrupt badger territoriality, promoting the spread of the disease to cattle. To address these knowledge gaps the ranging behaviour of a medium-density Irish badger population was monitored using GPS-tracking collars before, during, and after a major road realignment project that bisected the study area. We estimated badgers' home range sizes, nightly distances travelled, and the distance and frequency of extra-territorial excursions during each phase of the study and quantified any changes to these parameters. We show that road construction had a very limited effect on ranging behaviour. A small increase in nightly distance during road construction did not translate into an increase in home range size, nor an increase in the distance or frequency of extra-territorial excursions during road construction. In addition, suitable mitigation measures to prevent badger deaths appeared to ensure that normal patterns of ranging behaviour continued once the new road was in place. We recommend that continuous badger-proof fencing be placed along the entire length of new major roads, in combination with appropriately sited underpasses. Our analysis supports the view that road construction did not cause badgers to change their ranging behaviour in ways likely to increase the spread of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3197451281,"The impact of cardiovascular and neurologic complications on infective endocarditis (IE) are well studied, yet the prevalence and significance of pulmonary complications in IE is not defined. To better characterize the multifaceted nature of IE management, we aimed to describe the occurrence and significance of pulmonary complications in IE, including among persons with IE related to drug use.Hospitalizations of adult (≥18 years old) patients diagnosed with IE were identified in the 2016 National Inpatient Sample using ICD-10 codes. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to compare IE patient outcomes between those with and without pulmonary complications and to identify predictors of pulmonary complications. Interaction terms were used to assess the impact of drug-use IE (DU-IE) and pulmonary complications on inpatient outcomes.In 2016, there were an estimated 88,995 hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with IE. Of these hospitalizations,15,490 (17%) were drug-use related. Drug-use IE (DU-IE) had the highest odds of pulmonary complications (OR 2.97, 95% CI 2.50, 3.45). At least one pulmonary complication was identified in 6,580 (7%) of IE patients. DU-IE hospitalizations were more likely to have a diagnosis of pyothorax (3% vs. 1%, p<0.001), lung abscess (3% vs. <1%, p<0.001), and septic pulmonary embolism (27% vs. 2%, p<0.001). Pulmonary complications were associated with longer average lengths of stay (CIE 7.22 days 95% CI 6.11, 8.32), higher hospital charges (CIE 78.51 thousand dollars 95% CI 57.44, 99.57), more frequent post-discharge transfers (acute care: OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.09, 1.71; long-term care: OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.83, 2.61), and increased odds of inpatient mortality (OR 1.81 95% CI 1.39, 2.35).IE with pulmonary complications is associated with worse outcomes. Patients with DU-IE have a particularly high prevalence of pulmonary complications that may require timely thoracic surgical intervention, likely owing to right-sided valve involvement. More research is needed to determine optimal management strategies for complications to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3198382748,"Neuronal activity can enhance tau release and thus accelerate tauopathies. This activity-dependent tau release can be used to study the progression of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as hyperphosphorylated tau is implicated in AD pathogenesis and related tauopathies. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate activity-dependent tau release from neurons and the role that tau phosphorylation plays in modulating activity-dependent tau release is still rudimentary. In this study, Drosophila neurons in primary culture expressing human tau (hTau) were used to study activity-dependent tau release. We found that hTau release was markedly increased by 50 mM KCl treatment for 1 h. A similar level of release was observed using optogenetic techniques, where genetically targeted neurons were stimulated for 30 min using blue light (470 nm). Our results showed that activity-dependent release of phosphoresistant hTauS11A was reduced when compared with wildtype hTau. In contrast, release of phosphomimetic hTauE14 was increased upon activation. We found that released hTau was phosphorylated in its proline-rich and C-terminal domains using phosphorylation site-specific tau antibodies (e.g., AT8). Fold changes in detectable levels of total or phosphorylated hTau in cell lysates or following immunopurification from conditioned media were consistent with preferential release of phosphorylated hTau after light stimulation. This study establishes an excellent model to investigate the mechanism of activity-dependent hTau release and to better understand the role of phosphorylated tau release in the pathogenesis of AD since it relates to alterations in the early stage of neurodegeneration associated with increased neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W3198822614,"In a recently published phase III clinical trial, gemcitabine (GEM) plus cisplatin (DDP) induction chemotherapy significantly improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival and became the standard of care among patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. However, the molecular mechanisms of GEM synergized with DPP in NPC cells remain elucidated. These findings prompt us to explore the effect of the combination between GEM and DDP in NPC cell lines through proliferative phenotype, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and western blotting assays. In vitro studies reveal that GEM or DPP treated alone induces cell cycle arrest, promotes cell apoptosis, forces DNA damage response, and GEM synergism with DDP significantly increases the above effects in NPC cells. In vivo studies indicate that GEM or DPP treated alone significantly inhibits the tumor growth and prolongs the survival time of mice injected with SUNE1 cells compared to the control group. Moreover, the mice treated with GEM combined with DDP have smaller tumors and survive longer than those in GEM or DPP treated alone group. In addition, P-gp may be the key molecule that regulates the synergistic effect of gemcitabine and cisplatin. GEM synergizes with DPP to inhibit NPC cell proliferation and tumor growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis, and DNA damage response, which reveals the mechanisms of combined GEM and DDP induction chemotherapy in improving locoregionally advanced NPC."

We thus evaluated the impact of pure TCMR on graft survival (GS) according to treatment response. We also performed molecular diagnosis using a molecular microscope diagnostic system on a separate group of 23 patients. A total of 63 patients were divided into non-responders (N = 22) and responders (N = 44). Non-response to rejection treatment was significantly associated with the following factors: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at biopsy, ΔGFR, TCMR within one year, t score, and IF/TA score. We also found that non-responder vs. responder (OR = 3.31; P = 0.036) and lower GFR at biopsy (OR = 0.56; P = 0.026) were independent risk factors of graft failure. The responders had a significantly superior overall GS rate compared with the non-responders (P = 0.004). Molecular assessment showed a good correlation with histologic diagnosis in ABMR, but not in TCMR. Solitary TCMR was a significant risk factor of graft failure in patients who did not respond to rejection treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3198666900,"It is known among aviculturists that cockatiels imitate human music with their whistle-like vocal sounds. The present study examined whether cockatiels are also able to sing ""in unison"", or, line up their vocalizations with a musical melody so that they occur at the same time. Three hand-raised cockatiels were exposed to a musical melody of human whistling produced by an experimenter. All the birds learned to sing the melody. Then, two out of these three birds spontaneously joined in singing during an ongoing melody, so that the singing by the bird and the whistling by the human were nearly perfectly synchronous. Further experiments revealed that the birds actively adjusted their vocal timing to playback of a recording of the same melody. This means cockatiels have a remarkable ability for flexible vocal control similar to what is seen in human singing. The proximate/ultimate factors for this behavior and implications for musicality in humans are discussed."

A total of 4,066 participants aged 40-90 years were assessed from the database of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. The participants were classified into MetS and non-MetS groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis with four models were performed to assess the odds ratio (OR) of the divided tertiles of sLDH levels with frailty, and frail components including slow walking (SW), weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity (LPA), and low body weight (LBW). Higher sLDH levels were positively associated with frailty in the MetS group (p = 0.024) but not in non-MetS group (p = 0.102). After covariate adjustments, the OR of frailty in the upper two tertiles compared to the lowest tertile and revealed statistical significance (p < 0.05). Frail components of SW, weakness, exhaustion, and LPA were associated with higher sLDH (p < 0.05) except for LBW in MetS and non-MetS groups.

https://openalex.org/W3197688413,"The proper cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for maintaining the integrity of the genome. RecQL4, a DNA helicase of which mutations are associated with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), is required for the DNA DSB response. However, the mechanism by which RecQL4 performs these essential roles in the DSB response remains unknown. Here, we show that RecQL4 and its helicase activity are required for maintaining the stability of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex on DSB sites during a DSB response. We found using immunocytochemistry and live-cell imaging that the MRN complex is prematurely disassembled from DSB sites in a manner dependent upon Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of Nbs1 in RecQL4-defective cells. This early disassembly of the MRN complex could be prevented by altering the ubiquitination site of Nbs1 or by expressing a deubiquitinase, Usp28, which sufficiently restored homologous recombination repair and ATM, a major checkpoint kinase against DNA DSBs, activation abilities in RTS, and RecQL4-depleted cells. These results suggest that the essential role of RecQL4 in the DSB response is to maintain the stability of the MRN complex on DSB sites and that defects in the DSB response in cells of patients with RTS can be recovered by controlling the stability of the MRN complex."

We reviewed demographics and VMMC surgical details from 391 randomly sampled adult males aged ≥18 years at Ndola Teaching Hospital, a specialised VMMC fixed site in Zambia. Non-parametric tests (Fisher's exact test or Chi-square depending on assumptions being met) and logistic regression were conducted to determine the relationships between associated factors and VMMC AE.The overall VMMC AE prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 1.60%- 5.30%) and most AEs occurred postoperatively. In decreasing order, the commonly reported VMMC AE included; bleeding (47.1%), swelling (29.4%), haematoma (17.6%), and delayed wound healing (5.9%). There was an inversely proportional relationship between VMMC volume (as measured by the number of surgeries conducted per VMMC provider) and AEs. Compared to the highest VMMC volume of 63.2% (247/391) as reference, as VMMC volume reduced to 35.0% (137/391) and then 1.8% (7/391), the likelihood of AEs increased by five times (aOR 5.08; 95% CI 1.33-19.49; p = 0.018) and then sixteen times (aOR 16.13; 95% CI 1.42-183.30; p = 0.025) respectively.Our study found a low prevalence of VMMC AEs in Ndola city, Copperbelt Province of Zambia guaranteeing the safety of the VMMC program. We recommend more surgically proficient staff to continue rendering this service. There is a need to explore other high priority national/regional areas of VMMC program safety/quality, such as adherence to follow-up visits."

Method Cross-sectional study with a quantitative and analytical approach, a total of 459 indigenous people (57.1% men, aged 36.3 ± 14.7 years old) belonging to the Munduruku ethnic group from the Kwatá-Laranjal Indigenous Land, in Amazonas, Brazil, were selected by probabilistic sampling in all households in the four most populous villages. Sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, blood pressure levels and lipid profile were evaluated. Fasting capillary blood glucose was measured with a digital device. The associations were assessed by multinomial logistic regression, and p-values≤0.05 were considered significant. Results For pre-diabetes, prevalence was 74.3% and, for diabetes, 12.2%. The variables associated with the risk for pre-diabetes were the following: age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.00 – 1.06) and obesity (OR = 9.69; 95% CI = 1.28 – 73.58). The positive associations indicating risk for diabetes were as follows: age (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.03 – 1.08), overweight (OR = 4.17; 95% CI = 1.69 – 10.32) and obesity (OR = 35.26; 95% CI = 4.12 – 302.08). Conclusions The risks associated with pre-diabetes and diabetes among the Munduruku indigenous people revealed a worrying index. It is necessary to consider changes in eating habits and lifestyle, as well as possible environmental and social changes that can affect this and other groups, with emphasis on those who live in vulnerable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3138301874,"We previously demonstrated that exposure of adult mice to environmental levels of cadmium (Cd) alters immune cell development and function with increases in anti-streptococcal antibody levels, as well as decreases in splenic natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) in the adult female offspring. Based on these data, we hypothesized that prenatal Cd exposure could predispose an individual to developing autoimmunity as adults. To test this hypothesis, the effects of prenatal Cd on the development of autoimmune diabetes and arthritis were investigated. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were exposed to Cd in a manner identical to our previous studies, and the onset of diabetes was assessed in the offspring. Our results showed a similar time-to-onset and severity of disease to historical data, and there were no statistical differences between Cd-exposed and control offspring. Numerous other immune parameters were measured and none of these parameters showed biologically-relevant differences between Cd-exposed and control animals. To test whether prenatal Cd-exposure affected development of autoimmune arthritis, we used SKG mice. While the levels of arthritis were similar between Cd-exposed and control offspring of both sexes, the pathology of arthritis determined by micro-computed tomography (μCT) between Cd-exposed and control animals, showed some statistically different values, especially in the female offspring. However, the differences were small and thus, the biological significance of these changes is open to speculation. Overall, based on the results from two autoimmune models, we conclude that prenatal exposure to Cd did not lead to a measurable propensity to develop autoimmune disease later in life."
https://openalex.org/W3196377908,"Sodium carboxymethyl starch (CMS-Na), a kind of food additive with high degree of substitution, is also known as a prebiotic. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CMS-Na on defecation. Constipated mouse model was prepared by loperamide. Normal rats were also used in the study. Short-chain fatty acids in rat feces were detected by gas chromatography. The bacterial communities in rat feces were identified by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) were measured by ELISA. The results showed that CMS-Na increased the fecal granule counts and intestinal propulsion rate in constipated mice. The contents of water, acetic acid, propionic acid and n-butyrate in feces, Tph1 in colon and 5-HT in serum of rats were increased. In addition, CMS-Na shortened the colonic transport time in rats. The 16S rDNA gene sequencing results indicated that CMS-Na increased the relative abundance of Alloprevotella and decreased the proportion of Lactobacillus. However, the biodiversity of the normal intestinal flora was not altered. In conclusion, CMS-Na can promote defecation in constipated mice. The mechanism may be related to the regulation of Alloprevotella and Lactobacillus in colon, the increase of short-chain fatty acids, and the promotion of the synthesis of Tph1 and 5-HT."
https://openalex.org/W3196457182,"Metabolic flexibility is the capacity of cells to alter fuel metabolism in response to changes in metabolic demand or nutrient availability. It is critical for maintaining cellular bioenergetics and is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders. However, the regulation and function of metabolic flexibility in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) remain unclear. We have previously shown that glycolysis is the predominant metabolic pathway to generate ATP in LECs and that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling controls lymphatic vessel formation by promoting glycolysis. Here, we found that chemical inhibition of FGFR activity or knockdown of FGFR1 induces substantial upregulation of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) while reducing glycolysis and cellular ATP generation in LECs. Interestingly, such compensatory elevation was not observed in glucose oxidation and glutamine oxidation. Mechanistic studies show that FGFR blockade promotes the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), a rate-limiting enzyme of FAO; this is achieved by dampened extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase activation, which in turn upregulates the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Metabolic analysis further demonstrates that CPT1A depletion decreases total cellular ATP levels in FGFR1-deficient rather than wildtype LECs. This result suggests that FAO, which makes a negligible contribution to cellular energy under normal conditions, can partially compensate for energy deficiency caused by FGFR inhibition. Consequently, CPT1A silencing potentiates the effect of FGFR1 knockdown on impeding LEC proliferation and migration. Collectively, our study identified a key role of metabolic flexibility in modulating the effect of FGFR signaling on LEC growth."
https://openalex.org/W3198072298,"Self-reporting of pain can be difficult in populations with communication challenges or atypical sensory processing, such as children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Consequently, pain can go untreated. An objective method to identify discomfort would be valuable to individuals unable to express or recognize their own bodily distress. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a brain-imaging modality that is suited for this application. We evaluated the potential of detecting a cortical response to discomfort in the ASD population using NIRS. Using a continuous-wave spectrometer, prefrontal and parietal measures were collected from 15 males with ASD and 7 typically developing (TD) males 10–15 years of age. Participants were exposed to a noxious cold stimulus by immersing their hands in cold water and tepid water as a baseline task. Across all participants, the magnitude and timing of the cold and tepid water-induced brain responses were significantly different ( p &lt; 0.001). The effect of the task on the brain response depended on the study group (group x task: p &lt; 0.001), with the ASD group exhibiting a blunted response to the cold stimulus. Findings suggest that NIRS may serve as a tool for objective pain assessment and atypical sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W3198686537,"Bromodomains (BD) are conserved reader modules that bind acetylated lysine residues on histones. Although much has been learned regarding the in vitro properties of these domains, less is known about their function within chromatin complexes. SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes modulate transcription and contribute to DNA damage repair. Mutations in SWI/SNF subunits have been implicated in many cancers. Here we demonstrate that the BD of Caenorhabditis elegans SMARCA4/BRG1, a core SWI/SNF subunit, recognizes acetylated lysine 14 of histone H3 (H3K14ac), similar to its Homo sapiens ortholog. We identify the interactions of SMARCA4 with the acetylated histone peptide from a 1.29 Å-resolution crystal structure of the CeSMARCA4 BD-H3K14ac complex. Significantly, most of the SMARCA4 BD residues in contact with the histone peptide are conserved with other proteins containing family VIII bromodomains. Based on the premise that binding specificity is conserved among bromodomain orthologs, we propose that loop residues outside of the binding pocket position contact residues to recognize the H3K14ac sequence. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutations in the SMARCA4 BD that abolish H3K14ac binding in vitro had little or no effect on C. elegans viability or physiological function in vivo. However, combining SMARCA4 BD mutations with knockdown of the SWI/SNF accessory subunit PBRM-1 resulted in severe developmental defects in animals. In conclusion, we demonstrated an essential function for the SWI/SNF bromodomain in vivo and detected potential redundancy in epigenetic readers in regulating chromatin remodeling. These findings have implications for the development of small-molecule BD inhibitors to treat cancers and other diseases."
