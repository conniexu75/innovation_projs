https://openalex.org/W2013126973,"Exposure of murine embryos to teratogenic doses of retinoic acid (RA) induced homeotic transformations of vertebrae. Posterior transformations occurred along the complete body axis after RA administration on day 7 of gestation and were accompanied by anterior shifts of Hox gene expression domains in embryos. Anterior transformations of vertebrae in the caudal half of the vertebral column were induced on day 8.5. We suggest that the identity of a vertebral segment is specified by a combination of functionally active Hox genes, a ""Hox code."" In this concept the sequential activation of Hox genes defines sequentially more posterior axial levels, while mesodermal cells leave the primitive streak. Exogenous RA interferes with the normal establishment of Hox codes and thus with axial specification."

CD4 clones from individuals with strong cell-mediated immunity produced predominantly interferon-gamma, whereas those clones that enhanced antibody formation produced interleukin-4. CD8 cytotoxic T cells secreted interferon-gamma. Interleukin-4 was produced by CD8 T suppressor clones from immunologically unresponsive individuals with leprosy and was found to be necessary for suppression in vitro. Both the classic reciprocal relation between antibody formation and cell-mediated immunity and resistance or susceptibility to certain infections may be explained by T cell subsets differing in patterns of lymphokine production."
https://openalex.org/W1968774879,"Addition of brefeldin A (BFA) to most cells results in both the formation of extensive, uncoated membrane tubules through which Golgi components redistribute into the ER and the failure to transport molecules out of this mixed ER/Golgi system. In this study we provide evidence that suggests BFA's effects are not limited to the Golgi apparatus but are reiterated throughout the central vacuolar system. Addition of BFA to cells resulted in the tubulation of the endosomal system, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and lysosomes. Tubule formation of these organelles was specific to BFA, shared near identical pharmacolgic characteristics as Golgi tubules and resulted in targeted membrane fusion. Analogous to the mixing of the Golgi with the ER during BFA treatment, the TGN mixed with the recycling endosomal system. This mixed system remained functional with normal cycling between plasma membrane and endosomes, but traffic between endosomes and lysosomes was impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2053700844,"The Hox-1.6 gene disrupted in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination was introduced into the mouse germline. Heterozygous mice were normal, but homozygous mice died at birth from anoxia and had numerous defects that were centered at the level of rhombomeres 4 to 7 and included delayed hindbrain neural tube closure, absence of certain cranial nerves and ganglia, and malformed inner ears and bones of the skull. Thus, Hox-1.6 is involved in regional specification along the rostrocaudal axis, but only in its most rostral domain of expression. Hox-1.6 appears to specify neurogenic neural crest cells prior to specification of mesenchymal neural crest cells by Hox-1.5. Thus, within the same region of the presumptive hindbrain, two HOX-1 genes are involved in the patterning of two different populations of neural crest cells. The implication of these results for the function of the Hox network during mouse embryogenesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2119521084,"The molecular basis of the mouse mutation splotch (Sp), which is associated with spina bifida and exencephaly, was analyzed at three of its alleles, Sp, Sp2H, and Spr. We mapped the paired box gene Pax-3 within the Inha to Akp3 interval, near or at the Sp locus on chromosome 1, and found Pax-3 to be deleted in heterozygous Spr/+ mice. Analysis of genomic DNA and cDNA clones constructed from Sp2H/Sp2H embryos identified a deletion of 32 nucleotides in the Pax-3 mRNA transcript and gene. This deletion maps within the paired homeodomain of PAX-3 and is predicted to create a truncated protein as a result of a newly created termination codon at the deletion breakpoint. Our study provides evidence for a causal link between deletion of the paired homeodomain of Pax-3 and the Sp2H mutation, and infers that Pax-3 plays a key role in normal neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2019348717,"ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is an abundant and highly conserved low molecular weight GTP-binding protein that was originally identified as a key element required for the action of cholera toxin in mammalian cells, but whose physiological role is unknown. We report that ARF family proteins are highly concentrated in non-clathrin-coated transport vesicles and are coat proteins. About three copies of ARF are present on the outside of coated vesicles per Î±-COP (and thus per coatomer). ARF is highly enriched in coated vesicles as compared with parental Golgi cisternae, as shown both by biochemical and morphological methods, and ARF is removed from transport vesicles through uncoating during transport. Furthermore, ARF binds to Golgi cisternae in a GTP-dependent manner independently of coated vesicle budding. These observations strongly suggest a new role for GTP-binding proteins: ARF proteins may modulate vesicle budding and uncoating through controlled GTP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1601881612,"A common feature of scrapie and related transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is the accumulation of an abnormal protease-resistant form of PrP which may be the major component of the infectious agent. While it is known that both the normal (protease-sensitive) PrP and protease-resistant PrP are encoded by the same endogenous gene, the nature of the disease-associated modification of PrP is not understood. To study the cellular events leading to the formation of protease-resistant PrP, we have compared its biosynthesis to that of its normal isoform in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. In pulse-chase labeling experiments, the protease-resistant PrP was synthesized and degraded much more slowly than the normal PrP, suggesting that protease-resistant PrP is made from a protease-sensitive precursor. More significantly, we found that the precursor of protease-resistant PrP was eliminated from intact cells by treatments with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and trypsin. This demonstrated that, unlike the protease-resistant PrP itself, the precursor is phospholipase- and protease-sensitive and at least transiently found on the cell surface. By these criteria, the precursor of protease-resistant PrP is indistinguishable from the normal PrP isoform. These results indicate that the conversion of PrP to the protease- and phospholipase-resistant state is a post-translational event that occurs after the precursor reaches the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1752221293,"Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of both hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells that mediates, in part, the emigration of leukocytes out of the vasculature. Expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and a human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) was increased by interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma in a concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to 10 target sites on the human ICAM-1 mRNA were tested for inhibition of ICAM-1 expression in both cell lines by an ICAM-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based upon potency and unique mRNA target sites, two oligonucleotides were studied in greater detail: ISIS 1570, which targeted the AUG translation initiation codon, and ISIS 1939, which targeted specific sequences in the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA. Both oligonucleotides specifically inhibit expression of ICAM-1 as analyzed by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins. Treatment of cells with ISIS 1939 promoted a reduction in ICAM-1 mRNA, whereas ISIS 1570 did not change the level of ICAM-1 mRNA, suggesting that the two oligonucleotides may be inhibiting ICAM-1 expression by two different mechanisms. The activity of both oligonucleotides was blocked by hybridization of the oligonucleotide to its complementary sense strand prior to addition to the cells. Neither ISIS 1570 nor ISIS 1939 changed the transcriptional rate of the ICAM-1 gene, demonstrating that both oligonucleotides were working through a post-transcriptional mechanism. 2'-O-Methyl phosphorothioate analogs, which do not support RNase H-mediated cleavage of target mRNA, were used to determine if the active antisense oligonucleotides inhibited ICAM-1 expression by an RNase H-dependent mechanism. The 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate analog of ISIS 1939 did not significantly reduce interleukin-1 beta-induced ICAM-1 expression, whereas the 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate analog of ISIS 1570 did inhibit ICAM-1 expression, suggesting that the reduction of ICAM-1 mRNA following treatment with ISIS 1939 was due, in part, to RNase H-mediated hydrolysis. Adherence of HL-60 cells to human umbilical vein cell monolayers was inhibited by ISIS 1570 and ISIS 1939, demonstrating that the reduced levels of ICAM-1 impact on ICAM-1-associated function."
https://openalex.org/W2000252657,"We present evidence that the morphoregulatory activities of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and N-cadherin involve activation of intracellular second messenger pathways. PC12 cells were cultured on monolayers of control 3T3 cells or 3T3 cells expressing transfected N-cadherin or NCAM. NCAM and N-cadherin directly induced a transcription-independent change in the morphology of PC12 cells from an adrenal to neuronal phenotype and also specifically increased Thy-1, but not L1/NILE or low affinity NGF receptor, immunoreactivity. The morphological response was more rapid and, in the case of N-cadherin, more substantial than that induced by NGF. It could be fully inhibited by pertussis toxin and a combination of L- and N-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, but not by broad-specificity kinase inhibitors. It was blocked, however, by the kinase inhibitor K-252b. These studies suggest that cell adhesion molecules directly alter cell phenotype and provide direct evidence for transmembrane signaling mediating both the morphological and biochemical responses induced by NCAM and N-cadherin."
https://openalex.org/W1984688123,"Nascent transcripts of the Drosophila Ubx gene were detected by in situ hybridization. Following onset of expression, the progress of RNA polymerase (1.4 kb/min) across the gene was visualized as the successive appearance of hybridization signals from different positions within the transcription unit. Nascent transcripts disappeared at mitosis. Hybridization signals reappeared in the next cell cycle first with a 5' probe, and later, following a delay consistent with the transcription rate, with a 3' probe. Nascent transcripts were observed continuously in expressing cells of a mutant embryo in which cells are blocked in interphase. We conclude that progression through mitosis causes abortion of nascent transcripts and suggest that periodic abortion of transcription contributes to regulation of expression of large genes."
https://openalex.org/W1968653223,"The activation kinetics of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels in outside-out patches from cultured hippocampal neurons were analyzed to determine the number of glutamate and glycine binding sites per channel. Following rapid steps into high concentrations of glutamate, the activation time course was concentration-independent and limited by transitions between the shut, but fully liganded state and the open state. At lower concentrations, ligand binding was rate-limiting. The resulting sigmoidal activation time course was best fitted by a kinetic model with two glutamate binding sites. Glycine concentration jumps in the continuous presence of glutamate were also best fitted with a two-site model. Agonist and co-agonist binding were better described by an independent, rather than a sequential model. We suggest that the NMDA receptor is at least a tetramer containing four ligand binding subunits, assuming a single binding site per subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1540214411,"Lag times in DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase delta holoenzyme were due to ATP-mediated formation of an initiation complex on the primed DNA by the polymerase with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C (RF-C). Lag time analysis showed that high affinity binding of RF-C to the primer terminus required PCNA and that this complex was recognized by the polymerase. The formation of stable complexes was investigated through their isolation by Bio-Gel A-5m filtration. A stable complex of RF-C and PCNA on primed single-stranded mp18 DNA was isolated when these factors were preincubated with the DNA and with ATP, or, less efficiently with ATP gamma S. These and additional experiments suggest that ATP binding promotes the formation of a labile complex of RF-C with PCNA at the primer terminus, whereas its hydrolysis is required to form a stable complex. Subsequently, DNA polymerase delta binds to either complex in a replication competent fashion without further energy requirement. DNA polymerase epsilon did not associate stably with RF-C and PCNA onto the DNA, but its transient participation with these cofactors into a holoenzyme-like initiation complex was inferred from its kinetic properties and replication product analysis. The kinetics of the elongation phase at 30 degrees, 110 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase delta holoenzyme and 50 nucleotides/s by DNA polymerase epsilon holoenzyme, are in agreement with in vivo rates of replication fork movement in yeast. A model for the eukaryotic replication fork involving both DNA polymerase delta and epsilon is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2063792561,"It is generally accepted that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter at most excitatory synapses in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Synaptic release of glutamate may trigger a fast and a slow excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). The slow EPSC is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels, whereas the fast EPSC is mediated by non-NMDA receptor channels. The nootropic agent aniracetam selectively and reversibly slows the desensitization kinetics of non-NMDA channels and lengthens their single-channel open times. Aniracetam also modulates the kinetics of the fast EPSC in a manner that mirrors its action on the kinetics of the non-NMDA channels. These results support the hypothesis that the properties of the non-NMDA glutamate channels rather than the rate of neurotransmitter clearance are the primary determinants of the kinetics of the fast EPSC in the mammalian CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1515117525,"P-glycoproteins are responsible for multidrug resistance in tumor cell lines and are thought to have a physiologic role in exporting cellular metabolites. We now report that a P-glycoprotein gene in the H region of the trypanosomatid protozoan Leishmania confers resistance to heavy metals when present in multiple copies. The Leishmania H region is frequently amplified in drug-resistant lines and is associated with metal resistance. Leishmania expression vectors were used to introduce multiple copies of segments of the Leishmania major H region into wild-type L. major promastigotes. Only constructs bearing a segment of L. major DNA containing the P-glycoprotein lmpgpA conferred arsenite resistance. Deletional analysis of the arsenite-resistant construct mapped resistance to the lmpgpA protein coding region. Lines expressing lmpgpA showed resistance to arsenite and trivalent antimonials, but not to pentavalent antimonials, zinc, cadmium, or the typical multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein substrates vinblastine and puromycin. Transfection of the Leishmania tarentolae P-glycoprotein homologue ltpgpA resulted in a similar resistance profile. Thus, these pgpAs represent a functionally distinct group of P-glycoproteins which exhibit a substrate specificity similar to prokaryotic heavy metal pumps. Additionally, several arguments suggest that pgpAs may play a role in the susceptibility of Leishmania to clinically utilized antimonials."
https://openalex.org/W2055261660,"Transmitter release from photoreceptors is decreased by light, resulting in a conductance increase in depolarizing bipolar cells. Addition of exogenous cGMP through a patch pipette to depolarizing bipolar cells from slices of dark-adapted tiger salamander retina resulted in an enhancement of the light response. This enhancement was blocked by GTP-Î³-S and dipyridamole, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. GTP-Î³-S and dipyridamole also blocked responses to exogenously applied 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB), the glutamate agonist selective for this receptor. These data support the hypothesis that the postsynaptic receptor is linked via a G protein to a phosphodiesterase. The binding of glutamate or APB to the receptor suppresses a cGMP-activated current by increasing the rate of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1975094669,"The ability of excitatory amino acids to induce increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of cerebellar Purkinje cells was examined by digital fluorescence ratio imaging of voltage-clamped Purkinje cells dialyzed with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2. Purkinje cells responded with large inward currents accompanied by increases in dendritic [Ca2+]i when challenged with the excitatory amino acid agonists glutamate and quisqualate. The rise in [Ca2+]i was transient and reached peak values of several hundred nanomolar. The response subsisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a condition that eliminates Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, indicating that Ca2+ arose in large part from an intracellular compartment. In support of this hypothesis, only the first agonist application elicited a [Ca2+]i increase in slices maintained in Ca(2+)-free medium, as expected if the intracellular stores become depleted. These results indicate that metabotropic glutamate receptors are functional in Purkinje cells and point to glutamate as a possible modulator of [Ca2+]i in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1548902459,"The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from vertebrate skeletal muscle is a pentamer composed of two ligand-binding alpha-subunits and one beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunit. To examine the functional roles of the non-alpha-subunits, we have expressed, in stable cell lines, AChRs lacking either a gamma- or a delta-subunit. Most previous work has examined how these changes in subunit composition affect single channel properties. Here, we take advantage of the stable expression system to produce large amounts of AChR and, for the first time, examine ligand binding to altered AChRs on intact cells. The changes in subunit composition affect both ligand affinity and cooperativity of the receptor, suggesting important roles for the gamma- and delta-subunits, both in shaping the ligand binding site and maintaining cooperative interactions between alpha-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2107900791,"Ligand-activated retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and c-ErbA alpha repress the AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation of the interstitial collagenase gene promoter by specifically decreasing the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor. On the other hand, the v-ErbA oncoprotein fails to repress the AP-1 activity and acts as a dominant negative oncoprotein by overcoming the repression of the AP-1 activity induced by RAR alpha and c-ErbA alpha. This maintenance by v-ErbA of a fully active AP-1 complex is correlated with the abrogation by this same oncogene product of the growth-inhibitory response of chicken embryo fibroblasts to retinoic acid treatment. This new mechanism of action of v-ErbA together with its previously discovered dominant repressor effect on transcription of thyroid hormone-activated target genes may explain the contribution of the v-erbA oncogene to sarcomatogenic and leukemogenic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1496330792,"Heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) produced by Escherichia coli induces intestinal secretion in mammals by binding to the brush border membrane of the small intestine and activating guanylyl cyclase. We report here the cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding the human receptor for STa. The receptor contains both an extracellular ligand binding site and a cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain, making it a member of the same receptor family as the natriuretic peptide receptors. Stable mammalian cell lines over-expressing the STa receptor specifically bind 125I-STa (Kd approximately 1.0 nM) and respond to STa by dramatically increasing (approximately 50-fold) cellular cGMP levels. Sequence comparisons between the human and the rat STa receptors show less conservation in the extracellular domain than similar comparisons of natriuretic peptide receptors. This divergence may indicate important species differences in ligand-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1678488130,"Increased expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) has been demonstrated to cause multidrug resistance (MDR) in vitro, and it may be responsible for chemotherapy failure in a number of human cancers. Pgp is a plasma membrane protein thought to function as an energy-dependent drug transporter. From its deduced protein sequence the topology of Pgp was proposed to contain 12 transmembrane domains with six extracellular loops and two cytoplasmic ATP-binding sites. To investigate further the membrane orientation of Pgp, we have expressed a full length cDNA of mouse mdr1, as well as its truncated forms, in a cell-free system supplemented with dog pancreatic microsomal membranes (RM). We determined which domains of the in vitro-synthesized Pgp had transversed the RM membranes by analyzing their resistance to protease digestion and their glycosylation state. To our surprise, this system revealed that a significant portion of in vitro-synthesized Pgp molecules has an additional glycosylated domain in the C-terminal half. Previously, only the first predicted extracellular loop near the N terminus had been thought to be glycosylated. Furthermore, we discovered that Pgp has at least two functional signal recognition particle/docking protein dependent signal sequences, one at the N-terminal half and the other at the C-terminal half. These findings suggest a new topological model for in vitro synthesized P-glycoprotein which may be relevant to its in vivo topology."
https://openalex.org/W1536976216,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication factor C (RF-C) was purified 25,000-fold from a protease-deficient strain of yeast. RF-C is a complex of 6 subunits of 130, 86, 41, 40, 37, and 27 kDa. None of the subunits are related through proteolysis or differential phosphorylation. The assay for RF-C used as a substrate single-stranded DNA binding protein-coated singly primed single-stranded mp 18 DNA. This DNA was poorly replicated by yeast DNA polymerase delta with or without its cofactor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In the presence of RF-C, however, replication of the template proceeded efficiently when both ATP and PCNA were present as well. Formation of this replication-proficient complex of DNA polymerase delta required an input of one to two molecules of PCNA per replicated DNA molecule. DNA polymerase epsilon also formed an ATP-dependent complex with PCNA and RF-C. RF-C has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, equally active on single-stranded and primed single-stranded mp18 DNA. Addition of PCNA stimulated the ATPase of RF-C on primed but not on unprimed DNA, indicating that the increase in ATPase was due to PCNA-enhanced binding of RF-C to the primer terminus. Calf thymus PCNA also stimulated the ATPase activity of yeast RF-C and participated in holoenzyme formation with DNA polymerase delta. These results attest to the structural and functional homology between yeast and mammalian cells for these components of the replication machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1495418160,"Expression of ligand binding properties for an atypical beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtype was studied during the adipose differentiation of murine 3T3-F442A cells and compared with that of the human beta 3-AR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human beta 3-AR gene (CHO-beta 3 cells) Emorine, L. J., Marullo, S., Briend-Sutren, M. M., Patey, G., Tate, K., Delavier-Klutchko, C., and Strosberg, A. D. (1989) Science 245, 1118-1121). 3T3-F442A adipocytes exhibited high and low affinity binding sites for (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) [5,7-3H]benzimidazole-2-one ((-)-[3H]CGP-12177) (KD = 1.2 and 38.3 nM) and (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) (KD = 47 and 1,510 pM). The high affinity sites corresponded to the classical beta 1- and beta 2-AR subtypes whereas the KD values of the low affinity sites for the radioligands were similar to those measured in CHO-beta 3 cells (KD = 28 nM and 1,890 pM for (-)-[3H]CGP12177 and [125I]CYP, respectively). These low affinity sites were undetectable in preadipocytes but represented about 90% of total beta-ARs in adipocytes. The atypical beta-AR and the human beta 3-AR add similarly low affinities (Ki = 3-5 microM) for (+/-)-(2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)ethylamino-3)-(4-(1-methyl- 4- trifluormethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy)-2-propanol methane sulfonate (CGP20712A) or erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan-2-ol (ICI118551), highly selective beta 1- and beta 2-AR antagonists, respectively, in agreement with the poor inhibitory effect of the compounds on (-)-isoproterenol (IPR)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Atypical beta-AR and beta 3-AR had an affinity about 10-50 times higher for sodium-4-(2-[2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethylamino]propyl)phenoxyace tate sesquihydrate (BRL37344) than the beta 1-AR subtype. This correlates with the potent lipolytic effect of BRL37344 in adipocytes. The rank order of potency of agonists in functional and binding studies was BRL37344 greater than IPR less than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-epinephrine both in 3T3 adipocytes and CHO-beta 3 cells. As in CHO-beta 3 cells, the classical beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists CGP12177, oxprenolol, and pindolol were partial agonists in adipocytes. Although undetectable in preadipocytes, a major mRNA species of 2.3 kilobases (kb) and a minor one of 2.8 kb were observed in adipocytes by hybridization to a human beta 3-AR specific probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1570070844,"P-glycoprotein is an energy-dependent drug efflux pump with broad specificity for hydrophobic antitumor agents such as vinblastine, doxorubicin, and taxol. We have previously shown that [3H]azidopine and [125I] iodoaryl azidoprazosin, which are photoaffinity probes for the alpha 1-subunit of the L-type calcium channel and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, respectively, specifically interact with P-glycoprotein, partially reverse multidrug resistance, and bind to a 6-kDa common domain in the 140-kDa P-glycoprotein molecule (Greenberger, L., Yang, C.-P. H., Gindin, E., and Horwitz, S. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4394-4401). An immunological approach was used to identify the position of photoaffinity drug-binding domains in P-glycoprotein. Analysis was done with a series of site-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies to peptides that mimic domains in the mouse mdr1b gene product. The antibodies were made against amino acid residues 269-284, 356-373, 665-682, 740-750, 907-924, and 1203-1222. Upon trypsin digestion, cleavage products of 95 and 55 kDa were obtained, which after further digestion migrated at 60 and 40 kDa, respectively. The 40-kDa fragment was recognized by the antibodies to residues 1203-1222 and 919-1276, while the 55-kDa fragment was recognized by these antibodies plus antibodies to residues 740-750 and 907-924. In contrast, the 95- and 60-kDa trypsin fragments were recognized only by the antibody to residues 269-284. The 55- and 40-kDa fragments, as well as the 95- and 60-kDa fragments, were major photolabeled species after digestion of P-glycoprotein. The previously identified 6-kDa photo-labeled P-glycoprotein fragment was within the 40-kDa trypsin fragment. These data suggest that there are two photoaffinity drug-binding domains in P-glycoprotein encoded by mouse mdr1b. The C-terminal site most likely resides within or in close proximity to putative transmembrane domains 11-12."
https://openalex.org/W1560399205,"Rabbit hepatocyte surface-expressed tissue (type II) transglutaminase is shown to act as a binding site for fibrinogen or fibronectin and to covalently incorporate these glycoproteins, in addition to itself, into extracellular high molecular weight complexes. This concept is supported by the observation that a nonpeptidyl, active site-directed transglutaminase inactivator (L683685) elicited concentration-dependent (0.1-10 microM) decreases in the calcium-dependent binding and covalent cross-linking of 125I-fibrinogen, 125I-fibronectin, or [14C]putrescine by hepatocyte suspensions. In corroboration with these findings, an antiserum against rabbit liver transglutaminase, which did not cross-react with rabbit factor XIII, elicited concentration-dependent decreases in the calcium-dependent binding and covalent cross-linking of 125I-fibrinogen or [14C]putrescine by hepatocyte suspensions. Western blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate/Triton-insoluble hepatocyte fractions conducted with this antiserum, with a polyclonal antiserum against human erythrocyte transglutaminase, or with a monoclonal antibody (CUB-7401) against guinea pig liver transglutaminase detected the 80-kDa tissue transglutaminase, as well as tissue transglutaminase-immunoreactive bands of higher molecular mass (range of 90 to greater than 200 kDa). The higher molecular weight species were preferentially incorporated, in a time- and calcium-dependent manner, into very high molecular weight complexes which did not enter the stacking gel. Incorporation of these tissue transglutaminase-containing bands into the high molecular weight complexes was inhibited by L683685, indicating that cross-linking by the enzyme was responsible for the assembly of the complexes of which tissue transglutaminase was itself a component. Cellular integrins did not mediate ligand binding under the experimental conditions, as evidenced by the failure of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser tetrapeptide or anti-integrin antibodies to inhibit binding or cross-linking of 125I-fibrinogen or 125I-fibronectin, in the presence or absence of transglutaminase inactivators."

https://openalex.org/W1556881006,"SRIF receptors are membrane-bound glycoproteins. To structurally identify the carbohydrate components of SRIF receptors, solubilized rat brain SRIF receptors were subjected to lectin affinity chromatography. Solubilized SRIF receptors specifically bound to wheat germ agglutinin-lectin affinity columns but not to succinylated wheat germ agglutinin. This finding, as well as the ability of the solubilized receptor to interact with a Sambucus nigra L. lectin affinity column suggested that sialic acid residues are associated with SRIF receptors. The inability of the receptor to bind to concanavalin A, Dolichus biflorus agglutinin, Ulex europeaus I, and Jacalin lectin affinity columns suggests that high mannose, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and O-linked carbohydrates are not associated with receptor. To investigate the functional role of the carbohydrate groups in brain SRIF receptors, specific sugars were selectively cleaved from SRIF receptors and the subsequent effect on the specific high affinity binding of the agonist [125I]MK 678 to SRIF receptors was determined. Treatment of the receptor with endoglycosidase D did not affect the specific binding of [125I] MK 678 to the solubilized SRIF receptors, consistent with the finding from lectin affinity chromatography that high mannose-type carbohydrate structures were not associated with SRIF receptors. Treatment of solubilized SRIF receptors with peptide-N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidases H and F reduced [125I]MK 678 binding to SRIF receptors indicating that either hybrid, or a combination of hybrid and complex N-linked carbohydrate structures, have a role in maintaining the receptor in a high affinity state for agonists. Treatment of solubilized SRIF receptors with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholera abolished high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, whereas treatment of the receptor with neuraminidase from Newcastle disease virus did not affect [125I]MK 678 binding to the receptor. These findings suggest that sialic acid residues in an alpha 2,6-configuration have a role in maintaining the SRIF receptor in a high affinity conformation for agonists. This is further indicated by studies on SRIF receptors in the pituitary tumor cell line, AtT-20. Treatment of AtT-20 cells in culture with neuraminidase (V. cholera) greatly reduces high affinity [125I] MK 678 binding sites, but did not alter the maximal ability of SRIF to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in intact AtT-20 cells. This finding suggests that the desialylated SRIF receptor is functionally active and remains coupled to GTP-binding proteins, but exhibits a reduced affinity for agonists. Treatment of AtT-20 cell membranes with neuraminidase from V. cholera was also able to greatly reduce the affinity of SRIF receptors for [125I]MK 678.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2160361755,"Adrenaline inhibits insulin secretion via pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. Since voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents play a key role in insulin secretion, we examined whether adrenaline modulates voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents of the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. In the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, dihydropyridine- but not omega-conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ currents were identified. Adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors inhibited the Ca2+ currents by about 50%. Somatostatin which also inhibits insulin secretion was less efficient (inhibition by 20%). The hormonal inhibition of Ca2+ currents was not affected by intracellularly applied cAMP but blocked by the intracellularly applied GDP analog guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) and by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. In contrast to adrenaline and somatostatin, galanin, another inhibitor of insulin secretion, reduced Ca2+ currents by about 40% in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Immunoblot experiments performed with antibodies generated against synthetic peptides revealed that membranes of RINm5F cells possess four pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins including Gi1, Gi2, Go2, and another Go subtype, most likely representing Go1. In membranes of control but not of pertussis toxin-treated cells, adrenaline via alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive GTP analog [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of Gi2, Go2, and the not further identified Go subtype. The present findings indicate that activated alpha 2-adrenoceptors of RINm5F cells interact with multiple G-proteins, i.e. two forms of Go and with Gi2. These G-proteins are likely to be involved in the adrenaline-induced inhibition of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ currents and in other signal transduction pathways contributing to the adrenaline-induced inhibition of insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1521967899,"Nebulin, a family of giant myofibrillar proteins of 600-900 kDa, contains a large number of highly conserved sequence repeats of 31-38 amino acids. To investigate the significance of this repeat, human skeletal muscle nebulin cDNA fragments encoding two, six, seven, eight, or fifteen repeat modules were expressed in high yield as nonfusion proteins in Escherichia coli with the pET3d plasmid vector. F-actin cosedimentation and solid phase binding assays demonstrated that all nebulin fragments, except the smallest two-module 67-mer, bound to muscle actin with high affinity under physiological ionic conditions. Solid phase binding assays also revealed that a six-module fragment, NB5, binds to myosin and C-terminal protein but fails to bind to tropomyosin, troponin, and tubulin. Furthermore, the binding of NB5 to actin was inhibited by both tropomyosin and troponin. Immunoelectron microscopic localization of NB5 indicated that this N-terminal region fragment is situated near the distal end of thin filaments in the sarcomere. These results indicate that nebulin is a giant protein with an unprecedently large number of actin-binding sites along its length and is anchored at the C terminus to the Z line in the sarcomere. Nebulin may function as a multifunctional template protein that regulates the length of thin filaments and participates in muscle activities by interacting with actin and myosin filaments in the sarcomere of skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1503098738,"Abstract Several mammalian mutant cell lines are deficient in the biosynthesis of glycophosphatidylinositol anchors for membrane proteins. When metabolically labeled with [3H]myo-inositol or [3H]mannose, two out of five mutant lines (SIA-b and EL4-f) accumulated abnormal lipids which remained undetectable in the corresponding parental cell lines. The most abundant glycolipid of SIA-b cells (named lipid X) was isolated and partially characterized using hydrofluoric acid, nitrous acid deamination, acetolysis, and exoglycosidase treatments alone or in combination. The partial structure for the carbohydrate moiety of lipid X is Man alpha-(X----)Man alpha-GlcN-inositol, X being a charged, HF-sensitive substituent (possibly phosphoethanolamine). Lipid X is largely resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment but can be rendered sensitive to the enzyme by treatment with methanolic NH3, which suggests the presence of an acyl chain on the inositol moiety. The lipid moieties of lipid X are heterogenous in that about 50% of headgroups remain bound to a lipid moiety after mild alkaline hydrolysis. Similarly, about 50% of the lipid moieties of Thy-1, a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored surface glycoprotein, isolated from SIA, the parent of SIA-b cells or from EL4 lymphoma cells, are resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Altogether the data suggest that the SIA-b mutant line lacks an enzyme acting late in the anchor glycolipid biosynthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1514440591,"The three isozymes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase from Escherichia coli were overproduced, purified, and characterized with respect to their requirement for metal cofactor. The isolated isozymes contained 0.2-0.3 mol of iron/mol of enzyme monomer, variable amounts of zinc, and traces of copper. Enzymatic activity of the native enzymes was stimulated 3-4-fold by the addition of Fe2+ ions to the reaction mixture and was eliminated by treatment of the enzymes with EDTA. The chelated enzymes were reactivated by a variety of divalent metal ions, including Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. The specific activities of the reactivated enzymes varied widely with the different metals as follows: Mn2+ greater than Cd2+, Fe2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ much greater than Ca2+. Steady state kinetic analysis of the Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ forms of the phenylalanine-sensitive isozyme (DAHPS(Phe)) revealed that metal variation significantly affected the apparent affinity for the substrate, erythrose 4-phosphate, but not for the second substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or for the feedback inhibitor, L-phenylalanine. The tetrameric DAHPS(Phe) exhibited positive homotropic cooperativity with respect to erythrose 4-phosphate, phophoenolpyruvate, and phenylalanine in the presence of all metals tested."
https://openalex.org/W1521640184,"We have generated and characterized three rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize different regions of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and used them to study the degradation of the receptor in the isolated perfused rat liver. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of rat liver homogenates prepared from tissue biopsies collected at various times after epidermal growth factor (EGF) addition showed that both the ectoplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of rat liver EGF-Rs were degraded with similar kinetics (t1/2 = 3.5-3.8 h at 25 degrees C with cycloheximide). No immunoreactive intermediate breakdown products were detected. EGF-stimulated degradation of both receptor domains was inhibited by the thiol protease inhibitor leupeptin, suggesting lysosome involvement in the hydrolysis of the whole molecule. To study this further, protease protection experiments were performed on endosome- and lysosome-enriched fractions isolated from leupeptin-treated livers. We found that the cytoplasmic domains of greater than 90% of the EGF-Rs in endosomal fractions were accessible to digestion when proteinase K was added to the intact vesicle populations, while the ectoplasmic domain was unaltered. In contrast, both the ectoplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of approximately 55% of the EGF-Rs present in lysosome-enriched fractions were inaccessible to proteinase K digestion in the absence of detergent. These findings suggest that movement of EGF-Rs from the limiting membrane of endosomes to the lumen of lysosomes permits the degradation of the entire EGF-R molecule within lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1543700757,"Aminopeptidase N/CD13 is a metallopeptidase found in many tissues. Aminopeptidase N activity is high in the small intestinal mucosa, moderate in the liver, and low in the spleen. Using DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from these tissues, three cis elements (DF, LF-B1, UF) were identified in the aminopeptidase N promoter. The DF region (-53 to -30) interacts with the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1. The LF-B1 region (-85 to -58) interacts with the liver transcription factor LF-B1 (HNF-1) which was detected as well in nuclei from small intestinal mucosa. The UF region (-112 to -90) interacts with nuclear factors which seem to be expressed differentially in the liver and the small intestine. Transfection of promoter deletions into HepG2 cells showed that the LF-B1 region is necessary for high expression of the aminopeptidase N gene in liver cells. LF-B1 could not be detected in spleen nuclei. In accordance with this, RNA analysis demonstrated that the aminopeptidase N promoter operating in the small intestine and in the liver is inactive in the spleen. In this tissue initiation of transcription from the aminopeptidase N gene occurs from an upstream promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1550507433,"The mechanisms which mediate deposition of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), an atherogenic lipoprotein particle, onto the vessel wall and cell surfaces are unknown. An irreversible deposition of Lp(a) may require the presence of enzymes that catalyze its binding to surface-oriented structures. Transglutaminases catalyze cross-linking of proteins as well as incorporation of primary amines into protein substrates. We studied whether tissue transglutaminase and/or activated Factor XIII (plasma derived or recombinant FXIIIa) incorporate primary amines into Lp(a). In the presence of Ca2+, Factor XIIIa and tissue transglutaminase catalyze incorporation of monodansylcadaverine or [14C]putrescine into purified Lp(a) in a specific and time-dependent manner. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that monodansylcadaverine became incorporated into the apo(a) portion of Lp(a). Lp(a) purified from five different donors showing different apo(a) phenotypes were substrates for tissue transglutaminases (TG). Western blot analysis confirmed that apo(a) was the major monodansylcadaverine carrying protein moiety of Lp(a). Tissue TG also extensively cross-linked the apo(a) portion of the Lp(a) particle. Characterization of the specificity of tissue TG showed that fibronectin, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, and apo(a) could be readily labeled with monodansylcadaverine by tissue TG, but other proteins including low density lipoprotein, IgG, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and albumin showed poor or no reactivity. Direct comparison of Lp(a) with low density lipoprotein showed that apoB 100 was a poor substrate for transglutaminases. Recombinant apolipoprotein (a) proved to be an excellent substrate for TGs in that 1 mol of recombinant apolipoprotein (a) incorporated as much as 15 mol of [14C]putrescine, which corresponded to five times the amount of amine incorporated into Lp(a). The susceptibility of Lp(a) to transglutaminases suggests a mechanism whereby the interaction of Lp(a) with surface receptors and other surface oriented structures could be enzymatically altered."

https://openalex.org/W1607577031,"Human choriogonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone. The alpha subunit comprises 92 amino acids, of which 6 are Lys residues (Morgan, F.G., Birken, S., and Canfield, R.E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5247-5258). Our photoaffinity-labeling studies indicate that several of these Lys residues make contact with the lutropin receptor and are covalently cross-linked to the receptor. Lys-91 of the alpha subunit is of interest because deletion of the two alpha C-terminal residues, Lys-91 and Ser-92, results in a significant reduction in the bioactivity of lutropin and thyrotropin (Cheng, K.-W., Glazer, A.N., and Pierce, J.G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7930-7937). To determine the importance of Lys-alpha 91, we substituted it with Arg, Met, or Glu. The resulting mutant alpha cDNA constructs were co-transfected into CHO cells with the wild type hCG beta cDNA construct. Secreted hCG dimers were assayed for binding to receptors on porcine granulosa cells and stimulation of cAMP synthesis in a murine Leydig tumor cell line. The natural hCG, wild type hCG, and all mutant hCGs recognized the receptor, although with somewhat divergent affinities. However, there was a striking difference in the ability of cAMP induction. The natural hCG, wild type hCG, and Lys-91â-Arg mutant hCG induced cAMP synthesis, whereas the Lys-91â-Met and Lys-91â-Glu mutants did not. These results demonstrate that Lys-91 is important for receptor modulation in the stimulation of cAMP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489087649,"The enzymatic degradation of the neuropeptide somatostatin was investigated in cultivated cells and subcellular fractions from rat brain. Dissociated neurones, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes obtained from rat cerebral cortex were of more than 85-98% purity as evidenced by immunostaining with antisera to cell specific markers. All of these cell types were able to cleave radiolabeled somatostatin to smaller fragments, especially cultivated astrocytes with the highest specific activity. The neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115 did not measureably cleave somatostatin. The somatostatin-degrading proteases of the cultivated brain cells could be differentiated by their sensitivity to protease inhibitors and by the fragments produced: astrocytes contain a metallo-endoprotease sensitive to phenanthroline which cleaves somatostatin at the Phe6-Phe7 and Thr10-Phe11 bonds, whereas the endoprotease(s) of neurones and oligodendrocytes was insensitive to chelating agents but strongly inhibited by the antibiotic bacitracin. In accordance with this, the bacitracin-sensitive activity was mainly recovered in the synaptic plasma membrane and myelin subcellular fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of rat cerebral cortex homogenate. However, the highest total and specific somatostatin-degrading activity was detected in the cytosolic fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1597307438,"We have previously detected a sorting signal in the amino-terminal 78 residues of rat preprosomatostatin (rPPSS) that targets the precursor into a regulated secretory pathway or pathways allowing proteolytic maturation (Sevarino, K. A., Stork, P., Ventimiglia, R., Mandel, G., and Goodman, R. H. (1989) Cell 57, 11-19). To further localize this signal, we constructed three rPPSS expression vectors that code for substitutions or mutations spanning that portion of rPPSS implicated in sorting, and the precursors were expressed in RIN 5F cells. Fractionation of the intracellular products revealed that accurate processing to somatostatin-14 (SS-14) was not affected by any of the mutations. Examination of the secreted products showed no reduction in processing efficiency, indicating that none of the mutations blocked sorting from constitutive into regulated secretion. Finally, we examined the response to two separate secretogogues, cAMP and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Clones expressing two of the three mutant precursors displayed the same stimulation of SS-14 secretion by exogenously administered cAMP and TPA as cells expressing wild-type rPPSS, indicating that targeting specifically to the secretory pathway, or pathways, responsive to cAMP and TPA was not disrupted. However, cells expressing the mutant precursor containing a substitution of the amino-terminal 34 residues of rPPSS by the amino terminus of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein displayed greatly reduced stimulation of SS-14 secretion by TPA, with a less than compensatory increase in response to cAMP, when compared to cells expressing wild-type rPPSS. In conjunction with our previous studies with anglerfish preprosomatostatins, we conclude that 1) the sorting signal(s) in rPPSS necessary for cAMP-responsive secretion are redundant and probably reside within both mature peptide regions and extrapeptide regions; 2) two or more distinct regulated secretory pathways utilized by secreted peptides can be demonstrated in transfected endocrine cells and targeting to these pathways can be separately mediated by at least two different types of sorting signals within the neuropeptide precursor itself; and 3) pro-region conformation plays little role in prosomatostatin-processing site recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1508378505,"The interactions between the endothelial basement membrane, platelets, and coagulation factors play essential roles in hemostasis. Entactin is an integral and ubiquitous component of the basement membrane. Experiments were designed to study the interactions between entactin and blood coagulation factors. We have demonstrated, for the first time, that entactin interacts with fibrinogen in a specific manner. Entactin binding sites have been localized to the A alpha and B beta chains of fibrinogen. The binding of entactin to either the A alpha chain or the B beta chain was divalent cation-independent. The binding of 35S-labeled entactin to the immobilized fibrinogen A alpha or B beta chain was concentration-dependent and saturable and could be inhibited by unlabeled entactin, soluble fibrinogen, anti-entactin antiserum, or anti-fibrinogen antiserum. In addition, we have provided evidence that entactin can be cross-linked to itself, and probably also to fibrin(ogen), by transglutaminase. These novel properties, together with its cell binding, chemotactic, and phagocytic promoting activities and ubiquitous distribution in basement membranes, suggest that entactin may play important roles in hemostasis and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2114250824,"Catecholamines appear to be involved in behavioral responses to acute and chronic ethanol consumption. Since tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine biosynthesis and is regulated by second messenger systems known to be modulated by ethanol, we studied ethanol-induced changes in TH gene expression. In the N1E-115 neural cell line, Northern and Western blot analyses showed that treatment with 25-200 mM ethanol for 3 days caused a dose-dependent increase in TH mRNA and protein levels. N1E-115 cells were also stably transfected with pTH5'CAT, a plasmid containing 773 base pairs of the TH promoter fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Subclones expressing pTH5'CAT showed ethanol-induced increases in CAT activity, suggesting that ethanol modulates TH gene transcription. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment of transfected cells with 100 mM ethanol and 1 nM to 1 microM prostaglandin E1 increased prostaglandin E1-mediated stimulation of TH-promoter activity. Similarly, simultaneous treatment of transfected cells with 100 mM ethanol and either 10 mM (-)-N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine or 0.5 mM 8-bromo-cAMP also resulted in increased TH-promoter activity compared to treatment with these agents without ethanol. These results suggest that ethanol treatment of N1E-115 cells has a prominent effect on both basal and cAMP-regulated TH expression. Ethanol-induced changes in TH expression may be a critical molecular event in adaptation of the central nervous system to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W279134281,"The flagellar creatine kinase (TCK) of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm is both a principal component of sperm tail membrane preparations and a cytosolic enzyme. An improved purification scheme identified three pools of TCK, termed TCK I, TCK II, and TCK III. TCK I and II were essentially homogeneous protein preparations, while TCK III was heavily contaminated with other flagellar proteins, predominantly guanylate cyclase, and alpha- and beta-tubulin. The three TCK species are roughly present in a 1:10:1 ratio as assessed by activity measurements. TCK I and II are similar proteins as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, partial proteolytic fragmentation, and cellulose polyacetate electrophoresis and have the same pH-dependent specific activity. However, they are functionally distinct with respect to their capacity to associate with lipids. TCK II associated readily with phospholipid liposomes and detergent micelles, while TCK I did not. Association of TCK II was as a protein monomer with an apparent Kd of approximately 1-2 mM at a 10(4):1 lipid or detergent to protein ratio. Whereas the Kd estimates were pH independent, the rate of association increased 2-3-fold between pH 6.5 and 8. The data are consistent with membrane-association of TCK II being a two-step process, involving a pH-dependent, intramolecular, TCK-specific step and a charge-facilitated, but pH-independent, membrane association step. Membrane association of TCK may, together with microtubule association (Tombes, R.M., Farr, A., and Shapiro, B.M. (1988) Exp. Cell Res. 178, 307-317) represent a mechanism required for specific accumulation of the enzyme within the flagellum."
https://openalex.org/W1673986517,"Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, an enzyme of importance in glutathione metabolism, consists of two subunits, one of which (the light subunit, Mr 22,000; residues 380-568; rat kidney) contains residue Thr-523, which selectively interacts with the substrate analog acivicin to form an adduct that is apparently analogous to the gamma-glutamyl enzyme intermediate formed in the normal reaction (Stole, E., Seddon, A. P., Wellner, D., and Meister, A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 1706-1709). The present studies indicate that specific arginine and lysine residues of the heavy subunit (Mr 51,000; residues 31-379) participate in catalysis by binding the substrates. Selective labeling studies of the enzyme with [14C]phenylglyoxal showed that Lys-99 and Arg-111 were modified. This appears to be the first instance in which phenylglyoxal was found to react with an enzyme lysine residue. Incorporation of [14C]phenylglyoxal into Lys-99 was decreased in the presence of acceptor site selective compounds. Incorporation into both Lys-99 and Arg-111 was decreased in the presence of glutathione. The findings suggest that Lys-99 and Arg-111 interact, respectively, with the omega- and alpha-carboxyl groups of glutathione. That these putative electrostatic binding sites are on the heavy subunit indicates that both subunits contribute to the active center. Two additional heavy subunit arginine residues become accessible to modification by phenylglyoxal when acivicin is bound, suggesting that interaction with acivicin is associated with a conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1518553088,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a membrane glycoprotein with type II orientation. It is predominantly localized to the apical surface in epithelial cells. Previous studies (Bantles, J. P., Feracci, H. M., Shinger, B., and Hubbard, A. L. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1241-1251) using cellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation in rat liver suggest that DPPIV is targeted to the apical surface by an indirect pathway through transient appearance in the basolateral surface followed by specific transcytosis to the apical domain. In transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using domain-selective biotinylation and streptavidin absorption, it was, however, shown that DPPIV is directly sorted to the apical surface (Low, S. H., Wong, S. H., Tang, B. L. Subramaniam, V. N., and Hong, W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem, 266, 13391-13396). These studies suggest that the sorting pathway for DPPIV may be cell type-specific, but it cannot be ruled out that the observed difference in the DPPIV sorting pathway may be due to different methods employed for dissecting the sorting pathway. In this study, we have expressed rat DPPIV, using an expression system driven by the Rous sarcoma virus enhancer and the SV40 early promoter region, in another epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1. As in MDCK cells, DPPIV is preferentially (about 90%) localized to the apical surface. Employing identical methods used previously in MDCK cells, it was found that both direct and transcytotic pathways are involved in the apical surface localization of DPPIV in this epithelial cell type. These observations clearly illustrate that the sorting pathway of rat DPPIV is cell type-specific."

Stimulation of GSH transport by phenylephrine was blocked by the Î±-adrenergic antagonists, prazosin or phentolamine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine (both Î± and Î² agonists) also stimulated GSH absorption but not to the same extent as phenylephrine. Isoproterenol, a strict Î²-adrenergic agonist, had no effect on the rate of GSH absorption. Under physiological luminal GSH concentrations, phenylephrine stimulated GSH efflux from the lumen, accumulation in the intestinal mucosa, and transport into the mesenteric vasculature. Phenylephrine did not stimulate the transport of polyethylene glycol, a high molecular weight molecule, and stimulated uptake of cysteine and glycine by 30%. This suggests that the effect of phenylephrine on GSH transport is not due to enhanced bulk flow through paracellular pathways. Studies with isolated small intestinal epithelial cells showed that phenylephrine also stimulated the release of GSH from the cells. Oral administration of phenylephrine with GSH caused a two- to fivefold transient increase in plasma GSH concentrations in rats. Phenylephrine alone or with the amino acid constituents of GSH caused no increase in plasma GSH concentration. Thus, absorption of dietary GSH is under hormonal regulation. The physiological importance of this regulation is not known, although such regulation may function to control utilization of dietary GSH for detoxication and may have therapeutic benefits for individuals with deficient GSH or increased risk of oxidative or chemically induced injury.âHagen, T.
