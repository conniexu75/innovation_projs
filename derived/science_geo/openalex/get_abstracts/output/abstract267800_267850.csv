https://openalex.org/W1993618616,"The Pioneer 11 vector helium magnetometer provided precise, continuous measurements of the magnetic fields in interplanetary space, inside Jupiter's magnetosphere, and in the near vicinity of Jupiter. As with the Pioneer 10 data, evidence was seen of the dynamic interaction of Jupiter with the solar wind which leads to a variety of phenomena (bow shock, upstream waves, nonlinear magnetosheath impulses) and to changes in the dimension of the dayside magnetosphere by as much as a factor of 2. The magnetosphere clearly appears to be blunt, not disk-shaped, with a well-defined outer boundary. In the outer magnetosphere, the magnetic field is irregular but exhibits a persistent southward component indicative of a closed magnetosphere. The data contain the first clear evidence in the dayside magnetosphere of the current sheet, apparently associated with centrifugal forces, that was a dominant feature of the outbound Pioneer 10 data. A modest westward spiraling of the field was again evident inbound but not outbound at higher latitudes and nearer the Sun-Jupiter direction. Measurements near periapsis, which were nearer the planet and provide better latitude and longitude coverage than Pioneer 10, have revealed a 5 percent discrepancy with the Pioneer 10 offset dipole model (D2). A revised offset dipole (6-parameter fit) is presented as well as the results of a spherical harmonic analysis (23 parameters) consisting of an interior dipole, quadrupole, and octopole and an external dipole and quadrupole. The dipole moment and the composite field appear moderately larger than inferred from Pioneer 10. Maximum surface fields of 14 and 11 gauss in the northern and southern hemispheres are inferred. Jupiter's planetary field is found to be slightly more irregular than that of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2022704417,"Knowledge of the positional distributions, absolute intensities, energy spectra, and angular distributions of energetic electrons and protons in the Jovian magnetosphere has been considerably advanced by the planetary flyby of Pioneer 11 in November-December 1974 along a quite different trajectory from that of Pioneer 10 a year earlier. (i) The previously reported magnetodisc is shown to be blunted and much more extended in latitude on the sunward side than on the dawn side. (ii) Rigid corotation of the population of protons E(p) approximately 1 million electron volts in the magnetodisc is confirmed. (iii) Angular distributions of energetic electrons E(e) > 21 million electron volts in the inner magnetosphere are shown to be compatible with the Kennel-Petschek whistler-mode instability. (iv) A diverse body of magnetospheric effects by the Jovian satellites is found. (v) Observations of energetic electrons in to a radial distance of 1.59 Jovian radii provide a fresh basis for the interpretation of decimetric radio noise emission."
https://openalex.org/W2045094961,"The outbound leg of the Pioneer 11 Jupiter flyby explored a region farther from the equator than that traversed by Pioneer 10, and the new data require modification or augmentation of the magnetodisk model based on the Pioneer 10 flyby. The inner moons of Jupiter are sinks of energetic particles and sometimes sources. A large spike of particles was found near lo. Multiple peaks occurred in the particle fluxes near closest approach to the planet; this structure may be accounted for by a complex magnetic field configuration. The decrease in proton flux observed near minimum altitude on the Pioneer 10 flyby appears attributable to particle absorption by Amalthea."
https://openalex.org/W2086494753,"During the December 1974 Pioneer 11 Jupiter encounter our experiment provided measurements of Jovian energetic protons and electrons both in the magnetic equatorial zone and at previously unexplored high magnetic latitudes. Many of the observations and conclusions from the Pioneer 10 encounter in 1973 were confirmed, with several important exceptions and new findings. We report evidence from Pioneer 11 for protons ( approximately 1 million electron volts) of Jovian origin in interplanetary space. In the outer magnetosphere particle intensities at high magnetic latitudes were comparable to those observed in the equatorial zone, and 10-hour variations in particle intensities and spectra were observed at both high and low magnetic latitudes. Therefore, confinement of particles in the outer magnetosphere to a thin equatorial magnetodisc is adequate neither as a description of the particle distribution nor as a complete explanation of the 10-hour variations. Pioneer 11 data support a model in which the intensity varies with a 10-hour period in phase throughout the sunward side of the magnetosphere and is relatively independent of position within the magnetosphere. Transient, highly anisotropic bursts of protons with energies of approximately 1 million electron volts observed near the orbit of Ganymede suggest local acceleration in some regions of the magnetosphere. In the inner core where particles are stably trapped, a maximum in the high-energy nucleonic flux was again found, corresponding to the Pioneer 10 maximum at approximately 3.4 Jupiter radii (R(J)), which is apparently a persistent feature of, the inner radiation zone. In addition, Pioneer 11 data indicate two more local maxima in the nucleonic flux inside 3.4 R(J), one of which may be associated with absorption by Amalthea, and a maximum intensity at 1.9 R(J) more than 20 times that at 3.4 R(J), The flux of relativistic electrons reached a maximum on the magnetic equator at 1.8 R(J), only slightly less its closest approach at 3.1 R(J)."
https://openalex.org/W2016314341,"Data obtained by the infrared radiometers on the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft, over a large range of emission angles, have indicated an effective temperature for Jupiter of 125° ± 3°K. The implied ratio of planetary thermal emission to solar energy absorbed is 1.9 ± 0.2, a value not significantly different from the earth-based estimate of 2.5 ± 0.5."
https://openalex.org/W2069234365,"A strong incursion of dust and aerosol at an altitude of 20 kilometers was noted over Baja California and southern Arizona in mid-November 1974, as indicated by bluish-ashen daylight skies and colorful twilight glows of the type usually associated with volcanic eruptions. Infrared satellite observations and reports from other sources eliminated a possible oceanic origin in the eastern Pacific. The stratum is probably from the extensive eruption of Volcan de Fuego in Gautemala in October 1974."
https://openalex.org/W2095010699,"The concentration of meteoroids of mass ~ 10(-8) gram in interplanetary space, in the asteroid belt, and near Jupiter has been measured. The data confirm the Pioneer 10 observation that the asteroid belt is not highly populated with small meteoroids, suggest that the high concentration of small particles around Jupiter is the result of gravitational focusing, and provide an indication of the mass distribution of meteoroids in interplanetary space."
https://openalex.org/W2010192622,"A preliminary account of the Pioneer 11 passage through the Jovian magnetosphere as viewed by particle detector systems is presented. Emphasis is placed on the region well within the Jovian magnetosphere using data from the LET-II telescope, which measured the proton flux from 0.2 to 21.2 MeV in seven energy intervals and electrons from 0.1 to 2 MeV in four energy intervals. The relative trajectories of Pioneer 10 and 11 are discussed and indicate that Pioneer 11 was exposed to a much lower total radiation dose than Pioneer 10, largely as a result of the retrograde trajectory which approached and exited the inner region of the magnetosphere at high latitudes. Angular distributions, calculations from Pioneer 11 magnetic field data, and the low-energy nucleon component are included in the discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2003030006,"Significantly improved values of the zonal gravity harmonic coefficients J(39) J(4), and J(6) of Jupiter have been obtained from a preliminary analysis of Pioneer 11 spacecraft Doppler data taken while the spacecraft was near Jupiter. The new results, which will have an important application as boundary conditions for theoretical models of Jupiter's interior. are consistent with a planet in hydrostatic equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1964118239,"Two additional radio occultation measurements of the atmosphere of Jupiter were obtained with Pioneer 11. The entry measurement leads to a temperature profile that is substantially in agreement with those obtained with Pioneer 10, showing temperatures much higher than those derived from other observations. The exit measurement is not usable because of the discontinuous drift of the spacecraft auxiliary oscillator, presumably due to the trapped radiation belts of Jupiter. The combination of two Pioneer 10 measurements and one Pioneer 11 measurement yields an oblateness of 0.06496 at 1 millibar and 0.06547 at 160 millibars. Measurements in the Jovian ionosphere indicate a number of layers distributed over about 3000 kilometers, with a topside temperature of about 750 K."

https://openalex.org/W2917680197,"For 2 weeks continuous imaging, photometry, and polarimetry observations were made of Jupiter and the Galilean satellites in red and blue light from Pioneer 11. Measurements of Jupiter's north and south polar regions were possible because the spacecraft trajectory was highly inclined to the planet's equatorial plane. One of the highest resolution images obtained is presented here along with a comparison of a sample of our photometric and polarimetric data with a simple model. The data seem consistent with increased molecular scattering at high latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1999546175,"On December 3, 1974, Pioneer 11 passed the planet Jupiter at a distance of 42,000 km. The spacecraft is now headed for an encounter with the planet Saturn in September 1979. The prime scientific objectives of the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 missions are discussed along with the spacecraft payload, aspects of spacecraft design, the spacecraft power supply, and details regarding the spacecraft trajectory during the approach to Jupiter."
https://openalex.org/W2091430532,"Pioneer 11 observations of the interaction of Jupiter's magnetosphere with the distant solar wind have confirmed the earlier Pioneer 10 observations of the great size and extreme variability of the outer magnetosphere. The nature of the plasma transitions across Jupiter's bow shock and magnetopause as observed on Pioneer 10 have also been confirmed on Pioneer 11. However, the northward direction of the Pioneer 11 outbound trajectory and the distance of the final magnetopause crossing (80 Jupiter radii) now suggest that Jupiter's magnetosphere is extremely broad with a half-thickness (normal to the ecliptic plane in the noon meridian) which is comparable to or greater than the sunward distance to the nose."
https://openalex.org/W1977263963,"Results concerning the magnetosphere, the magnetic field, and the radiation belts of the planet Jupiter obtained by Pioneer 10 were supplemented by the observations made during the passage of Pioneer 11. Pioneer 11 provided further evidence that the disk model is inadequate as a description of the Jovian magnetosphere. The new data have made it possible to develop a field model based on an internal dipole, quadrupole, and possibly octopole and an external dipole and quadrupole."
https://openalex.org/W1995296760,Petioles and apical regions of Phaseolus vulgaris var. Black Valentine were subjected to ionizing radiation to study the effect on the translocation process. Petiole irradiation produced no discernible effect. Inhibition of translocation to the irradiated meristems was reversed by application of the auxin naphthaleneacetic acid.

https://openalex.org/W1966623199,"Mitochondrial particles were isolated from tobacco cells in tissue cultures which were disintegrated with pectinase. The pectinase treatment of the tissue cultures reduced the dry weight of the particulate preparations and eliminated glutinous material, but caused little change in oxidative and phosphorylative activities. The pectinase apparently did not affect the enzymatically active sites of the particles."
