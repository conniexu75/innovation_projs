https://openalex.org/W2015015357,"For many years apoptosis research has focused on caspases and their putative role as sole executioners of programmed cell death. Accumulating information now suggests that lysosomal cathepsins are also pivotally involved in this process, especially in pathological conditions. In particular, the role of lysosomes and lysosomal enzymes in initiation and execution of the apoptotic program has become clear in several models, to the point that the existence of a ‘lysosomal pathway of apoptosis’ is now generally accepted. This pathway of apoptosis can be activated by death receptors, lipid mediators, and photodamage. Lysosomal proteases can be released from the lysosomes into the cytosol, where they contribute to the apoptotic cascade upstream of mitochondria. This review focuses on the players and the molecular mechanisms involved in the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis as well as on the importance of this pathway in development and pathology."

The 3,570,858 base pair (bp) genome sequence reveals a network of novel c-type cytochromes, connecting multiple periplasmic hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, as a key feature of its energy metabolism. The relative arrangement of genes encoding enzymes for energy transduction, together with inferred cellular location of the enzymes, provides a basis for proposing an expansion to the 'hydrogen-cycling' model for increasing energy efficiency in this bacterium. Plasmid-encoded functions include modification of cell surface components, nitrogen fixation and a type-III protein secretion system. This genome sequence represents a substantial step toward the elucidation of pathways for reduction (and bioremediation) of pollutants such as uranium and chromium and offers a new starting point for defining this organism's complex anaerobic respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2008127844,"Phytoremediation of highly water soluble and volatile organic xenobiotics is often inefficient because plants do not completely degrade these compounds through their rhizospheres. This results in phytotoxicity and/or volatilization of chemicals through the leaves, which can cause additional environmental problems. We demonstrate that endophytic bacteria equipped with the appropriate degradation pathway improve the in planta degradation of toluene. We introduced the pTOM toluene-degradation plasmid of Burkholderia cepacia G4 into B. cepacia L.S.2.4, a natural endophyte of yellow lupine. After surface-sterilized lupine seeds were successfully inoculated with the recombinant strain, the engineered endophytic bacteria strongly degraded toluene, resulting in a marked decrease in its phytotoxicity, and a 50–70% reduction of its evapotranspiration through the leaves. This strategy promises to improve the efficiency of phytoremediating volatile organic contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W1995486038,"Protein-damaging stresses induce the expression of ‘heat-shock proteins’, which have essential roles in protecting cells from the potentially lethal effects of stress and proteotoxicity. These stress-protective heat-shock proteins are often overexpressed in cells of various cancers and have been suggested to be contributing factors in tumorigenesis. An underlying basis of oncogenesis is the acquisition and accumulation of mutations that provide the transformed cell with the combined characteristics of deregulated cell proliferation and suppressed cell death. Heat-shock proteins with dual roles as regulators of protein conformation and stress sensors may therefore have intriguing and central roles in both cell proliferation and apoptosis. It has been established that heat-shock proteins exhibit specificity to particular classes of polypeptide substrates and client proteins in vivo, and that chaperones can stabilize mutations that affect the folded conformation. Likewise, overexpression of chaperones has also been shown to protect cells against apoptotic cell death. The involvement of chaperones, therefore, in such diverse roles might suggest novel anticancer therapeutic approaches targeting heat-shock protein function for a broad spectrum of tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2107884498,"Signal transduction and activator of transcription 3(STAT3) signaling is constitutively activated in various tumors, and is involved in cell survival and proliferation during oncogenesis. There are few reports, however, on the role of STAT3 signaling in gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of STAT3 signaling in apoptosis and cellular proliferation in gastric cancer. Here we reported that STAT3 was constitutively activated in various human gastric cancer cells and its inhibition by ectopic dominant-negative STAT3 or Janus kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG490, induced apoptosis. Furthermore, STAT3 inhibition markedly decreased survivin expression, and forced expression of survivin rescued AGS cells from apoptosis induced by STAT3 inhibition. Although some reports demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates survivin expression, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway did not affect survivin expression in AGS and MKN1 cells. Finally, activated form of STAT3, Tyr-705 phospho-stat3, was found in the nucleus of cancer cells in 11 of 40 (27.5%) human gastric cancer specimens. These findings suggest that constitutively activated STAT3 signaling supports gastric cancer cell survival in association with survivin expression.2004"

https://openalex.org/W2080501134,"We have recently reported that Rituximab (anti-CD20) sensitizes drug-resistant 2F7 and 10C9 B Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines to the apoptotic effects of various chemotherapeutic drugs by downregulation of IL-10 and Bcl-2 expression. The mechanism by which Rituximab induces downregulation of IL-10 was examined. We hypothesized that Rituximab may inhibit p38 MAPK activity that regulates IL-10 expression via Sp1. Treatment of 2F7 cells with Rituximab or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the constitutive p38 MAPK activity and resulted in the inhibition of Sp1, IL-10, STAT3, and Bcl-2. Inhibition of the Src-family PTKs, Lyn, and Src-family PTKs upstream signaling molecules of the p38MAPK pathway, by PP2, a specific Src-family kinase inhibitor, resulted in the inhibition of p38MAPK and IL-10 expression. In addition to p38 MAPK, Rituximab also inhibited NF-kappaB activity. Inhibition of the Src PTKs, MAPK, and NF-kappaB activities by Rituximab or by specific chemical inhibitors sensitized the cells to CDDP-mediated apoptosis. The above signaling-mediated effects by Rituximab were observed with similar kinetics beginning at 1 h following treatment. Thus, altogether, these results demonstrate that signaling by Rituximab results in the inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway, which in turn inhibits the transcription of IL-10 via Sp1. Inhibition of the IL-10 autocrine/paracrine loop results in the inhibition of STAT3 activity and, consequently, inhibition of Bcl-2 expression and sensitization to drugs-apoptosis. Further, Rituximab-mediated signaling identifies several new intracellular targets in NHL that may be of potential therapeutic interest for the development of new drugs in the treatment of drug-refractory NHL tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112311127,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, an observation often correlated with poor clinical outcome. Overexpression of the EGFR is commonly caused by EGFR gene amplification and is sometimes associated with expression of a variant EGFR (de2–7 EGFR or EGFRvIII) bearing an internal deletion in its extracellular domain. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 806 is a novel EGFR antibody with significant antitumor activity that recognizes both the de2–7 EGFR and a subset of the wild type (wt) EGFR when overexpressed but does not bind the wt EGFR expressed in normal tissues. Despite only binding to a low proportion of the wt EGFR expressed in A431 tumor cells (∼10%), mAb 806 displays robust antitumor activity against A431 xenografts grown in nude mice. To elucidate the mechanism leading to its unique specificity and mode of antitumor activity, we have determined the EGFR binding epitope of mAb 806. Analysis of mAb 806 binding to EGFR fragments expressed either on the surface of yeast or in an immunoblot format identified a disulfide-bonded loop (amino acids 287–302) that contains the mAb 806 epitope. Indeed, mAb 806 binds with apparent high affinity (∼30 nm) to a synthetic EGFR peptide corresponding to these amino acids. Analysis of EGFR structures indicates that the epitope is fully exposed only in the transitional form of the receptor that occurs because EGFR changes from the inactive tethered conformation to a ligand-bound active form. It would seem that mAb 806 binds this small proportion of transient receptors, preventing their activation, which in turn generates a strong antitumor effect. Finally, our observations suggest that the generation of antibodies to transitional forms of growth factor receptors may represent a novel way of reducing normal tissue targeting yet retaining antitumor activity.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; wt, wild type; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GH, growth hormone; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris-(hydroxymethyl)methane. is a 170-kDa membrane-bound tyrosine kinase that is responsible for directing the proliferation and differentiation of many different cell types (1Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the EGFR has been observed in many epithelial tumors; increased EGFR expression levels usually correlate with poor clinical outcome (3Mendelsohn J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar, 4Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nicholson R.I. Gee J.M. Harper M.E. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the receptor is often caused by amplification of the EGFR gene, an event also linked with EGFR mutation (6Frederick L. Wang X.Y. Eley G. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 7Malden L.T. Novak U. Kaye A.H. Burgess A.W. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2711-2714PubMed Google Scholar). The most common oncogenic EGFR mutation is an extracellular truncation of the EGFR known as the de2–7 EGFR (or EGFRvIII), which is frequently expressed in glioma (6Frederick L. Wang X.Y. Eley G. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphrey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 8602-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This truncation results in the removal of 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain of the EGFR and the insertion of a novel glycine, which generates a unique junctional peptide near the N terminus of the de2–7 EGFR (6Frederick L. Wang X.Y. Eley G. James C.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphrey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Although the de2–7 EGFR does not seem to bind any known ligand with high affinity, it does exhibit low levels of constitutive activation and enhances the tumorigenicity of glioma and breast cells when grown as xenografts in nude mice (10Wikstrand C.J.

Med. 2002; 8: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Potential therapeutics include EGFR-specific antibodies (14Herbst R.S. Shin D.M. Cancer. 2002; 94: 1593-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and small molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (15Wakeling A.E. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) of the EGFR. A number of antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the EGFR have now been tested in the clinic, including EMD 55900 (16Stragliotto G. Vega F. Stasiecki P. Gropp P. Poisson M. Delattre J.Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 636-640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), ABX-EGF (17Lynch D.H. Yang X.D. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and C225 (cetuximab) (18Herbst R.S. Kim E.S. Harari P.M. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2001; 1: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), all of which have demonstrated some antitumor activity in patients. The most clinically advanced of these is C225, which is currently being tested in phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of head and neck, colorectal, and non-small cell lung carcinomas and has been recently approved for use in Europe (19Herbst R.S. Langer C.J. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has been presumed that the antitumor activity of these antibodies is primarily related to their ability to block ligand binding, but other antitumor mechanisms, such as immune effector function, receptor down-regulation, induction of inappropriate signaling, and interference with receptor dimerization and/or oligomerization could also play a role. One therapeutic limitation of antibody targeting of the wild-type (wt) EGFR is that significant uptake is observed in normal tissue, such as the liver and skin (20Divgi C.R. Welt S. Kris M. Real F.X.

Phelan D. Halpern A.C. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 144: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At present, targeting of the normal EGFR seems to cause manageable side effects, such as skin rash; however, if these anti-EGFR antibodies were coupled to cytotoxic agents or radioisotopes, significant liver damage would be expected. The mAb 806 was raised against mouse fibroblast cells expressing the de2–7 EGFR and does not bind to normal tissue expressing the wt EGFR, making it an attractive candidate for cancer therapy (22Jungbluth A.A. Stockert E. Huang H.J. Collins V.P. Coplan K. Iversen K. Kolb D. Johns T.J. Scott A.M. Gullick W.J. Ritter G. Cohen L. Scanlan M.J. Cavanee W.K. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When used therapeutically, mAb 806 demonstrated significant antitumor activity against human xenografts expressing either the de2–7 or amplified EGFR (23Luwor R.B. Johns T.G. Murone C. Huang H.J.

Unlike previously described de2–7 EGFR-specific antibodies, which were all raised against peptides and are therefore specific to the unique de2–7 EGFR junctional peptide (25Hills D.

Cancer. 2002; 98: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although mAb 806 recognizes a large fraction of the de2–7 EGFR, it also binds some of the wt EGFR in tumor cells that overexpress the receptor (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A.

Scatchard analysis has revealed that the mAb 806 binds ∼50% of the de2–7 EGFR recognized by mAb DH8.3, an antibody specific for the de2–7 EGFR junctional peptide (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G.

In contrast, mAb 806 bound <10% of the wt EGFR overexpressed on A431 tumor cells compared with the wt EGFR-specific mAb 528 (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K.

It is interesting that mAb 806 can robustly bind to wt EGFR after surface coating on polystyrene or denaturation by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the antibody recognizes an altered form of the receptor (28Johns T.G.

Determination of the mAb 806 binding epitope is important for understanding its mechanism of action, as well as providing a general strategy for developing other tumor-associated antibodies. Using two independent approaches, we have identified the epitope recognized by mAb 806. Taking advantage of recently published crystal structures of the EGFR (29Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M.

The expression vector pEE14/sEGFR310–501 contains cDNA encoding the signal peptide of the EGFR fused in-frame to amino acid residues 310–501 of the ectodomain, terminating with the epitope tag. A series of overlapping EGFR c-myc-tagged ectodomain fragments, starting at residues 274, 282, 290, and 298 and all terminating at amino acid 501, were generated by PCR. After sequence analysis, the fragments were cloned in-frame into the 3′ end of the human growth hormone (GH) gene expressed from the mammalian expression vector, pSGHVO (34Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The nucleotides corresponding to amino acids 287–302 were deleted from the cDNA template encoding residues 274–501 using splice-overlap extension PCR (35Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) and the resulting fragment sequenced and subcloned into pSGHVO. Transfections—Human 293T embryonic kidney fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. The day before transfection, cells were seeded at 8 × 105 per well in six-well tissue culture plates containing 2 ml of media. Cells were transfected with 3–4 μg of plasmid DNA complexed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24–48 h after transfection, cell cultures were aspirated, and cell monolayers were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The CR1-loop (dimerization arm) deletion was generated by removing the nucleotides corresponding to amino acids 244–259 and replacing them with a single alanine residue as described previously (29Garrett T.P.

Western Blotting—Aliquots of cell lysate (10–15 μl) were mixed with SDS sample buffer containing 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol, denatured by heating for 5 min at 100 °C, and electrophoresed on 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Samples were then electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were rinsed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked in TBST containing 2.5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/ml mAb 806 in blocking buffer. Parallel membranes were probed overnight with mAb 9B11 (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology) to detect the c-myc epitope. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated in blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed in TBST and developed using autoradiographic film after incubation with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For peptide competition experiments, blots were probed for 1 h at room temperature with mAb 806 in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of competing peptide. After chemiluminescent detection, blots were reprobed with 9B11.

Bio/Technology. 1990; 8 (Correction (1990) 8, 768): 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad gene pulser transfection apparatus. The plasmid is derived from pRS314 and contains the TRP1 marker that can be used to select for yeast that have incorporated the DNA into their genome. Expression of EGFR proteins on the yeast cell surface was performed as described previously (44Cochran J.R. Kim Y.S. Olsen M.J. Bhandari R. Wittrup K.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 287: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, transformed colonies were grown at 30 °C in minimal media containing yeast nitrogen base, casein hydrolysate, dextrose, and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on a shaking platform for approximately 1 day until an A600 of 5–6 was reached. Yeast cells were then induced for protein display by transfer to minimal media containing galactose and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 24 h. Cultures were then stored at 4 °C until analysis. Antibody Labeling Experiments on the Yeast Cell Surface—Raw ascites fluid containing the c-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was obtained from Covance (Richmond, CA). 1 × 106 yeast cells were washed with ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated with either anti-c-myc ascites (1:50 dilution) or human EGFR monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) in a final volume of 50 μl for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed with ice-cold FACS buffer and incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:25 dilution), in a final volume of 50 μl for 1 h at 4 °C, protected from light. After washing the yeast cells with ice-cold FACS buffer, fluorescence data were obtained with a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed with WinMDI cytometry software (J. Trotter, Scripps University). For determination of linear versus conformational epitopes, yeast cells were heated at 80 °C for 30 min, then chilled on ice 20 min before labeling with antibodies. EGFR-derived Peptides—Peptides (287CGADSYEMEEDGVRKC302, 287CGADSYEMEEDGVRK301, and 287CGADSYEMEEDG298) were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectral analysis. Cyclized peptide was prepared by the overnight aerial oxidation of a dilute peptide solution in alkaline conditions. Linear (reduced) peptide was prepared by dissolving the synthesized peptide in aqueous 10 mm HCl. A sample of the 287–302 peptide was reacted with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid under anaerobic conditions to generate fragments corresponding to the N- and C-terminal peptides. The peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 Vydac column using an acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The authenticity of the peptides was subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. A sample of S-carboxymethylated peptide was produced by reacting the peptide with dithiothreitol in 0.5 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.6, followed by the addition of iodoacetamide. The S-carboxymethylated peptide was subsequently purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described above. ELISA—The wells of white polystyrene 96-well plates (Greiner Lumitrac 600) were coated with 2 μg/ml 501-Fc, a variant form of sEGFR501 fused to the human Fc constant region, 2T. E. Adams, E. Koziolek, P. A. Hoyne, E. De Silva, G. O. Lovrecz, N. M. McKern, A. W. Burgess, and C. W. Ward, unpublished results. in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.9, and then blocked with 0.5% chicken ovalbumin in TBST. After washing with TBST, solutions (100 μl/well) of 0.5 μg/ml mAb 806 and varying concentrations of peptides were added to the wells. Plate-bound mAb 806 was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Bio-Rad) and West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and quantitated using a Wallac Victor 1420 counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). In some assays, mAb 806 binding was analyzed using 96-well plates coated with the sEGFR501 as described previously (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Smyth F.E. Hall C.M. Watson N. Nice E.C. Gullick W.J. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore)—A BIAcore 3000 was used for all experiments. The peptides containing the putative mAb 806 epitope were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using amine or thiol-disulfide exchange coupling at a flow rate of 5 μl/min (38Nice E.C. Catimel B. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The 806 antibody was passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. The surfaces were regenerated between runs by injecting 10 mm HCl at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Flow Cytometry Analysis of EGFR-transfected Cells—Cultured 293T cells transfected with different EGFR constructs were analyzed for cell surface EGFR expression using mAb 528 or mAb 806. 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml primary antibody, in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% human serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1% human serum albumin, cells were incubated for an additional 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody at 4 °C (1:100 dilution; Calbiochem). Fluorescence data were obtained using an Epics Elite ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). A minimum of 5000 cell events was observed and analyzed using EXPO software for Windows (version 2). Identification of the mAb 806 Epitope by Immunoblotting of EGFR Fragments—To determine the broad location of the mAb 806 epitope, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding a number of EGFR ectodomain isoforms. Cell lysates containing 1–513 and 310–501 c-myc-tagged EGFR fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mAb 806. Although mAb 806 showed strong reactivity to the 1–513 fragment, it did not bind at all to the 310–501 fragment of the EGFR (Fig. 1, left). The presence of the 310–501 fragment on the membrane could be detected using mAb 9B11, which is specific for the c-myc tag (Fig. 1, right). In other experiments, we established that mAb 806 also bound the soluble EGFR501 fragment (33Elleman T.C. Domagala T. McKern N.M. Nerrie M. Lonnqvist B. Adams T.E. Lewis J. Lovrecz G.O. Hoyne P.A. Richards K.M. Howlett G.J. Rothacker J. Jorissen R.N. Lou M. Garrett T.P. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Ward C.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8930-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in Western blots (data not shown). Given that mAb 806 binds the de2–7 EGFR (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Smyth F.E. Hall C.M. Watson N. Nice E.C. Gullick W.J. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which has amino acids 6–273 deleted, we concluded that the mAb 806 epitope must be contained within residues 274–310. To delineate the epitope of mAb 806, we expressed a series of c-myctagged EGFR fragments, all terminating at amino acid 501, fused to the carboxyl terminus of human GH. The mAb 806 reacted with both the 274–501 and 282–501 EGFR fragments but failed to bind to segments commencing at amino acid 290 or 298 (Fig. 1, left). The presence of all GH-EGFR fusion proteins was confirmed using the c-myc antibody (Fig. 1, right). Thus, the mAb 806 epitope must be contained within amino acids 282–310. Furthermore, although the epitope could extend beyond amino acid 290, the 282–290 region must contain some of the amino acid residues critical for mAb 806 reactivity in this particular immunoblotting assay. Identification of the mAb 806 Epitope by Yeast Surface Display of EGFR Fragments—We used a second approach to determine the location of the mAb 806 epitope. Fragments encompassing extracellular domains of the EGFR were expressed on the surface of yeast and tested for mAb 806 binding by indirect immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. The mAb 806 recognized both the yeast-displayed EGFR fragments 1–501 and 1–621 (Fig. 2A). In addition, the mAb 806 bound the EGFR fragment 273–621, which corresponds to the extracellular domain of the de2–7 EGFR (Fig. 2A). The mAb 806 could not recognize the EGFR fragments 294–543 or 475–621 (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that at least part of the mAb 806 epitope must be contained within the region between amino acids 274 and 294 (see amino acids 282–290, identified above). Given that these two different approaches identified the same region as critical for mAb 806 binding, we were confident that this region of the EGFR must contain an energetically important portion of the mAb 806 epitope. It was interesting that heat denaturation at 80 °C of the EGFR fragment 1–501 had no effect on mAb 806 binding, suggesting that the epitope is not conformational or discontinuous (Fig. 2B). This result is consistent with our previous data, which demonstrated that mAb 806 recognizes a large proportion of wt EGFR once the receptor is denatured by SDS-PAGE (28Johns T.G. Stockert E. Ritter G. Jungbluth A.A. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Smyth F.E. Hall C.M. Watson N. Nice E.C. Gullick W.J. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Binding of mAb 806 to an EGFR-derived Peptide Containing the Putative Epitope—A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the human and mouse EGFR spanning residues 274–310 revealed that of a total of five amino acid differences, four resided within the region bounded by Cys-287 to Cys-302. This is important because mAb 806 does not bind the denatured murine EGFR (data not shown). The deletion of the nucleotide sequence encompassing this cysteine loop from the expression construct encoding GH fused to amino acids 274–501 of the EGFR (GH-(274–501Δ287–302)), completely eliminated immunoreactivity with mAb 806 after immunoblotting of transfected cell lysates (Fig. 3A, left), whereas recognition by the myc tag-specific antibody was unaffected (Fig. 3A, right). A peptide (287CGADSYEMEEDGVRKC302) proposed to contain the putative mAb 806 epitope was synthesized. This peptide inhibits the binding of mAb 806 to EGFR fragments 1–501 and 274–501 in an immunoblot (Fig. 3B, top). The presence of the EGFR fragments on both portions of the immunoblot was confirmed by re-probing with anti-c-myc (Fig. 3B, bottom). The 287–302 E"

The present study shows that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) arrests ovarian cancer cells in G1 by stabilizing the p27 protein. 1,25(OH)2D3 initiates a chain of events by decreasing the amounts of cyclin E and cyclin E-associated CDK2 activity. As a result, p27 phosphorylation at Thr187 and consequently the interaction with Skp2 are decreased. 1,25(OH)2D3 also increases p27 stability by decreasing the abundance of Skp2. It is the combined effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on both the CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of p27, and thus its affinity for Skp2, and Skp2 expression that dramatically increases the stability of the p27 protein. Similar to its effects in ovarian cancer cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces p27 accumulation in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts and arrests wild type but not p27-null mouse embryo fibroblasts in G1. Stable expression of Skp2 in OVCAR3 cells diminishes the G1 arrest and decreases the growth response to 1,25(OH)2D3. Taken together, the results of this study identify p27 as the key mediator of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced growth suppression in G1 and show that the hormone achieves this by decreasing the activity of CDK2 and reducing the abundance of Skp2, which act together to degrade p27. p27Kip1 (p27) is a tumor suppressor whose stability is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation, a process directed in part by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)-mediated phosphorylation of p27 at Thr187 and its subsequent interaction with the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein/Skp2 (Skp2) ubiquitin ligase.

Although both receptor subtypes are co-expressed in numerous cells, little is known about their ability to form heterodimers. Here we show that both receptors were co-immunoprecipitated with an ETB-specific antibody using extracts from HEK293 cells stably co-expressing a fusion protein consisting of a myc-tagged ETA receptor and CFP (ETAmyc·CFP) and a fusion protein consisting of an ETB receptor and YFP (ETB·YFP). Co-immunoprecipitation was also observed with extracts from HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing FLAG-tagged ETB and myc-tagged ETA receptors, thereby excluding that heterodimerization is mediated by the CFP/YFP moieties. Heterodimerization was further confirmed in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing ETAmyc·CFP and ETB·YFP receptors. FRET efficiencies were between 12 and 18% in untreated and antagonist- or ET-1-treated cells, indicating constitutive heterodimerization. Prolonged stimulation (30 min) with the ETB receptor-selective agonist BQ3020 decreased FRET efficiency by 50%. This decrease was not observed when internalization was inhibited by co-expression of dominant-negative K44A·dynamin I or incubation with 450 mm sucrose. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and laser scanning microscopy of cell clones stably co-expressing ETAmyc·CFP/ETBflag·YFP receptors revealed a slower sequestration of the ETBflag·YFP receptors upon stimulation with ET-1 than with BQ3020.

Although human ETA and ETB receptors share 59% amino acid sequence identity (exceeding 75% at the cytoplasmic face), both receptor subtypes couple to different G proteins and differ in their ligand-induced internalization and intracellular trafficking. Whereas the ETA receptor stimulates G proteins of the Gq/11 and G12/13 families, the ETB receptor activates mainly G proteins of the Gi and Gq/11 families (3Cramer H. Schmenger K. Heinrich K.

Its activation elicits a long-lasting contraction via an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and activation of Rho proteins (11Seo B. Oemar B.S. Siebenmann R. von Segesser L. Luscher T.F.

Gu Z.F. Hildebrand P. Jensen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G713-G721PubMed Google Scholar, 16Harada N. Himeno A. Shigematsu K. Sumikawa K. Niwa M. Cell. Mol.

For example, in epithelial cells of the anterior pituitary, ETB receptor-selective ligands such as sarafotoxin 6c, ET-3, and IRL1620 were competitors of 125IET-1 binding only in the presence of the ETA receptor-selective antagonist BQ123 (16Harada N. Himeno A. Shigematsu K. Sumikawa K. Niwa M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 22: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In astrocytes, ETA and ETB receptors cooperatively control ET-1 clearance, because only the combination of ETA and ETB receptor-selective antagonists, but not their individual application increased ET-1 in the extracellular fluid (19Hasselblatt M. Kamrowski-Kruck H. Jensen N. Schilling L. Kratzin H. Siren A.L. Ehrenreich H. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similarly, the gap junction permeability of astrocytes is cooperatively inhibited via ETA and ETB receptors: only the combined application of ETA and ETB receptor-selective antagonists block ET-1 action (20Blomstrand F. Giaume C. Hansson E. Ronnback L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C616-C627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experimental data fit well with the now widely accepted view that class A (rhodopsin-like) and class C (GABAB-like) G protein-coupled receptors exist as homo- and/or heterodimers (21Pagano A.

The cooperativity of ET-1 action on both ETA and ETB receptors may be explained by the fact that ET-1 is a bivalent ligand, which binds to the ETA receptor via its cyclic N terminus and to the ETB receptor via its extended C terminus. It might even be possible that the bivalent ligand ET-1 could mediate the formation of ETA/ETB heterodimers by bridging ETA and ETB receptors via its N- and C-terminal parts, respectively (16Harada N. Himeno A. Shigematsu K. Sumikawa K. Niwa M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 22: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T.

To address the questions of whether endothelin receptor subtypes form heterodimers and what functional consequences this might have, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with HEK293 cells stably co-expressing ETAmyc·CFP and ETB·YFP receptors or transiently co-expressing ETAmyc and ETBflag receptors. In addition, heterodimerization and its regulation by mixed and selective agonists and antagonists was investigated in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments with living HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing ETAmyc·CFP and ETB·YFP receptors. Moreover, we studied ligand-induced receptor sequestration by ELISA and laser scanning microscopy. Materials—Bacitracin and aprotinin were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); G418, monensin, and nigericin from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany); Zeocin and LipofectAMINE from Invitrogen; FuGENE 6 from Roche Diagnostics; and fetal calf serum from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). 125I-ET-1, 125I-PD151242, and 125I-ET-3 (both 2000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. BQ123 and BQ788 were from Alexis (Läufelfingen, Schweiz); ET-3 and BQ788 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Monoclonal c-myc (9E10) antibody was from Roche Diagnostics; monoclonal FLAG (M2) antibody from Sigma; and monoclonal GFP antibody (JL-8) from BD Biosciences. Epidermal growth factor receptor cDNA (HER1) was kindly provided by Dr. A. Sorkin (University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO). K44A·dynamin I was kindly provided by Dr. S. L. Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescence Labeling—ET-1 and BQ3020 (N-acetyl-[Ala11,15]6-21-endothelin-1) were synthesized and purified essentially as described (10Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar, 27Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Papsdorf G. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S44-S47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The masses of purified ET-1 and BQ3020 were verified by electrospray mass spectometry. Fluorescence labeling of ET-1 and BQ3020 was carried out by selective modification of the ϵ-amino groups of Lys-9 of ET-1 and Lys-4 of BQ3020 using the Cy3 monoreactive succinimidyl ester (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1 m NaHCO3 at pH 9.3 followed by preparative high performance liquid chromatography purification. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells (obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. For laser scanning microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. For biochemical analyses, cells were grown for 48-72 h until 80% confluence. Transient and Stable Transfection of HEK293 Cells—The procedures for the stable transfection of HEK293 cells with LipofectAMINE and isolation of cell clones expressing ETB·GFP, ETBflag·GFP, ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP, and ETAmyc·CFP/ETBflag·YFP were essentially performed as described (10Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that for the selection and maintenance of ETAmyc·CFP and ETAmyc·CFP/ETBflag·YFP cell clones, Zeocin and Zeocin/G418 were used, respectively. For transient transfection, FuGENE 6 was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer (4 μl of FuGENE 6/μg of DNA). Generation and Affinity Purification of Polyclonal Antibodies—A polyclonal NT-ETB serum was raised against a conjugate consisting of a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 19-37 in the N terminus of the ETB receptor (Swiss-Prot accession number P24530; CGLSRIWGEERGFPPDRATP) and the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). The NT-ETB antibody was affinity purified with the peptide coupled to protein-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers protocol. The antibody fraction was dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. 125I-ET-1 Displacement Binding Experiments—Radioligand experiments were performed as described (10Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, membranes (0.1-0.5 μg) were incubated in 200 μl of Tris/bacitracin/aprotinin/MgCl2/EGTA buffer containing 50 pm125I-ET-1 without or with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand (1 × 10-13 to 1 × 10-4m) for 3 h at 25 °C in a shaking water bath. The samples were then transferred to GF/C filters (Whatman) pretreated with 0.1% (w/v) polyethylenimine. The filters were washed twice with PBS using a Brandel cell harvester and transferred into 5-ml vials. Radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Data were analyzed with RadLig Software 4.0 (Cambridge, UK), and graphs were generated with Prism Software 2.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Immunoblots—HEK293 cell clones stably expressing the fusion proteins were washed twice with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1.43 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5). Lysates (30 μg of protein per lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were probed with polyclonal NT-ETB antibody (diluted 1:5000), monoclonal c-myc, or monoclonal GFP antibodies (diluted 1:2000). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (both diluted 1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cell clones were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks for 48 h to near confluence. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and finally lysed with lysis buffer (1.2 ml). The cells were then harvested with a rubber policeman and homogenized five times by passage through a 27-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged (800 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new reaction tube and re-centrifuged (26,000 × g) for 30 min. The new supernatant was then mixed with the NT-ETB antibody (diluted 1:2000) and protein A-Sepharose (3.5 mg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml and incubated for 12 h in a shaker at 4 °C. After 3 washes with lysis buffer, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer (10% β-mercaptoethanol (w/v), 4% SDS (w/v), 2% bromphenol blue (w/v), 20% glycerol (w/v), 250 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and analyzed in immunoblot experiments. FRET—Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. Coverslips were then mounted in a custom-made chamber and covered with incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). FRET analysis was performed as described (28Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nurnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), using an inverted microscope Axiovert 100 equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 objective (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). In brief, CFP and YFP were alternately excited at 410 and 515 nm with a monochromator (Polychrome II; TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) in combination with a dual reflectivity dichroic mirror (<460 and 500-520 nm; Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT). Emitted light was filtered through 460-500 (CFP) or 535-580 nm (YFP) band pass filters changed by a motorized filter wheel (lambda 10-2; Sutter Instruments), and detected with a cooled CCD camera (Imago; TILL Photonics). For FRET analysis, CFP (40 ms) and YFP (8 ms) emission without acceptor bleach were recorded during 20 cycles. Then, 60 cycles were recorded with an additional 2-s illumination per cycle at 512 nm to bleach YFP. FRET was assessed as recovery of CFP (donor) fluorescence during YFP (acceptor) bleach. The FRET efficiency E can be expressed as E = 1-(FDA/FD), where FDA and FD are intensities of the donor fluorescence in the presence and absence of the FRET acceptor, respectively. The increase in CFP fluorescence during acceptor bleach was plotted against the remaining YFP fluorescence, yielding a regression line that served to extrapolate FDA and FD. The influence of ligands on FRET efficiency was investigated by incubation of cells with 50 nm BQ3020, BQ788, BQ123, or ET-1 for 5 or 30 min at 37 °C prior to FRET analysis. To adjust the intracellular pH at 7.5 or 5.0, monensin (10 μm) and nigericin (10 μm) were incubated with neutral (pH 7.5) or acidic (pH 5.0) incubation buffer. To block ligand-induced receptor internalization, cells were co-transfected with ETAmyc·CFP, ETB·YFP, and K44A·dynamin I or incubated with 450 mm sucrose. Receptor Sequestration Assay—HEK293 cell clones (40,000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates. After 24 h cells were stimulated with ET-1 (50 nm) or BQ3020 (50 nm) for up to 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature (2.5% formaldehyde in 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 mm sucrose, pH 7.5). After two rinses with PBS, monoclonal peroxidase-conjugated FLAG antibody (diluted 1:2000, Sigma) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with 95 μl of reaction buffer (200 mm citric acid, 200 mm K2HPO4, 0.01% H2O2) and 5 μl/well of substrate solution (20 mm tetramethylbenzidine in propanol) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 100 μl/well of H2SO4 (1.5 m). The absorbance at 450 nm was determined in an ELISA biokinetics reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Laser Scanning Microscopy—Living HEK293 cell clones (100,000 cells/well) were seeded onto glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes and grown for 24-48 h. Cells were then transferred to a custom-made chamber and stimulated with Cy3-ET-1 (50 nm) or Cy3-BQ3020 (50 nm) for up to 1 h at 37 °C. Holders were then transferred to the microscopic stage and immediately analyzed with a Zeiss 510 META inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were: λexc = 458 and λem = 470-505 nm for CFP; λexc = 488 and λem = 515-550 nm for YFP; and λexc = 543 nm and λem > 570 nm for Cy3. Generation of HEK293 Cell Clones Stably Expressing ETAand ETBReceptors—HEK293 cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding fusion proteins comprising an N-terminal c-myc epitope-tagged ETA receptor, C-terminal fused to CFP (ETAmyc·CFP) or an ETB receptor, C-terminal fused to GFP or YFP (ETB·GFP; ETB·YFP), or an ETB receptor, N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged and C-terminal fused to YFP (ETBflag·YFP). Several laboratories including ours have previously shown that the GFP fused to the C terminus of ETA and ETB receptors does not alter their functional properties (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A.

Similarly, the myc and FLAG epitopes, inserted after the signal peptide of the ETA and ETB receptors, respectively, did not influence ligand binding. 2J. Jürgensen, M. Jandke, G. Papsdorf, W. Rosenthal, and A. Oksche, manuscript in preparation. In saturation binding experiments with 125I-ET-1 as radioligand at least two independently obtained cell clones were analyzed, which express ETAmyc·CFP, ETB·GFP, ETB·YFP, and ETBflag·YFP receptors individually or in combination (ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP and ETAmyc·CFP/ETBflag·YFP). We obtained very similar KD values for the receptor fusion proteins in the different cell clones (Table I). 125I-PD151242 (ETA receptor-selective) and 125I-ET-3 (ETB receptor-selective) were used as radioligands in saturation binding experiments to determine the contribution of the ETAmyc·CFP and ETBflag·YFP receptors to 125I-ET1 binding in ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP cell clones. We found that the ratio of ETAmyc·CFP and ETBflag·YFP receptors in these clones varies between 70:30 and 60:40 (Table I). Laser scanning microscopy of the cell clones co-expressing ETAmyc·CFP and ETB·YFP receptors revealed a uniform and predominant expression of both receptor subtypes in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1).Table ISynopsis of Kd and Bmax values of HEK293 cell clones stably expressing ETAmyc·CFP, ETB·YFP, or ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP receptorsKdBmax125I-ET-1125I-ET-1125I-ET-3125I-PD-151242pMpmol/mg proteinETAmyc·CFP26.7 ± 45.6 ± 0.4NDaND, not determined.ND31.0 ± 3.99.0 ± 1.0NDNDETB·YFP10.5 ± 0.96.2 ± 1.6NDND12.3 ± 2.07.2 ± 1.1NDNDETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP28.0 ± 19.513.7 ± 0.74.2 ± 0.310 ± 2.429.7 ± 7.815.2 ± 6.46.5 ± 0.611 ± 2.2a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab HEK293 Cell Clones Express Mature, Complex-glycosylated Endothelin Receptor Fusion Proteins—Prior to immunoprecipitation experiments, we verified the integrity of the receptor fusion proteins expressed in HEK293 cell clones by analyzing cell lysates in immunoblot experiments. The ETB·GFP receptor was detected with a polyclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of the ETB receptor (NT-ETB, see “Experimental Procedures”). In lysates from ETB·GFP or ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP cell clones, we detected a prominent band at 75 kDa corresponding to the ETB·GFP or ETB·YFP receptors (Fig. 2, A and B, arrow). When we preincubated the NT-ETB antibody with the peptide used for immunization, the band was not observed (Fig. 2A). Thus, the NT-ETB antibody specifically detects the ETB·GFP receptor. We further investigated the glycosylation pattern of the ETB·GFP receptor by treatment of the lysates with endoH and PNGaseF. EndoH, which removes high man-nose glycans from immature, core-glycosylated proteins did not increase the mobility of the 75-kDa band (Fig. 2B). Treatment with PNGaseF, which removes N-linked glycans from both mature, complex-glycosylated and immature, core-glycosylated proteins, increased the mobility of the immunoreactive band, which now migrated at about 67 kDa (Fig. 2B, asterisk). Thus, the ETB·GFP receptor is expressed as a mature protein in HEK293 cell clones. For the detection of the ETAmyc·CFP receptor in immunoblots with lysates from ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP cell clones, we used a monoclonal c-myc antibody. Here, we observed a prominent band at about 87 kDa (Fig. 2C, double arrow). Incubation with endoH had no effect on the protein mobility of the ETAmyc·CFP receptor, whereas treatment with PNGaseF increased the mobility, resulting in a protein migrating at about 75 kDa (Fig. 2C, arrowhead). The results demonstrate that ET receptor fusion proteins are mainly expressed in HEK293 cell clones as complex-glycosylated, mature proteins. This is in good agreement with the microscopic analysis (Fig. 1), according to which both ET receptor fusion proteins are detected at the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation Reveals ETA/ETBHeterodimers—First we tested whether NT-ETB and c-myc antibodies were suitable for immunoprecipitation experiments. Whereas immunoprecipitation of the ETB·GFP receptor was possible with the polyclonal NT-ETB antibody (see below), the monoclonal c-myc antibody was unable to precipitate the ETAmyc·CFP receptor (data not shown). When the ETB receptor was precipitated with the NT-ETB antibody from detergent extracts of cell clones expressing only the ETB·GFP receptor, in immunoblots with a GFP antibody a 75-kDa band was detected, corresponding to the ETB·GFP receptor (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts from ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP cell clones with the NT-ETB antibody and subsequent immunoblots with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody revealed two bands: 75- and 87-kDa bands, corresponding to ETB·YFP and ETAmyc·CFP receptors, respectively (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The presence of the ETAmyc·CFP receptor in the immunoprecipitate was verified by using a c-myc antibody, which detected a single band at 87 kDa, representing the ETAmyc·CFP receptor (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The 75- and 87-kDa bands were also observed using NT-ETB (Fig. 3A, lane 1) and c-myc (Fig. 3A, lane 2) antibodies in immunoblots from lysates of ETAmyc·CFP/ETB·YFP cell clones. Thus, upon immunoprecipitation of the ETB·YFP receptor from detergent extracts of cell clones expressing ETAmyc·CFP and ETB·YFP receptors, we observed co-precipitation of the ETAmyc·CFP receptor. To confirm that heterodimerization is not because of secondary aggregation of fusion proteins after cell disruption or the lack of specificity of the affinity-purified antibody, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with a mixture of detergent extracts derived from cell clones individually exp"

In this study, we determined that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) interacts with Nod2 and is required for Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation. The dominant negative form of TAK1 abolished muramyl dipeptide-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-expressing cells. Nod2, acting in a reciprocal manner, inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation in RICK-deficient embryonic fibroblasts. Nod2 appears to interact with TAK1 through its LRR region to exert its inhibitory effect on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. Further, wild-type LRR more effectively suppressed NF-κB activation induced by TAK1 than LRR with a 3020insC mutation. Considered together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for TAK1 in Nod2-mediated innate immune responses and reveal a novel function for Nod2 in the regulation of the TAK1 signaling pathway.

Activated TAK1 phosphorylates IκB-related kinase and MKK6, which leads to activation of the NF-κB and JNK-p38 kinase pathways (18Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines mediate their effect primarily by reprogramming gene expression in inflamed tissues. Among the many genes induced are those of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 (25Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Understanding of the regulation of Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation remains limited. Whether cross-talk exists between the Nod2 pathway and other signaling pathways of inflammatory cytokines is still not known. In this study, we examined the regulatory effect of TAK1, TBK1, Ubc13, Rip, and MEKK1, proteins implicated in NF-κB activation, on Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation. Only the dominant negative form of TAK1 (TAK1DN) suppressed Nod2-induced NF-κB activation. TAK1DN also inhibited MDP-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-expressing cells. In vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analysis confirmed a biochemical interaction between Nod2 and TAK1. Interestingly, Nod2 had a negative regulatory effect on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. The LRR region of Nod2 inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. This is the first report of Nod2 and TAK1 interaction and evidence of reciprocal cross-talk between the Nod2 and inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways. Cell Culture—HEK293T and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and LS174T cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium.

Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (4206) Google Scholar). The expression constructs, FLAG-Nod2 and FLAG-LRR, which, respectively, encode full-length Nod2 and the LRR region of Nod2, were generated by PCR and cloned into LPCX vector, kindly provided by Dr. Derynck. TAK1 deletion constructs encoding aa 1-303, 1-403, and 286-632 were generated by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR and cloned into plasmid vector pGEM-2 (Promega). Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST·CARD (aa 28-265), the CARD domain of Nod2; and GST·LRR (aa 744-1040), the LRR domain of Nod2 were generated by PCR and cloned into plasmid vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). Construct authenticity was verified by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pHA-TAK1 and pLPCX-FLAG-Nod2 using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). LS174T cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (5 ng/ml) for 20 min to induce Nod2 expression. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.5% Triton X-100, 12.5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with lysis buffer, resolved in 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. All immunoblots were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence imaging assay developed by Amersham Biosciences. Anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Strategene. In Vitro GST Pull-down Assay—GST, GST·CARD, and GST·LRR fusion proteins were each expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified. TAK1 proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated in lysis buffer with the indicated GST fusion proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, resolved in 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence studies, COS cells were transfected with the indicated expression constructs. To detect FLAG-Nod2 and HA-TAK1, cells were stained 24 h after transfection with anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-HA monoclonal antibody, respectively, and incubated with Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody or Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). Images were captured by an Olympus FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope. NF-κB Activation Assays—Cells were cotransfected with RSV-KBLuc (100 ng), a reporter construct encoding the luciferase reporter gene κB-luc under the control of a minimal promoter with an NF-κB-binding site; RSV-β-galactosidase (50 ng), an expression construct containing β-galactosidase; and an indicated amount of each expression construct, by FuGENE 6, in triplicate. Cell lysates were prepared 24-36 h after transfection, and the relative luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Results were normalized for transfection efficiency on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Protein Kinase Assays—Autophosphorylates of TAK1 were assayed as described previously (27Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Lysates of the HEK293 cells that had been transfected with various expression constructs and HA-TAK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were incubated for 2 min at 25 °C in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Samples were fractionated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Nod2 siRNA Experiments—A double-stranded oligonucleotide was designed to contain a sequence derived from the 5′ end of human Nod2 open reading frame (nucleotides 1187-1207): 5′-AAGACAUCUUCCAGUUACUCC-3′ in forward and reverse orientation (Qiagen). Nod2 siRNA and a control siRNA were transfected into cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TAK1 Regulates Nod2-induced NF-κB Activation—To delineate the pathways that regulate Nod2 function, we studied the effect of several proteins implicated in NF-κB activation on Nod2-induced NF-κB activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with Nod2 plus the dominant negative forms of TAK1, TBK1, Ubc13, Rip, or MEKK1. Interestingly, only TAK1DN, exerting its effect in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited Nod2-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1, A and B). The other proteins and the control vector had no effect (Fig. 1A; MEKK1 data not shown), thus implicating TAK1 in the regulation of Nod2 function. TAK1 Regulates MDP-induced NF-κB Activation in Nod2-expressing Cells—Recent studies suggest that Nod2 serves as an intracellular receptor for the bacterial product MDP (11Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan G. Nunez C.A. Janeway Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 12Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Further, MDP enhances Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation. To determine whether TAK1 regulates MDP-induced NF-κB activation, HEK293T cells were transfected with Nod2 and TAK1DN, and 8 h later, stimulated with MDP (100 ng/ml). TAK1DN effectively inhibited MDP-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-transfected HEK293T cells; the control vector had minimal effect (Fig. 2). These results show that MDP-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-expressing cells requires activation of TAK1. TAK1 Interacts with Nod2—TAK1 regulation of Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation suggested an interaction between Nod2 and TAK1. To investigate this possibility, FLAG-Nod2 and HA-TAK1 were coexpressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immune complexes were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody showed that the TAK1-precipitated complexes contained Nod2 (Fig. 3A, left). Nod2 and TAK1 interaction was confirmed by the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Nod2 and Western blot analysis for HA-TAK1 (Fig. 3A, right). To verify interaction between endogenous TAK1 and Nod2 proteins, coprecipitation studies were performed with lysate from cells of the colonic epithelial cell line LS174T and cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1. Both cell lines are known to express Nod2 (28Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 29Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-41705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 30Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). TAK1 was readily detected in Nod2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B) but not in the immunoprecipitates prepared using a control serum. These results confirm that Nod2 is able to associate with TAK1 in vivo. To localize the region of Nod2 that interacts with TAK1, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged Nod2 containing only the C-terminal LRR domain (Nod2-LRR) and HA-tagged TAK1 (HA-TAK1). Coprecipitation of LRR with TAK1 (Fig. 3A, left and right) indicated an interaction between the Nod2 LRR domain and TAK1. To confirm this interaction, full-length TAK1 was translated in vitro and incubated with GST·LRR, GST·CARD, or GST protein. TAK1 bound to GST·LRR but not GST·CARD or GST protein (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Nod2 binds to TAK1 via its LRR domain. To determine which region of TAK1 interacts with Nod2, GST·LRR fusion protein was incubated with different regions of TAK1 translated in vitro. Full-length TAK1 and two deletion mutants (aa 1-303 and aa 1-403) bound to GST·LRR but not GST (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the C-terminal of TAK1 (aa 286-632) did not bind to GST·LRR. These results suggest that the N-terminal of TAK1 (aa 1-303) is sufficient for Nod2 binding. TAK1 Colocalizes with Nod2—To ascertain the intracellular distribution of Nod2 and to determine whether Nod2 colocalizes with TAK1, we performed dual color immunofluorescence staining using COS-7 cells that were transiently cotransfected with constructs encoding FLAG-Nod2 and HA-TAK1. These cells were double-stained with anti-HA (Fig. 4A) and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 4B). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that both Nod2 and TAK1 localize mainly in the cell cytoplasm. An overlay of the staining images showed colocalization of both proteins (Fig. 4C). Nod2 Expression Does Not Activate TAK1—Because dominant negative TAK1 suppressed Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation, we tested whether Nod2 induces activation of NF-κB by activating TAK1. TAB1 and IL-1 are known to activate TAK1 and to induce autophosphorylation of TAK1 (27Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We therefore performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay to examine TAK1 activation, as described previously (27Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with TAK1 plus Nod2 or control vector. The positive control was HEK293T cells transfected with TAK1 and TAB1. TAK1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody and subjected to phosphorylation. Nod2 expression did not activate TAK1 (Fig. 5). These results indicate that Nod2 does not activate NF-κB via the TAK1 pathway. Coexpression of Nod2 and TAK1 Does Not Have a Synergistic Effect on NF-κB Activation—The requirement of TAK1 activation for Nod2-induced NF-κB activation led us to hypothesize that coexpression of Nod2 and TAK1 may exert a synergistic effect on NF-κB activation. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK293T cells with TAK1, TAB1, and Nod2. HEK293T cells transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and control vector were used as the control. NF-κB activation in HEK293T cells transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and Nod2 was comparable with that in the control cells. (Fig. 6). Further, the level of NF-κB activation in cells transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and Nod2 tended to be lower than the sum of NF-κB activation in cells transfected with only TAK1 and TAB1 and in cells transfected with only Nod2 (Fig. 6). Thus, Nod2 and TAK1 do not appear to exert a synergistic or additive effect on NF-κB activation. Rather, a negative regulatory interaction between TAK1 and Nod2 is implied. Nod2 Inhibits TAK1-induced NF-κB Activation—Research has shown that RICK is a downstream molecule in the Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation pathway (11Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan G. Nunez C.A. Janeway Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 12Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because Nod2 expression does not induce NF-κB activation in RICK-/- fibroblasts (11Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan G. Nunez C.A. Janeway Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 12Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we used these cells to examine the effect of Nod2 on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. We first showed that the level of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation was similar in wild-type and RICK-/- fibroblasts (Fig. 7, A and B), which suggests that TAK1-induced NF-κB activation is not RICK-dependent. To study the effect of Nod2 expression on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation, we transfected RICK-/- fibroblasts with TAK1, TAB1, and Nod2. RICK-/- fibroblasts transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and control vector were the control. The expression plasmids RSV-KB-Luc and RSV- β-galactosidase were included in each transfection. As shown in Fig. 7C, we confirmed that Nod2 expression did not activate NF-κB in RICK-/- fibroblasts. Further, Nod2 effectively suppressed TAK1-induced NF-κB activation in RICK-/- fibroblasts; the control vector exerted no inhibitory effect. As seen in HEK293T cells, NF-κB activation in RICK wild-type fibroblasts transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and Nod2 was comparable with that in RICK wild-type fibroblasts transfected with TAK1, TAB1, and control vector (data not shown). These results show that in the absence of RICK, Nod2 has a negative regulatory effect on TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB. In the presence of RICK, Nod2 may also suppress TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation. However, the decreased NF-κB activity is less obvious because NF-κB activation induced by Nod2 compensates for the suppression of NF-κB activity induced by TAK1. To confirm the negative role of Nod2 in TAK1-dependent NF-κB activation, we reduced endogenous Nod2 expression through RNA-mediated interference. Fig. 7D shows a marked decrease in exogenous Nod2 induced by expression of Nod2-specific siRNA, evidence that Nod2-specific siRNA can efficiently reduce Nod2 expression. NF-κB activity was reduced in LS174T cells transfected with Nod2-specific siRNA as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA, which suggests that Nod2 siRNA effectively suppresses NF-κB activation induced by endogenous Nod2 (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, TAK1 induced higher NF-κB activation in LS174T cells pretreated with Nod2-specific siRNA than in LS174T cells pretreated with control siRNA (Fig. 7F). These results show that Nod2 siRNA expression potentiates TAK1-induced NF-κB activation and further support the observation that Nod2 negatively regulates TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. LRR Domain of Nod2 Suppresses TAK1-induced NF-κB Activation—Previous studies have shown that Nod2 activates NF-κB activation through the CARD domain; the LRR domain of Nod2 does not activate NF-κB (10Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Because the LRR region of Nod2 interacts with TAK1 (Fig. 3), we examined its effect on TAK1-induced activation of NF-κB. HEK293T cells were transfected with LRR, TAK1, and TAB1. As shown in Fig. 8A, LRR effectively suppresses TAK1-induced NF-κB activation; the inhibitory effect of the control vector is insignificant. Nod2 with deletion of LRR exerts no inhibitory effect (data not shown). These results suggest that Nod2 suppresses TAK1-induced NF-κB activation through the LRR domain. Mutant LRR Less Effectively Suppresses TAK1-induced NF-κB Activation—Because the 3020insC mutation in the LRR region of Nod2 is the main mutation in patients with Crohn's disease (3Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H.

Nature. 2001; 411: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (4725) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of wild-type LRR and mutant LRR (3020insC) on the suppression of TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with TAK1 and TAB1 plus wild-type LRR or mutant LRR. Mutant LRR was less effective than wild type at suppressing TAK1-induced NF-κB activation even at comparable levels of protein expression (Fig. 8B). These results suggest that mutation in the LRR region of Nod2 may affect the ability of Nod2 to regulate the TAK1 signaling pathway. Research has demonstrated that mutations in the Nod2 gene are associated with Crohn's disease. However, regulation of Nod2 function remains unclear. In this study, we showed that activation of TAK1 is required for Nod2-associated NF-κB activation. TAK1 is known to be activated by multiple proinflammatory cytokines (18Wang C. Deng L. Hong M.

These results suggest that cross-talk exists between inflammatory cytokines and the Nod2 pathway through TAK1. TAK1 may play a role in host defense against infection. Null mutations in the Drosophila dTAK1 gene reveal a conserved function for TAK1 in the control of rel/NF-κB-dependent innate immune responses (31Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). dTAK1 mutant flies do not produce antibacterial peptides and are highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacterial infection (31Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The bacterial product lipopolysaccharide activates multiple protein kinases via TAK1 (32Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterium, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, uses the TAK1-NIK-IκB-related kinase-β/γ-IκBα pathway to mediate NF-κB-dependent transcription of MUC2 mucin, which is a primary innate defensive response for mammalian airways and intestines (33Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that the dominant negative form of TAK1 abolished MDP-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-expressing cells, which suggests that TAK1 plays an important role in regulating the host response to MDP. Further, these results elucidate a novel mechanism by which TAK1 regulates innate immune responses. The underlying mechanism involving Nod2 mutation and the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is still unclear. Mutant Nod2 is found to elicit a weaker response in NF-κB activation (3Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (4206) Google Scholar). Further, MDP less effectively induces NF-κB activation in cells transfected with mutant Nod2 than in cells transfected with wild-type Nod2 (13Inohara N. Ogura Y. Fontalba A. Gutierrez O. Pons F. Crespo J. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Hashimoto M. Foster S.J. Moran A.P. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Why a lower level of NF-κB activation leads to chronic inflammation in Crohn's disease remains unclear. In this study, we have shown for the first time that Nod2 has a negative regulatory effect on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. In RICK-/- cells, Nod2 markedly suppresses TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that Nod2 may act as negative regulator of TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation. Previous studies have shown that Nod2 expression, which mainly occurs in monocytes (10Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), can be readily detected without stimulation (10Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). In comparison, the expression of RICK in monocytes occurs only after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (11Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan G. Nunez C.A. Janeway Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Nod2 and RICK expression occur at different temporal points. Therefore, Nod2 may have a dual function: 1) in the absence of RICK, Nod2 may suppress TAK1-induced activation of NF-κB, and 2) in the presence of RICK, Nod2 may serve as an intracellular receptor for MDP to activate NF-κB. Inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide may regulate Nod2 function by modulating the expression of RICK. Emerging research has shown that TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation plays an important role in IL-1- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (34Holtmann H. Enninga J. Kalble S. Thiefes A. Dorrie A. Broemer M. Winzen R. Wilhelm A. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3508-3516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our finding that Nod2 suppresses TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation suggests that Nod2 may exert a negative regulatory effect on TAK1-mediated inflammation. The discovery that the LRR region of Nod2 suppresses TAK1-induced NF-κB activation suggests that Nod2 may inhibit TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation via its LRR domain. Further, the LRR mutant was a less effective inhibitor of TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation. Considered together, these results raise the possibility that mutations in the LRR domain may reduce the capability of Nod2 to suppress TAK1-mediated NF-κB activation, which, in turn, may lead to a dysregulated TAK1-associated inflammation. In summary, we have shown that TAK1 regulates Nod2-mediated NF-κB activation. TAK1 modulates MDP-induced NF-κB activation in Nod2-expressing cells. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which TAK1 regulates an innate immune response. These results also indicate that cross-talk exists between the Nod2 and proinflammatory cytokine pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines may regulate Nod2-mediated NF-κB by activating TAK1. Also, this is the first evidence that Nod2 exerts an inhibitory effect on TAK1-induced NF-κB activation. The LRR domain of Nod2 appears to be involved in Nod2 suppression. The ability of Nod2 to interact physically and functionally with TAK1 represents a novel interaction between a Nod protein and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Further understanding of Nod2 function and regulation may shed light on the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. We thank B. Boughen and L. Hartwig for assistance in preparing the manuscript."

To investigate the potential role of discrete nucleophilic catalysis suggested by the double displacement mechanism generally proposed for retaining glycosyltransferases, the side chain amide of Gln-189, which is suitably positioned to act as the catalytic nucleophile of LgtC, was substituted with the more nucleophilic carboxylate-containing side chain of glutamate in the hope of accumulating a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The resulting mutant was subjected to kinetic, mass spectrometric, and x-ray crystallographic analysis. Although the Km for UDP-galactose is not significantly altered, the kcat was reduced to 3% that of the wild type enzyme. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis revealed that a steady state population of the Q189E variant contains a covalently bound galactosyl moiety. Liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric analysis of fragmented proteolytic digests identified the site of labeling not as Glu-189 but, surprisingly, as the sequentially adjacent Asp-190. However, the side chain carboxylate of Asp-190 is located 8.9 Å away from the donor substrate in the available crystal structure. Kinetic analysis of a D190N mutant at this position revealed a kcat value 3000-fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme. A 2.6-Å crystal structure of the Q189E mutant with bound uridine 5′-diphospho-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-galactopyranose revealed no significant perturbation of the mode of donor sugar binding nor of active site configuration.

Oligosaccharides on glycoproteins and glycolipids distributed on cell surfaces and within extracellular matrices are known to play key roles in normal cell functions including cell growth and differentiation, recognition by the immune system, and cell-cell interactions (1Varki A.

Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Changes in the composition of these glycoconjugates are often associated with disease states, including the metastasis of cancerous cells and autoimmune responses (4Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar). They are also known to modulate interactions with viral and bacterial pathogens leading to infection and are involved in mechanisms to evade host immune responses (8Jack D.L. Dodds A.W. Anwar N.

Glycosyltransferases, the anabolic enzymes responsible for the highly specific construction of these carbohydrate structures, therefore, not only represent an attractive class of therapeutic targets but also are important tools for the enzymatic synthesis of this synthetically challenging class of therapeutic agents. Of central importance to both of these applications is a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which this class of enzyme catalyzes glycosyl group transfer. On the basis of sequence similarities, glycosyltransferases are assigned to families in the same fashion as is done with the well characterized glycosidases (11Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 12Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar); the information is maintained on the Carbohydrate-active Enzymes Server at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html. Similarly, by comparison to the glycosidases, the relative anomeric stereochemistries of the substrate and product classify the glycosyltransferase catalyst as either retaining or inverting. This analogy has led to the assumption that the two classes of enzymes use similar mechanisms to carry out their function (14Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 15Davies G. Withers S.G. Sinnott M.L. Sinnott M.L. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. Academic Press, Ltd., London1997: 119-208Google Scholar). The existing structural and kinetic evidence for both classes of inverting enzymes supports a direct displacement mechanism involving an SN2-like attack facilitated by an active site general base catalyst. Reactions catalyzed by retaining glycosidases are known to proceed via a double displacement mechanism involving the formation and subsequent breakdown of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (16Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings have, however, brought into question the applicability of this mechanism to retaining nucleoside diphosphate-utilizing glycosyltransferases since good candidates for the catalytic nucleophile are generally lacking, and in no case has an intermediate been trapped and characterized. The claimed observation of a galactosyl-enzyme intermediate on the retaining α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.151) (17Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), despite low resolution and poor structure factors, is undermined by the more recent redetermination of that structure at a higher resolution (18Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y.N. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This new structure revealed that a large portion of the active site adopts a different conformation that is inconsistent with prior proposals. The α-1,4-galactosyltransferase (LgtC 1The abbreviations used are: LgtC, lipopolysaccharyl-α-1,4-galactosyltransferase C; LgtC-25, LgtC lacking 25 C-terminal residues; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: LgtC, lipopolysaccharyl-α-1,4-galactosyltransferase C; LgtC-25, LgtC lacking 25 C-terminal residues; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESMS, electrospray mass spectrometry.; EC 2.4.1.X) from Neisseria meningitidis is to date the only retaining glycosyltransferase for which the three-dimensional structure of a ternary complex with both intact donor and acceptor substrate analogues bound is available (19Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this structure revealed that the only active site side chain suitably positioned to act as the nucleophile in a double displacement mechanism is that of Gln-189. Although not generally considered a good candidate as a nucleophile, an amide can indeed play this role, as is seen with retaining hexosaminidases from families 18, 20, and 56, in which the acetamido substituent of the substrate functions as an intramolecular nucleophile with the formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate (20Mark B.L.

Can. J. Chem. 2002; 80: 1064-1074Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a possible role of an amide as a nucleophile had been previously forwarded for the structurally similar glycogen phosphorylase on the basis of a very similar active site interaction (22Mitchell E.P. Withers S.G. Ermert P. Vasella A.T. Garman E.F. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7341-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Subsequently another example has arisen in the glycosyltransferase family 20 trehalose-6-phosphate synthase OtsA (23Gibson R.P. Turkenburg J.P. Charnock S.J. Lloyd R. Davies G.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, despite this precedent considerable doubt concerning a nucleophilic role of Gln-189 was raised by the finding that the Q189A variant of LgtC possesses relatively high residual activity, with a kcat value that is 3% that of the wild type enzyme (19Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Doubt concerning a standard double displacement mechanism also derives from the lack of success in attempts to observe a covalently bound intermediate on LgtC, glycogen phosphorylase, and other glycosyltransferases despite exhaustive studies using techniques that have been successfully applied to observe the glycosyl-enzyme intermediates of retaining glycosidases (24Ly H.D. Lougheed B. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6572Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently (and somewhat in desperation), an alternative front side SN2-like displacement mechanism termed SNi-like was proposed (19Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The SNi-like mechanism has since been suggested for other retaining glycosyltransferases, including an α-1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.X) based on a recent crystal structure in which the only residue containing a side chain suitably positioned to act as the nucleophile is that of Arg-293 (25Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negish M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate the degree of nucleophilic character contributed by Gln-189 during catalysis, a Q189E variant of LgtC was created, thereby replacing the side chain amide with a more nucleophilic carboxylate, and subjected to kinetic, mass spectrometric, and x-ray crystallographic analysis. Making the transferase more “glycosidase-like” might result in intermediate accumulation or even perhaps a more efficient enzyme. The results provide the first direct observation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate covalently bound to the active site of a retaining glycosyltransferase but not in the anticipated mode, thereby implicating an alternative candidate catalytic nucleophile. General Procedures—All buffer chemicals and other reagents were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich unless otherwise stated. UDP-galactose was a generous gift from Neose Inc. Recombinant LgtC was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli (BL21) as described previously (26Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of LgtC—The Q189E and Q189A mutants were generated using pCWlgtC-25 (26Wakarchuk W.W. Cunningham A. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a two-stage PCR mutagenesis protocol as described previously (19Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The D190N mutant was created using the QuikChange™ method. Coding (GATGCAATATCAGGATCAGAACATTTTGAACGGGCTGTTTA) and antisense (TAAACAGCCCGTTCAAAATGTTCTGATCCTGATATTGCATC) primers containing a single-point mutation were used for PCR reaction using pCWlgtC-25 C128S/C174S plasmid DNA (19Persson K.

All constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation of interest. Enzyme Kinetics—A continuous coupled assay similar to that described previously (24Ly H.D. Lougheed B. Wakarchuk W.W.

Absorbance measurements were obtained using Cary 300 and Cary 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometers equipped with a circulating water bath and a Peltier temperature controller, respectively. GraFit version 4.0 (28Leatherbarrow R. Grafit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1990Google Scholar) was used to calculate kinetic parameters by direct fit of initial rates to the respective equations. Labeling of LgtC-25 Q189E—LgtC-25 Q189E (25 μl, 1 mg/ml, in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol) was incubated in the presence of 1 mm UDP-galactose for 2 min or 1 mm UDP-glucose for 2 h to obtain optimal amounts of labeled protein. All samples were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 6 m urea and stored frozen before mass spectrometric analysis. To increase the relative proportion of labeled enzyme by “pulling” the equilibrium over, 15 units of pyruvate kinase and 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate were added to the above incubations. Proteolysis—LgtC (25 μl in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, native or labeled, 1 mg/ml) was incubated with trypsin (25 μl in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml) and incubated at room temperature until digestion was complete (30 min). Intermediate Turnover—Excess UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose was removed from LgtC-25 Q189E labeled (as determined by MS analysis) with either Gal or Glu by exchanging the labeling buffer conditions (described above) with that of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol using an Ultrafree®-0.5 Centrifugal filter device (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions to obtain a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. When labeled with Gal, the peak corresponding to labeled enzyme had disappeared after solvent exchange (∼30 min). When labeled with Glu, a significant peak corresponding to labeled enzyme was observed after solvent exchange. To this solution (10-μl aliquots) an equal volume of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (control), or 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 200 mm lactose was added. Aliquots were incubated for predetermined time periods before being quenched by the addition of 6 m urea and stored frozen before MS analysis. An observed first order rate constant for the turnover of LgtC-25 Q189E labeled with Glu was obtained from a plot of the logarithm of the relative peak height of the labeled species versus time. Electrospray MS Conditions—Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an ion spray ion source. Whole proteins and peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on an LC Packing UltiMate Micro HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) that was directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. In each of the MS experiments whole protein was loaded onto a C4 column (LC Packing, 300 Å, 1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with solvent A and then eluted with a step gradient of 60:40 A:B for 10 min, 40:60 A:B for 8 min, 30:70 A:B for 4 min and 20:80 A:B for 4 min followed by 100% B for 5 min (solvent A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water; solvent B: 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water). Solvents were pumped at a constant flow rate of 40 μl/min. Spectra were recorded in the single quadrupole scan mode (LC/MS) with the quadrupole mass analyzer scanned over a mass to charge ratio (m/z) range of 500–2500 Da with a step of 0.5 Da and dwell time of 1 ms per step. The ion source voltage was set at 5.5 kV. and the orifice energy was set at 45 V. Protein masses were deconvoluted from multiply charged species using the Analyst 1.2 software package. For each of the MS experiments the proteolytic digest was loaded onto a C18 column (LC Packing, 100 Å pepMap, 1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with solvent A. Elution of the peptides was accomplished using a gradient (0–60%) of solvent B over 60 min followed by 85% solvent B over 20 min. Solvents were pumped at a constant flow rate of 50 μl/min. A post-column splitter was present in all experiments, splitting off 85% of the sample into a fraction collector and sending 15% into the mass spectrometer. Spectra were recorded in the single-quadrupole mode (LC/MS) with the quadrupole mass analyzer scanned over an m/z range of 300–2200 Da with a step of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1.5 ms per step. The ion source voltage was set at 5.5 kV, and the orifice energy was set at 45 V. Native or labeled peptides were sequenced in the single quadrupole mode by increasing the orifice energy to 65 V. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement—The LgtC-25 Q189E mutant was crystallized under the same conditions (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5–20% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether) as the wild type enzyme and in the presence of 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and 10 mm uridine 5′-diphospho-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-galactopyranose at 10 mg/ ml. Data were collected at 100 K. Cryoprotectants contained 20% polyethylene glycol 400 plus mother liquor. Q189E crystals were of the same orthorhombic space group P212121 and had similar unit cell dimensions as with the wild type, namely a = 39.86, b = 75.94, and c = 86.91 Å. A 2.6-Å data set was collected on a local Rigaku RU200 rotation anode equipped with OSMIC mirrors and a MAR image plate detector. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The wild type structure was used as the starting search model for molecular replacement with AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) and also for refinement using CNS 1.1 (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Glutamine at position 189 was first changed to alanine in the first round of refinement and, subsequently, to glutamate. Statistics for data collection and processing are available as supplemental information. Kinetic Analysis—Expression and purification of the Q189E variant of LgtC-25 proceeded without difficulties, yielding protein that displayed the same purification behavior, yield, and CD spectrum as the wild type enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicates that although the Km for UDP-Gal is approximately unchanged, the measured kcat value of this mutant is ∼3% that of the wild type enzyme (Table I). Interestingly, this is virtually identical to the residual activity of the Q189A mutant observed previously (Table I). It might be expected that substitution of the weakly nucleophilic side chain of glutamine with that of a carboxylate-containing side chain would increase the turnover rate of an enzyme that catalyzed a reaction via a double displacement mechanism if that residue was in fact acting as the catalytic nucleophile. The observed decrease in turnover rate, therefore, indicates either that this residue is not the catalytic nucleophile or that an uncharged nucleophile is required for optimal activity on a charged substrate. The recent finding that an active site tyrosine acts as the nucleophile in the double displacement mechanism of a trans-sialidase, which uses charged sialic acid-containing substrates, supports this latter interpretation (32Watts A.G. Damager I. Amaya M.L. Buschiazzo A. Alzari P. Frasch A.C. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7532-7533Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this finding is consistent with the notion that this enzyme uses a mechanism that differs from that involving the discrete nucleophilic catalysis of a double displacement mechanism.Table IKinetic parameters for wild type and mutants of LgtCLgtC-25ActivityUDP-galactoseUDP-glucosekcatKmkcat/KmkcatKms-1μmμm-1-s-1s-1μmWild typeTransferaseaDetermined at saturating concentrations of lactose acceptor (100-240 mm).24201.20.007N/AcN/A, not applicable.

Open table in a new tab Intermediate Trapping—To further investigate the contribution of nucleophilic catalysis in the mechanism of the Q189E mutant, the enzyme was incubated with various combinations and concentrations of donor and acceptor substrates to see if any covalently modified protein could be observed by ESMS. Interestingly, incubation with 1 mm UDP-galactose for 2 min followed by quenching in 3 m urea resulted in what appeared to be a steady state population (∼10%) of protein for which the mass had increased by 163 mass units, corresponding to a covalently bound galactosyl moiety (Fig. 1B). In an attempt to increase the level of labeling, UDP-glucose was employed in place of UDP-galactose since it has a lower Km value and slower turnover. As hoped, UDP-glucose labeled the mutant to a slightly higher level (∼30%) (Fig. 1C). Incubation in the presence of higher concentrations of donor substrate or in the presence of various concentrations of the incompetent acceptor analogue 4′-deoxylactose did not increase the relative amount of labeled protein. Surprisingly, quenching the reaction with acidic conditions (phosphate buffer, pH 1.6) resulted in the loss of any observable labeled protein. This finding is unusual in that glycosidase intermediates covalently bound by ester linkages are typically stable under acidic conditions. A covalently modified intermediate of the Q189A variant of LgtC-25 was not observed under similar conditions (data not shown). Supporting the notion that the observed labeled portion of the mutant enzyme was in fact that of a catalytically competent steady state population rather than a “dead end”-inhibited population was the observation that removal of excess UDP-galactose from such mixtures by centrifugal dialysis resulted in complete loss of the labeled species as determined by ESMS. Presumably the galactosyl-enzyme intermediate was hydrolyzed in a similar fashion to that seen for the wild type enzyme, which exhibits a significant rate of background hydrolytic activity (Table I). However, because of the higher level of labeling and presumably a lower hydrolysis rate, removal of excess UDP-glucose from enzyme labeled with that nucleotide sugar allowed the isolation and observation of a labeled species that could be turned over in a time-dependent fashion by incubation in the presence of saturating amounts of lactose acceptor. Fitting the rate of decay of labeled enzyme (as determined by ESMS) to a first order rate equation allowed the calculation of a first order rate constant of 0.0016 s–1, in close agreement with the observed kcat value for the UDP-glucose transferase activity of this mutant (Table I). Finally, in an attempt to “pull” the labeling equilibrium over, the Q189E mutant enzyme was incubated with UDP-galactose in the presence of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate to determine whether the relative proportion of labeled enzyme could be increased, consistent with the labeling event being a true equilibrium process (Scheme 1). Indeed, the introduction of this coupling syste"
https://openalex.org/W2006400527,"The connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) is a multidomain scaffold protein discovered in Drosophila, where it is necessary for Ras activation of the Raf kinase. Recent studies have shown that CNK1 also interacts with RalA and Rho and participates in some aspects of signaling by these GTPases. Herein we demonstrate a novel aspect of CNK1 function, i.e. reexpression of CNK1 suppresses tumor cell growth and promotes apoptosis. As shown previously for apoptosis induced by Ki-Ras(G12V), CNK1-induced apoptosis is suppressed by a dominant inhibitor of the mammalian sterile 20 kinases 1 and (MST1/MST2). Immunoprecipitates of MST1 endogenous to LoVo colon cancer cells contain endogenous CNK1; however, no association of these two polypeptides can be detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay. CNK1 does, however, bind directly to the RASSF1A and RASSF1C polypeptides, constitutive binding partners of the MST1/2 kinases. Deletion of the MST1 carboxyl-terminal segment that mediates its binding to RASSF1A/C eliminates the association of MST1 with CNK1. Coexpression of CNK1 with the tumor suppressive isoform, RASSF1A, greatly augments CNK1-induced apoptosis, whereas the nonsuppressive RASSF1C isoform is without effect on CNK1-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CNK1-(1–282), a fragment that binds RASSF1A but is not proapoptotic, blocks the apoptosis induced by CNK1 and by Ki-Ras(G12V). Thus, in addition to its positive role in the proliferative outputs of active Ras, the CNK1 scaffold protein, through its binding of a RASSF1A·MST complex, also participates in the proapoptotic signaling initiated by active Ras.

CNK was discovered in a screen for modifiers of Ras-dependent photoreceptor development in Drosophila. CNK loss-of-function enhances the ability of a dominant-interfering allele of kinase suppressor of Ras to inhibit photoreceptor development and also suppresses the effects of activated alleles of Sevenless and Ras but not Raf (1Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of CNK greatly enhances the effect of Ras(G12V) on eye development but suppresses the effect of activated Raf. The latter phenomenon was attributed to sequestration of Raf, which binds directly to a carboxyl-terminal segment of CNK. On this basis, CNK was proposed to function as a positive element in Ras activation of Raf, and subsequent work established that CNK expression is required for Ras activation of Raf kinase in Drosophila S2 and mammalian cells (2Anselmo A.N. Bumeister R. Thomas J.M. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5940-5943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Douziech M. Roy F. Laberge G. Lefrancois M. Armengod A.V. Therrien M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the ability of CNK to enhance Ras(G12V) action in eye development was shown to reside in a CNK aminoterminal fragment that lacks the ability to bind Raf and which does not alter Ras-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (4Therrien M. Wong A.M. Kwan G. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13259-13263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, this amino-terminal CNK fragment enhances the action of Ras(G12V,E37G), a Ras effector loop mutant that lacks the ability to activate Raf and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whereas CNK does not cooperate with Ras(G12V,T35S), an effector loop mutant that retains the ability to signal via the Raf/MAPK pathway. These findings indicated that the role of CNK in Ras signaling is more complex than simply coupling Ras to Raf and strongly suggested that CNK functions in more than one pathway downstream of Ras. Drosophila CNK is a 1557-amino acid polypeptide that contains SAM, CRIC, and PDZ domains in its Ras-cooperating amino-terminal segment and a PH domain and several proline-rich motifs in its Raf binding carboxyl-terminal segment. The human genome encodes three CNK homologs (each with splice variants); CNK1 (chromosome 1) was described by Therrien et al. (1Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas CNK2 (also called MAGUIN-1, chromosome X) and CNK3 (chromosome 6) were revealed by SAM and CRIC domain Blast searches of sequences deposited in NCBI databases. Although much shorter than Drosophila CNK, human CNK1 (713 amino acids) bears the closest overall similarity to Drosophila CNK in domain structure and amino acid sequence; CNK1 also binds c-Raf1 through its kinase domain (data not shown). While attempting to define the functions of CNK1 in mammalian cells we made the unexpected observation that CNK1 overexpression suppresses tumor cell proliferation by initiating cell death. In view of the participation of Drosophila CNK in Ras signaling, we inquired whether the mechanism by which CNK1 promotes apoptosis reflects an interference with an antiapoptotic output of Ras or the recruitment of elements that participate in Ras-induced apoptosis. The mechanisms through which Ras induces apoptosis are incompletely understood (for review, see Refs. 5Cox A.D. Der C.J.

As compared with NORE, RASSF1A/C binds with much lower affinity, if at all, to Ras-GTP, but RASSF1A (but not 1C) can heterodimerize with NORE1A (12Ortiz-Vega S. Khokhlatchev A. Nedwidek M. Zhang X.F.

RASSF1 is encoded on chromosome 3p21.3 in a region that is frequently deleted in lung, breast, renal, and other tumors (13Dammann R. Schagdarsurengin U. Strunnikova M. Rastetter M. Seidel C. Liu L.

Moreover, expression of RASSF1A from the other allele is commonly extinguished by selective hypermethylation of its promoter, whereas expression of the shorter RASSF1C isoform is unimpaired. NORE1 has been identified as the gene inactivated by translocation in a familial renal cell cancer syndrome (16Chen J. Lui W.O. Vos M.D. Clark G.J. Takahashi M. Schoumans J. Khoo S.K. Petillo D.

Chem. 2003; 278: s21943Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms that underlie the tumor suppressive actions of NORE1 and RASSF1A are incompletely understood; inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex function may be responsible for RASSF1A-induced mitotic delay (23Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The ability of overexpressed Ki-Ras(G12V) to induce apoptosis is strongly suppressed by concomitant overexpression of the MST1 binding segment of NORE1 or the carboxyl-terminal segment of MST1 that binds to NORE1 or RASSF1 (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar); thus, Ki-Ras(G12V)-induced apoptosis requires the recruitment of the MST1 (or MST2) kinase. The present data indicate that CNK-induced apoptosis reflects its intersection with this pathway. CNK1 binds RASSF1A (but not NORE1); RASSF1A relocalizes CNK1 to the cell periphery, and although RASSF1A itself provokes little or no apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, coexpression with CNK1 substantially augments CNK1-induced cell death. The RASSF1C splice variant also binds both CNK1 and MST1; however, RASSF1C, which lacks tumor suppressive activity, does not augment CNK1-induced cell death. As with Ki-Ras(G12V), CNK1-induced apoptosis is suppressed by concomitant expression of the MST carboxyl-terminal segment. Moreover, an amino-terminal fragment of CNK1 that binds RASSF1A but is not itself proapototic inhibits cell death induced by both CNK1 and by Ki-Ras(G12V). Thus, in addition to its role in Ras activation of Raf, CNK1 participates in an antiproliferative output mediated by the tumor suppressor RASSF1A and the protein kinase MST1 (or MST2). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 and colon cancer SW480 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Colon epithelial cancer ColoHSR and LoVo cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 and Ham's F-10, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression Constructs—CNK1 was isolated via PCR amplification from an EST library (I.M.A.G.E.) as described earlier (1Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and was subcloned between NcoI and NotI sites downstream of a Myc epitope tag in the pEAK8 vector. CNK1 was also independently cloned from human breast and prostate cDNA libraries and similarly subcloned into pEAK8 (EF1α promoter) and pcDNA3 (CMV promoter) vectors. CNK1-(1–282) and CNK1-(199–713) were PCR-amplified using CNK1 as a template and similarly cloned into the pEAK8-Myc vector. RASSF1A, RASSF1C, MST1 (and fragments), and MST2 were cloned in pCMV-FLAG as described earlier (10Tommasi S. Dammann R. Jin S.G. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Pfeifer G.P.

Cell Death Assay—Cell death assays were performed as previously described (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr.

Transfections were performed with 0.5 μg of DNA and 3.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Dead cells were counted via trypan blue exclusion at 96 h after treatment. ColoHSR cells were seeded at 80% density in 10-cm plates and transfected with 1.5 μg of pEAK8-CNK1, 3 μg of pcDNA3-p35 and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Upon an initial selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin and prolonged selection with 5 μg/ml puromycin, established colonies were fixed with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, stained with Coomassie Blue, and quantitated as previously described (24Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—293 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of DNA (FLAG and Myc-tagged) and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Activation of caspases was inhibited by the addition of 50 μm 1–3-Boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Calbiochem). After incubating for 20–24 h, the cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 750 μl of RIPA lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS and supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For RASSF1A/CNK1/serum withdrawal studies, transfected cells were washed with serum-free medium 20–24 h after transfection and placed on either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h. To inhibit serum withdrawal-induced caspase activation, 50 μm 1–3-Boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone was included in all cultures. Lysates were produced as above. The lysates were subjected to interaction with anti-Myc antibody (Calbiochem), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). The interactions between CNK1 and MST1 in LoVo cells were demonstrated by immunoprecipitating MST1 with anti-MST1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Briefly, LoVo cells were placed in serum-free medium for 24 h and lysed in RIPA buffer as above. Upon immunoprecipitation with anti-MST, the interaction was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CNK1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). To demonstrate the interaction between endogenous CNK1 and transfected RASSF1A, SW480 cells were transfected with FLAG-RASSF1A (1 μg) cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as above. Cells were lysed 30 h after transfection in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture tablet). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of anti-CNK1 monoclonal antibody or anti-FLAG for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered using goat anti-mouse beads followed by four washes and resolved on SDS-PAGE. To determine the presence of CNK1 in various colon cancer cell lines, 107 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-CNK1 antibody (Transduction Labs). Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Analysis—We used the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA coding the full-length CNK1 was cloned in the pACTII plasmid; this recombinant plasmid was transformed into AH109 yeast reporter strain, which was then used as a host cell for sequential co-transformation of the following cDNAs cloned in the pAS vector: NORE1, RASSF1A, RASSF1C, MST1, Rap1b, or RalA. Cotransformants were selected in SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine (QDO). Yeast α-galactosidase activity, expressed from the MEL1 gene in response to GAL4 activation, was determined in plates containing X-Gal (2 mg/ml) as a chromogenic substrate. Immunocytochemistry—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and expression constructs as above on cover slips coated with 0.01% w/v poly-l-lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in each well of a 6-well plate. At the time points indicated in the figure legend, the cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. The fixed cells were washed with PBS, quenched with 0.1 m NH4Cl, and washed with PBS again. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin-supplemented PBS, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies; after incubation with fluorescent agent-conjugated secondary antibodies, the cells were exposed to 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl to label nuclei. The cover slips were mounted on slides with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences). The samples were then examined by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). Transient overexpression of CNK1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells induces cell death, a response that is not seen with transient expression of a wide selection of other multidomain scaffold proteins (Fig. 1A). Cell death induced by CNK1 is comparable in magnitude to that seen with overexpression of p53 or caspase 3 and can be suppressed by coexpression with the baculoviral general caspase inhibitor, p35, or with dominant-interfering mutants of caspase 9 or caspase 3, whereas similar mutants of caspases 6, 7, and 8 are without effect (Fig. 1, B and C). Antiproliferative activity of CNK1 can also be seen by inhibition of tumor cell colony formation after stable transfection. Although normally present in the human colon (data not shown), CNK1 is variably expressed by human colon carcinoma cell lines. In one line, ColoHSR, CNK1 was not detectable by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Transfection of ColoHSR with an expression construct encoding GFP and a selectable marker yielded a large number of stably expressing colonies, whereas transfection of an expression construct encoding CNK1 and the selectable marker yielded a dramatically reduced number of colonies; cotransfection of a gene encoding the baculoviral caspase-inhibitor p35 resulted in a colony density comparable with that found in cells transfected with GFP instead of CNK1 (Fig. 2, B and C). The participation of Drosophila CNK in Ras signal transduction led us to inquire whether the mechanism of CNK1-induced apoptosis is related to that responsible for Ras(G12V)-induced cell death. We recently showed that Ki-Ras(G12V)-induced apoptosis in 293 cells requires the recruitment of the proapoptotic kinase, MST1 (or MST2) (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 26Brooks D.G. James R.M. Patek C.E. Williamson J. Arends M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MST1 and MST2 bind through their carboxyl terminus to the proteins of the NORE/RASSF1 family. The latter all share a homologous Ras association domain followed by a conserved carboxyl-terminal tail; MST1 and MST2 bind to this conserved NORE/RASSF1 carboxyl-terminal segment. Ki-Ras(G12V)-induced cell death can be strongly inhibited by coexpression with a carboxyl-terminal noncatalytic fragment of MST1, which binds endogenous NORE/RASSF1 polypeptides (GST-MST1-(456–487)) (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, CNK1-induced apoptosis is also strongly inhibited by coexpression with this carboxyl-terminal fragment of MST1, indicating that the recruitment of MST1 or -2 is involved in CNK1-induced apoptosis. We, therefore, examined the ability of CNK1 to interact with MST1/2, NORE, RASSF1, and related polypeptides. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, CNK1 associated with RASSF1A and RASSF1C but not with NORE or MST1(K/R) (Fig. 3B). The ability of CNK1 to bind RASSF1A was confirmed by coexpression in 293 cells (Fig. 3C); coprecipitation of recombinant CNK1 and RASSF1A is readily observed and is strikingly enhanced after 24 h of serum deprivation (Fig. 3C). Similarly, CNK1 endogenous to SW480 colon cancer cells can be coprecipitated with recombinant RASSF1A (Fig. 3D). Moreover, although CNK1 does not associate with MST1 in the two-hybrid assay, recombinant CNK1 coprecipitates both MST1 and MST2 during transient expression, and deletion of the MST1 carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil (so called SARAH) domain, which is responsible both for MST dimerization and association with the RASSF1 polypeptides, prevents MST co-precipitation with CNK1 (Fig. 3E). In addition, endogenous MST1 immunoprecipitated from the human colon carcinoma line LoVo contains endogenous CNK1, and the abundance of CNK1 in the MST1 immunoprecipitate is greatly increased after overnight serum withdrawal (Fig. 3F). Recombinant CNK1 exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution when expressed alone (Fig. 4A), whereas recombinant RASSF1A exhibits an asymmetric peripheral localization (Fig. 4B). When coexpressed with RASSF1A, CNK1 redistributes to a submembranous region and exhibits essentially complete colocalization with RASSF1A (Fig. 4C). The results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 strongly support the conclusion that RASSF1 polypeptides form a complex with CNK1 in vivo and couple the proapoptotic kinase MST1 to CNK1. As regards the site of RASSF1A binding on CNK1, an amino terminal CNK1-(1–282) fragment and the fragment CNK1-(77–279) encompassing the CRIC and PDZ domains bind RASSF1A as well as full-length CNK1; CNK1-(199–713) also exhibits modest binding of RASSF1A, whereas the carboxyl-terminal fragment CNK1-(279–713), which lacks the PDZ domain, shows no binding of RASSF1A (Fig. 5A). Thus robust binding of RASSF1A requires the CNK1 sequences 77–199, encompassing the CRIC and PDZ domains. Moreover, despite the modest binding of RASSF1A to CNK1-(199–713), which contains the PDZ but not the CRIC domain, neither the PDZ nor CRIC domains expressed individually show any binding of RASSF1A (data not shown). As shown previously (3Douziech M. Roy F. Laberge G. Lefrancois M. Armengod A.V. Therrien M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), c-Raf1 binds to a carboxyl-terminal region of CNK1 (Fig. 5B), entirely distinct from RASSF1A.Fig. 5Localization of the RASSF1A and c-Raf1 binding regions on CNK1. A, RASSF1A binds the CNK1 amino terminal segment between amino acids 77–199. Myc-tagged CNK1 and CNK1 fragments were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged RASSF1A in 293 cells, which were lysed in RIPA buffer 24 h after transfection. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-FLAG antibody. The lower panels represent lane loading controls. IP, immunoprecipitation; TL, total lysate. B, c-Raf1 binds the CNK1 carboxyl-terminal. GST-c-Raf1 was coexpressed in 293 cells with Myc vector or with the Myc-CNK1 constructs indicated. The GSH-agarose isolates were blotted for Myc (upper panel), and lysate expression of the GST-Raf and Myc-CNK1 polypeptides is shown in the middle and lower panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next inquired as to whether RASSF1A or -C alter the ability of CNK1 to promote apoptosis. Whereas transient expression of CNK1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells gives a reproducible increase in cell death, neither RASSF1A nor RASSF1C causes cell death beyond that seen with vector alone (Fig. 6A); nevertheless, coexpression of CNK1 with RASSF1A results in an increase in cell death far beyond that seen with CNK1 alone, whereas RASSF1C does not alter the extent of CNK1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Thus, although both RASSF1A and RASSF1C bind to CNK1 (and to MST1/2), only RASSF1A, the isoform that exhibits tumor suppressor activity, collaborates with CNK1 to promote apoptosis. The ability of CNK1 to bind RASSF1A is not sufficient to enable CNK1 to induce apoptosis inasmuch as the amino terminal CNK1 fragment (1–282), which binds RASSF1A, is not proapoptotic (Fig. 6B). By contrast, the CNK1 fragment (199–713), which exhibits a modest ability to bind RASSF1A (Fig. 5A) is proapototic. It is likely that the ability of CNK1-(199–713) to induce apoptosis is dependent on its ability to bind RASSF1A inasmuch as concomitant overexpression of CNK1-(1–282) with CNK1-(199–713) entirely blocks CNK1-(199–713)-induced apoptosis. Moreover, CNK1-(1–282) also blocks Ki-Ras(G12V)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). Thus, the ability of CNK1 to induce apoptosis appears to require the recruitment of an RASSF1A·MST complex through its amino terminal region together with an as yet unidentified effector that binds to its carboxyl-terminal segment. This report demonstrates that the human scaffold protein CNK1, a c-Raf1 binding protein homologous to a Drosophila protein necessary for Ras-induced Raf activation, binds the human tumor suppressor RASSF1A and activates cell death during transient overexpression and when stably reintroduced into human tumor cell lines. The CNK1-induced cell death requires the recruitment of the kinase MST1 or MST2, which is achieved because of the stable association of these kinases with RASSF1 polypeptides. The mechanism by which MST1/2 recruitment initiates cell death is not known, although previous work indicated that membrane localization of MST1 enhances its proapoptotic efficacy (7Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The requirement for MST1 in the induction of cell death in 293 cells is also shared by Ki-Ras(G12V), which can recruit MST1 directly in a complex with the Ras-GTP-binding protein, NORE. RASSF1A/C, although possessed of a canonical RA domain, exhibits little or no ability to bind Ras-GTP directly, certainly in comparison to NORE (12Ortiz-Vega S. Khokhlatchev A. Nedwidek M. Zhang X.F. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Avruch J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that CNK1 provides another mechanism by which MST1 can be functionally coupled to Ras through a RASSF1A/CNK1 adaptor. It should be emphasized, however, that our ability to demonstrate a physical association between Ras and CNK1 has been inconsistent. Coprecipitation of recombinant CNK1 with Ki-Ras(G12V) has been observed repeatedly but not reproducibly; conversely, we have never detected an association of CNK1 with Ha-Ras(G12V) or other small GTPases in the Ras subfamily. In addition, the extent to which the association of RASSF1A with CNK1 or MST1 contributes to the RASSF1A tumor suppressive function remains to be established. The present demonstration that CNK1 binds the tumor suppressor protein RASSF1A and promotes apoptosis when overexpressed through a pathway that depends on RASSF1A and the MST1 or MST2 kinases represents the fourth signal transduction pathway with which CNK1 has been shown to participate. In addition to its necessary role in the Ras-dependent activation of c-Raf1 (2Anselmo A.N. Bumeister R. Thomas J.M. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5940-5943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Douziech M. Roy F. Laberge G. Lefrancois M. Armengod A.V. Therrien M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the PH domain of human CNK1 has recently been shown to bind specifically to the GTP-liganded form of Rho and to be necessary for Rho activation of transcription through the serum response element, although dispensable for Rho recruitment of the actin cytoskeleton (27Jaffe A.B. Aspenstrom P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 15: 1736-1746Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human CNK1 also binds RalGDS, the guanyl nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the RalA/B GTPases (27Jaffe A.B. Aspenstrom P. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 15: 1736-1746Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Lanigan T.M. Liu A. Huang Y.Z. Mei L. Margolis B. Guan K.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); similarly, CNK2 has been shown to interact with Rlf, another GEF for RalA/B, as well as to RalA itself. Both RalGDS and Rlf bind preferentially to the GTP-liganded forms of Ras and are considered potential Ras effectors (29Herrmann C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar); however, the significance of CNK1/2 to RalA/B signaling remains to be established. Scaffold proteins are thought to facilitate rapid and accurate transmission of intracellular signals, and two primary mechanisms are recognized. Proteins such as Ste5p and Pbs2p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or kinase suppressor of Ras, MP1, and JIP-1 in mammalian cells assemble functionally interdependent and/or sequential elements in a single signaling pathway (31van Drogen F. Peter M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 53-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Nguyen A. Burack W.R. Stock J.L. Kortum R. Chaika O.V. Afkarian M. Muller W.J. Murphy K.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In contrast, INAD assembles a set of diverse effectors that signal downstream in a parallel and largely independent way that in aggregate produces a major part of the characteristic features of the cellular program of photoreceptor activation (36Tsunoda S. Zuker C.S. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ability of CNK1 to positively regulate c-Raf1 and to bind RalGDS and RhoGTP may reflect a similar example of the integration of proliferative signals downstream of Ras-GTP. The present results unveil a third mode of scaffold function through the ability of CNK1 to independently bind fundamentally opposing effectors Raf and RASSF1A. Raf is a major proliferative and anti-apoptotic effector of Ras; the ability of CNK1-(1–282) to suppress Ki-Ras(G12V)-induced apoptosis indicates that CNK1, probably through its ability to bind RASSF1A, can mediate Ki-Ras-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, the physiologic context wherein CNK1 acts as a proapoptotic effector is not known; specifically, it is unclear whether Ki-Ras(G12V)- or CNK1-induced apoptosis reflects the direct recruitment of an apoptotic signaling pathway or the interference by these elements when overexpressed with a critical cell function resulting in the secondary activation of a proapoptotic checkpoint response. Similarly, the mode of action of RASSF1A as a tumor suppressor is not entirely clear. RASSF1A, in addition to its ability to delay progression through G1 (22Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T. Pestell R. White M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to be an inhibitor of mitotic progression in mammalian cells, apparently acting as a direct inhibitor of anaphase-promoting complex function (23Song M.S. Song S.J. Ayad N.G. Chang J.S. Lee J.H. Hong H.K. Lee H. Choi N. Kim J. Kim H. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Kirschner M.W. Lim D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The protein kinase(s) MST1/2, constitutive partners of the RASSF1 polypeptides in mammalian cells, are also antiproliferative, at least in Drosophila, and proapototic during both Drosophila development (37Pantalacci S. Tapon N. Leopold P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 38Udan R.S. Kango-Singh M. Nolo R. Tao C. Halder G. Nat.

Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the Drosophila genome does not encode a structural homolog of RASSF1, it will be of interest to determine whether Drosophila CNK interacts with Drosophila MST (hippo) through another polypeptide, such as the hippo partner, Salvador (43Tapon N. Harvey K.F. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Schiripo T.A. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2002; 110: 467-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whether the CNK1/RASSF1A interaction acts physiologically to delay cell cycle progression, initiate apoptosis, or both, such actions are clearly opposing and essentially incompatible with the proliferative actions directed by activated Ki-Ras. It is likely that this dual function of CNK1 is essential to ensuring the transmission of a single output, appropriate to the overall physiologic program. An understanding of the biochemical mechanisms that enable CNK to function in both proliferative and antiproliferative pathways will clarify the operation of Ras in normal development as well as in neoplastic transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2018656850,"Previous studies indicated that treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced phosphorylation of Ser-985 at the juxtamembrane of c-Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and this was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met. However, the regulatory mechanisms and the biological significance of the Ser-985 phosphorylation in c-Met remain unknown. When A549 human lung cancer cells were exposed to oxidative stress with H2O2, H2O2 treatment induced phosphorylation of Ser-985, but this was abrogated by an inhibitor for protein kinase C (PKC). Likewise, treatment of cells with NaF (an inhibitor of protein phosphatases) allowed for phosphorylation of Ser-985, and a protein phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser-985 was identified to be protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The effects of PKC inhibitors revealed that PKCδ and -ϵ were responsible for the Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met, and pull-down analysis indicated that associations of PKCδ and -ϵ with c-Met may be involved in the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. Instead, PP2A was constitutively associated with c-Met, whereas its activity to dephosphorylate Ser-985 of c-Met was decreased when cells were exposed to H2O2. Addition of HGF to A549 cells in culture induced c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, the result being mitogenic response and cell scattering. In contrast, in the presence of H2O2 stress, HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was largely suppressed with a reciprocal relationship to Ser-985 phosphorylation, and this event was associated with abrogation of cellular responsiveness to HGF. These results indicate that Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met is bi-directionally regulated through PKC and PP2A, and the Ser-985 phosphorylation status may provide a unique mechanism that confers cellular responsiveness/unresponsivenss to HGF, depending on extracellular conditions.

The c-Met receptor is a heterodimeric protein composed of extracellular α-chain and membrane-spanning β-chain, which contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Specific binding of HGF to the c-Met receptor activates tyrosine kinase activity, thereby facilitating phosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine residues, so-called multifunctional docking sites (10Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 11Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E161-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain, the β-chain contains a juxtamembrane domain of 47 amino acid residues, which is highly conserved in distinct species (12Lee C.C. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19457-19461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that a serine residue at position 985, which resides in the juxtamembrane domain of c-Met, is phosphorylated by treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator for protein kinase C (PKC). Most interesting, Ser-985 phosphorylation was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Met receptor (13Gandino L. Longati P. Medico E. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, neither regulatory mechanisms nor the biological significance of the Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met has been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the phosphorylation status of juxtamembrane Ser-985 of the c-Met receptor is bidirectionally regulated through reverse activities of PKCδ/ϵ and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Likewise, oxidative stress in cells induced PKC-mediated Ser-985 phosphorylation, and this was associated with inhibition of c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent biological responses upon HGF stimulus. Our observations mean that the Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met mediated via PKCs and PP2A provides a unique mechanism, which confers cellular responsiveness/unresponsiveness to HGF, depending on the extracellular environment and conditions. Materials—A polyclonal anti-human c-Met antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Met (pY1234/1235) antibody, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-PP2A antibodies, recombinant PKC isoforms, recombinant protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) proteins were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. A polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Met (pY1365) antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). A monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody and monoclonal anti-PKC antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), KN-62, Gö6976, Gö6983, calyculin A, and cyclosporin A were from Calbiochem. TO-PRO-3 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). A polyclonal anti-phospho-Ser-985 c-Met antibody against synthetic peptide corresponding to the 11 amino acid sequence at the juxtamembrane domain of c-Met (amino acids 978–988) was raised in rabbit wherein Ser-985 was phosphorylated. The antibody was purified using an affinity column immobilized with the antigenic peptide. Cell Culture—A549 cells obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin and then incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with antibodies and precipitated by protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. These immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, blotted with antibodies at room temperature for 2 h, and subsequently labeled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting signals were detected by using ECL immunoblotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling—Cells were stimulated 10 ng/ml HGF for 12 h with or without 0.5 mm H2O2 and labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd during the last 2 h of the culture period. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3 min. Cells were further treated with 2 m HCl for 15 min and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, these cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody for 2 h and subsequently with fluorescence labeled second antibody for 1 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the nuclei were then stained with TO-PRO-3. The number of cells stained positively for BrdUrd and nuclei was counted using fluorescence microscopy. Protein Kinase C Assay—Immunoprecipitated c-Met from nonstimulated A549 cells were incubated with recombinant PKC isoforms in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Ser-985 c-Met antibody. Changes in PKC activity were assayed by measuring the transfer of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP to the synthetic peptide corresponding to the 11 amino acid residues of c-Met (amino acids 978–988), including Ser-985. Immunoprecipitated PKC isoforms from HGF- or H2O2-stimulated A549 cells were incubated with the substrate peptide in the reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of the [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was transferred onto a P-81 phosphocellulose paper, and this paper was washed three times for 5 min with 0.75% phosphoric acid. The radioactivity on the paper was measured in a scintillation counter. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Ser-985 of the c-Met receptor was phosphorylated by treatment of the cells with 25 mm NaF for 10 min. Ser-985-phosphorylated c-Met was immunoprecipitated from the cells by using an anti-c-Met antibody, and incubated with recombinant PP1 and PP2A in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2 (pH 7.5)), respectively, at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting by using anti-phospho-Ser-985 antibody. Inhibition of Cellular Response to HGF by H2O2—Oxidative stress induces growth arrest in proliferating cells (14Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We first asked whether the mitogenic stimulus of HGF was influenced under oxidative stress. DNA synthesis was measured by Br-dUrd incorporation into A549 cells cultured in the absence or presence of HGF and/or H2O2 (Fig. 1). In the control culture, the number of cells labeled with BrdUrd reached 32%. When the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 for 12 h, numbers of BrdUrd-positive cells decreased to 4%, indicating that serum-dependent proliferation of cells was strongly inhibited by H2O2. On the other hand, addition of HGF (10 ng/ml) stimulated BrdUrd labeling to 60%, indicating that HGF exerts mitogenic activity for A549 cells even in the presence of fetal bovine serum. However, exposure of the cells to H2O2 in the presence of HGF inhibited BrdUrd uptake to a level similar to that seen in cells treated with H2O2. These results demonstrate that the mitogenic stimulus of HGF, as well as serum components, was down-regulated by H2O2. Because cell scattering is a unique biological response through activation of the c-Met receptor and serum components do not induce cell scattering for A549 cells (see below), we also asked if the cell scattering induced by HGF is influenced under the oxidative stress. A549 cells were cultured under the absence or presence of HGF and/or H2O2 for 12 h (Fig. 1B). HGF (10 ng/ml) significantly induced scattering of cells, although it was inhibited in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2. Addition of H2O2 alone did not induce cell scattering. Taken together, in addition to the mitogenic response, H2O2 treatment diminished biological responses to HGF in A549 cells. PKC-mediated Ser-985 Phosphorylation Under H2O2 Stress—To search for mechanisms by which H2O2 treatment suppressed biological responses to HGF in A549 cells, we focused on the Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Met receptor, because phosphorylation of Ser-985 induced by TPA treatment was associated with suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Met receptor (13Gandino L. Longati P. Medico E. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To specifically detect phosphorylated Ser-985, we prepared a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide (amino acids 978–988 in the c-Met), which contains phosphorylated Ser-985. A549 cells were treated with or without TPA, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation for c-Met and subsequent Western blot with anti-phosphorylated Ser-985 antibody. The positive signal was detectable only in TPA-treated cells (Fig. 2A, left panel), and reprobing with anti-c-Met antibody indicated that the positive signal for phosphorylated Ser-985 coincided with the size of the c-Met β-chain (Fig. 2A, right panel). The c-Met receptor was then immunoprecipitated, incubated with or without λ protein phosphatase, and analyzed by Western blots using anti-phosphorylated Ser-985 antibody (Fig. 2B). The immunoreactive band for phosphorylated Ser-985 was diminished when the immunoprecipitate was treated with λ protein phosphatase. Moreover, when the antibody was preadsorbed with phosphorylated Ser-985 antigenic peptide, the specific band corresponding to the phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met seen in TPA-treated cells was not detectable (Fig. 2C, middle panel). In contrast, the antibody preadsorbed with nonphosphorylated antigenic peptide was reactive to phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met from TPA-treated cells (Fig. 2C, right panel). Thus the antibody is highly specific for the phosphorylated Ser-985 of the c-Met receptor. By using specific antibodies, phosphorylation of tyrosines and Ser-985 of c-Met was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blots (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was induced within 5 min with HGF stimulus; however, the phosphorylation level strongly decreased when the cells were pretreated with H2O2 for 60 min prior to HGF stimulus (Fig. 3A, upper panel). In contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met, Ser-985 was not phosphorylated by HGF but was strongly phosphorylated in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Therefore, H2O2 stimulus induces Ser-985 phosphorylation, and Ser-985 phosphorylation is reciprocally associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the c-Met receptor. When cells were treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 alone, phosphorylation of Ser-985 was within 10 min and was decreased but evidently sustained until 120 min after exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Ser-985 phosphorylation was induced by 0.1 mm H2O2 and increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, Ser-985 phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by BIM (an inhibitor of PKC), indicating that PKC is involved in H2O2-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D). Reprobing of Western blots with anti-c-Met antibody revealed that the c-Met level was mostly equal at each immunoprecipitation procedure. These results indicate that changes in phosphorylation levels of Ser-985 and tyrosine residues in c-Met by H2O2 and HGF could be attributed to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events and that PKC is responsible for H2O2-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation. Transient Phosphorylation of Ser-985 by HGF Stimulus—Because PKCs are downstream signal transducers of c-Met following HGF stimulus, we speculated that the HGF stimulus would induce Ser-985 phosphorylation to some extent even without H2O2 treatment. When cells were treated with HGF for 10 min, Ser-985 was weakly phosphorylated in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In the time course experiment (Fig. 4B), Ser-985 phosphorylation was detected within 10 min by stimulus with 10 ng/ml HGF and sustained for up to 60 min; however, it disappeared 120 min after the stimulus. When the same immunoblots were reprobed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4B, middle panel), c-Met was tyrosine-phosphorylated within 1 min and then gradually increased until 60 min after the stimulus. Thereafter, the tyrosine phosphorylation level slightly declined in parallel to a slight decrease in the expression level of c-Met but remained at a high level until 120 min after the stimulus. Taken together with the finding that HGF stimulus allows for a mitogenic response in A549 cells in the absence of H2O2, these results indicate that HGF weakly induces Ser-985 phosphorylation at least to some extent, but it is transient and allows for HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met, which is capable of inducing a mitogenic stimulus. When phosphorylation levels of Ser-985 induced by HGF and TPA were compared, Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by HGF was much weaker than that induced by TPA (Fig. 4C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was induced by HGF, whereas when cells were simultaneously treated with HGF and TPA, HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was much weaker than that seen with HGF alone (Fig. 4C). Thus, the level of HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was again in a reciprocal relationship to the Ser-985 phosphorylation level when Ser-985 phosphorylation was induced by TPA. Because the amino acid sequence encompassing Ser-985 (Ser-Ala-Arg) coincides with the consensus sequences in substrates of PKC ((S/T)X(R/K)) and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II) ((S/T)XR), involvement of PKC and CaMK II in Ser-985 phosphorylation was analyzed by using specific inhibitors (Fig. 4D). BIM almost completely inhibited Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by TPA and HGF. In contrast, KN-62 (CaMK II inhibitor) could not reduce Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by HGF and TPA. These results suggest that PKC is responsible for HGF-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation. PKC Isoforms Responsible for Ser-985 Phosphorylation—Because TPA targets both conventional and novel types of PKCs, we addressed PKC isoforms responsible for Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. Western blot analysis using cell lysate revealed that PKC isoforms, α (conventional), δ, ϵ, and θ (novel) but not β, γ, and η were expressed in A549 cell (Fig. 5A). We then tested whether these PKC isoforms directly phosphorylate Ser-985 of c-Met, using recombinant PKC isoforms (α, δ, ϵ, and θ). In vitro kinase assay for immunoprecipitated c-Met indicated that each PKC isoform phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met to a comparable extent, at least in vitro (Fig. 5B). To identify which PKC isoforms are responsible for Ser-985 phosphorylation in the cells, we next assessed the effects of isoform-specific inhibitors for PKC on H2O2-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Pretreatment of cells with BIM (inhibitor for α, δ, and ϵ) almost completely inhibited Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by H2O2, indicating PKC θ is not involved in H2O2-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation. Gö6976 (an inhibitor for α) had no effect on Ser-985 phosphorylation, whereas Gö6983 (an inhibitor for α and δ) partially inhibited Ser-985 phosphorylation. Collectively, these results indicate that PKCδ and -ϵ are responsible for H2O2-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. We addressed mechanisms coordinating these activities for the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation. A potential mechanism would be association of PKC and c-Met. To determine whether PKCs are associated with c-Met, c-Met was immunoprecipitated from H2O2-treated cells, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-PKC antibodies. Association of PKCδ and -ϵ with c-Met was marginal in unstimulated cells, whereas it was detectable 10 min after H2O2 stimulus and was sustained for up to 60 min (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that the association of PKCδ and -ϵ with c-Met may be involved in the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. To address further the PKC isoform-dependent Ser-985 phosphorylation, we measured changes in activity of PKCδ and -ϵ. PKC isoforms were immunoprecipitated from HGF- or H2O2-stimulated cells, respectively, and subjected to in vitro kinase assay by using synthetic peptide corresponding to the 11 amino acid residues of c-Met (amino acids 978–988), including Ser-985 as a substrate. H2O2 increased activity of PKCδ and -ϵ within 10 min, and the activities thereby declined to lower levels than those seen at 10 min (Fig. 5E). HGF stimulus also increased PKCδ and -ϵ activity with a similar time dependence to that seen in the case of H2O2 stimulus; however, the level of PKC activity during HGF stimulus was less than that enhanced by H2O2. Involvement of Protein Phosphatase 2A in Ser-985 Dephosphorylation—Because the HGF-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation was transient and the level was weak compared with that induced by H2O2 (Fig. 3) and TPA (Fig. 4), we speculated that Ser/Thr protein phosphatases might attenuate the level of phosphorylation of Ser-985 during HGF stimulation. To address this possibility, the effect of NaF was analyzed, which is a broad inhibitor for protein phosphatases on phosphorylation levels of Ser-985 and tyrosine of c-Met receptor (Fig. 6A). In this experiment, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at 1234/1235 and 1365 of c-Met, which are critical autophosphorylation sites to evoke intracellular signals of HGF, was analyzed by using specific antibodies. In control culture without NaF, HGF induced transient Ser-985 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of Tyr-1234/1235 and Tyr-1365. On the other hand, pretreatment with NaF for 10 min allowed for Ser-985 phosphorylation, and the level was higher than that induced by HGF stimulus, suggesting that protein phosphatase(s) is involved in the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation. HGF stimulation in the presence of NaF further increased Ser-985 phosphorylation to higher levels than that seen with NaF alone. Most important, in the presence of NaF, phosphorylation levels of Tyr-1234/1235 and Tyr-1365 induced by HGF were much weaker than those seen in the absence of NaF, again demonstrating a reciprocal relationship between phosphorylation levels of Ser-985 and tyrosine residues in the c-Met receptor. We then attempted to identify the phosphoserine phosphatase responsible for the attenuation of Ser-985 phosphorylation. Because NaF broadly inhibits activities of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, the effects of selective inhibitors, calyculin A (specific to PP1/2A) and cyclosporin A (specific to PP2B), were evaluated (Fig. 6B). Treatment with calyculin A further enhanced the Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by HGF, but cyclosporin A did not influence the Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by HGF, thereby suggesting the involvement of PP1 and/or PP2A in Ser-985 dephosphorylation. To address this, the c-Met receptor possessing phosphorylated Ser-985 was immunoprecipitated from A549 cells pretreated with NaF, and the catalytic activity of purified recombinant PP1 and PP2A to dephosphorylate of Ser-985 was analyzed, respectively (Fig. 6C). Treatment with PP2A but not PP1 almost completely dephosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met; hence, PP2A is presumed to be responsible for dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-985 of c-Met. Association of PP2A with c-Met and PP2A Activity Modulated by HGF- and H2O2 Stimulation—The above results indicate that the phosphorylation status of Ser-985 is bi-directionally regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by PKC and PP2A, respectively. We therefore addressed mechanisms coordinating these activities for the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation. A potential mechanism would be association of PKC and/or PP2A to the c-Met receptor. To determine whether PP2A is associated with c-Met, c-Met was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-PP2A antibody. PP2A was clearly associated with the c-Met receptor even in unstimulated cells, and HGF stimulus did not significantly alter the association of PP2A with c-Met (Fig. 6D). Hence, we suggest a constitutive association of PP2A with the c-Met receptor. When changes in the association of PP2A were analyzed in cells treated with H2O2, H2O2 stimulation did not change the association of PP2A with c-Met following H2O2 stimulus (Fig. 6D), again suggesting a constitutive association of PP2A with c-Met regardless of any extracellular stimuli with HGF and H2O2. We then considered possible changes in PP2A activity even though PP2A is constitutively associated with c-Met. To address this possibility, the catalytic activity of PP2A required to dephosphorylate phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met was analyzed. PP2A was immunoprecipitated from A549 cells untreated or treated with HGF or H2O2, and PP2A activity was analyzed by Western blots, using phosphorylated Ser-985 of c-Met from NaF-treated cells as a substrate (Fig. 6E). Ser-985 was equally dephosphorylated by PP2A prepared from cells untreated or treated with HGF for up to 60 min, indicating that PP2A associated with c-Met was active in unstimulated cells, and this activity was unchanged upon HGF stimulation. On the other hand, PP2A prepared from H2O2-treated cells decreased in activity to dephosphorylate Ser-985, thereby increasing the phosphorylation level of Ser-985 (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that PP2A associated with c-Met was active in cells under stress-free conditions, but this activity to dephosphorylate Ser-985 in cells decreased in the presence of oxidative stress. A previous study demonstrated that Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met was induced by TPA stimuli, and this event resulted in a decrease of c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation (13Gandino L. Longati P. Medico E. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our work, strong Ser-985 phosphorylation induced by H2O2 stimulus and inhibition of protein phosphatase, as well as TPA, was associated with a decreased c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation upon HGF stimulus. Thus, the phosphorylation status of Ser-985 seems to play a functional regulatory role in activation of the c-Met receptor, thereby involved in distinct cellular responsiveness to HGF, which depends on distinct extracellular conditions. However, the regulation of Ser-985 phosphorylation by extracellular stimuli, potential molecules responsible for Ser-985 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and involvement of Ser-985 phosphorylation in regulation of cellular responsiveness mediated by c-Met remain to be addressed. In the present study, we found that Ser-985 was phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, respectively, by PKC (PKCδ and -ϵ) and PP2A, and that Ser-985 phosphorylation was bi-directionally regulated by the differential activation of PKC and PP2A depending on cellular conditions. Likewise, we found that Ser-985 was phosphorylated by oxidative stress and that the stress-induced Ser-985 phosphorylation was associated with inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met and subsequent cellular responsiveness to HGF. Possible regulatory mechanisms of Ser-985 phosphorylation and its involvement in c-Met receptor activation and cellular responsiveness are schematically described in Fig. 7. Various intracellular signaling molecules are associated with the c-Met receptor (8Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar); however, the association of PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PP2A with the c-Met receptor has not been demonstrated. Because activation of PKC is a downstream event triggered by HGF and H2O2 stimuli (15Awasthi V. King R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L942-L949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), we speculated that the association of PKCδ and -ϵ with c-Met is likely to be related to the activation of these isoforms and/or their association may facilitate preferentially Ser-985 phosphorylation of c-Met. On the other hand, PP2A seems to constitutively associate with c-Met, yet its enzymatic activity is regulated by extracellular stimuli. A variety of cellular damages and stresses such as oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and heat induce cell cycle arrest (14Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar, 18Pearce A.K. Humphrey T.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 426-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest is a critical event, which allows cells to be restored from the damages (e.g. DNA-repair and refolding of denatured enzymes) or eliminated by apoptotic pathways; however, precise mechanisms of cell cycle arrest have yet to be elucidated. We found that the growth-promoting effects of HGF were abolished by suppression of the tyrosine phosphorylation event of c-Met when cells were exposed to oxidant stress, and the suppression was mediated by phosphorylation of Ser-985. To our knowledge, this is the first finding that H2O2-induced growth arrest is primarily regulated by receptor inactivation even when cells are exposed to mitogens. We propose that attenuation of the cellular responsiveness to growth factors may be an initial step to avoid disadvantages associated with cell cycle transition in damaged cells. Previous studies indicated that Ser/Thr phosphorylation in receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation events following ligand stimulus, suggesting that a specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation provides an autoinhibitory mechanism in distinct receptor tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation events in epidermal growth factor receptor (19Cochet C. Gill G.N. Meisenhelder J. Cooper J.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2553-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin receptor (20Takayama S. White M.F. Lauris V. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Castellone M.D. Beguinot F. Santoro M. Formisano P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2942-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are reciprocally inhibited by PKC-mediated Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Although related mechanisms remain to be addressed, the inhibition of receptor dimerization and enhancement of internalization in the epidermal growth factor receptor have been noted (23Kuppuswamy D. Pike L.J. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As for c-Met, pretreatment of cells with TPA and NaF induced extensive Ser-985 phosphorylation, and this was associated with suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met upon HGF stimulus without any accompanying c-Met receptor degradation (Figs. 4C and 5A). Furthermore, TPA and NaF treatment after HGF stimulus also induced extensive Ser-985 phosphorylation and resulted in tyrosine dephosphorylation without c-Met degradation. 2A. Hashigasako, M. Machide, T. Nakamura, K. Matsumoto, and T. Nakamura, unpublished data. Thus, we speculate that phosphorylation of Ser-985 may mediate the inhibition of receptor dimerization and/or association of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. c-Met has a structural variant that lacks a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region (ΔJxt-Met) including Ser-985, and it is generated through the alternative splicing of exon 14 (12Lee C.C. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19457-19461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain of c-Met has been considered to play a negative regulatory function, based on findings that addition of the juxtamembrane domain to oncogenic TPR-Met fusion protein abolishes its transforming activity (25Vigna E. Gramaglia D. Longati P. Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4275-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Tyr-1003 in this domain facilitates proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Met through Cbl association (26Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the juxtamembrane domain were identified in human gastric cancer and small cell lung cancer, and these mutant c-Met are more susceptible to tyrosine phosphorylation upon HGF stimulus (27Lee J.H. Han S.U. Cho H. Jennings B. Gerrard B. Dean M. Schmidt L. Zbar B. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4947-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Ma P.C. Kijima T. Maulik G. Fox E.A. Sattler M. Griffin J.D. Johnson B.E. Salgia R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6272-6281PubMed Google Scholar), again indicating that the domain contributes to negative regulation of c-Met. Most interesting, ΔJxt-Met is expressed in various tissues (12Lee C.C. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19457-19461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2A. Hashigasako, M. Machide, T. Nakamura, K. Matsumoto, and T. Nakamura, unpublished data. suggesting the ΔJxt-Met plays some c-Met related roles in biological events. ΔJxt-Met expression may provide a condition wherein the activation of ΔJxt-Met simply depends on the ligand binding regardless of the extracellular environment and stimuli in a cell and/or tissue type-specific manner. PKC is activated by diverse extracellular stimuli such as cellular stress, cell-cell adhesion, cell-extracellular matrix interaction, and cellular (tissue) injury (16Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y.

Kermorgant S. Whelan R. Parsons M. Ng T. Parker P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 90-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, c-Met-mediated cellular responsiveness is modified depending on extracellular conditions, including cellular stress, cell-cell adhesion, and cell extracellular matrix interaction (32Matsumoto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 33Takehara T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Taken together, Ser-985 phosphorylation mediated by activation of PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PP2A is likely to play a role in the regulation of c-Met receptor activation and cellular responsiveness to HGF, which depend on the extracellular environment and stimuli. Further studies on regulatory mechanisms responsible for c-Met receptor activation through juxtamembrane domain and Ser-985 phosphorylation will provide even further understanding of the HGF-c-Met system in development, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2060816138,"Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is a growth factor-inducible, immediate-early gene that has multifaceted activities in various cancers. In a previous study, we found that Cyr61 inhibited the growth of the H520 and H460 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. In further studies, we now report that p53 plays a pivotal role in Cyr61-dependent cellular growth arrest. Blocking Cyr61 with a Cyr61 antibody resulted in the downregulation of expression of p53 and p21, as well as partially reversing the growth suppression of H520-Cyr61 cells. Proliferation of NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H157, H125, H1299), having a mutant p53, were not suppressed by Cyr61. Inhibition of wild-type p53, by either human papilloma virus type 16 E6 or a dominant-negative p53, resulted in the rescue of the growth suppression mediated by Cyr61 in the H520-Cyr61 cells. The enhanced levels of p21WAF1 and p130/RB2, in the Cyr61-expressing H520-Cyr61 cells, were also inhibited by blocking p53 showing that p21 and p130 were induced by p53 in these cells. In addition, levels of both c-myc and beta-catenin increased in Cyr61 stably transfected H520 cells. Moreover, beta-catenin was translocated into the nucleus in these cells. Inhibition of c-myc expression in the H520-Cyr61 cells with antisense c-myc resulted in their decreased levels of p53. Transfecting cells with a dominant-negative T-cell factor (TCF4), the specific inhibitor of the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex, downregulated the expression of c-myc. Taken together, the data suggest that Cyr61 suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells by triggering a signal transduction pathway through beta-catenin. In this pathway, Cyr61 activated the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex, which promoted the expression of c-myc and the latter induced expression of p53, and p53 upregulated p21WAF1 and p130/RB2, resulting in growth arrest."

https://openalex.org/W1984420724,"The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are known to be involved in maintaining the silenced state of several developmentally regulated genes. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a member of this large protein family, has also been shown to be deregulated in different tumor types and its role, both as a potential primary effector and as a mediator of tumorigenesis, has become a subject of increased interest. We observed that Ezh2 binds to pRb2/p130, a member of the retinoblastoma family; as such, we were led to consider the possible ability of Ezh2 to modulate cell cycle progression. Both Ezh2 and pRb2/p130 repress gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC1), which decreases DNA accessibility for activating transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Ezh2 interacts with the C-terminal region of pRb2/p130, essential for interaction with HDAC1. We show that Ezh2 is able to reverse pRb2/p130-HDAC1-mediated repression of the cyclin A promoter. This indicates a functional role of this complex in regulating cyclin A expression, known to be crucial in mediating cell cycle advancement. We also detected a significant decrease in the retention of HDAC1 activity associated with pRb2/p130 when Ezh2 was overexpressed. Finally, electromobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated that overexpression of Ezh2 caused the abrogation of the pRb2/p130-HDAC1 complex on the cyclin A promoter. These data, taken together, suggest that Ezh2 competes with HDAC1 in binding to pRb2/p130, disrupting their occupancy on the cyclin A promoter. In this study, we propose a new mechanism for the functional inactivation of pRb2/p130 that ultimately contributes to cell cycle progression and malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2157829770,"LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1."

https://openalex.org/W2016483466,"Rat platelets served as a model to evaluate quantitatively how guanylate cyclase (GC)-coupled nitric oxide (NO) receptors and phosphodiesterases (here phosphodiesterase-5) interact to transduce NO signals in cells. The platelets expressed mRNA only for the α1 and β1 GC-coupled receptor subunits. In intact platelets, the potency of NO for elevating cGMP (EC50 = 10 nm) was lower than in lysed platelets (EC50 = 1.7 nm). The limiting activities of GC and phosphodiesterase in intact platelets were both very high, being equivalent to about 100 μm/s. With low phosphodiesterase activity (imposed by 100 μm sildenafil), the cGMP response over time was hyperbolic in shape for a range of NO concentrations or GC activities due to GC desensitization. Without a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, NO generated only brief cGMP transients, peaking after 2–5 s but amounting maximally to about 150 μm cGMP. The transients were caused partly by GC desensitization, which varied in rate (half-time up to 3 s) and extent (up to 80%) depending on the NO concentration, and partly by an enhancement of the phosphodiesterase catalytic activity with time, which was deduced to be up to 30-fold and to occur with a half-time of up to 5 s. The results were simulated by a quantitative model, which also explains the varied shapes of cGMP responses to NO found in other cells. Downstream phosphorylation in platelets was detectable within 2 s, and, with continuous exposure (1 min), this pathway could be engaged by subnanomolar NO concentrations (EC50 = 0.5 nm).

Whereas the spatio-temporal dynamics of some of the primary steps of cellular signal transduction, such as synaptic transmission and changes in intracellular Ca2+, have become well understood in quantitative terms (1Colquhoun D.

Nevertheless, the kinetic properties of the second messenger cascades are likely to be similarly instrumental in determining how cells respond. A case in point is nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; GC, guanylyl cyclase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; SPER/NO, spermine/NO adduct; CPTIO, 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; ODQ, 1-H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; GC, guanylyl cyclase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; SPER/NO, spermine/NO adduct; CPTIO, 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; ODQ, 1-H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one. signaling. NO acts as a diffusible chemical messenger throughout the body, where it subserves diverse functions, including smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and the induction of synaptic plasticity (3Hobbs A.J.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). NO elicits these and other physiological effects by binding to its guanylyl cyclase (GC)-coupled receptors, thereby evoking the accumulation of cGMP in target cells. The receptors are αβ-heterodimers, of which two main isoforms, α1β1 and α2β1, exist at differing levels in different tissues (5Friebe A. Koesling D. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Studies on purified receptors (6Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and intact cells (7Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggest that activation of GC occurs very rapidly, within a few ms or less of adding NO, and complete deactivation in cells (upon removal of NO) requires only about 500 ms (7Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when studied in isolation, the receptors are highly sensitive NO detectors, with only about 1 nm being needed to evoke half-maximal GC activity (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The shape of the resulting cGMP response in cells, however, varies greatly from one cell to another. For example, in platelets (9Mellion B.T. Ignarro L.J. Ohlstein E.H. Pontecorvo E.G. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J. Blood. 1981; 57: 946-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bellamy T.C. Wood J.

Acta. 1979; 586: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the response to continued NO application is a transient increase in cGMP, whereas, in a population of glial cells from the cerebellum, cGMP rises hyperbolically with time to attain large plateau concentrations (10Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). An intermediate response is found in neurons in another part of the brain (13Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in aortic smooth muscle (14Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Thompson W.J. Liu L. Koesling D. Friebe A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The information encoded in the different cGMP profiles is unclear, but the temporal and amplitude characteristics presumably impact on the selection of downstream targets, which include protein kinases in the nanomolar concentration range (15Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and ion channels in the micromolar range (16Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to analyze quantitatively the factors responsible for shaping cellular cGMP signals in response to NO and to determine the relationship between cGMP signals and subsequent protein phosphorylation. The levels of cGMP in a cell reflect the interplay between the rate of synthesis, the rate of degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE), and, possibly, the rate of extrusion into the extracellular fluid. The rates of cGMP synthesis and degradation may both change with time because of desensitization of the GC-coupled NO receptors (10Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and enhancement of PDE activity (17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A.

Platelets are very small (∼1 μm in diameter), which diminishes problems of subcellular compartmentation (19Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Tse T.E. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13049-13054Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and minimizes the diffusion distance from the suspending medium to the cell interior. They are also homogenous and, being an established target for NO, are rich in GC-coupled NO receptors, PDE (specifically a cGMP-preferring isoform, PDE5), and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a substrate for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (20Schwarz U.R. Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Preparation of Platelets—Whole blood was collected from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (3–5 rats/experiment) into acid citrate dextrose solution (12.5%) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 20 °C. The platelet-rich plasma was withdrawn and recentrifuged to eliminate residual red and white blood cells. The supernatant was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g (20 °C), and the platelet pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.55 mm NaH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, to give a final concentration of 0.5 mg protein/ml (protein being measured using the bicinchoninic acid method). The platelet suspension was incubated in 1–2 ml volumes for at least 1 h at 37 °C prior to use. l-nitroarginine (100 μm) was included at the start of the incubation to abolish possible complications arising from endogenous NO synthesis. Delivery of NO—The platelets were exposed to clamped NO concentrations using a new method (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly spermine/NO adduct (SPER/NO) was used as the source of NO and 2,4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (CPTIO; 200 μm) was included as an NO sink, serving to translate rapidly (within 1 s) different rates of NO release from the donor into proportionate steady-state concentrations. Urate (300 μm) was added to convert NO2 (the product of the reaction between NO and CPTIO) into NO2−, and superoxide dismutase (1000 units/ml) was included as a precautionary measure to remove any superoxide ions that would otherwise react with NO. The method had previously been used only in cell-free preparations, so it was important to evaluate its use with living cells. In accordance with predictions (see Supplemental Data, Fig. S1), the addition of SPER/NO in increasing concentration (100 μm to 1 mm) to a platelet suspension (0.5 mg protein/ml) containing CPTIO, urate, and superoxide dismutase (at 37 °C) resulted in increasing steady-state NO concentrations, as measured using an electrochemical probe (Iso-NO; World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, Herts, UK). A plot of the amplitude of the plateau NO concentration against SPER/NO concentration gave the expected straight line passing through zero and the slope (1.3 × 10–4) was similar to that found beforehand in cell-free preparations (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Omission of platelets had no effect on the NO concentration profile, indicating that they do not consume NO significantly themselves. These data validate the method for delivering NO in the 0–100 nm concentration range to platelet suspensions. The NO concentration generated by the addition of 400 μm SPER/NO to the platelet buffer (containing CPTIO, urate, and superoxide dismutase) was measured 3–4 times on each experimental day and averaged for the purpose of calibration. Measurement of cGMP—The method was similar to that used previously (10Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In short, aliquots of the platelet suspension (usually 50 μl) were withdrawn before and at various times after the addition of SPER/NO to give different NO concentrations and expelled immediately into inactivation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 100 °C. The samples were maintained at that temperature for about 10 min. When used, 1-H-(1, 2, 4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a blocker of GC-coupled NO receptors (21Garthwaite J. Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar), was added to the platelets 15 min before the addition of SPER/NO in order to achieve a steady degree of inhibition (22Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The levels of cGMP were measured by radioimmunoassay and expressed relative to the amount of protein. To measure extracellular cGMP, aliquots of the suspension were filtered gently but rapidly (5 s) through 0.22-μm cut-off filters. Usually, three independent runs were carried out in each experiment, and the resulting data are presented as means ± S.E. Measurement of GC Activity in Lysed Platelets—Platelets were prepared and incubated as described above. An equal volume of 2-fold concentrated lysis buffer containing 200 μm dithiothreitol and two Mini Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets per 10 ml (Roche Applied Science) was added to platelet suspensions, and the mixture was sonicated and kept on ice. Lysed platelets were assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 300 μm GTP, 1000 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 300 μm uric acid, and 200 μm CPTIO. SPER/NO was added, and 100-μl aliquots were removed at various intervals, inactivated, and assayed for cGMP as for the intact platelets. Upon the addition of 2 or 20 nm NO, cGMP accumulated linearly with time for at least 2 min (not illustrated) as reported previously for cell-free preparations (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); a 2-min exposure was used to obtain concentration-response data. Analysis of Rates of cGMP Synthesis and Degradation—The kinetic parameters of the PDE activity were measured by exposing platelets to NO in the presence of varying concentrations of a PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil), and then the decay in cGMP was followed after removing NO using hemoglobin. The data were analyzed using the linear transformation of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (23Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London1995Google Scholar), tln(P0Pt)=1Vp(P0−Ptln(P0Pt))+KpVp Eq. 1 where Vp represents the limiting PDE activity, Kp is the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, and P0 and Pt are the cGMP levels at the start and at time t, respectively. For a competitive inhibitor such as sildenafil, when used in concentrations that are large relative to the inhibitory constant (Ki), the value of Kp/Vp (the intercept) should increase in proportion to the inhibitor concentration ([I]) because of the following relationship: Kp = Km(1 + [I]/Ki). Linear regression analysis of the transformed cGMP decay was used to obtain best estimates of the gradient (1/Vp) and of a common intercept per unit concentration of sildenafil. From this intercept and the value of Vp, the ratio Km/Ki was obtained. To analyze the cGMP profiles formed in response to NO, the basic premise was that the level of cGMP at any time is governed by the rates of synthesis (vs) and degradation (vd), since the rate of cGMP extrusion from the cells was negligible under most conditions (see “Results”). The methods for determining the parameters under conditions of maximal PDE inhibition (100 μm sildenafil), when the cGMP accumulation curve followed a hyperbolic shape, were as before (10Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, the curve was fit (in Origin 7, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) to a generalized hyperbola of the form, P=a⋅tnkn+tn Eq. 2 where P represents the cGMP level, t is time, a is maximum cGMP accumulation, and k and n are constants. Differentiating and inserting the result into the expression dP/dt = vs – vd gives the following, aâ‹…nâ‹…knâ‹…tnâˆ’1(kn+tn)2=vsâˆ’Vpâ‹…aâ‹…tn/(kn+tn)Kp+aâ‹…tn/(kn+tn)ÂEq. 3 from which vs was found with respect to t. In some cases, cGMP did not reach a steady plateau but fell gradually after reaching a peak despite PDE being substantially inhibited (100 μm sildenafil). In these cases, the curves were fit (in Origin) to a pulse function, Â P=A(1âˆ’e(âˆ’t/t1))pâ‹…e(âˆ’t/t2)ÂEq. 4 where A dictates the maximum cGMP level, t1 and t2 are the time constants for the rising and falling phases, and p is a constant. Upon differentiation, this equation gives the following, dPdt=A(1âˆ’e(âˆ’t/t1))pâˆ’1â‹…pâ‹…e(âˆ’t(t2+t1)/t1â‹…t2)â‹…t2âˆ’(1âˆ’e(âˆ’t/t1))pâ‹…e(âˆ’t/t2))â‹…t1t1â‹…t2ÂEq. 5 which is used to find vs as above. A more complex model was developed to analyze the responses under conditions where PDE was not inhibited or was inhibited more mildly. The rate of cGMP synthesis (vs) was represented by the following equation, vs=(GCmax−c)⋅[NO]EC50+[NO]⋅e−kd⋅t+c(1−e−k1⋅t) Eq. 6 where GCmax is the limiting GC activity, kd is the desensitization rate constant, c is a nondesensitizing component, and k1 is the rate constant for its activation. Because of mixing delays and the fact that it takes a finite time (about 1 s) for the NO concentration to reach steady state (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the NO concentration in the above equation was assumed to increase exponentially with a rate constant of 1.5 s–1 (giving 80% of the steady-state level in 1 s), and this was also the value assigned to k1. To enable cGMP levels to rise before desensitization sets in (see “Results”), it was assumed that kd increases from zero (at t = 0) to its final value with a rate constant of 0.8 s–1. The EC50 for NO was taken as 10 nm (see “Results”), and the value of GCmax was adjusted according to the amplitude of the maximum cGMP response in any particular experiment, which could vary by up to 2-fold. Analysis of the PDE activity (vd) was based on the Michaelis-Menten equation, modified for the presence of a competitive antagonist (as needed). vd=Vp⋅[cGMP]Km(1+[I]Ki)+[cGMP] Eq. 7 PDE5 activity is not fixed, but it becomes enhanced when cGMP binds to the enzyme (17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This enhancement corresponds to a time-dependent increase in the limiting rate of hydrolysis (Vp), a reduction in the Km for cGMP, and an increase in the affinity of sildenafil (Ki). Accordingly, these parameters were represented as follows, Vp=Vp1+Vp2(1−e−kp⋅t) Eq. 8 where Vp1 is the basal condition, and Vp2 is the component that enhances with rate constant kp. Km=Km2+Km1(e−kp⋅t) Eq. 9 where Km2 is the final value that is approached with rate constant kp from the initial value (Km2 + Km1). Ki=Ki2+Ki1(e−kp⋅t) Eq. 10 where Ki2 is the final value that is approached with rate constant kp from the initial value (Ki2 + Ki1). The equations assume that the enhancement is irreversible, which, considering the short time intervals being analyzed, is justified (17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Feil R. Thompson W.J. Hofmann F. Koesling D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). With values assigned to the variables, the cGMP profile is obtained by numerically solving the following equation. dPdt=vs−vd Eq. 11 The equations were solved using the adaptive Runge-Kutta algorithm in Mathcad, version 2000i or 11 (Adept Scientific, Letchworth, Herts, UK). Measurement of VASP Phosphorylation—Platelets were incubated and exposed to clamped NO concentrations as above. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed at specified time points and inactivated in 33 μl of 4-fold concentrated SDS-loading buffer, comprising 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8% (w/v) SDS, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 40% (v/v) glycerol, and 20% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Concentration-response experiments used 1-min exposures to NO. Samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and then aliquots containing 5 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and blocked for 2 h in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were then probed with an anti-phospho-VASP antibody (0.05 μg/ml; 16C2, Alexis Corp., Nottingham, UK) and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (1.67 μg/ml; Chemicon, Hampshire, UK) before being probed with anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:10,000; DAKO, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK). Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was carried out using Optiquant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and differences were analyzed statistically using the two-tailed Student's t test. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from the platelet suspensions according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was subsequently used to generate PCR products. The primers and annealing temperatures used are listed in Table I. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. Reaction products were detected by standard agarose gel electrophoresis.Table IPrimers used for reverse transcriptase-PCR detection of GC-coupled NO receptor subunit mRNAs in rat plateletsSubunitPrimer sequence 5′-3′ResiduesProduct sizeAnnealing temperatureAccession numberbp°Cα1cctttctccttactgg (forward)502-52125152M57405gtgctttgccaatgttc (reverse)753-733α2gactcactgggcgaga (forward)676-69121050AF109963tacaccgaagaattcct (reverse)886-870β1tacggtcccgaggtgt (forward)90-10832755M22562ctgcatcggtgcaccg (reverse)417-398β2actactcagacagacatggtctg (forward)26-4420555M57507atgccctcacagcagttgagtg (reverse)231-214 Open table in a new tab Expression of GC-coupled NO Receptor Subunit mRNA in Rat Platelets—Although anucleate, platelets contain abundant mRNAs that can be translated into proteins (24Lindemann S. Tolley N.D. Dixon D.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Weyrich A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR products of the mRNAs encoding both the α1 and β1 subunits were detected, whereas the products of α2 and β2 mRNAs were not (Fig. 1). Thus, rat platelets appear to express only the α1β1 NO receptor, as found in other species (25Guthmann F. Mayer B. Koesling D. Kukovetz W.R. Bohme E. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 346: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The result also indicates that the expression of the receptor protein in platelets could be subject to regulation (24Lindemann S. Tolley N.D. Dixon D.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Weyrich A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Potency of NO for Platelet GC-coupled Receptors—The addition of fixed NO concentrations to platelet suspensions led to very transient increases in cGMP (Fig. 2a). At the higher NO concentrations (10–50 nm), the peak elevation occurred after 5 s, but, as the concentration was reduced, the peak gradually shifted to 2 s (2 nm NO). The NO concentration range active in the intact platelets appears higher than in cell-free preparations, where maximal effects are observed at about 10 nm NO (8Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the platelet receptor is unusual, aliquots of the same batch were either lysed or kept intact and compared directly. In lysed platelets, the EC50 for NO was 1.7 nm, and the Hill coefficient was near 1. In intact platelets given a short (5-s) exposure to NO in the presence of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (100 μm; see below) the EC50 value was 11 nm, with the Hill coefficient remaining close to 1 (Fig. 2b). Kinetics of cGMP Degradation—Human platelets contain PDE5 as the main cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme, although PDE2 can make a minor contribution (10Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Thompson W.J. Liu L. Koesling D. Friebe A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). With the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (1 μm) present, the NO-evoked cGMP response was transformed from a brief transient to a larger, broader transient followed by a prolonged plateau (Fig. 3a). The main effect of increasing the sildenafil concentration further (3–100 μm) was to increase the amplitude of the plateau. Ultimately, the response had a hyperbolic shape, with the maximum amplitude being reached after about 20 s. The PDE2 inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (100 μm) on its own had no effect on the response to NO (50 nm) measured after a 60-s exposure, and, when added together with 100 μm sildenafil, it did not raise cGMP further (results not shown), suggesting that PDE2 makes a negligible contribution to cGMP hydrolysis in rat platelets. Knowledge of the PDE kinetics is a prerequisite for analyzing cellular cGMP profiles. To extract this information, platelets were stimulated with 50 nm NO in the presence of a range of sildenafil concentrations (1–100 μm) for a period of 1 min, by which time cGMP levels were close to steady-state (Fig. 3a); hemoglobin (30 μm) was then added to remove NO, and the decline in cGMP was followed for 3 min (Fig. 3b). There was no observable delay between the addition of hemoglobin and the fall in cGMP levels, consistent with GC deactivating in the subsecond time frame (7Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the rates of decline varied inversely with the sildenafil concentration. Analysis of the data using the linear transformation of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 3c) (see “Experimental Procedures”) gave a value of the limiting rate of cGMP hydrolysis (Vp) of 250 pmol/mg protein/s. For platelets, 1 mg of protein corresponds to 2.5 μl (26Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), so that, assuming homogeneity, the value of Vp corresponds to about 100 μm/s in this experiment. From the intercepts and the value of Vp, the ratio Km/Ki is 400. Taking the steady-state Km of PDE5 for cGMP to be 1 μm (17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the Ki for sildenafil is 2.5 nm, which accords with published values (27Moreland R.B. Goldstein I.I. Kim N.N. Traish A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 97-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Simulations using the derived parameters tracked the measured cGMP decays at each sildenafil concentration (Fig. 3b). Subsequent analyses used the same Km and Ki values, but the precise Vp value (along with the value for the maximal GC activity) had to be adjusted for each experiment, because the absolute cGMP levels varied. The values fitting all of the data in the present study ranged from 150 to 220 pmol/mg protein/s (equivalent to 67–100 μm/s). The corresponding range of limiting GC activities (see below) was 237–360 pmol/mg protein/s (95–144 μm/s). cGMP Extrusion—When platelets were stimulated with 50 nm NO for 1 min in the presence of 100 μm sildenafil, the total cGMP was 1345 ± 31 pm"

In this study, we have confirmed increased expression of SOX9 in M12/mac25 cells and have further investigated the physiological effects of increased SOX9 production. Greatly increased levels of SOX9 RNA and mature protein were demonstrated in cells transfected with a SOX9 cDNA (M12/SOX9), and gel mobility shift assays confirmed binding of nuclear protein from these cells to an oligonucleotide containing the SOX9 consensus binding sequence. M12/SOX9 cells assumed the spindle-shaped morphology characteristic of M12/mac25 cells, suggesting that SOX9 mediates some effects of mac25. Elevated expression of SOX9 resulted in a decreased rate of cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Tumor development in athymic nude mice was inhibited by 80%. Finally, prostate-specific antigen and the androgen receptor, two genes whose expression is characteristic of differentiated cells, were both upregulated in M12/SOX9 cells. These data indicate that SOX9 contributes to growth regulation by mac25 via inhibition of cell growth and promotion of differentiation."

As a member of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family, TACE is also named ADAM17 and is biosynthesized as a zymogen that contains an inhibitory N-terminal prodomain (4Black R.A. Rauch C.T.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). TACE zymogen is a type 1 membrane protein, which becomes N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. After being further modified at N-linked sugars in the medial Golgi, full-length TACE is transported to the trans-Golgi where it is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease to release the prodomain (45Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It was estimated that only a small proportion of the biosynthesized TACE is processed to the cell surface (45Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). There are several other non-catalytic domains in TACE in addition to the prodomain: a cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (4Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain serves to anchor the protease to the plasma membrane where the substrates of the enzyme are located (19Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 47Itai T. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain of TACE, unlike that in most other ADAM family members, does not have a noticeable integrin binding motif (48Eto K. Huet C. Tarui T. Kupriyanov S. Liu H.Z. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Zhang X.P. Sheppard D. Engvall E. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, the cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain of TACE can be substituted by that of ADAM10 for the cleavage of most substrates (19Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Ectodomain cleavage by TACE is induced within minutes following treatment of cells with stimuli (49Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This rapid and efficient activation occurs through post-translational mechanisms, because it is not affected by compounds targeting RNA or protein synthesis (49Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the removal of the prodomain is essential for TACE function, it does not seem to be sufficient to confer a proteolytic activity in the cellular context because the prodomain is cleaved constitutively, and the amount of mature TACE does not change in response to shedding inducers (4Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Various stimuli induce TACE-mediated shedding by activating intracellular signaling pathways mediated by Erk and p38 MAP kinases (49Fan H. Derynck R.

Therefore, the cytoplasmic domain of TACE was thought to serve as a signal transducer that regulates the cleavage by the (extracellular) protease domain (49Fan H. Derynck R.

Surprisingly, even though the cytoplasmic domain binds other proteins and is phosphorylated in response to shedding inducers (19Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A.

Therefore, the mechanism by which intracellular signaling events lead to changes of TACE activity remains unknown. Two mutant cell lines, the M1 and M2 cell lines, may be particularly useful to elucidating the mechanisms controlling ectodomain shedding by TACE. These cell lines were isolated from ethyl methane sulfonate-treated CHO cells stably transfected with transmembrane TGF-α, i.e. CHOT cells. Compared with CHOT cells, M1 and M2 cells no longer released soluble TGF-α when stimulated by the shedding inducer PMA (57Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 58Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Though M1 and M2 were obtained from independently mutagenized CHOT stocks, results of cell fusion experiments suggest that a same recessive gene defect accounts for the loss of TGF-α shedding in these cell lines (57Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 58Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that M2 cells are also defective in TNF-α ectodomain shedding (59Merlos-Suarez A. Fernandez-Larrea J. Reddy P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas M1 cells are unable to cleave L-selectin (60Arribas J. Lopez-Casillas F. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These characteristics exhibited by M1 and M2 cells strikingly resemble those of embryonic fibroblasts, i.e. EC2 cells, isolated from TACE-null mouse (6Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of TACE reportedly failed to restore TNF-α release in M2 cells. Nevertheless, fusion of M2 cells to EC2 cells led to recovery of TNF-α shedding (59Merlos-Suarez A. Fernandez-Larrea J. Reddy P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that a cellular component that is essential for the functioning of TACE is defective in M1 and M2 cells. We were motivated to identify this hypothetical TACE regulator. However, our findings point to mutations in TACE as the direct causes of shedding deficiencies in these cells. One of these TACE variants had a single point mutation in the cysteine-rich/disintegrin domain, suggesting that this non-catalytic domain may regulate TACE activity.

All cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 8% FBS. Transfection of plasmid DNA into cells was achieved by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Western Blotting of TACE—Sample preparation for analyzing TACE expression was carried out as previously described with slight modifications (45Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). For detecting endogenous TACE forms, CHOT, M1, and M2 cells grown on 10-cm culture plates were lysed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After a 15-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf benchtop minicentrifuge with a 30-place rotor, supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Glycosylated proteins were precipitated from a 600-μg total cellular protein sample adjusted to 1 ml with 50 μl of Con A-Sepharose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and sequentially reacted to the QED anti-TACE antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (55Fan H.

Endogenous TACE forms were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Plus kit. For analysis of transfected TACE forms, COS or M2 cells grown on 6-well plates were used for transfection; the QED anti-TACE antibody or the anti-FLAG antibody were used for Western blotting.

Ankyrins are often co-expressed in the same cells and, although structurally similar, have non-overlapping functions. We previously determined that the regulatory domain of ankyrin-B defines specificity between ankyrins B and G in cardiomyocytes. Here, we identify key residues on the surface of an amphipathic α-helix unique to the regulatory domain of ankyrin-B that are essential for the function of ankyrin-B in cardiomyocytes. Using circular dichroism, we determined that a peptide representing the predicted helix folds as a helix in solution. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that residues 1773, 1777, 1780, 1784, and 1788 located in a patch on one surface the helix are critical for ankyrin-B function in cardiomyocytes. In a parallel set of experiments we determined that the molecular co-chaperone human DnaJ homologue 1 (Hdj1)/Hsp40 interacts with the ankyrin-B regulatory domain. Moreover, interaction of Hdj1/Hsp40 with the regulatory domain was mapped by random mutagenesis to same surface of the α-helix that is required for ankyrin-B function. These results provide new insight into the molecular basis for specificity between ankyrin-based pathways by defining a key α-helix structure in the divergent regulatory domain of ankyrin-B as well as interaction of the helix with Hdj1/Hsp40, the first downstream target for ankyrin-B-specific function.

Ankyrins are a family of ubiquitously expressed multivalent adaptor proteins required for the restriction of structurally unrelated transmembrane proteins including cell adhesion molecules, calcium-release channels, ion channels, and transporters at specialized membrane domains (for review, see Refs. 1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar and 2Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1565-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vertebrate ankyrin polypeptides are derived from three ankyrin genes, ankyrin-R (ank1), ankyrin-B (ank2), and ankyrin-G (ank3). Ankyrin-R, -B, and -G polypeptides share common structural domains and have a high degree of sequence similarity. Additionally, ankyrin gene products are often co-expressed within the same tissue or cell type. For example, isoforms of ankyrins R, B, and G are co-expressed in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (3Kordeli E. Ludosky M.A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J.

In contrast to many other protein families, ankyrin-R, -B, and -G polypeptides have divergent and non-overlapping functions. For example, ankyrins B and G are co-expressed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. However, mice with a targeted knockout of ankyrin-G in the cerebellum display ataxia, with abnormal localization of L1 cell-adhesion molecules, voltage-gated Na+ channels, and βIV spectrin at Purkinje neuron axon initial segments (6Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Moreover, Purkinje neurons from these animals display abnormal axon potentials (6Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a null mutation in ankyrin-B (ankyrin-B-/- mice) display central nervous system defects including hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, degeneration of the optic nerve, dilated ventricles, and reduced expression of L1 cell-adhesion molecules (8Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) even though both ankyrin-R and -G polypeptides are expressed in many of these same brain regions (6Zhou D. Lambert S.

Significantly, these abnormal cardiomyocyte phenotypes can be rescued by transfection of ankyrin-B but not the similar ankyrin-G (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, loss-of-function mutation (E1425G) in ankyrin-B is the cause of a fatal inherited human arrhythmia (similar to arrhythmia observed in ankyrin-B+/- mice) recently characterized in a large French family (12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Therefore, although similar in structure, ankyrin gene products do not compensate for loss of expression or loss of function of another ankyrin within the same cell. The primary structures of ankyrins R, B, and G are similar in their membrane-binding domains, spectrin-binding domains, and death domains but quite divergent in their C-terminal regulatory domains (Fig. 1; Refs. 1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar and 2Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1565-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using ankyrin-B and -G chimeras, we previously determined that the regulatory domain of ankyrin-B defines specificity between ankyrins B and G in cardiomyocytes (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ankyrin-B regulatory domain contains a potential amphipathic α-helix structure that is missing or highly divergent in ankyrin-G and is a candidate to contribute to specific functions of ankyrin-B (12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). This study presents several new insights into how ankyrin-B achieves its functional specificity in cardiomyocytes. We identify an ankyrin-B-specific sequence, located in the regulatory domain, that folds as an amphipathic α-helix. Moreover, we demonstrate that residues 1773, 1777, 1780, 1784, and 1788, located in a patch on one surface of this helix, are required for restoration of normal levels of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Na,K-ATPase, and InsP3 receptor in ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes. Finally, we identify the molecular co-chaperone Hdj1/Hsp40 as the first downstream target that is specific for ankyrin-B and demonstrate that Hdj1/Hsp40 associates with ankyrin-B via the same surface of the amphipathic α-helix that is required for ankyrin-B function in cardiomyocytes. Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Animal care was in accordance with Duke University Medical Center institutional guidelines. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from P1 or P2 mice and transfected as described (12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F.

After transfection, isolated cardiomyocyte spontaneous contraction rates and/or Ca2+ dynamics (Fluo-3 AM) were monitored as described (12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W.

Peptides—Ankyrin-B C-terminal peptides were synthesized and purified (>95%; Sigma); they are amphipathic helix peptide, YIDEHGHTVVKKVTRKIIRRYVS; mutant amphipathic helix peptide, YIDEAGHTAVKAVTRAIIRAYVS; non-helix C-terminal peptide, SKTPPEEVSTPAEEEKLYLQ. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Peptides were reconstituted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mm NaF, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.4. Peptides were diluted to a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in the above buffer with 50% trifluoroethanol (v/v) because we did not observe significant structure in 50 mm NaF, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.4. A volume of 0.4 ml was placed in a 0.1-cm far-UV QS cuvette (1-mm path length, Helma) and analyzed on an Aviv model 62DS circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer. CD readings were taken in 1-nm intervals between 190 and 260 nm at 25 °C. Background signal (buffer alone) was subtracted, and molar ellipticity was calculated using the equation, molar ellipticity (θ) = signal at wavelength/10ncl, where c is peptide concentration (m), n is the number of amino acids, and l is the cuvette path length (cm). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The C termini of 220-kDa ankyrin-B (nucleotides 4330-5220) and 190-kDa ankyrin-G (nucleotides 6985-7866) were PCR-amplified and ligated into pAS2-1 (Clontech) to create the GAL4-ankyrin-B and the GAL4-ankyrin-G C termini. Assays were performed as described (Ref. 15Smith F.D. Oxford G.S. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19894-19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar; Clontech). The bait plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (ADE2, HIS3, lacZ selection) using lithium acetate. Autoactivation did not occur for any bait. After confirming full-length expression of the bait protein, a human heart Matchmaker cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech) was transformed into the yeast strain harboring the bait plasmid. Double transformants were selected on medium lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan. Positive clones were tested for positive growth on media lacking histidine. TD1-1 and pLAM5 (Clontech) were negative interaction controls, and pVA3 and TD1-1 were positive interaction controls. 8 × 106 clones were screened, and 160 positive clones (AHLT+) were isolated and sequenced. Ankyrin-B Mutagenesis—Single or multiple alanine mutations were introduced into either the pAS2-1 ankyrin-B C terminus or 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Mutated regions were sequenced and then sub-cloned into original vectors to ensure no additional mutations were introduced into the vector. Random Mutagenesis—A mutant ankyrin-B C terminus library was created using GeneMorph PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene). The PCR protocol was optimized to obtain mutation frequency of 1 nucleotide mutation/ankyrin-B C terminus (∼1 kilobase). Mutagenized products were cloned into pAS2-1 vector, and clones were amplified to create a mutant library for yeast two-hybrid screening (∼19,200 clones). Yeast were co-transformed with the mutant library and pACT2 clones and plated on -LT media. Single colonies were replicated on -ALT and -AHLT plates to identify co-transformants that did not interact. Non-interacting ankyrin-B C-terminal clones were analyzed by Western blot to confirm absence of stop codons, and positive clones were then analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Clones with only one mutation were sub-cloned back into the bait plasmid, and loss-of-interaction was confirmed. Binding Assays—Human ankyrin-B C-terminal domain and human Hdj1/Hsp40 were PCR-amplified, ligated into pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences), and expressed as GST fusion proteins using standard methods. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. A fraction of the purified proteins was cleaved with Precision Protease to remove the GST tag. Cleaved proteins were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to remove aggregated protein. Purified ankyrin-B C-terminal domain (GST tag-cleaved) was labeled with Na125I using chloramine T as an oxidant (16Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5863) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, 96-well protein G-coated plates (Pierce) were incubated with 0.5 μg of affinity-purified anti-GST polyclonal IgG per well in bovine serum albumin binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 4 h at 25 °C. Wells were then washed and incubated with either 50 μl of 0.5 μm purified GST-Hdj1/Hsp40 or GST alone for control wells overnight at 4 °C, washed, and stored in the cold. Increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled ankyrin-B C-terminal domain (specific activity 125,885 cpm/pmol) were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with immobilized GST-Hdj1/Hsp40 or GST in a final volume of 50 μl. The wells were washed, broken out, and counted in a γ counter. The data were corrected for nonspecific binding at each concentration by subtracting values obtained with GST-coated wells and plotted either as bound ankyrin-B C-terminal domain versus total ankyrin-B C-terminal domain concentration (Fig. 6, left panel) or by the method of Scatchard (17Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17833) Google Scholar) (right panel). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, adult rat heart was flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder. The powder was resuspended in 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.35, 10 mm NaCl, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm 4-(2-aminomethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei. Triton X-100 and deoxycholate were added to the post-nuclear supernatant for final concentrations of 1.0% Triton X-100 and 0.5% deoxycholate. This sample was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was saved. The soluble fraction was incubated with 10 μg of Hdj1/Hsp40 Ig or control Ig coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with homogenization buffer plus 1.0% Triton X-100. Protein bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using affinity-purified ankyrin-B polyclonal Ig. Protein was detected by 125I-labeled protein A and phosphorimaging. The ribbon structure of Sis1 homodimers presented in Fig. 7 was created using PDB viewer (18Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z.

Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This predicted α-helix is missing or divergent in ankyrin-G and ankyrin-R and was of particular interest since the regulatory domain of ankyrin-B defines the specificity between ankyrins B and G in cardiomyocytes (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We performed CD spectroscopy to determine whether this small domain folded in solution. CD analysis of a synthetic peptide (amino acids 1769-1789) revealed a signature α-helix CD profile including double minima at 208 and 220 nm with a strong positive peak at 190 nm (Fig. 2A). The percent α-helix of this region was calculated at 44%. A second ankyrin-B peptide of similar length (amino acids 1677-1697) but with no predicted α-helical structure had a minimum at 204 nm, no peak at 190 nm, and a maximum calculated helix content of 11% (Fig. 2B). Both peptides were analyzed for structure in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol, since no significant α-helix structure was observed in buffer alone (50 mm NaF, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that the predicted α-helical fold actually occurs in a synthetic peptide of ankyrin-B residues 1769-1789 and is likely to be a feature of full-length ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B Loss-of-function Mutations Are Contiguous on One Surface of the Amphipathic α-Helix —We next performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the residues encompassing the amphipathic α-helix to determine the importance of surface residues on this structure for ankyrin-B function. Nineteen 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP single mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”) and confirmed to be free of additional mutations by DNA sequencing. We evaluated the functional activity of each ankyrin-B mutant based on the ability to rescue ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes display reduced frequency of spontaneous contractions, abnormal Ca2+ dynamics, and abnormal localization of InsP3 receptor, Na,K-ATPase, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger compared with neonatal cardiomyocytes derived from wild-type mice (Figs. 3A and 4, A and B; Ref. 12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These phenotypes can be restored to normal by transfection of 220-kDa ankyrin-B cDNA into the cardiomyocytes (Figs. 3A and 4C; Refs. 12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar and 13Mohler P.J.

Therefore, the ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocyte rescue assay can be used to evaluate potential ankyrin-B loss-of-function mutations. For example, expression of ankyrin-B cDNA containing the E1425G mutation found in humans with arrhythmia and sudden death is unable to rescue abnormal ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocyte phenotypes even though the transfected protein is normally expressed and properly localized (12Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Marec H.L. Bennett V.

Distance between ankyrin-B striations equals 1.8 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We expressed the 19 individual amphipathic α-helix mutants in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes. All of the 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP amphipathic helix mutants showed the same striated pattern as endogenous ankyrin-B and wild-type 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP and were expressed at levels similar to wild-type 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP (see Figs. 3B and 4). However, 5 of 19 ankyrin-B mutants (H1773A, V1777A, K1780A, K1784A, R1788A) were unable to rescue abnormal ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocyte contraction rates (Fig. 3A, n > 150 cells/mutant, p < 0.05). The five identified loss-of-function mutations do not affect folding of the α-helix, since there was no significant change in the α-helical content of a synthetic peptide (amino acids 1769-1789) with all five sites changed to alanine (Fig. 2C; 46% α-helix content). Significantly, helical wheel analysis of ankyrin-B residues 1769-1789 reveals that all 5 of the loss-of-function mutations are confined to residues located in a patch on one surface of the α-helix (arrows in the helical wheel diagram, Fig. 3C). These same five mutants (H1773A, V1777A, K1780A, K1784A, R1788A) were also the only amphipathic α-helix mutants unable to rescue the abnormal localization and expression of the ankyrin-B-associated InsP3 receptor, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 4). The specificity of mutations causing loss of function is underscored by the finding that alanine mutagenesis of nine predicted C-terminal serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in the C-terminal domain had no effect on ankyrin-B function in cardiomyocytes (data not shown). These data demonstrate that ankyrin-B residues H1773A, V1777A, K1780A, K1784A, and R1788A localized in a patch on the surface of the amphipathic α-helix play an important role in ankyrin-B function by potentially defining an interaction surface for ankyrin-B-associated proteins. The C-terminal Domain of Ankyrin-B Interacts with Hdj1/Hsp40 —In independent studies described below, we identified Hdj1/Hsp40 as an interacting partner for the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain and found that Hdj1/Hsp40 associates with the same surface of the amphipathic helix identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. These experiments began with a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart library using the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain (death domain plus regulatory domain) as bait to identify ankyrin-B-specific interacting proteins. The corresponding C-terminal domain of ankyrin-G was used as a negative-control bait, and only clones that specifically interacted with ankyrin-B C-terminal domains were pursued. We identified 160 clones that encoded members of the type 2 Hsp40 family of co-chaperones in a screen of >1.5 million independent clones (Fig. 5A). 123/160 clones were Hdj1/Hsp40, and the others were the closely related Hlj1 and hHsp40-3. The ankyrin-G C-terminal domain did not interact with Hdj1/Hsp40 or related proteins in a screen of >1.5 million clones. Additionally, a full-length Hdj1/Hsp40 clone did not interact with the ankyrin-G C-terminal domain bait plasmid when co-transformed into yeast (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that Hdj1/Hsp40 specifically interacts with the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain in yeast. We evaluated the potential interaction between ankyrin-B and Hdj1/Hsp40 in heart by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Detergent-soluble extracts of adult rat heart were incubated with immobilized Hdj1/Hsp40 antibody or control Ig. After washes, bound protein was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using affinity-purified ankyrin-B polyclonal Ig. Hdj1/Hsp40 co-immunoprecipitates a significant fraction (∼12%) of 220-kDa ankyrin-B from detergent-soluble extracts from rat heart (Fig. 5B). Therefore, 220-kDa ankyrin-B and Hdj1/Hsp40 interact in vivo. We next analyzed interaction of the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain with Hdj1/Hsp40 in solution using purified proteins. We expressed and purified full-length Hdj1/Hsp40 as a GST fusion protein. The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain was also expressed as a GST fusion protein and then was digested with Precision Protease to remove the GST tag. Once cleaved and purified, the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain was 125I-labeled for binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). 125I-Labeled ankyrin-B C-terminal domain binds to GST-Hdj1/Hsp40 in a saturable manner with a Kd of 53 nm (Fig. 6). GST alone was used as a negative control, and these values were subtracted to give specific binding. These results together with the yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation data indicate a direct high affinity interaction between Hdj1/Hsp40 and the regulatory domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay with domains of Hdj1/Hsp40 as bait to determine the specific site of interaction with ankyrin-B. Hdj1/Hsp40 contains an N-terminal 78-amino acid J domain critical for association with Hsp70 chaperones, a G/F (glycine/phenylalanine) domain, two C-terminal domains (CTD), and a predicted dimerization domain (Fig. 7A), (19Sha B. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Ohtsuka K. Hata M. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2000; 16: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). We, therefore, generated nine different Hdj1/Hsp40 types of bait corresponding to each major domain and combinations of domains of the full-length protein (i.e. J domain only, J domain plus G/F domain, etc.; Fig. 7B). Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that although bait containing only the J domain or the G/F domain is unable to bind the ankyrin-B C terminus, the CTD1/CTD2 bait contains full ankyrin-B binding activity. In contrast, isolated CTD1 or CTD2 domains are inactive (Fig. 7B). Additionally, the C-terminal dimerization domain was not required for the ankyrin-B interaction in yeast. The atomic structure of the Hsp40 ortholog Sis1 predicts the formation of Hdj1/Hsp40 homodimers mediated by CTD1/CTD2/DD domains, forming a ∼40-Å-wide “wishbone” cavity (Fig. 7C; Refs. 22Abdul K.M. Terada K. Gotoh T. Hafizur R.M. Mori M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 23Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the cavity created by the CTD1 and CTD2 domains likely forms the binding pocket for ankyrin-B. Hdj1/Hsp40 Interacts with the Functional Surface of the Amphipathic α-Helix of Ankyrin-B—We used an unbiased random mutagenesis approach to define the Hsp40/Hdj1 binding site in the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain. A mutant ankyrin-B C-terminal domain library was created using PCR mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The PCR protocol was optimized to obtain a mutation frequency of one nucleotide mutation/ankyrin-B C terminus (1 mutation/1 kilobase). Yeast were co-transformed with the mutant library, and non-interacting ankyrin-B C-terminal clones that expressed full-length protein were analyzed by sequencing. Clones with only one mutation were sub-cloned back into the bait plasmid, and loss of interaction was confirmed. This screen of a randomly mutagenized library (>19,000 clones) yielded two loss-of-binding mutations in the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain, H1773D and K1780L. Interestingly, both H1773 and K1780 are localized to the loss-of-function surface of the amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous results using H1773A and K1780A (Fig. 3), both H1773D and K1780L are loss-of-function mutations when analyzed in ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes for the ability to rescue abnormal spontaneous contraction rates (Fig. 8A) or abnormal localization of the InsP3 receptor (Fig. 8B). The ubiquitous expression of ankyrin polypeptides and their diversity in protein partners suggests that ankyrin-based pathways for targeting ion channels and transporters are likely utilized in many different contexts in metazoan cells. However, different ankyrin genes and most of their reported alternatively spliced variants display very similar primary structures in their membrane binding domains and would be expected to bind equivalently to membrane partners such as the Na,K-ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and InsP3 receptor. Therefore, a major issue in moving from in vitro interactions to physiological functions of ankyrins is the basis for specificity between the structurally similar ankyrin gene products. We previously identified the divergent C-terminal regulatory domain of ankyrin-B as a key determinant for regulating ankyrin-B specificity in cardiomyocytes (13Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our new data provide the first insight into the molecular basis for specificity between ankyrin-based pathways by defining key residues on a surface of an amphipathic α-helix structure in the divergent C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B and identifying Hdj1/Hsp40 as the first downstream target for ankyrin-B-specific function. Hdj1/Hsp40 is a member of a large family of molecular chaperones (24 in vertebrates) expressed in a variety of tissues (including heart) that have numerous functions, including regulation of protein folding, protein trafficking, and clathrin un-coating (20Ohtsuka K. Hata M. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2000; 16: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Abdul K.M. Terada K. Gotoh T. Hafizur R.M. Mori M.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hdj1/Hsp40 polypeptides can function independently or in collaboration with other chaperones (23Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 24Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 26Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). For example, the function of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 is tightly coupled to its intrinsic ATPase activity, which is normally quite weak. Binding of Hsp70 to the J domain of Hdj1/Hsp40 induces a conformational change in the structure of Hsp70, increasing its ability to hydrolyze ATP and affect target proteins (23Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In fact, both activities are required for normal folding and maturation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (27Farinha C.M. Nogueira P. Mendes F. Penque D. Amaral M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 797-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ankyrin-B, by direct interactions with Hdj1/Hsp40, may target Hsp70 to intermediates in the cellular assembly of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Na,K-ATPase, and InsP3 receptor. Our data demonstrate that ankyrin-B residues 1773, 1777, 1780, 1784, and 1788 on one surface of the amphipathic α-helix are critical for ankyrin-B function. Although our structural data suggest that alanine mutagenesis of these residues does not effect the folding of the helix, our results do not address whether the structure of the helix itself is critical for ankyrin-B function. However, given the established principles of protein folding, it is likely that if surface residues of a helix are required for ankyrin-B function, the helix fold is also required. Future experiments to disrupt helix formation could directly evaluate the role of the helix structure in ankyrin-B function. However, these results would be difficult to interpret due to other potential consequences of mis-folding. Additionally, although our data are consistent with a role for ankyrin-BHsp40/Hdj1 interactions in cardiomyocyte function, we cannot definitively state that mutations to one surface of the amphipathic α-helix affect cardiomyocyte function in vivo solely due to loss of Hsp40/Hdj1 binding. The α-helix surface (residues 1773, 1777, 1780, 1784, and 1788) may also associate with signaling proteins such as GTPases or protein kinases, which may not be easily detected in conventional yeast two-hybrid assays (28El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol.

The giant Rho-guanine exchage factor obscurin has been reported to bind to a similar but not identical site in small ankyrin-1 (30Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Jones E.M. Van Rossum D.B. Bloch R.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ankyrin-B amphipathic α-helix and surrounding residues may accommodate multiple protein interactions to regulate ankyrin-B function. Ankyrins have been classically viewed as static “membrane scaffolds” that link membrane-associated proteins to the underlying spectrin-based cytoskeleton based on the role of ankyrin-R in the red blood cell (32Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2533-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J.

The interaction with the molecular chaperone Hdj1/Hsp40 described in this study suggests that ankyrin-B may also function as a direct participant in biosynthesis and assembly of its target membrane proteins. Moreover, 190-kDa ankyrin-G has recently been shown using small interfering RNA to be required for biogenesis of the lateral membrane of polarized human bronchial epithelial cells (34Kizhatil K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16706-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These two new studies suggest unanticipated proactive roles for ankyrins in assembly of membrane domains."
https://openalex.org/W1972801247,"Cyclin G is one of the earliest p53 target genes to be identified, but its function in the p53 pathway has been elusive. Although the precise mechanisms of cyclin G in this novel network have not been explored, recent studies have demonstrated that cyclin G is a key regulator of the p53-Mdm2 network. Here we present evidence that cyclin G-mediated p53 regulation is dependent upon the status of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, which activates p53 in response to DNA damage. Abrogation of cyclin G enhances p53 accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser-15 residue, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Ectopically expressed cyclin G significantly reduces the steady-state levels of p53 as well as that of phosphorylated p53 at Ser-15 after DNA damage in normal human dermal fibroblasts containing normal ATM. However, cyclin G does not cause similar reductions in p53 levels in ATM-mutated cells. We also show that translocation of cyclin G to the nucleus requires functional ATM. Thus, our findings identify a new role of cyclin G in ATM-dependent p53 regulation and in cell cycle regulation during DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1972004676,"Abnormally suppressed levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are associated with aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer and contribute to uncontrolled proliferation. The androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP-104R1, ALVA31 and PC-3, express low levels of the CKI, p21(CIP1), compared to the less-malignant, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. We investigated the mechanism underlying this suppression by examining the role of Rho GTPases, signaling proteins that play important roles in cell cycle progression, at least in part through regulation of CKIs. Inhibition of Rac1 induced p21 expression in androgen-independent lines but had no effect on the higher p21 levels characteristic of LNCaP cells. This induction of p21 was functionally significant as evidenced by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity and decreased cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 suppressed the higher p21 levels seen in LNCaP cells. Thus, Rac1 activity is both necessary and sufficient for suppression of p21 in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, Rac1 activity was significantly higher in all three androgen-independent cell lines compared to LNCaP cells. Thus in three models of aggressive human prostate cancer, hyperactivity of Rac1 corresponds to suppressed levels of p21. These results are unique in describing a role for Rac1 in p21 regulation and may implicate the Rac1 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for controlling prostate cancer cell growth following progression to androgen independence."

Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeboflagellate of soil and freshwater habitats throughout the world. Although the trophozoites are able to fulfil their life cycle without the intervention of a parasitic stage, they can invade the human brain via the nasal mucosa and olfactory nerve and cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (1Marciano-Cabral F.

This disease is characterized by massive host tissue destruction indicating that the cytolytic activity of the amoebae is a major factor for their pathogenicity.

The amoebic cytolytic capacity has been attributed mainly to pore-forming molecules that have been identified more than a decade ago (4Young J.D. Lowrey D.M. J. Biol.

Recently, we characterized at the molecular level naegleriapores A and B, proteins that potently display pore-forming activity that kills prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic target cells (5Herbst R.

According to the respective transcripts, both naegleriapores were processed from larger precursor structures, each of which contains several naegleriapore isoforms that share the structural motif of six invariant cysteine residues within their highly diverse amino acid sequences. The precursor molecule of naegleriapore A contains three isoforms, and that of naegleriapore B contains five isoforms (5Herbst R. Ott C. Jacobs T. Marti T. Marciano-Cabral F. Leippe M. J. Biol.

For convenience, the putative isoforms within the precursor molecules were designated according to their location on the precursor of naegleriapore A as A1–A3 and on that of naegleriapore B as B1–B5. Isoforms A2 and B1 represent proteins that have been isolated recently by us according to their pore-forming activity (5Herbst R. Ott C. Jacobs T. Marti T. Marciano-Cabral F. Leippe M. J. Biol.

As the existence, fate, and function of additional naegleriapores contained in the precursor molecules are unclear, we initiated a survey pursuant to their identification in crude extracts of N. fowleri. To detect naegleriapore-like peptides without prominent pore-forming activity at the protein level, we screened for small cysteine-rich proteins by fluorescently labeling their cysteine residues. Using this approach, we identified three novel isoforms, which are apparently proteolytically released from the precursor molecule of naegleriapore B. Two of the isoforms could be purified to homogeneity and in sufficient quantity to allow for testing of their pore-forming capacity and antibacterial activity. Amoebae—A highly virulent strain of N. fowleri (ATCC 30894), LE-Emp, was used in this investigation. Samples of brain tissue from infected mice containing amoebae were cultured at 37 °C in Oxoid medium supplemented with serum and hemin to obtain the amoebae. The amoebae were cultured axenically for 4 days prior to use (1Marciano-Cabral F. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 114-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Freshly harvested and washed amoebae were extracted with 5 volumes of 10% acetic acid overnight at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was passed through a C18 12-ml (2 g) Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the adsorbed material was eluted stepwise with 30–100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml for each 10% step). Each fraction was analyzed for cysteine-rich small proteins in the range of 5–20 kDa.

Naegleriapores B1, B4, B2, and B5 were eluted with 52, 56, 62, and 65% acetonitrile, respectively, from the column. Detection of Cysteine-rich Proteins—Proteins of each fraction obtained during the purification process were tested for cysteine-rich peptides using the fluorescent dye monobromobimane (MBBr, Sigma) (6O'Keefe D.O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The proteins were lyophilized briefly, resuspended in 200 mm Tris, 1% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, followed by denaturation at 70 °C for 20 min. After the samples were cooled to room temperature, MBBr was added to a final concentration of 6 mm, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped with 10 mm cysteine, and the proteins were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Excessive MBBr was washed out of the gel with 50% methanol, and cysteine-rich peptides were detected under UV light as bright fluorescent bands. Protein Analysis and N-terminal Sequencing—Tricine-SDS-PAGE was performed according to Schägger and von Jagow (7Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) using 13% separation gels. For N-terminal sequencing, peptides purified by reversed phase HPLC were analyzed using a gas phase protein sequencer (model 437 A, Applied Biosystems). The method applied did not allow for the unequivocal detection of cysteine residues. The concentration of purified naegleriapores was determined by measuring absorbance at 214 nm. The extinction coefficients were calculated using the respective sequence information (8Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pore-forming Activity Assay—The pore-forming activity of the samples was determined by measuring fluorometrically the dissipation of a valinomycin-induced membrane potential in liposomes (9Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model LS 50B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 620 and 670 nm, respectively. Pore-forming activity was measured as the initial change in fluorescence intensity over time after adding the sample. One unit of activity was defined as a fluorescence increase to 5% of the prevalinomycin intensity in 1 min at 25 °C. Antibacterial Assay—The bacterial strains used were Bacillus subtilis (strain 60015) (10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 10145). The bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and subsequently inoculated in LB medium for growth to mid-logarithmic phase. After centrifugation, the bacteria were washed twice with, and resuspended in, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 25 mm NaCl. A 96-well microtiter plate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) was precoated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min prior to use in the assay. Peptides in 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid were 2-fold serial diluted in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl. 1 × 105 bacteria (25 μl) were incubated with the diluted peptides (25 μl) and 2 μm of the fluorescent dye Sytox green (50 μl; in 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl) (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 1 h. Compromised bacterial cytoplasmic membranes allowed the dye to cross this membrane and to intercalate with the DNA. When excited at 495 nm, the binding of the dye to DNA results in an increase of emitted fluorescence at 538 nm; this was measured in a fluoroscan II microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The antibacterial activity of the peptides was expressed as percent of permeabilized bacteria. For maximum permeabilization of the bacteria (100% value), cells were incubated with 70% ethanol for 5 min. Cecropins A and B were purchased from Sigma as synthetic peptides and used as positive controls. Identification and Purification of Small Cysteine-rich Proteins—To identify small cysteine-rich proteins in extracts of N. fowleri, the cysteine residues of the proteins in each fraction obtained during the purification process were labeled with the fluorescent dye MBBr. The bright fluorescence compared with the amount of protein loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel suggested the presence of numerous cysteine residues within their amino acid sequence. Several fluorescent proteins in the range of 5–25 kDa were eluted stepwise from a hydrophobic solid phase matrix. These proteins were purified further using reversed phase HPLC and subsequently were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Altogether, 11 proteins were analyzed, and 4 of 11 were identified as naegleriapores B1, B2, B4, and B5 by their N-terminal sequence. All naegleriapores were found in the 60–80% acetonitrile fraction eluted from the hydrophobic matrix column. The elution profile of the final purification step is shown (Fig. 1A). From the HPLC elution profile, the relative amount of naegleriapore isoforms B2, B4, and B5 in the amoebic extracts was estimated to be 0.6, 0.3, and 0.6, respectively, when compared with B1. The peptides possessed apparent molecular masses of 13, 7, 10, and 10 kDa, respectively, as judged by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that virtually all peptides originating from the precursor molecule of naegleriapore B are proteolytically released (Fig. 2) and are present as mature peptides in crude extracts of N. fowleri.Fig. 2Schematic presentation of the processing of mature peptides from the precursor molecule (A) and alignment of the amino acid sequences of the different naegleriapore B isoforms (B).A, the five naegleriapore B isoforms within the precursor molecule are interrupted by spacer regions (dark gray). Naegleriapore B3 (light gray and question mark) was not purified from crude amoebic extract. Signal peptides of the precursors are shown in black. Potential N-glycosylation sites and those proven experimentally for isoform B1 are represented by Y. B, naegleriapore B isoforms were aligned with saposins A–D.

N-Glycosylation motifs are shaded in dark gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Biological Activity—Two of the three new isoforms, naegleriapores B2 and B5, were purified to homogeneity and tested for their pore-forming activity. The specific pore-forming activities of naegleriapores B2 and B5 were 0.2 ± 0.05 units pmol–1 (n = 4) and 0.4 ± 0.05 units pmol–1 (n = 4), respectively, which are 10–20-fold lower than that of the major isoform naegleriapore B1 (4.1 ± 1.0 units pmol–1, n = 3) measured in parallel. The primary task of naegleriapores is thought to be the rapid killing of engulfed bacteria. Therefore, we tested the antibacterial activities of naegleriapores B1, B2, and B5 against B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa in comparison with cecropins A and B (Fig. 3). Naegleriapores B1 and B2 exerted potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive B. subtilis, which was comparable with that of the well known cecropins. However, they were less potent against Gram-negative P. aeruginosa. The permeabilization of bacterial membranes was also detectable for isoform B5, but the activity displayed was lower. The pore-forming peptides naegleriapores A2 and B1 of N. fowleri are encoded in larger multipeptide precursor structures. As no other entities displaying pore-forming activities have been detected after separation of amoebic extracts, it remained unclear whether all of the peptides were released from the precursor molecules. When we began a survey to identify the other naegleriapore-like peptides at the protein level, we used an alternative approach, which entailed screening for small cysteinerich peptides. Three additional naegleriapore B isoforms were identified by N-terminal sequencing. With the exception of the pore-forming naegleriapore A (i.e. isoform A2), we were not able to identify additional isoforms arising from the second precursor structure. The unexpected finding that several mature peptides derived from a single precursor molecule were not present in equimolar amounts in crude extracts may be due to different stabilities of these peptides against degradation processes mediated by proteases. Naegleriapore B1 is a glycoprotein containing two glycan moieties (5Herbst R. Ott C. Jacobs T. Marti T. Marciano-Cabral F. Leippe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22353-22360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is likely that naegleriapores B2 and B5 are glycoproteins as well because (i) both peptides contain a putative N-glycosylation motif within the N-terminal region of their respective amino acid sequences, and (ii) they display a migration behavior upon SDS-PAGE similar to that of naegleriapore A (5Herbst R. Ott C. Jacobs T. Marti T. Marciano-Cabral F. Leippe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22353-22360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which possesses one glycan moiety and hence migrates at a higher molecular mass than calculated from its primary structure. Naegleriapores B3 and B4 do not possess an N-glycosylation motif within their amino acid sequences. The aforementioned N-terminal N-glycosylation motif of naegleriapores is situated at the same position as in other SAPLIPs, e.g. saposins A, B, and D, and in surfactant protein B (see Fig. 2). Deglycosylation of naegleriapores A2 and B1 and saposin B does not have a negative effect on their respective activities (5Herbst R. Ott C. Jacobs T. Marti T. Marciano-Cabral F. Leippe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22353-22360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Martin B.M. Fluharty A.L. Hirabayashi Y. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, for the latter, it was found that the absence of the sugar moiety led to aberrant folding, rendering the protein metabolically unstable (11Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Martin B.M. Fluharty A.L. Hirabayashi Y. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We suggest that the degree of glycosylation of naegleriapores may reflect their stability against degradation by proteases and may account for the variant amounts of the different isoforms in crude amoebic extracts. Interestingly, the missing naegleriapore A isoforms 1 and 3 do not possess a glycosylation motif at the assigned position. The organization of several SAPLIP elements within one precursor molecule is not a unique feature of naegleriapores, as saposins A–D and the surfactant-associated protein B also are proteolytically processed from a multipeptide molecule (12Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Galdzicka M. Fluharty A.L. Ginns E.I. Martin B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Hiraiwa M. Martin B.M. Kishimoto Y.

The processing of multiple antibacterial peptides from one large precursor molecule may constitute an efficient mode for the simultaneous synthesis of different effector molecules, thereby resulting in amplification of the antibacterial response and an expansion of the target cell spectrum. This strategy is found with other antibacterial peptides as well, e.g. magainins from frog skin and the apidaecins from honey bees (16Zasloff M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Terry A.S. Poulter L. Williams D.H. Nutkins J.C. Giovannini M.G. Moore C.H. Gibson B.W. J. Biol.

It may reflect the continuous “arms race” between the high mutational rate of microorganisms and the protective armament of potential host organisms, in this case the amoebae. Notably, the primary translation products of members of the SAPLIP family with antibacterial and cytolytic activity from other species known so far, e.g. amoebapores, disparpores, NK-lysin and granulysin (10Leippe M.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), contain a single SAPLIP element. Assaying the activity spectrum of naegleriapores against a broad variety of target cells was not possible because of the minute amounts of proteins that can be purified from the natural source. The novel naegleriapore B isoforms exert poor pore-forming activity (not due to their different glycosylation states, as already mentioned above). All naegleriapore isoforms tested exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Collectively, our results confirm our postulate that the naegleriapores that display high poreforming activity, i.e. the isoforms A2 and B1, constitute the unrivaled cytolytic factors of Naegleria and that they represent a component of the archaic antimicrobial system of a free-living bacteria-hunting amoeba, which may, incidentally, also be instrumental in the fatal parasitic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2058923421,"We showed previously that exogenous overexpression of C3G, a guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GEF) for Rap1 and R-Ras proteins, blocks the focus-forming activity of cotransfected, activated, sis, ras and v-raf oncogenes in NIH 3T3 cells. In this report, we show that C3G also interferes with dbl and R-Ras focus-forming activity and demonstrate that the transformation suppressor ability of C3G maps to its Crk-binding region (SH3-b domain). Using full-length C3G and C3GΔCat mutant, lacking catalytic domain, we showed here that overexpression of cotransfected C3G or C3GΔCat inhibited oncogenic Hraslys12-mediated phosphorylation of ERK, without altering Ras and Raf-1 kinase activation. We also showed that, overexpressed C3G and C3GΔCat inhibited the viability of oncogenic Ras-induced colonies in soft agar, indicating that C3G interferes with the anchorage-independent growth of Ras-transformed cells in a Rap1-independent manner. Consistent with both observations, overexpression of exogenous C3G and C3GΔCat also caused downregulation of Ras-induced cyclin A expression. Altogether, our results indicate that C3G interferes with at least two separate aspects of oncogenic transformation – cell cycle progression and loss of contact inhibition – and that these inhibitory effects probably account for its transformation suppressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1998302098,"In an earlier study designed to investigate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in synovial sarcomas (SSs), we applied a cDNA microarray to detect human genes with significantly increased expression in SS cells. Among the genes selected in this way, we identified a novel transcript, subsequently designated PDZK4 (PDZ domain-containing 4), that was specifically upregulated in all of the 13 SS cases we examined. On Northern blots of normal human tissues, the PDZK4 transcript was expressed only in fetal brain. Immunocytochemical staining of transfected COS7 cells showed that the PDZK4 gene product localized mainly under the plasma membrane. Treatment of human SS cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the expression of PDZK4 and resulted in the suppression of tumor-cell growth. Induction of exogenous PDZK4 expression promoted growth of T98G and COS7 cells in which no endogenous expression of PDZK4 was observed. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that inappropriate expression of PDZK4 might play an important role in the proliferation of SS cells and that the gene might be a suitable molecular target for designing of novel drugs to treat SS patients."
https://openalex.org/W1967075618,"The effects of spermine on peptidyltransferase inhibition by an aminohexosylcytosine nucleoside, blasticidin S, and by a macrolide, spiramycin, were investigated in a model system derived from Escherichia coli, in which a peptide bond is formed between puromycin and AcPhe-tRNA bound at the P-site of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes. Kinetics revealed that blasticidin S, after a transient phase of interference with the A-site, is slowly accommodated near to the P-site so that peptide bond is still formed but with a lower catalytic rate constant. At high concentrations of blasticidin S (>10 × Ki), a second drug molecule binds to a weaker binding site on ribosomes, and this may account for the onset of a subsequent mixed-noncompetitive inhibition phase. Spermine enhances the blasticidin S inhibitory effect by facilitating the drug accommodation to both sites. On the other hand, spiramycin (A) was found competing with puromycin for the A-site of AcPhe-tRNA·poly(U)·70 S ribosomal complex (C) via a two-step mechanism, according to which the fast formation of the encounter complex CA is followed by a slow isomerization to a tighter complex, termed C*A. In contrast to that observed with blasticidin S, spermine reduced spiramycin potency by decreasing the formation and stability of complex C*A. Polyamine effects on drug binding were more pronounced when a mixture of spermine and spermidine was used, instead of spermine alone. Our kinetic results correlate well with cross-linking and crystallographic data and suggest that polyamines bound at the vicinity of the antibiotic binding pockets modulate diversely the interaction of these drugs with ribosomes.

Blasticidin S and spiramycin are representatives of two distinct antibiotic families, the aminohexosylcytosine nucleosides and the 16-membered lactone ring macrolides, respectively, both of which have been proposed to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the large ribosomal subunit. Blasticidin S consists of a cytosine bonded to a pyranose ring, to which an amino acid-like substituent is attached (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it is not surprising that blasticidin S and puromycin have been considered as iso-structural, both with one another and with the 3′-end of aminoacyl-tRNA (1Theocharis D.A. Kalpaxis D.L.

Biochem. 1986; 154: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a fact supporting the notion that blasticidin S influences, at least transiently, the affinity of the A-site. Further support derives from chemical probing studies in Escherichia coli ribosomes (7Rodriguez-Fonseca C. Amils R. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that blasticidin S protects A2439, one of the three nucleosides in domain V of 23 S rRNA, which show altered chemical reactivity on removal of the aminoacyl group from A-site-bound tRNAs (8Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Moreover, A2439 is one of the preferable cross-linking sites for A-site bound Phe-tRNA bearing a photoreactive group attached to its aminoacyl terminus (9Mitchell P. Stade K. Osswald M. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, the reactivity of A2439 is also affected by P-site-bound Phe-tRNA, and A2439 is susceptible to cross-linking by P-site-bound Phe-tRNA. The situation is further complicated by the finding of a recent crystallographic study in Haloarcula marismortui, revealing that blasticidin S binds at two, nonoverlapping sites, with different affinities (10Hansen J.L. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the primary binding site (see Fig. 2A, site occupied by blasticidin I), the cytosine residue of blasticidin S is base-paired with G2251 (E. coli numbering). Further stabilization of the binding is conferred by hydrogen bonding of the N-methylguanidinium tail of blasticidin S with the backbone phosphates of A2439 and A2600. At this position, blasticidin S superimposes on C75 of a P-site-bound tRNA. In the secondary site (see Fig. 2A, site occupied by blasticidin II), the cytosine base of blasticidin S forms a base pair with G2252, thereby mimicking C74 of a P-site substrate. Therefore, we should expect that blasticidin S might inhibit peptide bond formation by competing with the P-site substrate.Fig. 2The binding site of blasticidin S and spiramycin on the 50 S ribosomal subunit.A, binding positions of blasticidin S (purple) on the H. marismortui 50 S ribosomal subunit, with nucleoside residues of the P-loop (upper right) and of helices H74 (bottom) and H93 (left) indicated (pdb 1KC8 (10Hansen J.L.

In the binding site of higher affinity (occupied by blasticidin I) the cytidine group of the drug base pairs with G2251 of the P-loop, while the N-methylguanidinium tail stacks hydrophobically on the base of A2439 and hydrogen-bonds (dotted lines) with the backbone phosphates of A2439 and A2600.

This is consistent with the long standing view that spiramycin acts during the early stages of protein synthesis by blocking the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel (13Spahn C.M.T. Prescott C.D. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a process that may also induce destabilization and premature dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs from the ribosome (14Menninger J.R. Otto D.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that 16-membered macrolides also exhibit an inhibitory effect on 50 S ribosomal subunit assembly (15Champney W.S. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2001; 1: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, spiramycin can inhibit peptide bond formation in most model cell-free systems by direct blocking the PTase activity (11Poulsen S.M. Kofoed C. Vester B. J. Mol.

This surprising effect seems to be due to the mycaminose/mycarose moiety of spiramycin, a disaccharide attached to the C5 position of the antibiotic (Fig. 1), which extending toward the catalytic center inserts into the A-site hydrophobic crevice (Fig. 2B).

Med. 1996; 74: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), are in agreement with this consideration.In the course of binding studies, most analyses have assumed that the interaction of ribosomes (R) with either blasticidin S or spiramycin (I) can be expressed by a fast equilibrium of the form, R + I ⇆ RI. However, this concession cannot justify the binding of blasticidin S at two, nonoverlapping sites, nor can it explain the strengthening of spiramycin potency after preincubation of ribosomes with the drug (16Dinos G. Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10638-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Experiments from more than 30 years ago have also indicated that the ionic environment is an essential factor that influences both the PTase activity and the interaction of antibiotics with ribosomes (18Vogel Z. Vogel T. Zamir A. Elson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Teraoka H. Tanaka K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Notably, spermine has been found to inhibit the interaction of ribosomes with erythromycin, an antibiotic sharing a set of common binding features with spiramycin (11Poulsen S.M. Kofoed C. Vester B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the effect of polyamines on the mode of action of blasticidin S and spiramycin has never been investigated.In the present study, we utilize the puromycin reaction, a model reaction for peptide bond formation, under polyamine buffer conditions. By analyzing the peptide bond formation as a pseudo-first-order reaction, we reveal that blasticidin S, after a transient competitive phase, is slowly accommodated near to the P-site. By anchoring to this site, blasticidin S reduces the reactivity of P-site bound AcPhe-tRNA. At higher antibiotic concentrations, a second molecule of blasticidin S is attached to a secondary binding site, leading to mixed-noncompetitive inhibition. We also demonstrate that spiramycin interacts with ribosomes via a two-step mechanism, behaving as a slow binding inhibitor, namely the drug induces a slow conformational change in the ribosome upon binding, and this conformational change affects both the binding affinity and the pattern of inhibition. Polyamines attached in close proximity to the binding sites of blasticidin S and spiramycin affect the potency of these drugs differentially; they promote the inhibitory effect of blasticidin S but impair that of spiramycin. Our results are discussed in view of current crystallographic advances on the localization of these drugs on ribosomes.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Materials—Puromycin dihydrochloride (disodium salt), spermine tetrahydrochloride, spermidine trihydrochloride, DMS, DMS stop solution, heterogeneous tRNA from E. coli, spiramycin (mixture of spiramycins I, II, and III) were purchased from Sigma. Blasticidin S was kindly provided by Prof. H. Yonehara (University of Tokyo, Japan). l-[2,3,4,5,6,-3H]Phenylalanine and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and RNase H were obtained from Roche Diagnostics and Promega (Madison, WI), respectively. dNTPs and ddNTPs were from Roche Applied Science. Cellulose nitrate filters (type HA; 0.45-μm pore size) were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). ABA-spermine was synthesized and purified according to Clark et al. (20Clark E. Swank R.A. Morgan J.E. Basu H. Matthews H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Biochemical Preparations—Salt-washed (0.5 m NH4Cl) 70 S ribosomes and partially purified translation factors were obtained from E. coli CAN20–12E cells as described elsewhere (6Kalpaxis D.L. Theocharis D.A. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Complex C, i.e. the Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA·poly(U)·70 S ribosome complex, was prepared in buffer A (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing partially purified translation factors and separated from excess Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA as reported previously (21Drainas D. Kalpaxis D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When desired, 100 μm spermine or 50 μm spermine and 2 mm spermidine were also included in buffer A. In the purified product, ∼20% of the used ribosomes were in the form of complex C. This fraction was almost fully reactive toward puromycin.Photo-affinity Labeling, Chemical Modification, and Mapping of ABA-Spermine Cross-linking Sites in 23 S rRNA—Complex C was photolabeled with 100 μm ABA-spermine as described previously (22Amarantos I. Zarkadis I.K. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After irradiation, the excess of ABA-spermine was inactivated by reduction with 100 μm dithiothreitol and removed from complex C by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and microdialysis (22Amarantos I. Zarkadis I.K. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Identification of spermine cross-linking sites was made by primer extension analysis (22Amarantos I. Zarkadis I.K. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chemical modification of labeled or nonlabeled complex C with DMS was made as reported (22Amarantos I. Zarkadis I.K. Kalpaxis D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Puromycin Reaction—The reaction between photolabeled or untreated complex C and puromycin (S) was carried out at 25 °C in buffer A. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 5.2 pmol of ribosomes in the form of complex C, and puromycin at concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 2 mm. When required, 100 μm spermine or 50 μm spermine and 2 mm spermidine were also included in the reaction mixture. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 1 m NaOH. The product, AcPhe-puromycin (P), was extracted in ethyl acetate, and its radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The product was expressed as the percentage (x) of complex C added in the reaction mixture. Control experiments without puromycin were run in parallel, and the values obtained were subtracted. The blank values were about 2 and did not vary by more than 10%. In the absence of polyamines, complex C was relatively unstable. In this case, the percentage x was corrected by dividing its value with factor A (21Drainas D. Kalpaxis D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Factor A equals the amount of surviving complex C at the end of each incubation period divided by the amount of complex C at zero time. By this correction, the degradation of complex C during the puromycin reaction was erased. Among the several species formed during complex C preparation, only poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosome complexes with AcPhe-tRNA bound at the P-site could react with puromycin. The radioactive noise of other species, except for complex C, was corrected by dividing the x values by the extent of puromycin reaction (23Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), before fitting these values into the integrated rate law. Thus, complex C was normalized to the same baseline at which 100% of the bound AcPhe-tRNA reacts quantitatively with puromycin. The introduction of the above-mentioned corrections made the first-order-time plots for puromycin reaction linear up to over 95% depletion of complex C. Such linear time plots are a prerequisite for pseudo-first-order kinetic analysis (24Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York, NY1993: 39, 170-43, 202Google Scholar). Since puromycin in the reaction mixture was in excess to complex C, the reaction, C+S⇄KsCS→ksC'+P followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. In the above kinetic scheme, C′ represents a modified species of complex C, stripped of Ac[3H]Phe-tRNA, and thus unable to react with puromycin for a second cycle. At each concentration of puromycin, the pseudo-first-order rate constant, kobs, was determined by fitting the corrected x values into Equation 1, ln100100−x=kobs⋅t (Eq. 1) where t is the reaction time. As justified by Synetos and Coutsogeorgopoulos (23Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the kobs value is related to the puromycin concentration by the relationship in Equation 2. kobs=k3[S]/(KS+[S]) (Eq. 2) The values of k3 and KS were estimated by nonlinear regression fitting (Microcal Origin, Version: 5.00, provided by Microcal Software, Inc.) of kobs and [S] values to Equation 2.Inhibition of Puromycin Reaction by Blasticidin S or Spiramycin—In this series of experiments, the reaction buffer also contained each one of the antibiotics. The range of blasticidin S and spiramycin concentrations used was from 0.2 μm to 12 μm and from 0.1 μm to 2 μm, respectively. Therefore, the antibiotic depletion by vacant ribosomes was negligible; at least 97% of the antibiotic concentration used was available to bind complex C. In these experiments, biphasic ln[100/(100 - x)] against time plots were obtained. The slope of the straight line going through the origin was called initial slope and was taken as a measure of the apparent rate constant, (kobs)o, at the early phase of the reaction. Similarly, the slope of the second straight line was taken as the value of the apparent rate constant, (kobs)s, at the late phase of the puromycin reaction.Inactivation of Complex C by Spiramycin—The reaction of complex C with spiramycin in the absence of puromycin was examined as described previously (16Dinos G. Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10638-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Briefly, 5.2 pmol of complex C in buffer A or polyamine buffer (1 ml) reacted with specified concentrations of spiramycin for the desired times of exposure. The percentage (x′) of the remaining active complex C, after removing the excess spiramycin, was determined by titration with puromycin (2 mm for 2 min, at 25 °C). For each concentration of spiramycin, ln x′ was plotted against time. The apparent rate constant of inactivation, kin, was estimated from the slope of those plots.Determination of the Regeneration Rate Constant of Complex C*A (Complex C Inactivated by Spiramycin)—Following the formation of C*A complex (see Kinetic Scheme III), the reversibility of the slow binding step was monitored by filtration of C*A complex through cellulose nitrate filter, after which the filter was immersed in 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 2 mm puromycin for several time intervals. The rate constant of the enzymatic activity regain, koff, was measured from the slope of the obtained ln[100/(100 - x′)] against time plot at the steady state. In this case, the variable x′ expresses the enzymatic activity regained as a percentage of complex C added.RESULTSInhibition of Peptide Bond Formation at Low Concentrations of Blasticidin S ([I] < 3 × Ki)—The progress curve of AcPhe-puromycin synthesis carried out in buffer A, is expressed by a straight line at each concentration of puromycin. A representative plot obtained at 200 μm puromycin is given in Fig. 3A (upper line). However, when puromycin reaction is performed in the presence of blasticidin S, an early as well as a late phase can be clearly seen in the progress curves (Fig. 3A, three lower lines), a fact that reveals a delay in the onset of inhibition. In agreement with a previous study performed at 10 mm Mg2+ and 100 mmNH4+ (6Kalpaxis D.L. Theocharis D.A. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), analysis of the initial slopes by DR plotting (1/(kobs)oversus 1/[S]) and slope-replotting (slope of DR plots versus [I]), not shown, confirms that blasticidin S behaves as a competitive inhibitor over a narrow range of inhibitor concentrations ([I] < 3 × Ki). The Ki value found in the present study is approximately two-times higher than that reported in this earlier report (6Kalpaxis D.L. Theocharis D.A. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, our analysis of the late slopes revealed a partial-noncompetitive inhibition. As shown, with increasing concentrations of blasticidin S the apparent KS value remains approximately constant (Fig. 3B), whereas the slopes of the DR plots are increased (Fig. 3C), tending to a limit. To evaluate the molecular order of blasticidin S participation in the puromycin reaction, a modified formula of Hill equation was used (25Kalpaxis D.L. Drainas D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A plot of this equation, obtained at 200 μm puromycin, is shown in Fig. 3D. The slope of this plot is equal to 0.75, a fact indicating that only one molecule of blasticidin S is involved in the mechanism of inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that blasticidin S (I) reacts rapidly with complex C to form the encounter complex CI, which is then isomerized slowly to a tighter complex, termed C*I. In contrast to complex CI, complex C*I is capable to produce product, but with a lower catalytic rate constant than that of CS (control reaction). Therefore, a kinetic model that could adequately explain the above-mentioned results is that shown in Scheme I.Fig. 3Kinetic analysis of AcPhe-puromycin synthesis at low concentrations of blasticidin S ([I] < 3×Ki).A, first-order time plots. The reaction between complex C and 200 μm puromycin was carried out at 25 °C in buffer A, in the absence (○) or in the presence of blasticidin S at 0.2 μm (•), 0.4 μm (□), and 0.8 μm (▪). B–D, DR plot, slope replot, and Hill plot analysis, respectively. The data presented in B and D were collected from the late phases (t > 1 min) of logarithmic time plots, such as those shown in panel A. The slope values indicated in panel C were estimated from the DR plots shown in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme IView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The KS*, k3*, and k6/k7 values estimated from 1/Δintercept and 1/Δslope secondary replots (Fig. 4; see also Ref. 24Segel I.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5074-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the individual values of k6 and k7 can be calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of kinetic data to Equation 3, k′=k7+(k6[I]/Ki)1+([S]/KS)+([I]/Ki) (Eq. 3) where k′ is the apparent equilibration rate constant for the attainment of equilibrium between complex C and the drug. The k′ values were estimated from the intersection point of the vertical axis with the late linear part of the corresponding progress curve; at this point, the value of the vertical axis is related to the k′ value by the relationship in Equation 4. Intercept=(kobs)oâˆ’(kobs)skâ€²Â(Eq. 4) Equation 4 holds, provided that C*I is not reactive toward the substrate (26Xaplanteri M.A. Andreou A. Dinos G.P. Kalpaxis D.L.

Therefore, to adopt precisely the slow onset inhibition theory in our analysis, the values of (kobs)s were first corrected by subtracting the contribution of k3* step and then were fitted to Equation 4. The estimated k6 and k7 values are presented in Table I.Fig. 4Secondary 1/Δslope and 1/Δintercept replots for the AcPhe-puromycin synthesis at low concentrations of blasticidin S ([I] < 3×Ki).

Q0 was incubated with rat and human pancreatic islets and INS-1 insulinoma cells, and its attachment to cellular proteins was studied with Western analysis using antiserum raised against the benzoquinone ring structure of ubiquinone (anti-Q). Q0 covalently bonded to two proteins, one of 50 kDa and another of 70 kDa. Both proteins were found to be mitochondrial in human and rat islet cells and in many rat organs.

The insulin release is not simply due to insulin leaked from dying cells because numerous inhibitors of cellular respiration that kill the cell, such as rotenone, antimycin A, cyanide, and dinitrophenol, inhibit insulin release rather than stimulate it (7MacDonald M.J.

Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). They additionally showed that electron flux through complex I of the respiratory chain is an important PTP regulator and that when complex I is turning over, Q0 becomes an even more potent inhibitor of the PTP (16Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and they suggested that Q0 binds to sites previously occupied by endogenous quinones. Numerous ubiquinone analogs in which carbon 6 of the benzoquinone ring is occupied by various side chains were ineffective as PTP inhibitors, except for decylubiquinone, which was less potent than Q0.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) also observed that Q1, which did not itself inhibit the PTP, specifically counteracted the inhibitory effect of Q0. The PTP is also regulated by the NAD/NADH, NADP/NADPH, and oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratios, with the latter being the most important (17Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V.

The absence of a side chain at carbon 6 of the benzoquinone ring of Q0 enables it to be a potent electrophile that can react with cellular nucleophiles, such as peptide thiols and reduced glutathione, to form a strong carbon sulfur bond. The neighboring oxygen on carbon 1 permits resonance delocalization of the negative charge of the unsaturated bond at carbon 6, allowing a nucleophile to add to carbon 6 in a Michael reaction or a similar reaction. We observed that Q0 bonds covalently to two proteins, one of about 50 kDa and another of about 70 kDa, in rat and human pancreatic islets and in INS-1 rat insulinoma cells as judged by Western analysis. The proteins were associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane of these tissues and of numerous rat organs. Although a large amount of Q0 was found in the two proteins when Q0 alone was added to mitochondria, prior incubation of mitochondria with a low concentration of dithiothreitol, which keeps thiols reduced, made both proteins more susceptible to Q0 bonding. In addition, agents such as oxidized dithiothreitol, N-ethylmaleimide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide that can oxidize thiols prevented the attachment of Q0. Q1 did not bond to the proteins, but it and Q2 inhibited bonding of Q0 to the 50-kDa protein, similar to the effect of Q1 preventing the action of Q0 on the PTP. The 50-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated from mitochondria using affinity-purified anti-Q antibodies followed by amino acid sequencing of its trypsin-digested peptides and identified as the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2) of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. At low micromolar concentrations, Q0 was found to bond to the E2 enzymes of purified α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. The E2 enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has a molecular mass of 70 kDa, and therefore it was inferred that the 70-kDa protein is the E2 (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) of this complex. Both E2 enzymes are part of multienzyme complexes involved in metabolism of mitochondrial substrates that pass electrons to complex I of the respiratory chain. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase identified two protein fragments that contain lipoate as the targets of Q0. Q0 seems to bond most effectively and specifically to thiols of dihydrolipoamide because even at exceptionally high concentrations, it did not bond to the numerous cysteines in cellular proteins or to cysteines in the two purified E2 proteins. Thus, the results suggest that some of the toxic effects of Q0 in cells are due to its propensity to attack the dihydrolipoamides of the two acyltransferase enzymes. Materials—α-2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(3′-carboxy-3′-methylpropyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (which we named Q acid) was generously provided by Dr. Masazumi Watanabe (Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Protein A Trisacryl beads, KLH, and EDC were from Pierce. Q0 (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone), glutathione-agarose (catalog number G-0387), S-thiopropyl-Sepharose (catalog number T8387), additional KLH and EDC, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma in the highest purity available. Purified porcine heart α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes were from Sigma. These two enzyme complexes purified from bovine heart, as well as recombinant human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, were gifts of Thomas Roche. Pancreatic islets and other tissues were obtained from 300-g Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (1MacDonald M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1370-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human pancreatic islets were from the Islet Isolation Core, Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO). Antisera to Q Acid—Q acid was conjugated to KLH by mixing 0.5 ml of a 10 mm solution of Q acid in 0.9 m NaCl and 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 4.7, with 0.15 ml of 65 mm EDC. After 10 min, the activated Q acid was added to 0.2 ml of KLH (10 mg/ml), and the mixture was allowed to set at room temperature. After 2 h, the unconjugated Q acid was removed from the Q acid-KLH conjugate by gel filtration as described in the Pierce Immunogen EDC Conjugation Kit instructions. The conjugate was mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and 0.5–1.0 mg of hapten protein was injected into rabbits at 6-week intervals four times and again a fifth time after a year. Antisera were harvested 3 weeks after the third, fourth, and fifth injections of hapten. Subcellular Fractionation—Organs were homogenized in 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 5 mm potassium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 (MSH), and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to obtain a pellet of nuclei and cell debris. The resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 5,500 × g (islets) or 15,000 × g (other tissues) for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondrial pellets from large tissues were resuspended in MSH and washed three times by centrifugation. Islet mitochondrial pellets were washed once. The post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a supernatant fraction consisting of cytosol plus endoplasmic reticulum (21MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22MacDonald M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 615: 223-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of Tissues with Q0—Intact islets were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.3. Homogenates of whole tissue and subcellular fractions were incubated with various concentrations of Q0 in MSH solution for 30 min or for 1 h at room temperature. When added, dithiothreitol or Q1, Q2, doxorubicin, genistein, 1,4-benzoquinone, aurovertin, or infrapeptin was present for 15 min before the addition of Q0 to mitochondria and also present during incubation with Q0. When added, N-ethylmaleimide, oxidized dithiothreitol (trans-4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane), or t-butylhydroperoxide was incubated with mitochondria for 1 h at room temperature and washed out by centrifugation of the mitochondria before Q0 was added. Compounds not soluble in aqueous buffers were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the aqueous mixture to give a final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide of ≤1%. Extraction of Proteins from Mitochondria—After mitochondria from various tissues were incubated with Q0, the mitochondria were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet (about 600 μl) was suspended in 12 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm Triton X-100 and vortexed at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction containing the Q0-bonding proteins was saved for analysis (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8). It was subsequently learned that a large amount, albeit less, of the 50-kDa protein could be extracted without Triton X-100. The Triton X-100 was omitted when the sample was used for immunoprecipitation.Fig. 6Sulfhydryl reagents decrease the bonding of Q0 to the 50-kDa protein in rat kidney mitochondria. Rat kidney mitochondria (90 μg of protein) were incubated with sulfhydryl oxidizing agents for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice by centrifugation, and then incubated with 1 mm Q0 for 1 h at room temperature and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Blots were probed with an early draw anti-Q antibody from rabbit 73613.

Rat kidney mitochondria (100 μl of 1 mg/ml mitochondrial protein) were incubated in the absence or presence of Q1 or Q2 (added in 10 μl of methanol) for 1 h, and then various concentrations of Q0 were added, and the incubation was continued for a second hour. Twenty μl of sample was applied to each well for PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The top and bottom panels each show a separate experiment. Samples in lanes 13 and 14 contained methanol equal to that in samples applied to lanes 5–12. The concentration of Q1 and Q2 was 1 mm except in mixtures shown in lanes 9, 11, and 12 of the bottom panel, where the concentration of Q2 was 0.5 mm. Blots were probed with antiserum from a late draw of anti-Q antiserum from rabbit 73613.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Inhibition by benzoquinone of Q bonding to proteins of 50 and 70 kDa. Rat kidney mitochondria (70 μg of protein) were incubated in 100 μl of MSH solution in the absence or the presence of 0.1 or 1 mm 1,4-benzoquinone (Benz) for 1 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm Q0 for a second hour. A sample (20 μl) was analyzed by Western analysis with antiserum from a late draw from rabbit 73613. The sample in lane 9 is the same as that in lane 2, except that this sample contained only methanol equal to the amount added with benzoquinone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoblotting—After incubation with Q0, pancreatic islets were washed and boiled in gel electrophoresis sample buffer (1.7% SDS, 5% glycerol, 62 mm Tris-chloride buffer, pH 6.8, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized with 10 mm Triton X-100 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and boiled in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were probed with polyclonal antibodies to Q0. The antiserum from rabbit 73613 was used at a dilution of 1:6,000, and the antiserum from rabbit 73903 was used at a dilution of 1:500. Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Identification of the 50-kDa Q0 Bonding Protein—Affinity-purified antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate one of the proteins to which Q0 bonds. Q0 was immobilized on a solid support of 3 ml of either settled oxidized glutathione-agarose beads or S-thiopropyl-Sepharose beads. The beads were treated with 12 ml of 100 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h and washed five times with 12 ml of water. Q0 (40 mm, 12 ml) was added to the beads, and they were agitated gently for 18 h on a rocking platform. Beads were washed five times with water and twice with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-chloride, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). To affinity-purify the anti-Q antibodies, the beads were suspended in 4–8 ml of anti-Q serum from rabbit 73613 plus 4–7 ml of Tris-buffered saline and agitated gently for 18 h. Beads were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline and then sequentially treated for 15 min with 12 ml each of three different buffer solutions to elute the anti-Q antibodies: 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0; Tris-buffered saline; and 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5. Immediately after elution, the pH of each fraction was adjusted to 7.5 by adding 1 m Tris chloride to give a concentration of 0.2 m, and bovine serum albumin was added to give a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Western analysis indicated that the triethylamine eluate contained >90% of the anti-Q antibodies. Affinity-purified anti-Q antibodies were covalently coupled to 2–3ml of protein A Trisacryl beads as described previously (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. pp. and 521, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310Google Scholar). Briefly, beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of 200 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, and incubated with all three of the elutant fractions of affinity-purified anti-Q antibodies. After 20 h, the beads were washed five times with 10 volumes of borate buffer and incubated in 10 volumes of 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate in the borate buffer. After 1 h, the beads were washed with borate buffer twice, and 10 volumes of 0.2 m ethanolanine, pH 8.7, were added to block any unreacted sites. After gentle agitation for 20 h, the beads were washed five times with 10 volumes of Tris-buffered saline and saved until use. To immunoprecipitate the Q0-bonding protein, anti-Q-protein A Trisacryl beads were incubated for 18 h with 10–15 volumes of kidney mitochondrial supernatant fraction that had been extracted in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The extract was the supernatant fraction prepared by vortexing the mitochondria in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer at room temperature for 1 h and removing the mitochondrial membranes by centrifuging the mixture for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The beads were washed five times with Tris-buffered saline and boiled in 1.5 volumes of SDS sample buffer in preparation for gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the protein in the gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol for 15 min or electrotransferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. The Coomassie Blue R-250-stained band was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, the internal peptides were separated by HPLC, and their amino acid sequences were determined with an Applied Biosystems Procise cLC Protein Sequencing System. Mass Spectrometry of Peptides—Human and pig pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes were dialyzed into a solution of 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated with or without Q0, and the component proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel band was excised, cut into 1-mm3 pieces, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and then incubated for 22 h with 20 μg of chymotrypsin or chymotrypsin followed by trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0. The digested peptides were extracted by sonication in 20 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min, and then the supernatant fraction was concentrated in vacuo to 10 μl. For MALDI-TOF MS, 0.5 μl of the extract was mixed with 0.5 μl of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, air-dried, and introduced into the spectrometer. Spectra were obtained on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) in the linear mode. Time to mass calibration was achieved using bradykinin (MH+ at 1061.2 Da) and insulin MH+ at m/z 5734.59 Da. Average masses of all possible peptide fragments of the completely and incompletely digested proteins were calculated with the program Protein Prospector (http://prospector.ucsf.edu). Liquid chromatography/MS was performed on a Capillary liquid chromatography system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) coupled to a LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ionization source. An aliquot (6.4 μl) of the chymotryptic digest was trapped on a Michrom Cap Trap cartridge (Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, CA) and flushed onto a 5 cm × 75 μm inner diameter Picofrit column packed with 5 μm of ProtoPep C18 material (New Objective, Woburn, MA). Peptides were eluted from the column with a gradient of 2–95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were identified with the program Sequest. Q Proteins—To study the toxic effects of Q0 on cells occurring at concentrations that also stimulate insulin release from pancreatic islets, the islets were incubated with 0–200 μm Q0. Intracellular Q0 and/or Q0 adhering to the outside of the cells was measured by absorbance at 263 nm (versus 274 nm for coenzyme Qs with long side chains) and by Craven's test. This indicated that the intracellular concentration of Q0 was no more than 45% of the concentration of Q0 added to the incubation medium. As judged by Western analysis with a late draw of anti-Q antiserum 73613, Q0 reacted with two proteins with molecular masses of about 50 and 70 kDa (Fig. 1). Q0 was also incubated with whole cell homogenates and subcellular fractions of rat and human pancreatic islets and the INS-1 rat insulinoma cell line. A solution containing Triton X-100 was used to extract proteins from the tissue fractions, and the extracts were used for Western analysis. In all three tissues, a protein of 50 kDa was the major reactant when a potent anti-Q antiserum from rabbit 73613 (from an early draw) was used at a dilution of 1:6,000 (Figs. 2, 3, 4). When a weaker anti-Q antiserum from a different rabbit (rabbit 73903) was used (at a dilution of 1:500) to probe the blots, a protein of about 70 kDa was the major reactant (Figs. 3 and 4). The initial different specificities of the anti-Q antisera from the two rabbits were puzzling but highly reproducible. It may indicate that the amino acid residues surrounding the Q0 bonding site were initially part of the epitope for these antisera. In any case, this initial apparent difference in specificity does not influence the arguments made later in the paper and does not influence our final conclusions. Antiserum from the weakly responding rabbit was not used in subsequent experiments because after the fourth and fifth immunizations, the strong antisera reacted with both the 50- and 70-kDa proteins.Fig. 2Q0 bonding to protein in rat pancreatic islet subcellular fractions. Subcellular fractions of rat pancreatic islets were incubated in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or presence of (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) of 1 mm Q0 for 1 h at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2101434919,"Over the past decades, much has been learnt about the genes that contribute to oncogenic transformation of primary cells in vitro. However, much less is known about the genes that contribute to the later stages of tumor progression, in which cells of ever increasing malignancy arise through clonal selection in vivo. To search for genes that confer a tumor progression phenotype in vivo, we have used a functional genetic approach. We used adenovirus-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, which are tumorigenic in immunodeficient nude mice, but not in immunocompetent mice, due to strong cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune rejection. We infected these cells in vitro with several high-complexity retroviral cDNA expression libraries and selected rare variants that formed tumors in immunocompetent mice. Using this approach, we identify here the TRK-T3 oncogene as a tumor progression gene. TRK-T3 does not inhibit T-cell reactivity towards the tumor cells. Instead, we find that cells expressing TRK-T3 enhances in vivo growth rate, most likely by stimulating anchorage-independent proliferation in growth factor-limiting conditions. Our data indicate that cDNA expression libraries can be used to identify tumor progression genes in vivo that cannot be readily identified using in vitro cell culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W2092900272,"The insulin receptor is a transmembrane protein dimer composed of two αβ monomers held together by inter-α-chain disulfide bonds. In a previous report we described a monomeric insulin receptor obtained by replacing Cys-524, -682, -683, and -685 with serine (Wu, J. J., and Guidotti, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 27809-27817). The membrane-bound monomeric insulin receptors could be cross-linked to dimers in the presence of insulin, indicating that although covalent interactions had been abolished, noncovalent dimerization could still occur in the membrane. To eliminate noncovalent dimerization, we replaced all or some of Cys-524, -682, -683, and -685 with arginine or aspartic acid with the expectation that the electrostatic repulsion at these contact sites would prevent noncovalent dimerization. The results indicate that mutant insulin receptors that are able to form covalent dimers are expressed at the wild type level; mutants that can form noncovalent dimers are expressed at half the level of the wild type receptor, whereas insulin receptor mutants that cannot dimerize are expressed at less than 10% of the wild type level. To elucidate the mechanism of the decrease in expression of the mutant insulin receptors, we examined their subcellular localization and biosynthesis. The results suggest that the extent of expression of these mutant receptors is related to their ability to form covalent or noncovalent dimers at the proreceptor stage.

We have recently constructed a monomeric insulin receptor by replacing Cys-524, Cys-682, Cys-683, and Cys-685 residues with serine; the IR monomer could be autophosphorylated in response to insulin in intact cells and membranes (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, membrane-bound monomeric insulin receptors could be cross-linked to dimers in the presence of insulin, suggesting that the monomeric insulin receptors, IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S need to dimerize noncovalently to undergo autophosphorylation. To construct an insulin receptor that would not dimerize noncovalently we replaced the four cysteine residues Cys-524, Cys-682, Cys-683, Cys-685 with arginine (Arg), aspartic acid (Asp) or tryptophan (Trp). We expected that the side chain electrostatic repulsion (from Arg and Asp) and the steric hindrance (from Trp) might prevent noncovalent dimerization of the monomers and allow us to study the properties of monomeric IR. Surprisingly, the IRC524R,C682R,C683R,C685R and IR524D,C682D,C683D,C685D mutants were expressed at very low levels, 6% of IRWT, and there was almost no proreceptor in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex. On the other hand replacement of Cys-524 with Trp was sufficient by itself to prevent processing of the mutant IRs, which were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex as proreceptors. The conclusion is that proreceptor dimerization is required for IR processing and movement to the plasma membrane. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), LipofectAMINE, fetal bovine serum, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. The sources of antibodies were Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) for anti-V5 antibody, Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA) for insulin receptor antibody Ab-1, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada) for antibody SPA-860 against calnexin, and this laboratory for antibody 620 against the α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (17Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). [125I]Insulin and [35S]Met/Cys (Expre35S35S) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; protein G-agarose was from Sigma; Protran nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.; Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce; gradient polyacrylamide gel (4-15%) was from Bio-Rad. DNA sequencing was performed with an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer made by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Construction of Plasmids—Plasmid pJW17, which contained the full-length human IR cDNA in the LITMUS28 vector (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), was used in these experiments. Site-specific mutations of Cys-524 were introduced by mutagenesis primers GGGTCAATGTCTACCACCGTCCAACTGTTGGAACCcCggGCATCCTGC (C524R mutation), GGGTCAATGTCTACCACCGTCCAACTGTTGGAACCcCAtGCATCCTGC (C524W mutation), and GGGTCAATGTCTACCACCGTCCAACTGTTcGAACCAtcCGCTCCTGC (C524D mutation). To introduced mutations at Cys-682 to Cys-685, the following primers were used: ATGAGGATTCGGCCGCGAAcGtTGCTCCTGTCCAA (C682R mutation), ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAAcGCcGCTCCcGTCCAA (C682R,C683R,C685R mutation), ATGAGGATTCGGCCGGCGAAgaCgaCTCCgaTCCAA (C682D,C683D, C685D mutation). The nucleotides involved in mutagenesis are indicated in lowercase. The entire PCR fragments were sequenced to verify that no other base changes occurred. The mutated sequences were cut and pasted into the corresponding regions in mammalian expression plasmids containing wild type or mutant insulin receptors (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All IR constructs contained a V5 epitope tag at the C terminus of the β-subunit. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were maintained with 5% CO2 at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To transiently express the insulin receptors, subconfluent cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin Binding Assay—COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids harboring different forms of insulin receptors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in medium without fetal bovine serum for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. [125I]Insulin (50 pm) was incubated with the cells for 12 h at 4 °C in binding buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer, solubilized in 0.1% SDS, and counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by including 10 μm unlabeled insulin in the incubation. Dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard plot analysis of [125I]insulin binding to crude membranes, as previously described (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of Insulin Receptors—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells expressing insulin receptors were solubilized with Laemmli buffer under nonreducing or reducing conditions (with 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide or 5% β-mercaptoethanol). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibody. Densitometric analysis of the signals was performed using NIH image software. Metabolic Labeling—COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids containing mutant IRs. Forty-eight hours later the cells were washed twice with Met/Cys- DMEM followed by incubation with Met/Cys- DMEM plus 250 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (Expre35S35S) for 30 min. The cells were then washed and chased in complete DMEM medium. At various time points as specified in Fig. 5 the cells were washed and solubilized with lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and immunoprecipitated with anti-IR antibody (Ab-1) and protein G-agarose beads. The precipitated IRs were released from the beads with Laemmli buffer in non-reducing condition, separated on a 4-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX System. The 35S-labeled insulin receptors used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were generated in a similar manner, except that the 35S-labeling time was longer with no chase. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—[35S]Met/Cys (Expre35S35S)-labeled insulin receptors were released from protein G-agarose beads with Laemmli buffer under non-reducing condition and separated on a 3-10% polyacrylamide gel. A lane of gel containing cell proteins was cut and treated in Laemmli buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 20 min. The gel slice was then put on a 7% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out in the vertical orientation. After electrophoresis, the 7% polyacrylamide gel was analyzed with a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX System. Preparation of Crude Membranes—Forty-eight hours after transfection, five 100-mm plates of transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with 10 ml of PBS containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4. The cells were scraped off the plates with a rubber policeman after a 5-min incubation in PBS supplemented with 5 mm Na2EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The cells were homogenized by 25 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle followed by adding 264 μl of 65% sucrose (w/w in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), 4 μl of 0.5 m MgCl2, 13.2 μl of 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenate was then subjected to two 10-min spins at 1000 × g at 4 °C to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and unbroken cells. Crude membranes were pelleted from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 150,000 × g in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor for 30 min. They were then washed quickly in 2 ml of HEPES buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad (Bradford) protein assay kits. The membranes were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C for further analysis (17Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Crude Membrane Fractionation—Crude membrane protein (100 μg) was resuspended in 0.7 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, homogenized with 15 strokes in a Thomas Teflon pestle homogenizer, combined with 2.3 ml of 65% (w/w) sucrose in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and placed at the bottom of an SW40Ti centrifuge tube. The sample was subsequently overlaid with 1 ml each of 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20 15, and 10% sucrose solutions (w/w in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 85,000 × g for 18 h, the fractions (0.75 ml/fraction) were collected from the top of the tube. The sucrose concentration in each fraction was determined with an Abbe refractometer. The fractions were diluted in 6 ml of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti70.1 rotor to pellet the membranes. The membranes were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol or 100 mm dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies. The plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum fractions were determined by immunoblotting with an anti-α1 (Na,K-ATPase) antibody and an anti-calnexin antibody, respectively (17Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Staining—COS7 cells transfected with plasmids containing wild type or mutant IR cDNA were grown on coverslips. 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 2 min. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS 3 times, the coverslips were blocked with 10% goat serum, PBS for 30 min and stained with either anti-V5 antibody or anti-calnexin antibody followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies for 30 min. DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to localize the nucleus. The secondary antibodies were removed from the coverslips by washing with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS. The coverslips were observed under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Expression of the Mutant IRs in COS7 Cells—To make IR monomers that do not dimerize noncovalently, we placed charged (Arg or Asp) or bulky (Trp) residues at the positions of cysteine residues 524 and 682, 683, 685 to prevent interactions between the α chains. Because amino acid substitutions of a membrane protein can affect the structure of the protein leading to activation of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system (18Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), we first determined whether substitutions at either position 524 or 682, 683, 685 alone were tolerated by the IR. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild type and mutant IRs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, insulin binding to intact cells and to crude membranes was carried out to determine the dissociation constants for insulin and the number of insulin binding sites per cell. The results are shown in Table I. Fig. 1 shows the results of experiments to determine whether the IRs are present as dimers or monomers. It is evident that replacement of Cys by Ser, Arg, or Asp at either position 524 or at 682, 683, 685 as a group had a negligible effect on the dissociation constant and the number of IRs at the cells surface (Table I, lines 2-7) and that in all these cases IR dimers were present (Fig. 1, lanes 2-5). The presence of insulin receptor dimers of the mutants IRC524S and IRC682S,C683S,C685S were reported in Lu and Guidotti (15Lu K. Guidotti G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B, lane 4) and in Cheatham and Kahn (8Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7108-7115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3, lane 6), respectively. Clearly, the substitution of Ser, Arg, and Asp for Cys did not affect processing, appearance at the cell surface, and insulin binding of these mutant receptors. We conclude that as long as cysteines are present either at position 524 or 682,683,685 interchain disulfide bonds can form between α chains even if there is charge repulsion at the other contact site. We also conclude that the presence of interchain disulfide bonds allows proper processing of the IR. In contrast, Trp at position 524 was highly deleterious because there was little insulin binding at the cell surface (Table I, line 15), the IR proreceptor was not significantly processed (Fig. 2A), and there was minimal IR dimer (Fig. 2B). Only when the immunoblot was exposed for a long time at least three distinctive bands were observed in the position of the mature dimeric insulin receptor (Fig. 2B). Clearly, processing was severely affected in this case, supporting the view that the lack of insulin binding at the cell surface was caused by a lack of surface receptors rather than a change in the dissociation constant for insulin.Table IInsulin binding to COS7 cells expressing wild type and mutant insulin receptorsKdBinding sites/cellmDissociation constants and insulin binding sites1.

The idea here is that whereas there might be electrostatic repulsion at one α-α interface, at the other interface noncovalent interactions can take place. The results are shown in Table I (lines 9-12). In all these mutants, which are incapable of forming interchain disulfide bonds and are present as monomers (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5), the number of IRs at the cell surface was approximately half of that of IRs that can form disulfide bonds. Whereas these mutant IRs were clearly processed to α and β chains (Fig. 4, lane 4) and transported to the plasma membrane, there appeared to be a problem in the maturation process. The results are similar to those obtained with the mutant IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S that we had previously shown to be able to form noncovalent dimers (Table I, line 8; Fig. 1, lane 6; Fig. 4, lane 2). Finally, we made IRs with Arg or Asp at both positions 524 and 682, 683, 685. In this case, there should be electrostatic repulsion at both inter-α chain contact surfaces. The results (Table I, lines 13 and 14) show that there was very little insulin binding activity at the cell surface, 6% of the IRWT, and that only minute amounts of IR monomer and proreceptor were visible (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8; Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). Clearly any proreceptor made is rapidly destroyed. Although it was not possible to determine the insulin dissociation constant for these receptors due to the small amount of receptor, the immunofluorescence of cells expressing IRC524R,C682R,C683R,C685R indicated that the cells do not have surface receptor so the lack of binding activity is not principally due to an increase in the value of the dissociation constant. This situation is distinctly different from that of IRC524W and IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S, which although also present at only 12 and 13% of the amount of IRWT at the cell surface (Table I, lines 15 and 16), accumulated 1.5-2 times greater amounts of proreceptor than did IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S (Figs. 2 and 4A, lane 3). Under reducing conditions, the IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S β subunit was identified with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 3), suggesting that some proreceptors may have been processed. In these mutants, Trp at position 524 appears to prevent proper folding so that the issue of covalent or noncovalent interactions at the 682, 683, 685 positions is not relevant. We conclude that proreceptor survival and processing requires covalent or noncovalent dimerization to be effective. If dimerization is prevented by electrostatic repulsion (Asp and Arg mutants), the proreceptor is rapidly destroyed; if the proreceptor is misfolded (Trp mutant), dimerization and processing are severely impaired even though dimerization might take place. Post-translational Processing of Mutant IRs—To examine the processing stages of the three types of IRs, those that form covalent dimers, those that form noncovalent dimers, and those that are not processed, we carried out pulse-chase experiments with cells expressing IRWT,IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S, and IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S. Fig. 5A shows the results obtained with IRWT and reproduces results already published (5Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the beginning of the cold-chase the primary product was proreceptor at position M1. After 45 min of chase, the proreceptor had shifted to position M2, corresponding to that of proreceptor with a difference in the number and/or arrangement of intramolecular disulfide bonds (19Bass J. Chiu G. Argon Y. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At the same time the dimeric insulin receptors at positions D1 and D2 were visible. After 90 min, the M2 fraction was reduced with a concomitant increase in dimeric insulin receptors. After 3.5 h, only IR dimers were present. Fig. 5B shows the results obtained with IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S, which can form noncovalent dimers. At the beginning of the cold chase, the protein was present as the proreceptors at positions M1 and M2. After 45 min, the amount of proreceptor M2 had increased, and curiously, there was also a band at position D1, corresponding to that of a covalent dimer even though all the canonical cysteine residues for inter-α chain disulfide bond formation are absent. After 90 min of cold-chase, the band at D1 disappeared concurrently with the appearance of the mature monomeric insulin receptor at position M3. After 3.5 h, the major product was mature monomeric insulin receptor. We conclude that during noncovalent dimerization of the proreceptor, some of the other cysteine residues in the α chain were utilized to form spurious interchain disulfide bonds. Because it is likely that this dimeric material was targeted for destruction, this process may explain the decreased number of IRs at the cell surface. The situation with IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S was simple and different from that in the preceding two cases. From the beginning of the cold-chase, there was material at position M of the proreceptor and at position D of a potential spurious dimer and no change in the pattern with time except for a nearly complete loss of all material by 3.5 h (Fig. 5C). The band at the position D was more diffuse and persisted for a longer period of time than was the case for the D1 band present with IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S. We suggest that the proreceptor at position D, either a spurious dimer or a monomer, is probably in a complex with endoplasmic reticulum chaperones making a diffuse band. The mature monomeric receptor (M3) was not detected in the cold-chase experiment, although a small amount of mature IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S monomeric insulin receptor was observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4, lane 3). These results indicate that the stability of the IR depends on its ability to form covalent dimers. Although IRWT was stable after 7 h of chase, only 20% of IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S and less than 1% of IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S remained after 7 h. We considered the possibility that the processing of proreceptors that can form noncovalent dimers requires the intermediate of a covalent dimer of the proreceptor, thus explaining the presence of such a band in the case of IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S (Fig. 5B). If this were the case, one would expect that the spuriously dimeric receptor would be composed of α and β chains, whereas the monomeric proreceptor would not be processed. Accordingly, we examined the situation by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions. The IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S labeled with 35S for 90 min was first separated under non-reducing conditions in a 3-10% gradient gel (Fig. 6A) followed by electrophoresis under reducing conditions at right angles. Under these conditions, the mobility of proteins in the second dimension will depend on their position in the gel, with those at lower concentrations of acrylamide traveling faster than those at higher concentrations. As shown in Fig. 6B, the band at the position of the proreceptor dimer moved to the position of the monomeric proreceptor, indicating that the protein is an oligomer of the proreceptor. A small amount of α and β chain (α″ and β″), however, can be seen at the position of the proreceptor dimer in the second dimension, indicating that some of this spurious oligomer had been processed. It is not excluded that the band at the proreceptor dimer position might be a complex between proreceptor and chaperone proteins, although the position does correspond to that of a proreceptor dimer. Fig. 6B also shows that the receptor monomer was fully composed of α and β subunits and that a fraction of the monomeric proreceptors was cleaved to α′ and β′ subunits. The α′ and β′ subunits migrated more rapidly than the mature subunits, possibly due to a difference in the degree of post-translational modification. The difference in mobility is too small to be detected by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, lane 2). The same experiments were also performed with COS7 cells expressing IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S labeled with 35S for 12 h. When separated on a 3-10% gradient polyacrylamide gel, only mature monomeric insulin receptor and proreceptor were identified (Fig. 7A). In the second dimension no cleaved α- and β-subunits derived from the proreceptor were detected (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the processing of proreceptor is transient; once the plasma membrane is saturated with IR, the proreceptor may no longer undergo further processing. Subcellular Distribution of Proreceptor and Receptor—To determine the subcellular distribution of the three types of IRs, those that form covalent dimers, those that form noncovalent dimers, and those that are not processed, we separated the membrane compartments of COS7 cells by sucrose density sedimentation. The positions of the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum were identified by antibodies against the α chain of the Na,K-ATPase and against calnexin, respectively (17Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, the plasma membrane was primarily present in the fractions containing 25-32% sucrose (Fig. 8E), whereas most of the endoplasmic reticulum was in fractions of 45-50% sucrose (Fig. 8D). In all three cases (Fig. 8, A-C), the proreceptors were exclusively detected in the fractions with high sucrose concentrations, indicating that they are localized in intracellular membranes, principally endoplasmic reticulum, which is consistent with previous observations (5Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunits from cells expressing IRWT (Fig. 8A) and IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S (Fig. 8B) were present both in intracellular membranes and in the plasma membrane, although the amount of β chain in the plasma membrane was greater for IRWT compared with IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S. In contrast, the β subunit from cells expressing IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S was detected only in the 41-52% sucrose fractions (Fig. 8C), supporting the result in Table I that a small number of IRC524W,C682S,C683S,C685S (12% of IRWT) are in the plasma membrane. The cellular localization of IRWT C524R,C682R,C683R,C685R was also examined by immunofluorescence staining. Fig. 9A shows that IRWT was abundant and present at the plasma membrane. On the other hand, the amount of IRC524R,C682R,C683R,C685R expressed was very small (Fig. 9B), as also demonstrated in Fig. 1, lane 8, and Fig. 3, lane 3, and it was present mainly in the intracellular compartments. We conclude that the number of IR present in the plasma membrane is determined by the processing efficiency of the proreceptor, which depends on the dimerization ability of the proreceptor. To demonstrate the existence of proreceptor noncovalent dimers, we tried to cross-link the proreceptors of IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S in the endoplasmic reticulum in the same way that we cross-linked the mature IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S monomers in the plasma membrane (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the proreceptor band did decrease in amount with increasing concentration of cross-linking agents, no clear-cut proreceptor dimer band was evident; rather, a diffuse smearing of immunostaining material at higher molecular weights was observed (data not shown). It was not clear whether the shifts in position were caused by interaction with endoplasmic reticulum proteins associated with the proreceptor or by oligomerization of the insulin proreceptors themselves. Finally, we compared the properties and of the IRC524R,C682S,C685S and IRC524R,C682R mutants to those of the IRC524R mutant. The latter resembles IRWT in its ability to form covalent dimers and to appear at the plasma membrane (Table I, line 4 and Fig. 1, lane 3). The question was whether a single Arg at position 682 was sufficient to prevent covalent dimerization through electrostatic interactions. The IRC524R,C682R mutant (Fig. 10, lane 3) was present at the plasma membrane in the same amount as the IRC524R mutant (Fig. 10, lane 2), and it formed covalent dimers, as did the IRC524R,C682S,C685S mutant (Fig. 10, lane 1). These results suggest that just 1 cysteine residue of the group at positions 682, 683, 685 is sufficient for covalent receptor dimerization even if there is some electrostatic interference. These results support the view that proreceptor dimerization is necessary for processing. The biosynthesis of IRWT has been studied extensively. It has been proposed that proreceptors form disulfide-linked dimers and are then proteolytically cleaved into α and β subunits (3Hedo J.A. Kahn C.R. Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10020-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Olson T.S. Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7342-7351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With an effective quality control system, most abnormal insulin receptors are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. The question of interest in this work is the mechanism of processing of IR proreceptors that are not capable of forming covalently linked dimers. We have shown previously that IRC524S,C682SC683S,C685S is monomeric and is expressed at the cell surface at 50% of the amount of IRWT (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Does processing of proreceptors require noncovalent dimerization? To answer this question, we made mutant IRs in which the contact points between α chains, residues 524 and 682, 683, 685, contain charged residues (Arg and Asp) that would be expected to prevent interaction. We first showed that substitution of Arg or Asp at 524 alone or at 682, 683, 685 alone had no effect on the appearance of the IR at the cell surface and that in all cases the IR was a dimer. Thus, processing and delivery to the plasma membrane are normal in these mutants. We conclude that Arg and Asp at 524 and at 682, 683, 685 do not affect folding of the molecule. However, when Arg or Asp is present at both 524 and 682, 683, 685, there is very little IR at the plasma membrane, and virtually no proreceptor is found in the cell. The simplest explanation is that the presence of the charged residues prevents formation of any interaction between the proreceptors, and thus, processing is prevented, and the proreceptor is destroyed. In contrast, if Ser is present at the contact positions or charged residues are present at only one of the contact sites with Ser at the other one, then noncovalent interactions can take place between proreceptors, and processing is allowed. One possible explanation for the reduced amount of processing in these cases is that the noncovalent interactions are weak, so only a fraction of the proreceptors is capable of dimerization. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the IRC524R,C682R mutant, in which there is reduced electrostatic repulsion at the 682, 683, 685 region, forms dimers and is expressed at a high level at the plasma membrane. The situation is quite different for the IRC524W and IRC524W,S682,683,685S mutants, which we constructed with the idea that a bulky group might also interfere with dimerization. These mutants appear to be misfolded so that the proreceptors are not processed, they do not dimerize, and virtually no mature receptor appears at the cell surface. The amount of proreceptor of these mutants was at least equivalent to or slightly higher than that of the wild type receptor. It was surprising that mutant monomeric insulin proreceptors also formed covalent dimers during post-translational processing (Fig. 5B). Because proreceptors dimerize before proreceptor cleavage (19Bass J. Chiu G. Argon Y. Steiner D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we carried out two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine whether the covalent dimer was required for proteolytic cleavage of proreceptor into α and β subunits, an important step during insulin receptor maturation. Our results suggest that the covalent dimer observed during the pulse-chase experiment is not required for proteolytic cleavage of proreceptor into α and β subunits (Fig. 6). It is more likely that proreceptors must form noncovalent dimers for processing and that the covalent dimers represent a small amount of spurious disulfide bond formation between non-canonical cysteine residues. Because insulin receptor monomers, IRC524S,C682S,C683S,C685S, were cross-linked to dimers in the presence of insulin, indicating that the concentration of receptor monomers was high enough to form noncovalent dimers (16Wu J.J. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27809-27817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the proreceptors should also be able to dimerize. We conclude that a correctly folded proreceptor has to dimerize to be processed into α and β chains. In the native state dimerization is stabilized by disulfide bonds between Cys-524, -682, -683, and -685. In the mutants lacking some of the Cys residues, the remaining ones are sufficient to allow covalent dimerization. The proreceptors of mutants, which have Ser at the positions of the Cys residues, form noncovalent dimers and are processed, but the extent of processing is decreased by mass action and possibly by spurious disulfide bonds between non-canonical cysteine residues. The proreceptors of mutants that cannot dimerize because of electrostatic repulsion are not processed and are rapidly destroyed. We thank Drs.
