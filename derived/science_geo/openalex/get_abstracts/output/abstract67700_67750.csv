https://openalex.org/W1516582678,"Abstract The rate of reduction of cytochrome c by the ferredoxin-TPN reductase of spinach or by chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase is markedly augmented by a variety of electron carriers. Menadione, flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, N-methylphenazinium methosulfate, methylene blue, and 2,6-dichlorobenzenone indophenol were all effective. When cytochrome c reduction was mediated aerobically by menadione, flavin mononucleotide, or flavin adenine dinucleotide, superoxide dismutase was an inhibitor. When cytochrome c reduction was mediated by these same electron carriers in the absence of molecular oxygen, superoxide dismutase was without effect. When cytochrome c reduction was mediated by N-methylphenazinium methosulfate, methylene blue, or 2,6-dichlorobenzenone indophenol, superoxide dismutase was without effect whether or not oxygen was present. These results indicate that of these electron carriers only the reduced forms of menadione and of the flavins preferentially reduce O2 to the superoxide radical in the presence of cytochrome c. In the absence of cytochrome c, it was shown that reduced methylene blue is likewise capable of the univalent reduction of oxygen. In this case O-2 was detected by its ability to oxidize epinephrine to adrenochrome."
https://openalex.org/W2063454638,"d-Amphetamine is markedly more potent an inhibitor of catecholamine uptake by norepinephrine neurons in the brain than is l-amphetamine, whereas the two isomers are equally active in inhibiting catecholamine uptake by the dopamine neurons of the corpus striatum. In behavioral studies, d-amphetamine is ten times as potent as l-amphetamine in enhancing locomotor activity, while it is only twice as potent in eliciting a compulsive gnawing syndrome. This suggests that the locomotor stimulation induced by amphetamine involves central norepinephrine, while dopamine neurons play an important role in the induced compulsive gnawing behavior. Assessment of differential actions of d- and l-amphetamine may be an efficient method to differentiate behaviors involving norepinephrine or dopamine in the brain."

Blood acetaldehyde concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 0.15 and from 0.04 to 0.08 milligrams per 100 milliliters when blood ethanol concentrations ranged from 1 to 400 milligrams per 100 milliliters after consumption of bourbon or grain ethanol, respectively. No dose or dose-time relationships were found between blood ethanol concentrations and blood acetaldehyde concentrations during any phase of this study."
https://openalex.org/W1563779986,"Abstract The kinetic behavior of calf thymus deoxycytidine kinase was studied over a 100-fold variation in deoxycytidine concentration, and several abrupt transitions were observed in slopes of double reciprocal plots, suggesting negative homotropic cooperativity in the binding of this substrate. This is in apparent contrast to the simpler kinetics seen when an alternate substrate, deoxyguanosine, or the substrate analogue, 1-Î²-d-arabinofuranozylcytosine, was used in place of deoxycytidine. Convex reciprocal plots were also obtained with variable ATP-Mg2- or with an alternative phosphate donor, dTTP-Mg2-, although the latter yielded more marked negative curvature and lower Vmax values. Inhibition by end product, dCTP, was complex, particularly when deoxycytidine was varied over a wide range of concentrations, but below the first transition concentration dCTP plotted as a noncompetitive inhibitor. With variable ATP-Mg2-, dCTP gave the appearance of noncompetitive inhibition at low ATP-Mg2-, but shifted to apparent competitive inhibition against high phosphate donor concentrations. End product inhibition is overcome by dTTP at low deoxycytidine concentrations, but with increased nucleoside concentrations dTTP replaces the dCTP effect with its own highly complex pattern of inhibition. Like dTTP, UDP also stimulates at low nucleoside concentrations and becomes inhibitory as the deoxycytidine concentration is elevated. However, this inhibition can be reversed by dTTP, provided that the ATP-Mg2- concentration is limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1596205209,"Glutamate dehydrogenase is reversibly inhibited by the reaction of 1 mole of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mole of subunit polypeptide chain of the enzyme. Reduction of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-inactivated enzyme with NaBH4, followed by alkylation of the thiol groups and subsequent tryptic digestion, yielded a single fluorescent peptide which after acid hydrolysis, gave approximately 1 eq of e-pyridoxyllysine. This peptide was recognized by its amino acid composition as an overlap of two tryptic peptides which had been isolated and sequenced independently. The hexadecapeptide has the sequence: Cys-Ala-Val-Val-Asp-Pro-Val-Phe-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys*-Ala-Gly-Val-Lys."

https://openalex.org/W1490425006,"Abstract The plastocyanin from Phaseolus vulgaris has been shown to consist of a single polypeptide chain of 100 residues to which 1 atom of copper is bound. This plastocyanin is the smallest copper-protein yet reported; its molecular weight is 10,690. The molar extinction coefficient (e597) of the copper chromophore was shown to be 4.5 x 103. The copper content and molecular weight contrast with that of plastocyanin preparations from spinach (mol. wt., 21,000) and Chenopodium album (mol. wt., 11,500), which both contain 2 copper atoms (2, 13). Amino acid analysis indicated that the minimum molecular weight of the polypeptide chain is 10,626. The dansyl-Edman procedure showed that plastocyanin has only the one NH2-terminal sequence, Leu-Glx-Val-Leu, and reduction and carboxymethylation of the apoprotein gave a homogeneous product, as judged by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sephadex gel chromatography. The molecular weight of the carboxymethyl protein was similar to the minimum molecular weight value of 10,626. There are 2 residues of methionine per minimum molecular weight, and cyanogen bromide cleavage of the carboxymethyl protein gave 3 fragments, containing 58, 35, and 7 residues. The characterization of these peptides confirmed that the protein contains only one type of polypeptide chain, with a molecular weight of 10,626. Molecular weight values for the native protein of about 11,000 were consistently obtained by Sephadex gel chromatography in sodium acetate buffers at pH 6.0 and of varying ionic strengths. The approach to equilibrium technique yielded a value of 10,790 in sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. Variable and high molecular weight values for plastocyanin (up to 16,000) were obtained by Sephadex gel chromatography in sodium phosphate buffers. The reason for these anomalous values is not clear. Frontal analysis studies with Sephadex did not indicate dimerization of the molecule in the phosphate buffer. There was no significant difference in the molecular weight or sedimentation coefficient of plastocyanin in acetate and phosphate buffers as judged by ultracentrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1483258156,"Abstract The distribution of amino acids in a homogeneous fraction of lysine-rich histone from rabbit thymus has been studied by use of chymotryptic digestion. The course of chymotryptic digestion was followed by measuring the generation of new carboxyl-terminal residues. The results allowed the choice of one set of conditions which produced a limited number of peptides in high yield. These conditions divided the molecule into four major portions. Under other conditions, more extensive digestion with chymotrypsin provided a set of peptides, 13 of which accounted for the entire molecule. These studies provided further evidence that the chromatographic fraction of rabbit thymus lysine-rich histone was molecularly homogeneous. Moreover the results indicate that most of the lysine and proline residues are closely packed in the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, whereas the amino acid composition of the amino-terminal half is not unlike small enzymes such as ribonuclease and lysozyme. The basic residues that are in the amino-terminal half are preferentially grouped towards the amino-terminal part of that half, leaving a continuous stretch of approximately 45 amino acids (23% of the molecule), in which the ratio of basic amino acids to acidic amino acids is close to one, and in which there are no proline residues."
https://openalex.org/W1570743625,"Abstract Treatment of isolated bone cells in primary culture with insulin in vitro for 1 hour markedly enhanced the incorporation of radioactively labeled uridine into cellular free uridine nucleotide pools and into RNA. Stimulation was directly proportional to the starting insulin concentration (4.6 ng per ml being minimally effective), appeared within 15 min, was maximal in 45 to 60 min, and gradually disappeared in 4 to 5 hours. This disappearance is best explained by inactivation of insulin, since fresh insulin stimulated incorporation when added to cells which had already been treated for 4 hours. Stimulation was not diminished by washing insulin-treated cells. Neither growth hormone nor glucagon altered the incorporation of radioactive uridine into bone cells. Insulin appears to act by stimulating uridine uptake or phosphorylation (or both) since (a) it did not restrict uridine efflux or degradation, and (b) it increased the incorporation of radioactive uridine at a high (500 Âµm) as well as a low (4.8 Âµm) starting concentration of uridine in the incubation medium, thus tending to exclude the possible contribution of an alteration in the size of the corresponding intracellular precursor pool. Failure of insulin to increase cellular free uridine or uracil radioactivity is evidence for an effect on phosphorylation rather than uptake. Insulin enhanced the incorporation of uridine and cytidine to a much greater degree than that of adenosine and guanosine, suggesting a preferential effect on the transport or phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleosides. Insulin effects appeared during inhibition of protein synthesis with either puromycin or cycloheximide, and during incubation of cells in glucose and amino acid-free medium, indicating that they were independent of protein synthesis or of changes in glucose or amino acid transport. Insulin did not increase the accumulation of radioactivity in RNA precursor pools by first stimulating RNA synthesis, since (a) this increase developed during virtually complete inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D, and (b) enhanced labeling of precursor pools and of RNA appeared simultaneously, and were equivalent in degree. Short term treatment of bone cells with insulin did not significantly increase the total content of RNA per culture. Cortisol-induced inhibition of nucleoside incorporation was not seen during simultaneous treatment with insulin, and insulin antagonized the cortisol effect even after its ability to stimulate uridine incorporation had disappeared."

https://openalex.org/W1513891185,"Abstract The Tris-HCl and phosphate-borate forms of glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2, l-glutamine amidohydrolase) are both activated and protected from inactivation by phosphate and carboxylic acids. The Tris-HCl enzyme is less sensitive to this activation, but more sensitive to glutamate inhibition than the phosphate-borate enzyme. Plots of activity against concentration of activating anions are generally sigmoidal, and plots against phosphate become more sigmoidal by addition of glutamate. However, such plots for the phosphate-borate enzyme become hyperbolic in the presence of Î±-ketoglutarate. In addition to spontaneous activation by phosphate and carboxylic acids, assumed to be of allosteric nature, a time-dependent activation has been shown at higher protein concentrations. The time-dependent activation occurs following incubation of the Tris-HCl enzyme with phosphate or phosphate plus borate. The time-dependent activation in the presence of phosphate plus borate changes the properties of the Tris-HCl enzyme so that they become similar to those of the phosphate-borate enzyme. It is suggested that time-dependent activation reflects a transition of the Tris-HCl enzyme to higher molecular forms."
https://openalex.org/W1995042798,"Human lymphocytes treated with the plant protein concanavalin A are stimulated to transform into blasts, without developing cytotoxicity for chicken erythrocytes. Prior treatment of lymphocytes with concanavalin A potentiated phytohemagglutinin-induced blast transformation and DNA synthesis but completely inhibited phytohemagglutinin-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibiton was not due to suppression of the mixed lymphocyte-erythrocyte aggregation normally caused by phytohemagglutinin. Inhibition of cytotoxicity was reversible when concanavalin A was removed from the lymphocytes by treatment with methyl-alpha-D-manno-pyranoside after 1 hour but not after 20 hours. The results indicate that blast transformation and cytotoxicity are separate expressions of lymphocyte stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1541296093,"Abstract High resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra at 220 MHz were obtained for cyanoferrimyoglobins of sperm whale, harbor seal, harbor or common porpoise, California gray whale, and horse. Carboxymethylated derivatives of sperm whale and porpoise cyanoferrimyoglobin were also studied. The positions of the proton resonances of the heme group, which are greatly shifted by hyperfine interactions with the unpaired electron, delineate the electron spin delocalization from the iron to the porphyrin ring. The nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that the electronic structure of the heme group is identical in the cyanoferrimyoglobins of the different mammals, even though the amino acid residues at only 119 of the 153 positions of the polypeptide chain are invariant. Chemical modification of the amino acid residues at some positions did not noticeably affect the heme group either. These results indicate that only the amino acid residues in the immediate environment of the porphyrin ring are involved in the heme-polypeptide interactions which were shown in previous studies to have marked effects on the electronic structure of the heme group."
https://openalex.org/W180151107,"Abstract Sperm whale ferrimyoglobin was treated with 0.2 m sodium bromoacetate at pH 6.8 to test the accessibility for alkylation of certain residues, particularly those of histidine. After a plateau had been reached in the reaction process, the product was shown to retain native properties. Electrophoretically, it was free of unmodified material and contained four main components apparently differing by unit gradations of net charge. The most fully studied preparation contained 5.3, 4.6, 1.3, 0.9, and 17.9 residues per molecule of histidine, 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine, 3-carboxymethylhistidine, 1-carboxymethylhistidine, and lysine, respectively. The methionine content was not affected. The aminoterminal valyl residue was largely alkylated. Assignment of histidyl residues according to the derivatives identified in peptide fragments was made according to the method of the preceding paper in the series (Hugli, T. E., and Gurd, F. R. N., J. Biol. Chem., 245, 1930 (1970)). The following residues were recovered as unmodified histidine: 24, 36, 82, 93, and 97. The other residues were isolated in various states of alkylation. The results establish a considerable number of points of similarity between the reactivity patterns in solution and in the crystalline state. Most points of contrast with the results of alkylation in the crystalline states can be ascribed to the absence of neighboring lattice molecules. However, the fact that residue 36 becomes unreactive when the protein passes from the crystalline to the dissolved state implies a distinct structural change controlling the accessibility of the residue to the alkylating agent."

A high degree of homogeneity is suggested by sedimentation velocity, gel filtration, polyacetate electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. The purified enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 2.7 S, a diffusion coefficient of 8.3 x 10-7 cm2 per sec, and a molecular weight of 30,000. The isoelectric point, as determined by means of isoelectric focusing, was found to be 9.1. Enzymatic assays showed the preparation to be specific for arginine esters. The Km values determined with N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester and p-toluenesulfonyl-l-arginine methyl ester are 1.17 x 10-4 and 1.49 x10-3, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-bromosuccinimide. Optimal rates of hydrolysis were observed from pH 7.5 to pH 8.5."

https://openalex.org/W1505670114,"Abstract It is shown that kinetic control dissociation of a complex prepared by mixing of equimolar quantities of trypsin and of modified (reactive site Arg (64)-Ile bond cleaved) soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) yields trypsin and predominantly (g95%) virgin (reactive site intact) inhibitor. If less than equimolar quantities of trypsin are used the fraction of inhibitor molecules in which the bond is resynthesized is directly proportional to the amount of trypsin used. A simple apparatus was constructed for monitoring the yield of virgin inhibitor obtained by kinetic control dissociation as a function of time after mixing of modified inhibitor and of trypsin. The reaction was found to be first order, a result consistent with the initial equilibrium formation of a loose complex of trypsin and modified inhibitor, L*, and its subsequent first order conversion to the stable trypsin inhibitor complex, C. The rate constant for this reaction was obtained and is â¼2 x 10-2 per sec at pH 4.00 and â¼2 per sec at pH 6. The rate of this reaction appears to be identical with the rate of change of ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm observed in stopped flow studies."
https://openalex.org/W1515715754,"Studies of viscosity, optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), and circular dichroism (CD) are reported on the phosphoprotein, phosvitin. From viscosity measurements it was shown that phosvitin in some of its properties resembles a polyelectrolyte. At low ionic strength the protein molecules, because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the charged phosphate groups of the phosphoserine residues, attain an extended shape, whereas in the ionic strength interval of 0.02 to 0.05 the molecules contract to a more compact shape. From the ORD measurements in the wave length range of 600 to 300 mÂµ as function of pH and ionic strength, it was shown that a conformational transition occurs in the pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. The ORD spectra below 300 mÂµ show that at neutral and alkaline pH the principal trough of phosvitin is at 205 mÂµ, whereas in the pH range of 3.0 to 4.0 two minima at 207 mÂµ and 232 mÂµ are present. The CD spectra are characterized by a strong negative band at 198 mÂµ. In addition, a positive band at 220 mÂµ and a negative one at 233 mÂµ were recorded. Based on these results and in analogy with ORD and CD measurements on polypeptides with known conformation it is suggested that at alkaline pH phosvitin has an unordered conformation, whereas at pH 3.0 to 3.6 helical regions and Î² structures are present within an otherwise unordered structure."
https://openalex.org/W1498034755,"Abstract The molecular composition of 14C-valine-labeled protein in extracts of thyroid glands was found to be strongly dependent on temperature in some species and independent in others. In guinea pig extracts most of the radioactivity was in thyroglobulin at 23Â° but appeared in its 12 subunit after standing at 2Â° for 36 hours. The dissociation was readily reversed with temperature. In rat extracts a broad asymmetrical 19 S sedimentation band was found at 2Â°, whereas this band appeared as a sharper symmetrical boundary (19S) at 23Â°. In bovine extracts temperature had almost no effect on the sedimentation pattern, and very little or no radioactivity was observed in the 12 region even at very short times of labeling. These results require a reinterpretation of experiments measuring the kinetics of labeling of components in species where a temperature-dependent dissociation exists, i.e. in the rat and guinea pig. Iodine labeling follows a completely different pattern from carbon labeling of thyroglobulin. An appreciable amount of the iodine label appears in a nondissociable form of thyroglobulin, whereas all of the carbon label is incorporated into dissociable thyroglobulin. It is evident that quite different molecules are being labeled by the two elements. This result is in harmony with iodine incorporation occurring after and independent of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1538307633,"Abstract The structure of porcine thyrocalcitonin has been evaluated by circular dichroism, optical rotatory dispersion, infrared spectroscopy, and fluorescence. The degree of helical structure was estimated by circular dichroism (222 mÂµ) and optical rotatory dispersion (233 mÂµ) at the n â Ï* transition of the Î± helix. The optical activity at this transition suggests that thyrocalcitonin contains approximately 10% Î±-helical structure in aqueous solution. The spectrum of thyrocalcitonin in 6 m guanidine was similar to that of a randomly coiled polypeptide. In 2-chloroethanol, thyrocalcitonin formed a structure containing approximately 50% Î± helix. The near ultraviolet circular dichroic spectrum of thyrocalcitonin revealed a major band at 288 mÂµ, indicating that the tryptophanyl chromophore had restricted rotational freedom. Reduction and alkylation of the amino-terminal heptapeptide ring of thyrocalcitonin produced no significant change in the circular dichroic or optical rotatory spectra. In addition, the effects of alkaline pH and temperature on tryptophanyl emission were similar to the unmodified hormone. These findings preclude a high degree of organized structure in the heptapeptide ring, which is in marked contrast to the amino-terminal hexapeptide ring of oxytocin. These studies indicate that porcine thyrocalcitonin exists predominately in a random coil in aqueous solution. The polypeptide, however, does not appear to possess a rigid conformation and a coil â helix equilibrium may exist in water with guanidine shifting the equilibrium in favor of the coil and 2-chloroethanol in favor of the helix. The latter type of transition may occur at the receptor site of the hormone in lipid layers or cellular membranes where the water concentration is significantly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1520626712,"Abstract Inhibition of purified AMP-deaminase from chicken breast muscle by phosphate esters and inorganic phosphate has been investigated. When tested at a concentration of 3 mm, in the presence of 0.15 m potassium chloride, the order of effectiveness as inhibitors of deaminase activity was: 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid, 2-phosphoglyceric acid, 2-phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, Î²-glycerophosphate l-Î±-glycerophosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and fructose 1-phosphate. Inhibition by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid, 2-phosphoenolpyruvate, and l-Î±-glycerophosphate was also tested in the absence of potassium chloride; the degree of inhibition was depressed. In contrast to inhibition by phosphate esters, addition of potassium chloride sharply reduced the degree of inhibition by inorganic phosphate. The effects of salts on enzyme activity and inhibition by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid have been compared. When tested at 0.15 m salt and in the presence of 95 Âµm 5'-AMP, the order of effectiveness as activators of enzyme activity was potassium chloride, lithium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium chloride, rubidium chloride, cesium chloride, and tetramethylammonium chloride. Ammonium, rubidium, potassium, and sodium chlorides enhanced the level of inhibition by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid approximately 2-fold. The effect was somewhat less with tetramethylammonium chloride and was negligible with lithium chloride. The role of sulfhydryl groups in inhibition by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, with and without sodium chloride, and their effect on catalytic activity have also been investigated. Native deaminase, as well as enzyme which had been denatured in 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, was titrated with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). It was found that six, out of a total of 26, sulfhydryl groups per mole of enzyme, can be substituted without loss of deaminase activity. Inhibition by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid was not altered by treatment with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)."

None of the recent authors has pointed out that there is a simple legal procedure that would instantly reduce the U.S. population growth rate by 20%-namely revise the immigration laws to bring net migration to the U.S. to zero. It is estimated that net migration to the U.S. is a positive 400000 per year. Although recent changes in the immigration laws may reduce somewhat the immigration level from the 450000 admitted n 1968 the current laws are not designed to bring about zero net migration. From a purely scientific point of view it is inefficient and ineffective to tell Americans to abort their children and kill their old folks because of the population crisis and at the same time allow a net positive migration of over 4 million each decade.(FULL TEXT)
