https://openalex.org/W2036048932,"The precise regulation of protein activity is fundamental to life. The allosteric control of an active site by a remote regulatory binding site is a mechanism of regulation found across protein classes, from enzymes to motors to signaling proteins. We describe a general approach for manipulating allosteric control using synthetic optical switches. Our strategy is exemplified by a ligand-gated ion channel of central importance in neuroscience, the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR). Using structure-based design, we have modified its ubiquitous clamshell-type ligand-binding domain to develop a light-activated channel, which we call LiGluR. An agonist is covalently tethered to the protein through an azobenzene moiety, which functions as the optical switch. The agonist is reversibly presented to the binding site upon photoisomerization, initiating clamshell domain closure and concomitant channel gating. Photoswitching occurs on a millisecond timescale, with channel conductances that reflect the photostationary state of the azobenzene at a given wavelength. Our device has potential uses not only in biology but also in bioelectronics and nanotechnology."

https://openalex.org/W2089598395,"It has been widely accepted that DNA can adopt other biologically relevant structures beside the Watson-Crick double helix. One recent important example is the guanine-quadruplex (G-quadruplex) structure formed by guanine tracts found in the MYC (or c-myc) promoter region, which regulates the transcription of the MYC oncogene. Stabilization of this G-quadruplex by ligands, such as the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, decreases the transcriptional level of MYC. Here, we report the first structure of a DNA fragment containing five guanine tracts from this region. An unusual G-quadruplex fold, which was derived from NMR restraints using unambiguous model-independent resonance assignment approaches, involves a core of three stacked guanine tetrads formed by four parallel guanine tracts with all anti guanines and a snapback 3′-end syn guanine. We have determined the structure of the complex formed between this G-quadruplex and TMPyP4. This structural information, combined with details of small-molecule interaction, provides a platform for the design of anticancer drugs targeting multi-guanine-tract sequences that are found in the MYC and other oncogenic promoters, as well as in telomeres."

https://openalex.org/W1968501645,"This study evaluated the action of tamoxifen and estradiol on the function of isolated liver mitochondria. We observed that although tamoxifen and estradiol per se did not affect mitochondrial complexes II, III, or IV, complex I is affected, this effect being more drastic (except for state 4 of respiration) when mitochondria were coincubated with both drugs. Furthermore, using two respiratory chain inhibitors, rotenone and diphenyliodonium chloride, we identified the flavin mononucleotide site of complex I as the target of tamoxifen and/or estradiol action(s). Tamoxifen (25 μm) per se induced a significant increase in hydrogen peroxide production and state 4 of respiration. Additionally, a significant decrease in respiratory control ratio, transmembrane, and depolarization potentials were observed. Estradiol per se decreased carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-stimulated respiration, state 3 of respiration, and respiratory control ratio and increased lag phase of repolarization. With the exception of state 4 of respiration whose increase induced by tamoxifen was reversed by the presence of estradiol, the effects of tamoxifen were highly exacerbated when estradiol was present. We observed that 10 μm tamoxifen in the presence of estradiol affected mitochondria significantly by decreasing FCCP-stimulated respiration, state 3 of respiration, respiratory control ratio, and ADP depolarization and increasing the lag phase of repolarization. All of the deleterious effects induced by 25 μm tamoxifen were highly exacerbated in the presence of estradiol. Furthermore, we observed that the effects of both compounds were independent of estrogen receptors because the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 did not interfere with tamoxifen and/or estradiol detrimental effects. Altogether, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the multiple cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen including its capacity to destroy tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in the presence of estradiol. This new piece of information provides a basis for the development of new and promising anticancer therapeutic strategies.

This new piece of information provides a basis for the development of new and promising anticancer therapeutic strategies. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, also known as tissue selective estrogens, are a class of drugs with mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist actions (1Wijayaratne A.L. Nagel S.C. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Norris J.D. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were originally classified as antiestrogens because of their ability to antagonize the proliferative effects of estrogens (2Lerner L.J. Hilf R. Turkheimer A.R. Michel I. Engel S.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 138: 863-870Google Scholar). It was later discovered that these compounds could antagonize the action of estrogen by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; DPI, diphenyliodonium chloride; E2, estradiol; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; RCR, respiratory control ratio; TAM, tamoxifen; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; DPI, diphenyliodonium chloride; E2, estradiol; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; RCR, respiratory control ratio; TAM, tamoxifen; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium. to thereby block estradiol (E2) access (1Wijayaratne A.L.

Treat. 1983; 3: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is now known that under certain circumstances and in certain tissues, in addition to acting as competitive inhibitors of endogenous estrogen, these same estrogen antagonists can exert estrogenic agonist properties (4Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 5McDonnell D.P. J. Soc. Gynecol.

These findings indicate that the mechanisms regulating ER function are not the same in all cells and that a compound can only be classified as an ER agonist or antagonist in relation to a specific cell type or process. It is known for a long time that breast cancer is an estrogen-dependent malignancy. Based on this finding, the current strategy for treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer is to block the action of estrogen on cancer cells either by inhibiting estrogen from binding to ER using an antiestrogen (7Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group Lancet. 1998; 351: 1451-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar) or preventing its synthesis using an aromatase inhibitor (8Baum M. Budzar A.U. Cuzick J. Forbes J. Houghton J.H. Klijn J.G. Sahmoud T. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2131-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen (TAM), the first clinically useful selective estrogen receptor modulators (9Jordan V.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), has antiestrogenic effects in the breast tissue and is the standard endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Currently, the standard of care for breast cancer is 5 years of TAM (7Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group Lancet. 1998; 351: 1451-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar) or an aromatase inhibitor such as anastrazole (8Baum M. Budzar A.U. Cuzick J. Forbes J. Houghton J.H. Klijn J.G. Sahmoud T. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2131-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). However, the consequence of long term TAM therapy is drug resistance (10Gottardis M.M. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5183-5187PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gottardis M.M. Jiang S.Y. Jeng M.H. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4090-4093PubMed Google Scholar). Although, resistance to TAM has been well documented (10Gottardis M.M. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5183-5187PubMed Google Scholar, 12Howell A. Dodwell D.J. Anderson H. Redford J. Ann. Oncol. 1992; 3: 611-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Schafer J.M. Lee E.S. O'Regan R.M. Yao K. Jordan V.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4373-4380PubMed Google Scholar), evidence suggests the emergence of a new form of drug resistance that develops after many years of selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy (14Lewis J.S. Cheng D. Jordan V.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that TAM-resistant breast cancer can be reversed by the use of low doses of E2 for a short period of time to resensitize ERα-positive tumors again to the growth inhibitory effects of antiestrogens (15Osipo C. Gajdos C. Cheng D. Jordan V.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 93: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, and as far as we know, this effect was not explored in a mechanistic point of view. We chose mitochondria as an experimental model because it is increasingly recognized that these organelles are essential for generating energy that fuels normal cellular function and, at the same time, are the major intracellular source of cytotoxic free radicals and the primary determinants of cell death (16Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). The unique role of the mitochondria is in supplying high energy ATP molecules, while at the same time, monitoring cellular health to make a rapid decision to initiate a programmed cell death. As such, mitochondria sit at a strategic position in the hierarchy of cellular organelles to continue the healthy life of the cell or to terminate it. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that both E2 (17Zheng J. Ramirez V.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 368: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Yang S.H. Liu R. Perez E.J. Wen Y. Stevens Jr., S.M. Valencia T. BrunZinkernagel A.M. Prokai L. Will Y. Dykens J. Koulen P. Simpkins J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and TAM (19Custódio J.B. Dinis T.C. Almeida L.M. Madeira V.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Custódio J.B. Moreno A.J. Wallace K.B. Toxicol. Appl.

Neuropharmacology. 2005; 48: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are capable of modulating mitochondrial function. To achieve our goal, we evaluated several mitochondrial parameters from the respiratory chain (states 3 and 4 of respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR), ADP/O ratio, and FCCP-stimulated respiration), oxidative phosphorylation system (transmembrane, depolarization, and repolarization potentials and lag phase of repolarization), and the capacity of mitochondria to produce hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, to identify the specific site(s) of TAM and/or E2 action(s), we performed our experiments in the presence/absence of two respiratory chain inhibitors, rotenone and diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI), and the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780. Materials—TAM and E2 were obtained from Sigma. DPI was obtained from Aldrich, and ICI 182,780 was obtained from TOCRIS (UK). All of the other chemicals were of the highest grade of purity commercially available. Animals—Male Wistar rats (3 months old) were housed in our animal colony (Laboratory Research Center, University Hospital, Coimbra, Portugal). They were maintained under controlled light (12 h day/night cycle) and humidity with free access (except in the fasting period) to water and powdered rodent chow (URF1; Charles River). Adhering to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the animals were sacrificed by cervical displacement and decapitation. Isolation of Liver Mitochondria—The animals were killed by cervical displacement, and the mitochondria were isolated by conventional methods (23Gazotti P. Malmstron K. Crompton M. A Laboratory Manual on Transport and Bioenergetics. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1979: 62-69Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the liver mitochondria were isolated in a medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% defatted bovine serum albumin (pH 7.2). EGTA and bovine serum albumin were omitted from the final washing medium. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and suspended in the washing medium. Mitochondrial protein was determined by the biuret method calibrated with bovine serum albumin (24Gornall A.G. Bardawill N.C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Respiration—Oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was monitored polarographically with a Clark oxygen electrode (25Estabrook R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) connected to a suitable recorder in a 1-ml thermostatted water-jacketed closed chamber with magnetic stirring. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C in 1 ml of the standard medium with 1 mg of protein. ICI (1 min) and/or E2 (1 min) and/or TAM (2 min) were incubated with isolates before 5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate or 5 mm succinate addition. Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) Measurements—The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) was monitored by evaluating transmembrane distribution of the lipophilic cation tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) with a TPP+-selective electrode prepared according to Kamo et al. (26Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake V. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) using a Ag/AgCl-saturated electrode (Tacussel, model MI 402) as reference. TPP+ uptake has been measured from the decreased TPP+ concentration in the medium sensed by the electrode. The potential difference between the selective electrode and the reference electrode was measured with an electrometer and recorded continuously in a Linear 1200 recorder. The voltage response of the TPP electrode to log[TPP+] was linear with a slope of 59 ± 1, in a good agreement with the Nernst equation. The reactions were carried out in a chamber with magnetic stirring in 1 ml of the standard medium (130 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 100 μm EGTA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 3 μm TPP+. This TPP+ concentration was chosen to achieve high sensitivity in measurements and to avoid possible toxic effects on mitochondria (27Jensen B.D. Gunter T.E. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 92Google Scholar, 28Wingrove D.E. Gunter T.E. Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1985; 44: 1082-1087Google Scholar). The ΔΨm was estimated by the following equation as indicated by Kamo et al. (26Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake V. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) and Muratsugu et al. (29Muratsugu M. Kamo N. Kurihara K. Kobatake Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 464: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ΔΨm(mV)=59log(v/V)-59log(10ΔE/59-1)(Eq. 1) v, V, and ΔE stand for mitochondrial volume, volume of the incubation medium, and deflection of the electrode potential from the base line, respectively. This equation was derived assuming that TPP+ distribution between the mitochondria and the medium follows the Nernst equation and that the law of mass conservation is applicable. A matrix volume of 1.1 μl/mg protein was assumed. No correction was made for the “passive” binding contribution of TPP+ to the mitochondrial membranes because the purpose of the experiments was to show relative changes in potentials rather than absolute values. As a consequence, we can anticipate a slight overestimation on ΔΨm values. However, the overestimation is only significant at ΔΨm values below 90 mV, therefore, far from our measurements. Neither TAM nor E2 affected TPP+ binding to mitochondrial membranes on the electrode response. Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were energized by the addition of 5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate. After a steady state distribution of TPP+ had been reached (∼1 min of recording), ICI and/or E2 and/or TAM were added, and ΔΨm fluctuations were recorded. Evaluation of Hydrogen Peroxide Production—The rate of H2O2 production was measured fluorimetrically using a modification of the method described by Barja (30Barja J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mitochondria were incubated at 30 °C with 5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate in 1.5 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm MgCl2, 145 mm KCl, 30 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm homovalinic acid, and 6 units/ml horseradish peroxidase in the presence or absence of 1 mm ICI, 0.5 mm DPI, rotenone and E2 and/or TAM. The incubation was stopped at 15 min with 0.5 ml of cold 2 m glycine buffer containing 25 mm EDTA and NaOH (pH 12). The fluorescence of supernatants was measured at 312-nm excitation wavelength and 420-nm emission wavelength. The rate of H2O2 was calculated using a standard curve of H2O2. Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as the means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was determined using the one-way analysis of variance test for multiple comparisons, followed by the post hoc Tukey-Kramer test. Mitochondrial Complex I Is the Key Target of the Deleterious Effects Induced by E2 Plus TAM—In control conditions after the addition of glutamate/malate (substrate of complex I) there was a slight increase in oxygen consumption (state 2 of respiration) caused by the activation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig. 1A). The addition of 1 μm FCCP, a well known respiratory chain uncoupler, promoted a significant stimulation of oxygen consumption (Figs. 1A and 2). The preincubation of mitochondria with 25 μm E2, 10 μm, and 25 μm TAM significantly decreased the consumption of oxygen induced by 1 μm FCCP (∼37, 20, and 19%, respectively) when compared with control condition (Fig. 2). However, the coincubation of mitochondria with 25 μm E2 and TAM (10 or 25 μm) exacerbated the decrease in FCCP-induced oxygen consumption, with this effect being much more pronounced in the presence of the highest concentration of TAM (∼52 and 79%, respectively) when compared with control condition (Figs. 1A and 2). The preincubation of mitochondria with 30 μm E2 and 25 μm TAM completely abolished FCCP-stimulated respiration (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when these conditions were tested in mitochondrial complex II (using succinate as substrate), we did not observe any statistical difference when we compared mitochondria without treatment with those incubated with E2 and/or TAM (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that mitochondrial complex I is the target of E2 and TAM.FIGURE 2Effect of TAM and/or E2 on FCCP-stimulated respiration. Freshly isolated liver mitochondria (1 mg) in 1 ml of the standard medium were energized with 5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate. The isolates were incubated with TAM and E2 for 2 and 1 min, respectively, at 30 °C, before mitochondria energization. aaa, p < 0.001; a, p < 0.05, when compared with FCCP-stimulated respiration. bbb, p < 0.001; b, p < 0.05, when compared with FCCP-stimulated respiration in the presence of 25μm E2. ccc, p < 0.001, when compared with FCCP-stimulated respiration in the presence of 10 μm TAM. ddd, p < 0.001, when compared with FCCP-stimulated respiration in the presence of 25 μm TAM. eee, p < 0.001, when compared with FCCP-stimulated respiration in the presence of 25 μm E2 and 10 μm TAM. The data shown represent the means ± S.E. from six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Respiratory Chain Activity Is Drastically Affected When Mitochondria Are Coincubated with E2 and TAM—RCR is the ratio between mitochondrial respiration states 3 (consumption of oxygen in the presence of substrate and ADP) and 4 (consumption of oxygen after ADP has been consumed). We observed that 25 μm TAM induced a significant increase in respiration state 4 (∼143%) when compared with control condition (Fig. 3). However, coincubation of E2 with TAM decreased this parameter to a value similar to that of control conditions (Fig. 3). Preincubation of mitochondria with ICI, the pure estrogen antagonist, did not affect this parameter, indicating that estrogen receptors are not involved in these effects. This finding is supported by the results obtained with mitochondria incubated with ICI and TAM (25μm) alone or in combination with E2 (25 μm) because the increase observed in respiration state 4 (∼101 and 90%, respectively) is not statistically significant compared with that induced by 25 μm TAM per se (Fig. 3). When we analyzed respiration state 3, we observed that 30 μm E2 induced a decrease of this parameter (∼34%) when compared with control condition (Fig. 4). Similarly, coincubation of mitochondria with E2 (25 or 30 μm) and 10 μm TAM induced a decrease in respiration state 3 (∼36 and 35%, respectively), and this effect was exacerbated when both E2 concentrations were present with 25 μm TAM (∼47 and 53%, respectively) (Fig. 4). ICI in the presence of E2 (25 μm) alone or in combination with TAM (25 μm) induced a significant decrease in respiration state 3 (∼38 and 52%, respectively) when compared with control condition (Fig. 4). However, this decrease was not statistically significant from that induced by 25 μm E2, indicating that the effect on respiration state 3 is only due to E2 action (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows that 25 and 30 μm E2 induced a similar decrease in RCR (∼26 and 36%) and that 25 μm TAM promoted a drastic decrease of this parameter (∼64%) when compared with control condition. However, coincubation of mitochondria with 25 or 30 μm E2 and 10 μm TAM significantly potentiated the decrease in RCR (∼51 and 58%, respectively), and this potentiation was more pronounced when both concentrations of estradiol were present with 25 μm TAM (∼72 and 76%, respectively), when compared with control condition. Once again, ICI per se did not affect RCR (Fig. 5). The ADP/O ratio, an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, is expressed by the ratio between the amount of ADP added and the oxygen consumed during state 3 respiration. We observed that coincubation of 25 or 30 μm E2 with 25 μm TAM induced a similar decrease in the ADP/O ratio (∼37% and ∼21%, respectively) when compared with control condition (Fig. 6). Similar to what happened with the previous parameters analyzed, ICI did not interfere with ADP/O ratio (Fig. 6). Although we observed a decrease in ADP/O ratio when mitochondria were coincubated with ICI, 25 μm E2, and 25 μm TAM, this effect was not statistically different from that induced by E2 and TAM in the absence of ICI (Fig. 6). Oxidative Phosphorylation System Is Drastically Affected When Mitochondria Are Coincubated with E2 and TAM—The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) is fundamental for the phenomenon of oxidative phosphorylation, the conversion of ADP to ATP via ATP synthase. Mitochondrial respiratory chain pumps H+ out of the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The H+ gradient forms an electrochemical potential (Δp), resulting in a pH (ΔpH) and a voltage gradient (ΔΨm) across the mitochondrial inner membrane. ΔΨm developed by mitochondria after energization with glutamate/malate was ∼-220 mV (negative inside) (Fig. 7). However, the addition of TAM after mitochondria energization induced a decrease in ΔΨm, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Because the addition of E2 (25 or 30 μm) did not significantly affect ΔΨm, we compared the alterations promoted by the other conditions on ΔΨm with that induced by E2. We observed that, with the exception of 10 μm TAM, all of the other experimental conditions induced a significant decrease in ΔΨm, with this effect being much more pronounced when 25 μm TAM was present with 25 and 30 μm E2 (∼77 and 101%, respectively) when compared with E2 alone (Fig. 7).FIGURE 8Effect of TAM and/or E2 on ΔΨm. Freshly isolated liver mitochondria (1 mg) in 1 ml of the standard medium were energized with 5 mm glutamate/2.5 mm malate.

The data shown represent the means ± S.E. from six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the depolarization induced by ADP was not statistically affected when we compared E2 and/or TAM effects with control condition, we observed that the repolarization potential (capacity of mitochondria to reestablish ΔΨm, after ADP phosphorylation) decreased similarly in the presence of 25 μm TAM (∼5%), 25 μm E2 plus 10 μm TAM (∼5%), 25 μm E2 plus 25 μm TAM (∼8%), and 30 μm E2 plus 10 μm TAM (∼8%) when compared with control conditions (Figs. 7 and 9). It should be noted that the presence of 30 μm E2 plus 25 μm TAM potentiated the decrease of repolarization potential (∼11%) when compared with control condition (Fig. 9). It is noteworthy that ICI did not interfere with this parameter (Fig. 9). The lag phase of repolarization (time necessary for ADP phosphorylation) was significantly affected by 25 and 30 μm E2 (∼58 and 69%, respectively) when compared with control condition (Figs. 7 and 10). This effect of E2 was exacerbated in the presence of 10 μm TAM (∼66 and 92%, respectively) and 25 μm TAM (∼97 and 159%, respectively) (Figs. 7 and 10). Additionally, the presence of ICI did not induce any statistical difference in the lag phase of repolarization (Fig. 10). Hydrogen Peroxide Production Is Potentiated When Mitochondria Are Coincubated with E2 and TAM: FMN Is the Site in Complex I Where Both Compounds Exert Their Effects—The production of H2O2 by mitochondria gives an indication about the propensity of mitochondria to originate and/or exacerbate oxidative stress. At basal conditions (control), we observed that incubation of mitochondria with 25 μm TAM induced an increase on H2O2 production (∼41%) (Table 1). However, after the coincubation of mitochondria with 30 μm E2 and 25 μm TAM/mg protein, we observed a potentiation in H2O2 production (∼84%) when compared with untreated mitochondria (Table 1). Except in the conditions where 25 μm TAM was present, rotenone pretreatment increased the levels of H2O2 in all of the conditions tested when compared with levels generated by mitochondria not exposed to complex I inhibitors (Table 1). In the presence of ICI, we observed that incubation of mitochondria with 25μm TAM induced an increase in H2O2 production (∼32%) (Table 1), this effect being exacerbated when mitochondria were coincubated with 30 μm E2 and 25 μm TAM (∼88%) when compared with the untreated mitochondria (Table 1). In the presence of DPI, which irreversibly binds to the FMN site in complex I, we did not observe any statistical difference between the several experimental conditions assayed, and in all cases, the level of H2O2 production was very low (Table 1), indicating that both TAM and E2 exert their effects on H2O2 production through the FMN site of complex I.TABLE 1Effect of TAM and/or E2 on H2O2 production Freshly isolated liver mitochondria were incubated at 0.2 mg protein/ml under standard conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values of H2O2 are given in nmol/mg protein/15 min.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway glands fail to secrete mucus in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide or forskolin; the failure was attributed to loss of CFTR-mediated anion and fluid secretion. Alternatively, CF glands might secrete acinar fluid via CFTR-independent pathways, but the exit of mucus from the glands could be blocked by hyperabsorption of fluid in the gland ducts. This could occur because CFTR loss can disinhibit ENaC, and ENaC activity can drive absorption. To test these two hypotheses, we measured single gland mucus secretion optically and applied ENaC inhibitors to determine whether they augmented secretion. Human CF glands were pretreated with benzamil and then stimulated with forskolin in the continued presence of benzamil. Benzamil did not rescue the lack of secretion to forskolin (50 glands, 6 CF subjects) nor did it increase the rate of cholinergically mediated mucus secretion from CF glands. Finally, neither benzamil nor amiloride increased forskolin-stimulated mucus secretion from porcine submucosal glands (75 glands, 7 pigs). One possible explanation for these results is that ENaC within the gland ducts was not active in our experiments. Consistent with that possibility, we discovered that human airway glands express Kunitz-type and non-Kunitz serine protease inhibitors, which might prevent proteolytic activation of ENaC. Our results suggest that CF glands do not display excessive, ENaC-mediated fluid absorption, leaving defective, anion-mediated fluid secretion as the most likely mechanism for defective mucus secretion from CF glands.

Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Submucosal glands are the major sites for mucus production in large airways. They secrete the gel-forming mucin MUC5B, many innate defense molecules, and the serine protease inhibitors α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin (2Joo N.S. Lee D.J. Winges K.M. Rustagi A. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38854-38860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The innate mucosal defense system, which includes mucociliary and cough clearance, effectively entraps, inactivates, and removes airborne pathogens to maintain sterile airways (1Knowles M.R.

These vital host defenses are compromised in CF airways, allowing pathogens to grow within static airway mucus eventually destroying the lungs. Human CF airway glands fail to secrete mucus in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP, or forskolin (4Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol.

However, the properties of CF gland mucus produced in response to carbachol are altered (5Jayaraman S. Joo N.S. Reitz B. Wine J.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8119-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and their responses appear to be reduced when corrected for the hypertrophied state of CF glands. 3N. S. Joo and J. J.

The direct explanation for these results is that CFTR-mediated fluid secretion is lost in CF glands. However, both CFTR and ENaC are expressed in human submucosal glands (8Burch L.H. Talbot C.R.

Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L485-L490PubMed Google Scholar).What role does ENaC play in submucosal glands, and how is it regulated? Nothing is known about the activity or function of ENaC within submucosal glands, but in the ciliated cells of the airway surface ENaC is complexly regulated. For example, CFTR expression appears to inhibit ENaC in the airways via an unknown mechanism, while ENaC is activated extracellularly by diverse membrane proteases (13Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

The function of ENaC within glands is of increased interest because of a recent study which suggested that gland acini contain only scant CFTR (11Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), while the ducts contain abundant CFTR, raising the question of how the non-responsiveness of CF glands can be explained. One possibility is that the ducts actually secrete the glandular fluid. Another is that the co-localization of ENaC and CFTR in the ciliated ducts of glands may mean that ENaC is disinhibited in CF glands by the loss of CFTR (17Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), leading to increased volume absorption of fluid from CF glands. That might be sufficient to block secretion from CF glands.To test this latter hypothesis, we used reverse transcriptase PCR to confirm the presence of ENaC subunits in human submucosal glands and then used optical methods to study secretion rates of single submucosal glands from CF subjects and from normal pigs in the presence or absence of ENaC inhibitors. We found no evidence that ENaC inhibitors altered secretion rates in either normal or CF glands. To try to understand why this might be, we used reverse transcriptase PCR to show that glands express multiple serine protease inhibitors. These results are discussed in terms of a hypothesis that innate anti-serine proteases modify ENaC activity both within glands and on the surface of the airways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAirway Tissues and Cell Cultures—Human CF lungs and tracheal scraps from donors were obtained from lung transplants or, in one CF case, from an autopsy specimen harvested less than 2 h post mortem at Stanford Hospital. The average ages of the CF transplants were 29 ± 2 years, and three of them were male. Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University. Post-mortem (<1 h) Yorkshire pig tracheas were obtained from the animal facility at Stanford University after acute experiments unrelated to our studies. The human airway gland serous cell line, Calu-3, was maintained as described previously (2Joo N.S. Lee D.J. Winges K.M. Rustagi A. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38854-38860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The human airway surface epithelial cell line, H441, was kindly provided by Rabin Tirouvanziam, Stanford University, and maintained in a T25 tissue culture flask containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged once at 7-10 days with a density of ∼1.5 × 104/cm2.Tissue Preparations and Optical Measurements—Harvested tissues were kept until use in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The KRB buffer composition was 115 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4) adjusted to ∼290 mosm with a Wescor vapor pressure osmometer. To minimize endogenously generated prostaglandins during tissue preparation, 1.0 μm indomethacin was present in the Krebs buffer. Tissue preparation for optical measurements and the experimental setup for single gland mucus secretion measurements were described previously (4Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I.

Briefly, a piece of dissected human CF bronchial preparation was mounted as apical-side-up in a Sylgard-lined 35-mm plastic Petri dish and placed onto an optical chamber where temperature and pH are controlled. The surface of the tissue was cleaned, dried, and covered with water-saturated mineral oil. The rate at which spherical mucus bubbles were secreted from the gland ducts into the oil layer was optically recorded at intervals of 1-5 min using a computer-controlled Nikon digital camera. Stored images were analyzed by Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). To determine the effects of ENaC blockers, tissue preparations were pretreated with 10 μm amiloride or 10 μm benzamil for various durations (5-60 min) and exposed either apically only or apically + basolaterally. They were then stimulated with 10 μm forskolin in the continued presence of the inhibitor in the bath.Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA was extracted from isolated human airway glands, Calu-3 cells, and H441 cells using the Qiagen total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, CA). Primer pairs were designed to span an intron whenever possible as an additional precaution against contamination by genomic templates. The primer sequences, expected sizes (bp) of the amplicons, and GenBank™ reference sequence accession numbers used for designing primers are shown in Table 1. The PCR amplifications were done for 35 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C followed by 45 s at 53-56 °C and 60 s at 72 °C using the Qiagen HotStarTaq DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen, CA). PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining.TABLE 1PCR primer sequences of ENaC and serine protease inhibitors RefSeq represents a reference sequence of GenBank™ accession number used for designing primers or cited reference in this study.

In marked contrast, glands from CF subjects show virtually no response to these agents, even though they continue to respond to carbachol (4Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I.

The lack of mucus secretion in response to VIP and forskolin shows in Fig. 1A, while carbachol produced a good response (sustained carbachol secretion rates: 5.38 ± 1.08 nl/min for 8 glands).FIGURE 1Lack of mucus secretion in response to cAMP agonists in CF airways. A, the CF gland preparation was initially stimulated 2 μm carbachol to clear out potentially clogged CF gland ducts followed by thorough washout of carbachol from bath solution. The glands then were stimulated with 1 μm VIP and 10 μm forskolin (Fsk) for 60 min and were subsequently stimulated with 10 μm carbachol (Carb). The arrows show the time points when the corresponding drugs are added. While no increase is found with VIP + forskolin, the carbachol treatment causes mucus secretion. A representative time course is shown here in an analyzed subset of 151 glands from 18 different CF subjects.

Both glands were stained with Neutral Red dye to visualize them, and the one on the right clearly shows ductal parts of a gland after being injected with Brilliant Blue dye into its ductal opening.

C, reverse transcriptase PCR of total RNA from isolated human submucosal glands (Hm-SMG), Calu-3 human gland serous cell lines, and H441 human airway surface cells was carried out using primer sets that encompass at least one intron. The expected amplicon sizes of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits are 188, 173, and 155 bp, respectively.

These glands were selected based on the presence of mucus bubbles prior to carbachol stimulation, which ensured that the ducts were not blocked. The mean secretion rate in response to forskolin/VIP in this set of CF glands was 0.01 ± 0.01 nl/min. This contrasts with response rates to forskolin of 0.94 ± 0.19 nl/min for 139 glands from 16 normal donor control subjects and 0.99 ± 0.23 nl/min for 79 glands from 12 disease control subjects. This ∼100-fold difference in response rates was previously interpreted to be the result of the loss of CFTR in CF gland serous cells and the consequent absence of the HCO3- and Cl--mediated fluid secretion thought to occur via CFTR (4Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50710-50715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This interpretation is based on the assumption that Calu-3 cells, which secrete copious fluid in response to VIP and forskolin (21Irokawa T. Krouse M.E. Joo N.S. Wu J.V. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L784-L793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), are a reasonable model for gland serous cells, as well as on the observation that gland serous cells express abundant CFTR (9Engelhardt J.F. Yankaskas J.R. Ernst S.A. Yang Y. Marino C.R. Boucher R.C. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar).However, a reinvestigation of human airways with a new set of monoclonal antibodies found only sparse and variable CFTR in the gland serous cells but abundant CFTR in the airway surface and in the ducts (11Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The different, antibody-dependent distributions of CFTR remain to be resolved. One approach to resolving the differences is to use physiology to assess some possible functional consequences of each pattern. Because CFTR in the ducts is accompanied by ENaC (10Gaillard D. Hinnrasky J. Coscoy S. Hofman P. Matthay M.A. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L177-L184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kreda S.M. Mall M. Mengos A. Rochelle L. Yankaskas J. Riordan J.R. Boucher R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2154-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and because of evidence that the loss of CFTR increases ENaC activity in CF airways (17Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), an alternative explanation for the lack of CF gland secretion is that VIP/forskolin still stimulates CF glands to secrete fluid via non-CFTR pathways, but the lack of observed fluid secretion from the openings of CF gland ducts results from enhanced, ENaC-driven fluid volume absorption in the CF gland ducts. The volume absorption need not completely offset secretion; it could be that hyperabsorption in the small diameter ducts could lead to blockage.Confirmation of ENaC Expression in Human Airway Glands—Two prior studies, taken together, provided evidence for ENaC expression in glands, but neither study alone demonstrated expression of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits (8Burch L.H. Talbot C.R. Knowles M.R. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C511-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gaillard D. Hinnrasky J. Coscoy S. Hofman P. Matthay M.A. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L177-L184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows two representative isolated human submucosal glands after injections with Brilliant Blue (right one: note dark blue collecting ductal parts) followed by whole gland staining with Neutral Red dye to more clearly visualize the glands and permit certainty that the tissue was glandular. Reverse transcriptase PCR for α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits were carried out using human airway submucosal glands, Calu-3 cells, and H441 human airway surface epithelial cells as sources for RNA. We extracted total RNA from each sample and ran reverse transcriptase PCR as described. All three ENaC subunits were demonstrated in RNA from isolated human glands and from H441 surface epithelial cells (Fig. 1C). Calu-3 cells only expressed the α-ENaC subunit. Calu-3 cells lack amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport (22Singh M. Krouse M. Moon S. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L690-L698PubMed Google Scholar). These PCR results confirm previous reports that ENaC is expressed in human airway surface epithelia and submucosal glands (8Burch L.H. Talbot C.R. Knowles M.R. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C511-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gaillard D. Hinnrasky J. Coscoy S. Hofman P. Matthay M.A. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L177-L184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Continued Lack of Responses to Forskolin in CF Glands Exposed to ENaC Inhibitors—To test the hypothesis that defective gland secretion is caused by enhanced ENaC-driven fluid absorption within CF glands, CF airway glands were incubated with a 10 μm concentration of the potent ENaC inhibitor benzamil for 5-60 min and were then stimulated with forskolin in the continued presence of the inhibitor in the bath. If 1) forskolin-stimulated CF glands still secrete fluid via non-CFTR pathways, and if 2) ENaC is active or hyperactive in CF glands as it appears to be in surface epithelia of CF airways, and if 3) ENaC mediates the absorption of fluid volume as it appears to do for surface epithelia (17Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), then it might be expected that the inhibition of ENaC could rescue, at least partially, forskolin-stimulated fluid secretion of CF glands.Results from two representative experiments with benzamil are shown in Fig. 2. In the first experiment, benzamil was added to a CF tissue containing glands that were secreting low levels of mucus basally. Benzamil treatment did not affect the basal mucus secretion nor was their any significant stimulation of secretion by subsequent treatment with 10 μm forskolin in the presence of benzamil (Fig. 2A). This result is significant because the low rate of basal secretion proves that the ducts were not blocked; hence even small increases in the net rate of fluid flow from the ducts should have been observed if secretion were the net result of opposing volume secretion and ENaC-based volume absorption. However, a potential criticism of this kind of experiment is that the benzamil might not gain access to ENaC in the lumen of the duct.To partially address that concern, some CF gland preparations were pretreated with benzamil for up to 60 min both apically and basolaterally before the preparation was stimulated with forskolin. Despite this prolonged exposure, there was still no rescue of forskolin-stimulated secretion, as shown for a representative preparation treated for 60 min (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments were carried out with a total of 50 glands from 6 different CF subjects with the same results: there was no indication of any increase in either basal secretion, when present, and no rescue of the lack of forskolin-stimulated secretion.To verify tissue viability, the tissue was stimulated with 10 μm carbachol in the presence of benzamil at the end of experiment. The sustained response to carbachol from 5 amiloride or benzamil pretreated subjects was 2.0 ± 0.35 nl/min (40 glands from 5 CF subjects) versus 2.96 ± 0.52 nl/min for carbachol responses from a larger series of CF tissues that were not treated with ENaC inhibitors (143 glands from 17 CF subjects, t test, p = 0.14, not significant).No Effect of Benzamilon Forskolin-stimulated Mucus Secretion from Healthy Pig Glands—To determine whether ENaC-driven volume absorption plays a role in normal airway glands, experiments like those above were also carried out with porcine tracheal preparations. These were pretreated with the ENaC inhibitors benzamil or amiloride with vehicle controls and were then stimulated with 10 μm forskolin in the continued presence or absence of the inhibitors (Fig. 2C). No significant differences in mucus secretion rates were observed in the presence of either ENaC inhibitor. Secretion rates from individual glands were 0.73 ± 0.14 nl/min in the benzamil/amiloride-pretreated group (n = 8, 75 glands from 7 pigs) and 0.67 ± 0.14 nl/min in the control group (n = 8, 75 gland"

To elucidate the still unclear toxicity of Phyt, mitochondria from brain and heart of adult rats were exposed to free Phyt. Phyt at low micromolar concentrations (maximally: 100 nmol/mg of protein) enhances superoxide (O2·¯) 2The abbreviations used are: O2·¯, superoxide; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; DCFH, dichlorofluorescin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FCCP, p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone.2The abbreviations used are: O2·¯, superoxide; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; DCFH, dichlorofluorescin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FCCP, p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. generation. Phyt induces O2·¯ in state 3 (phosphorylating), as well as in state 4 (resting). Phyt stimulates O2·¯ generation when the respiratory chain is fed with electrons derived from oxidation of glutamate/malate, pyruvate/malate, or succinate in the presence of rotenone. With succinate alone, Phyt suppresses O2·¯ generation caused by reverse electron transport from succinate to complex I. The enhanced O2·¯ generation by Phyt in state 4 is in contrast to the mild uncoupling concept. In this concept uncoupling by nonesterified fatty acids should abolish O2·¯ generation. Stimulation of O2·¯ generation by Phyt is paralleled by inhibition of the electron transport within the respiratory chain or electron leakage from the respiratory chain. The interference of Phyt with the electron transport was demonstrated by inhibition of state 3- and p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-dependent respiration, inactivation of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex in permeabilized mitochondria, decrease in reduction of the synthetic electron acceptor 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in state 4, and increase of the mitochondrial NAD(P)H level in FCCP-uncoupled mitochondria. Thus, we suggest that complex I is the main site of Phyt-stimulated O2·¯ generation. Furthermore, inactivation of aconitase and oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool show that enhanced O2·¯ generation with chronic exposure to Phyt causes oxidative damage.

Furthermore, inactivation of aconitase and oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool show that enhanced O2·¯ generation with chronic exposure to Phyt causes oxidative damage. The clinical manifestation of Refsum disease, a neurological disorder, is attributed to highly elevated levels of phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) in serum and tissue (1Dacremont G. Cocquyt G. Vincent G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Wanders R.J.A. Jakobs C. Skjeldal O.H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3303-3321Google Scholar). Dairy products, such as milk and cheese, and red meat (cow, sheep) are the major source of the phytanic acid intake in human. Phytanic acid is a branched-chain fatty acid formed from the phytol side chain of chlorophyll by bacterial activities in the gut of ruminants (3Patton S. Benson A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 125: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The methyl group in the β-position of the hydrocarbon tail prevents formation of a 3-keto intermediate product; therefore phytanoyl-CoA cannot be degraded by β-oxidation. Degradation of phytanoyl-CoA starts within peroxisomes by α-oxidation, forming 2-hydroxyphytanate, which is thereafter converted to pristanic acid (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoic acid) (4Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, pristanic acid is degraded by combined peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation to propionyl-CoA (3×), acetyl-CoA (3×), and isobutyryl-CoA. In Refsum disease patients degradation of phytanic acid is impaired mostly due to a defective phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.18). However, the import of this enzyme by peroxisomes or the α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) can also be impaired (6Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Jansen G.A. Wanders R.J. Lloyd M.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme links peroxisomal α-oxidation with β-oxidation. Clinical signs demonstrate that phytanic acid is toxic especially in those tissues, which have high ATP turnover, such as brain or heart (2Wanders R.J.A. Jakobs C. Skjeldal O.H. Scriver C.R.

Feher M.D. Gibberd F.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We reported previously that in sharp contrast to palmitic acid, the homologue phytanic acid triggered rapid cell death of cultured astrocytes (8Kahlert S. Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 18: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This pronounced toxicity of phytanic acid was paralleled by (i) enhancement of cytosolic Ca2+ (8Kahlert S. Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 18: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), (ii) depolarization of mitochondria (8Kahlert S. Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 18: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Schönfeld P. Kahlert S. Reiser G. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and (iii) stimulation of cellular superoxide (O2·¯) generation (8Kahlert S. Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 18: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Stimulation of O2·¯ generation in astrocytes by phytanic acid is a surprising finding, because it contradicts the mild uncoupling concept. This concept implies that even a slight lowering of the potential at the inner mitochondrial membrane due to the protonophoric effect of fatty acids decreases the respiratory chain-driven O2·¯ generation (10Brookes P.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 11Korshunov S.S. Korkina O.V. Ruuge E.K. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Skulachev V.P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 169-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To get insight into the mechanism of phytanic acid-mediated O2·¯ generation, we applied phytanic acid as well as its homologue palmitic acid to mitochondria isolated from rat brain and heart. O2·¯ generation was measured in resting (state 4) and phosphorylating (state 3) mitochondria by determining the release of H2O2. The mitochondrial electron transport chain is assumed to represent the main source of cellular O2·¯ generation (for review, see Ref. 13Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 70: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Although complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain has been widely accepted as a major source of mitochondrial O2·¯ generation (13Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 70: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), the site(s) of O2·¯ generation in complex I are still under debate. Thus, it has been discussed that the one-electron transfer to molecular oxygen could happen from the FMN moiety, the low potential FeS centers or the semiubiquinone-binding site of complex I (14Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 15Kudin A.P. Bimpong-Buta N.Y. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. J. Biol.

In addition, complex III (ubiquinone-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is capable of O2·¯ generation, with semiubiquinone as the widely accepted responsible electron donor (18Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 19Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 20Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). O2·¯ is released to both sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane (21Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 22St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar), where it is converted to H2O2 and O2 by spontaneous dismutation or by superoxide dismutase (18Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Boveris A. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex might also contribute to the O2·¯ generation (24Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. Chinopoulos C. Lorenzo B.J. Browne S.E. Patel M.S. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7779-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 25Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7771-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is well known that inhibition of the electron flux in the respiratory chain by rotenone or antimycin A dramatically increases the O2·¯ generation (20Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 26Hinkle P.C. Butow R.A. Racker E. Chance B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5169-5173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the possibility whether an interference of phytanic acid with the electron flux causes an enhanced O2·¯ generation. This concept is consistent with the molecular distortion hypothesis (27Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2351-2369Google Scholar), which proposes that incorporation of phytanic acid into the inner membrane disturbs the well ordered arrangement of phospholipids and proteins due to the bulky hydrocarbon tail. In line with this hypothesis is the decreased phase transition temperature, observed after enrichment of phytanic acid in membranes of the fungus Neurospora crassa (28Friedman K.J. Glick D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 64: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we found that phytanic acid strongly enhanced O2·¯ generation in resting and in phosphorylating mitochondria. The increase in O2·¯ generation can be attributed mostly to an interaction of phytanic acid with complex I. In addition, phytanic acid enhanced oxidative stress in mitochondria, which was detected by the inactivation of the matrix enzyme aconitase. Preparation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria from rat brain were prepared as described by Liu et al. (29Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from rat heart were prepared as described by Schaller et al. (30Schaller H. Letko G. Kunz W. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1978; 37: 31-38PubMed Google Scholar). Protein contents in the stock suspensions were determined by the Biuret method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Measurement of H2O2 Release—Generation of O2·¯ was measured as release of H2O2 from mitochondria using dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) plus horseradish peroxidase as the detection system (31Degli Esposti M. Methods (Orlando). 2002; 26: 335-340Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml) were incubated at 22 °C in incubation buffer (110 mm mannitol, 60 mm KCl, 60 mm Tris, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) in the presence of pyruvate plus malate or glutamate plus malate or succinate) as respiratory substrates. Each substrate was given at 5 mm concentration. Buffers were further supplemented with 2.4 μm DCFH plus horseradish peroxidase (2 units/ml) to detect H2O2 and, for quantitative conversion of O2·¯ into H2O2 with Cu,Zn-dismutase (2 units/ml). Oxidation of the nonfluorescent DCFH by H2O2 plus horseradish peroxidase yields the fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF). DCFH was prepared freshly by alkaline treatment of dichlorofluorescin-diacetate as described. Changes in fluorescence were monitored by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B fluorescence spectrometer (excitation at 475 nm, emission at 525 nm). For calibration of the fluorescence intensity changes, 60 pmol of H2O2 was added to the cuvette. NADH-ubiquinone Oxidoreductase—Enzymatic activity of complex I was assayed by monitoring the rotenone-sensitive initial rate of NADH oxidation at 340 nm (32Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a sample and reference cuvette mitochondria (0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein), treated by freeze-thawing cycles, were suspended in 1 ml of reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm Pi, 8 mm Mg2+, 2 mm KCN, 150 μm NADH (pH 7.2; 30 °C). The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μm ubiquinone Q2, and, after 5 min of monitoring, 10 μm rotenone was added. Activities were measured spectrophotometrically with a Varian Cary 3E spectrophotometer. Aconitase—Enzymatic activity was measured by recording the formation of NADPH at 340 nm (33Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since complex I substrates interfere with the aconitase assay, we examined the effect of O2·¯ generation on matrix aconitase activity as follows. Mitochondria (0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein) were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in EGTA-free incubation buffer supplemented with 5 mm succinate, 5 μm rotenone, 5 mm citrate, 0.8 mm NADP+, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase. To allow access of the indicator metabolites to matrix aconitase, 0.05% lauroyl maltoside (v/v) was added. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Reduction—Reduction of MTT to a blue-colored formazan dye was used to assess the activity of the electron flow along the respiratory chain (34Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Samples of mitochondria (0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein) were suspended in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 1 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer supplemented with pyruvate plus malate (5 mm/5 mm) in the presence or absence of phytanic acid or respiratory chain inhibitors for 5 min. Thereafter, tubes were warmed to 25 °C in the presence of MTT (0.1 mg/ml). After a 10-min incubation period at 25 °C, tubes were centrifuged, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were suspended in 1 ml of pure ethanol. Reduction of MTT is given by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a Varian Cary 3E spectrophotometer. Mitochondrial NAD(P)H Levels—Changes in mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) were measured by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B fluorescence spectrometer (excitation at 358 nm, emission at 465 nm). Mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in 1 ml of incubation buffer supplemented with glutamate plus malate (5 mm/5 mm). Glutathione Measurements—The mitochondrial content of glutathione was measured with the enzymatic recycling assay described in (35Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Samples withdrawn from incubations were denatured by sulfosalicylic acid, deproteinized by centrifugation, and thereafter neutralized with Tris. For determining oxidized glutathione, neutralized samples were treated with 2-vinylpyridine (2%), as described (36Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione was calculated by substracting GSSG from total glutathione content. Oxygen Uptake—Oxygen uptake by mitochondria was measured using an oxygraph (Oroboros Oxygraph®, Bioenergetics and Biomedical Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) at 30 °C. Briefly, mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were suspended in 2 ml of incubation medium supplemented with 5 mm pyruvate plus 5 mm malate as complex I substrates. The respiratory control index was greater than 6. Data Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Significance was examined by the unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Phytanic Acid Inhibits the Electron Transport in the Respiratory Chain—Fig. 1 shows the effect of micromolar concentrations of phytanic acid, palmitic acid, and phytanic acid methyl ester on the oxygen uptake of maximally phosphorylating rat brain mitochondria using pyruvate plus malate as substrates. Phytanic acid decreased the state 3 respiration remarkably within the concentration range tested (corresponding to values of upto 100 nmol/mg of protein at the maximum), contrary to the lack of effect of palmitic acid. Inhibition is due to a direct interaction of phytanic acid with redox carriers of the electron transport chain, because phytanic acid inhibits the oxygen uptake of FCCP-uncoupled mitochondria similarly (Fig. 1A). In the esterified form, phytanic acid was without effect on the oxygen uptake both in state 3 and in resting mitochondria (Fig. 1C). Next, the enzymatic activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of phytanic acid (corresponding to 200 nmol/mg of protein at the maximum). We also tested for comparison palmitic acid. Since the binding site for NADH is on the matrix site of the inner membrane, mitochondria were prepared by freezing and thawing to provide access for externally added NADH to complex I. Fig. 2 shows that the activity of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase declined with increasing concentrations of phytanic acid in the incubation mixture. Similar to the experiment shown in Fig. 1, palmitic acid affects the enzymatic activity to a very small degree only. Phytanic Acid Inhibits Electron Transfer from the Respiratory Chain to the Acceptor MTT—Our next attempt was to localize the site of interaction of phytanic acid within the mitochondrial electron transport chain by application of MTT, a synthetic electron acceptor. MTT becomes reduced to a blue-colored dye by nonenzymatic one-electron transfer reactions from the respiratory chain. Reduction of MTT takes place at distinct sites of the electron transport chain (34Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). This gives the possibility to identify those sites, where phytanic acid could interfere with the electron transport. Mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate plus malate were treated either with respiratory chain toxins or with phytanic acid (Fig. 3). The respiratory chain toxin rotenone (complex I inhibitor), which blocks the transfer of electrons from FeS N-2 centers to ubiquinone, decreased MTT reduction by about 80%. The complex III inhibitors myxothiazol, antimycin A, or stiggmatellin diminished the reduction of MTT only marginally by 10 to 30%. In comparison to these respiratory chain inhibitors, phytanic acid decreased the MTT reduction to an extent similar to that of rotenone. Phytanic Acid Causes Oxidation of Mitochondrial Pyridine Nucleotides—From both findings, uncoupling of mitochondrial energy transduction (9Schönfeld P. Kahlert S. Reiser G. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and partial inactivation of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (Fig. 2), it is expected that the level of reduced mitochondrial NAD(P)H is changed when mitochondria are treated with phytanic acid. To examine this, the NAD(P)H level was monitored fluorimetrically in mitochondria respiring glutamate plus malate at the resting state before and after addition of phytanic acid. Fig. 4 shows that addition of 50 μm phytanic acid (corresponding to 100 nmol/mg of protein) dramatically decreases the NAD(P)H level (A). A similar oxidation of NAD(P)H occurs when the synthetic protonophore FCCP is added (B). Furthermore, when after the addition of phytanic acid or FCCP rotenone is applied, oxidation of NAD(P)H becomes reversed. This clearly indicates that NAD(P)H oxidation is due to the protonophoric activity of phytanic acid. Next, we examined the ability of phytanic acid to inhibit the electron transport within complex I using FCCP-uncoupled mitochondria in substrate-free medium. At this condition, the mitochondrial NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox couple is highly oxidized (C). Addition of the complex I substrates glutamate plus malate only slightly increases the NAD(P)H level compared with the maximum seen in Fig. 4A. The subsequent addition of phytanic acid further increases the NAD(P)H level, clearly indicating that phytanic acid inhibits the electron flux downstream of the primary NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase. However, this inhibitory activity is much less effective than that of rotenone (D). Phytanic Acid Stimulates Superoxide Generation in Mitochondria—Depending on the activity state of the respiratory chain, phytanic acid either stimulates or inhibits oxygen uptake. This raises the following question: how do these opposite effects of phytanic acid on the rate of the electron flux affect the respiratory chain-dependent superoxide generation by mitochondria? Fig. 5A shows a typical trace, where the fluorescent dye DCF is formed through oxidation of the nonfluorescent DCFH by released H2O2 plus horseradish peroxidase. This experiment clearly reveals that brain mitochondria treated with a concentration of phytanic acid (10 μm; corresponding to 100 nmol/mg of protein), which is sufficient to diminish the electron flux in phosphorylating mitochondria to 50% of maximum (Fig. 1A), strongly enhances the release of H2O2. However, phytanic acid already stimulates the release of H2O2 also at low concentrations (e.g. 1 μm; corresponding to 10 nmol/mg of protein), which are typical of its uncoupling effect (Fig. 5B). For half-maximal stimulation of H2O2 release an EC50 value of 10 μm phytanic acid was determined (data not shown). Stimulation of H2O2 release by phytanic acid was also found with rat heart mitochondria, both in the resting state and state 3 (Fig. 5C). Unbranched, saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic, myristic, and lauric acid do not stimulate H2O2 release in the resting state (Figs. 5C and 6), whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic (C18:2) and arachidonic acid (C20:4) also stimulate the H2O2 release by mitochondria (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Influence of various fatty acids on H2O2 release in resting mitochondria. Brain mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein/ml) were treated, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The final concentration of added fatty acids was 20 μm: phytanic acid (Phyt), lauric acid (Lau), myristic acid (Myr), palmitic acid (Pal), oleic acid (Ole), linoleic acid (Lino), and arachidonic acid (Ara). For control, an aliquot of 20 μl of ethanol (EtOH) was added. Data shown are expressed as percent of H2O2 release from untreated mitochondria respiring pyruvate plus malate obtained from four to six preparations. *, p < 0.05 versus control (pyruvate plus malate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phytanic Acid Exerts a Rotenone-like Effect on Respiratory Chain-dependent Superoxide Generation—Phytanic acid-induced H2O2 release from brain mitochondria was compared with that induced by rotenone. In these experiments the respiratory chain was fed with electrons derived either from oxidation of the complex I substrates glutamate plus malate or from the complex II substrate succinate. Fig. 7 shows that the rate of H2O2 release is similarly high with phytanic acid or with rotenone, when glutamate plus malate are used as substrates. Succinate promotes H2O2 release from mitochondria by feeding the complex I via reversed electron transport from complex II (26Hinkle P.C. Butow R.A. Racker E. Chance B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5169-5173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chance B. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1534-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This H2O2 production is inhibited by phytanic acid or rotenone to a similar extent. When, in the presence of rotenone, the electrons derived from succinate oxidation were conducted exclusively to complex III, a low basal H2O2 production is seen. Under this condition H2O2 generation was stimulated by phytanic acid or the complex III inhibitor antimycin A. On first sight, this finding indicates that an interaction of phytanic acid with components of complex III also stimulates H2O2 release from mitochondria. On the other hand, taking into consideration that complex I contains several quinone binding sites (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), it could be possible that the observed stimulation of ROS generation by phytanic acid is due to simultaneous binding of rotenone and phytanic acid at complex I. Phytanic Acid-induced O2·¯ Generation Inactivates Aconitase and Oxidizes Glutathione—Then we examined the oxidative damage in mitochondria caused by phytanic acid-enhanced O2·¯ generation. The citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase is known to be highly susceptible to oxidative inactivation by O2·¯ (33Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, aconitase activity was measured in mitochondria exposed to phytanic acid and, for comparison, in mitochondria treated with palmitic acid or antimycin A. Typical traces of aconitase-dependent NADPH formation by heart mitochondria monitored after 15 min of preincubation are shown in Fig. 8A. Comparable with the opposite effects of phytanic acid and palmitic acid on the release of H2O2 from mitochondria, phytanic acid strongly inactivates aconitase, whereas palmitic acid has only slightly inactivating effects (Fig. 8B). Mitochondrial NADH donates electrons into the electron transport chain, but it also acts as substrate of the transmembrane potential (Δψ)-dependent transhydrogenation of NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH reduces oxidized glutathione (GSSG) by means of the NADPH-glutathione reductase. Since GSH acts as potent scavenger of H2O2, the glutathione content of phytanic acid-treated mitochondria was examined. Fig. 9 shows that phytanic acid decreased the level of reduced glutathione, whereas palmitic acid was without effect. Here we demonstrate, first, that low concentrations of phytanic acid inhibit the electron transport within the respiratory chain in actively respiring rat brain mitochondria (Figs. 1 and 2). With respect to phytanic acid, the homologue palmitic acid or the esterified phytanic acid exert much less or no inhibition on the electron transport from NADH to molecular oxygen. However, it is important to mention that significant inactivation of complex I activity has been observed (39Loskovich M.V. Grivennikova V.G. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), when inside-out bovine heart submitochondrial particles were treated with concentrations of palmitic acid corresponding to high palmitic acid to protein ratios (≥1000 nmol/mg of protein). The results obtained in our study strongly suggest that phytanic acid interferes mainly with the electron transport in complex I, putatively similar to rotenone. Thus, phytanic acid severely inactivates the enzymatic activity of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Fig. 2), and it diminishes MTT reduction, also quite similar to rotenone (Fig. 3). Inhibition of complex I by phytanic acid supports the reported concept that complex I is a target for the deteriorating effects of free long-chain fatty acids in mitochondria (39Loskovich M.V. Grivennikova V.G. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that fatty acids act at the complex I-ubiquinone junction site by perturbation of the pseudo-reversible active-de-active complex I transition (39Loskovich M.V. Grivennikova V.G. Cecchini G. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Second, we demonstrate that phytanic acid strongly enhances O2·¯ generation with complex I-directed substrates (pyruvate plus malate or glutamate plus malate), but inhibits O2·¯ generation when the FAD-dependent substrate succinate is given as electron source (Figs. 5, 6, 7). The latter suggests that phytanic acid can block the complex I-mediated reverse electron transport from succinate to NAD+. Remarkably, phytanic acid stimulates O2·¯ generation in resting as well as in phosphorylating mitochondria. In contrast, palmitic acid has almost no effect on O2·¯ generation in resting brain and heart mitochondria (Figs. 5C and 6). However, at conditions different from ours, where FCCP-uncoupled heart mitochondria were treated with very high levels of palmitic acid (1000 nmol/mg of protein), a slight stimulation of O2·¯ generation was reported (32Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, also in astrocytes, phytanic acid, but not palmitic acid, enhances O2·¯ generation, as determined previously (8Kahlert S. Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 18: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With mitochondria oxidizing NAD-dependent substrates, O2·¯ generation has been found to be enhanced by (i) treatment of mitochondria with the respiratory chain toxins rotenone or antimycin A (29Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 32Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol.

Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), (ii) depletion of cytochrome c from mitochondria due to disruption of the respiratory chain (40Gyulkhandanyan A.V. Pennefather P.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 42Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and (iii) a switch of the mitochondrial oxygen uptake from phosphorylating to resting (29Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 38Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 43Boveris A.

Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 45Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The consequence of all these manipulations resulted in the reduction of redox centers within complex I, including the sites that leak electrons to molecular oxygen (44Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Moreover, complex I-related O2·¯ generation with NAD-dependent substrates was found to be relatively insensitive to a change in the Δψ at the inner membrane (38Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 44Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, a significant fraction of complex I-related O2·¯ generation occurs even at low Δψ (44Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In contrast, complex I-related O2·¯ due to reverse electron transport of mitochondria oxidizing succinate (in the absence of rotenone) is greatly reduced by depolarization (38Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 46Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 47Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that generation of O2·¯ by complex I during reversed electron transport was at least 3-fold more sensitive to the pH gradient than to Δψ (48Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, phytanic acid is also capable to increase O2·¯ generation in rotenone-inhibited mitochondria (Fig. 7). This stimulation might be explained (i) by preventing the binding of semiubiquinone (UQ·¯) at the Qp-site within complex III as a consequence of the isoprenoic structure of phytanic acid and, in addition, (ii) by interrupting the electron transport due to depletion of cytochrome c from mitochondria (49Reiser G. Schönfeld P. Kahlert S. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, this stimulation of O2·¯ generation by phytanic acid is not expected to play a significant physiological role, since in vivo the electron supply from complex II to complex III at blocked complex I is nonphysiological. The enrichment of phytanic acid, which is lipophilic and bulky, within the lipid core of the inner membrane could alter the arrangement of electron carriers. Thereby the access of molecular oxygen to electron donating redox carriers might be facilitated. An analogous distortion of the arrangement of membrane constituents could contribute to O2·¯ generation stimulated by linoleic and arachidonic acid (Fig. 6). Conformational analysis reveals that both polyunsaturated fatty acids exist in bulky, low energy conformers (50Rich M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For instance, arachidonic acid prefers an angle iron-like structure (when bound to hydrocarbon chains) or a hairpin structure (near to a protein-lipid interface). Importantly, stimulation of O2·¯ generation by phytanic acid inactivates aconitase (Fig. 8). This matrix enzyme is a further measure of O2·¯ generation, since O2·¯ is by far the most reactive and selective physiological oxidant for aconitase (33Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Aconitase catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate, a reaction essential for citric acid cycle activity. Inactivation of aconitase may cause accumulation of NADH and, thereby induce reductive stress. It has been discussed that this is a condition that further increased production of reactive oxygen species through auto-oxidation of NADH (51Yan L.J. Levine R.L. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). An important aspect of our study is the finding that phytanic acid stimulates O2·¯ generation in resting mitochondria (Fig. 5B), a condition where uncoupling is believed to be the main effect of nonesterified long-chain fatty acids on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Uncoupling of resting brain mitochondria by phytanic acid is clearly indicated by (i) oxidation of matrix NAD(P)H (Fig. 4A) and (ii) lowering of Δψ (9Schönfeld P. Kahlert S. Reiser G. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stimulation of O2·¯ generation by phytanic acid is not consistent with the previously derived concept that long-chain fatty acids should generally decrease O2·¯ generation by mild uncoupling and induce a protective mechanism (11Korshunov S.S. Korkina O.V. Ruuge E.K. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Skulachev V.P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 169-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Originally, this concept was based on the observation that lauric acid (C12:0) and the chemical protonophore FCCP decrease O2·¯ generation of glutathione-depleted rat heart mitochondria oxidizing succinate in the resting state (11Korshunov S.S. Korkina O.V. Ruuge E.K. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our study also reveals that phytanic acid added to mitochondria oxidizing succinate strongly decreases O2·¯ generation (Fig. 7). In resting mitochondria oxidizing succinate in the absence of rotenone, O2·¯ generation is linked to the reverse electron transport. The reverse electron transport is a thermodynamically unfavorable process demanding a high Δψ to support the electron transport from FAD-dependent substrates (e.g. succinate) to NAD+ (52Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of succinate-linked O2·¯ generation by fatty acids is most likely due to inhibition of the reverse electron transport from succinate to complex I. Apart from one study (32Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) dealing with the effect of palmitic acid and arachidonic acid on O2·¯ generation by FCCP-treated rat heart mitochondria, the effect of fatty acids on O2·¯ generation by coupled mitochondria oxidizing NAD-dependent substrates has not yet been reported. However, a rotenone-like effect of phytanic acid and its stimulation of O2·¯ generation in resting mitochondria oxidizing NAD-dependent substrates agrees well with the observation that inhibitors of the ubiquinone-binding site at complex I (exemplified by rotenone, piericidin, and myxothiazol) allow rapid O2·¯ generation (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is good reason to propose that phytanic acid increases O2·¯ generation by inhibiting the ubiquinone-binding site of complex I. In conclusion, the data presented here reveal an important mechanism of toxicity in pathological situations with a steady build-up of the branched-chain phytanic acid in the body. Mitochondria are the most important source of O2·¯ generation within the cell, and mitochondria on the other side are quite vulnerable targets of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the stimulation of O2·¯ generation by phytanic acid contributes to the cytotoxicity of phytanic acid in vivo. This is most prominent in those tissues, which mainly depend on mitochondrial energy supply, such as brain and heart. However, the findings and the conclusions presented here seem to have even wider implications. There is good reason to hypothesize that phytanic acid-induced oxidative stress could damage also other tissues. We thank H. Goldammer for skillful technical assistance in performing the experiments."

FAP has been implicated in cancer; however, its specific role remains elusive because inhibitors that distinguish FAP from other prolyl peptidases like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) have not been developed. To identify peptide motifs for FAP-selective inhibitor design, we used P2-Pro1 and acetyl (Ac)-P2-Pro1 dipeptide substrate libraries, where P2 was varied and substrate hydrolysis occurs between Pro1 and a fluorescent leaving group. With the P2-Pro1 library, FAP preferred Ile, Pro, or Arg at the P2 residue; however, DPP-4 showed broad reactivity against this library, precluding selectivity. By contrast, with the Ac-P2-Pro1 library, FAP cleaved only Ac-Gly-Pro, whereas DPP-4 showed little reactivity with all substrates. FAP also cleaved formyl-, benzyloxycarbonyl-, biotinyl-, and peptidyl-Gly-Pro substrates, which DPP-4 cleaved poorly, suggesting an N-acyl-Gly-Pro motif for inhibitor design. Therefore, we synthesized and tested the compound Ac-Gly-prolineboronic acid, which inhibited FAP with a Ki of 23 ± 3 nm.

Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that FAP activity promotes tumor growth and that FAP inhibition may have therapeutic value. FAP belongs to the prolyl peptidase family, which comprises serine proteases that typically cleave peptide substrates after a proline residue. This family has been implicated in several diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and mood disorders (13Polgar L. Cell. Mol.

These proteases differ in structure at the N terminus, but each has a C-terminal αβ-hydrolase domain that contains the catalytic Ser, Asp, and His residues. FAP, like its most closely related family member, DPP-4, is a type II transmembrane protein; both have a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a β-propeller domain containing several sites of N-linked glycosylation (5Scanlan M.J.

DPP-4 cleaves these peptides via a well characterized dipeptidyl peptidase activity that removes P2-Pro1 or P2-Ala1 dipeptides, (P2 represents any amino acid) from the N terminus of the substrate.

In contrast, endogenous peptide substrates of FAP are not known, and the activity of the protease against synthetic substrates remains poorly characterized. FAP also cleaves proteins such as gelatin (8Park J.E. Lenter M.C. Zimmermann R.N. Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. J. Biol.

To overcome this lack of selectivity, we sought here to define the substrate specificity of FAP with the goal of identifying a FAP-selective motif for inhibitor design. We identified N-acyl-Gly-Pro dipeptides as FAP-selective substrate motifs and synthesized a representative boronic acid inhibitor, Ac-Gly-BoroPro. This inhibitor showed ∼9- to ∼5400-fold selectivity for FAP inhibition relative to other prolyl peptidases, suggesting that N-acyl-Gly-Pro-based inhibitors will aid in testing whether FAP is a valid therapeutic target. Materials—Ala-Pro-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC), Phe-Pro-AFC, Gly-Pro-AFC, Ile-Pro-AFC, acetyl (Ac)-Gly-Pro-AFC, and Lys-Ala-AFC were from Enzyme Systems Products. Benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Gly-Pro-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), Gly-Ala-AMC, Ac-Ala-AMC, and amino acid derivatives were from Bachem. An Ac-P2-Pro1-AFC substrate library, where P2 was varied with all amino acids (except Cys and Trp), was custom synthesized by Enzyme Systems Products. N-substituted-Gly-Pro-7-amino-4-methyl-3-carbamoylcoumarin (AMCC) substrates and a P2-Pro1-AMCC substrate library were prepared essentially as described by Maly et al. (33Maly D. Leonetti F. Backes B. Dauber D. Harris J. Craik C. Ellman J. J. Org. Chem. 2020; 67: 910-915Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with the exception that 7-amino-4-methyl-3-coumarinylacetic acid was used as the fluorophore. Acetylated substrates were prepared by treating peptides on resin with acetic anhydride in 10% triethylamine/dichloromethane until the resin was negative to the Kaiser ninhydrin test (34Sarin V. Kent S. Tam J. Merrifield R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Formylated substrates were prepared as described (35Fields G. Fields C. Petefish J. Van Wart H. Cross T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1384-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ac-Gly-Proline boronic acid (BoroPro) was synthesized as described by Gibson et al. (36Gibson F. Singh A. Soumeillant M. Manchand P. Humora M. Kronenthal D. Org. Proc. Res. Dev. 2002; 6: 814-816Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except that Ac-Gly was substituted for Val, making deprotection unnecessary. Substrates and inhibitors were purified by reverse phase chromatography and verified by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry. N-glycanase was from Sigma. Protease Cloning and Expression—cDNAs encoding the extracellular domains of FAP (amino acids 38–760) and DPP-4 (amino acids 39–766) were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Quick Clone cDNA library (Stratagene) as a template. PCR products were TA-cloned into pGemT (Promega) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confirmed cDNAs were then subcloned into pFLAG-CMV1 (Sigma) for expression as N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins. Plasmids containing full-length DPP-7, DPP-8, DPP-9, prolyl oligopeptidase, and acylpeptide hydrolase were obtained from Origene and used as templates to generate pFLAG-CMV1 expression constructs encoding each protease as above. These constructs encoded amino acids 26–492 of DPP-7, 2–883 of DPP-8, 2–864 of DPP-9, 2–710 of prolyl oligopeptidase, and 2–732 of acylpeptide hydrolase. For protein production, we transfected 293 cells with plasmids encoding proteases using calcium phosphate and purified proteins from serum-free conditioned medium by affinity chromatography with M2-anti-FLAG resin (Sigma). Proteins were >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, with the exception of DPP8, which had a purity of ∼70%. Protein concentrations were determined by the bichinconic acid method (Bio-Rad). Gel Filtration Chromatography and Light Scattering Analysis—To calculate the stoichiometry of purified FAP and DPP-4, we measured the molecular mass of each protease in solution using multiangle light scattering in combination with gel filtration chromatography and interferometric refractometry. This method allows accurate determination of the molecular mass of a protein based on protein concentration, refractive index, and the degree of light scattering (37Mogridge J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases (50 μg) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 100 mm NaCl were loaded onto a Shodex KW-803 gel filtration column (flow rate 0.5 ml/min). The column was developed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a MiniDawn 3-angle light scattering detector (Wyatt Technology) and an OPTILAB DSP interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technology) in line. ASTRA software was used for molecular mass calculations. Protease Assays—Protease activity was monitored continuously using a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) in the kinetic mode. Assays were conducted at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The excitation/emission wavelengths were 360/460 nm for AMC/AMCC substrates and 400/505 nm for AFC substrates. Standard curves of the appropriate fluorescent product versus concentration were used to convert relative fluorescence units to moles of product produced. Generally, kinetic constants (kcat, Km) were determined with initial rate (v0) measurements, using substrate concentrations in the range of 0.1–5 Km and protease concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Kinetic parameters were calculated from Michaelis-Menten plots (v0 versus [S]) with nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad software. kcat values were calculated assuming that each protease was 100% active. When saturating amounts of substrate could not be achieved, catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were determined under pseudo-first order conditions ([S] <<the estimated Km) and fit to the following equation: Ln[St/S0] =-kobst, where St is the concentration of substrate remaining at time t, S0 is the initial substrate concentration, and kobs is the apparent first order substrate cleavage constant equal to (kcat/Km) × ET, the total enzyme concentration (38Copeland R. Enzymes, A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 136Google Scholar). The linear relationship of Ln[St/S0] versus time allows calculation of kcat/Km by dividing the slope of the plot by ET. Inhibition Kinetics—Ki values for inhibition of proteases by Ac-Gly-BoroPro were determined using the method of progress curves for analysis of tight binding competitive inhibitors (39Henderson P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 40Nicklin M. Barrett A. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteases were added to a reaction mixture containing inhibitor and substrate (Ac-Ala-AMC for acylpeptide hydrolase, Z-Gly-Pro-AMC for prolyl oligopeptidase, and Ala-Pro-AFC for all others) in assay buffer at 23 °C. Protease activity was followed continuously as described above to monitor time-dependent inhibition. Reactions contained inhibitor concentrations at least 20-fold greater than protease concentrations, such that the protease-inhibitor complex does not significantly deplete the free inhibitor. Data were plotted as v0/vi - 1 versus [I], where v0 is the rate of substrate hydrolysis in the absence of inhibitor, vi is the steady state rate of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of inhibitor, and [I] is the concentration of Ac-Gly-BoroPro. Plots of v0/vi - 1 versus [I] were linear, and the apparent inhibition constant, Kapp, was determined from the reciprocal of the slope. Ki, the true equilibrium inhibition constant, was determined according to the following relationship: Ki = Kapp/(1+ [S]/Km), where [S] is the concentration of substrate used in the assay and Km is the Michaelis constant for substrate cleavage. Protease Expression and Characterization—DPP-4 exists in serum as a soluble glycoprotein beginning at residue 39 (41Durinx C. Lambeir A.-M. Bosmans E. Falmagne J.-B. Berghmans R. Haemers A. Scharpe S. De Meester I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5608-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed and purified recombinant Ser-39-DPP-4 and an analogous soluble FAP molecule beginning at amino acid Thr-38. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, FAP migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa (Fig. 1A), whereas DPP-4 migrated with a molecular mass of 105–115 kDa (Fig. 1B). These molecular masses are 15–20 kDa greater than expected based on primary amino acid sequence and decreased upon treatment with N-glycanase (not shown), indicating that each protease is N-glycosylated. To further characterize each protease, we determined molecular mass in solution using multiangle light scattering in combination with gel filtration chromatography and interferometric refractometry. This analysis showed that FAP exists predominantly as a dimer with a molecular mass of 200 ± 15 kDa (Fig. 1A). Small amounts of monomeric (elution volume 9.0 ml) and multimeric (elution volume <8.0 ml) FAP were also observed. The predominant elution peak of DPP-4 had a molecular mass of 220 ± 15 kDa (Fig. 1B), indicating a dimeric composition. The dimeric nature of our soluble protease preparations is consistent with the dimeric composition of FAP and DPP-4 crystal structures (15Aertgeerts K. Levin I. Shi L. Snell G.P. Jennings A.

Dipeptide Substrate Specificity—Although FAP cleaves certain proline-containing DPP-4 substrates (8Park J.E. Lenter M.C. Zimmermann R.N. Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36505-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 15Aertgeerts K. Levin I. Shi L. Snell G.P. Jennings A. Prasad G.S. Zhang Y. Kraus M.L. Salakian S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19441-19444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the full spectrum of dipeptidase specificity of FAP remains undefined. Therefore, to better understand the specificity of FAP, we examined the activity of the protease against a P2-Pro1-AMCC dipeptide substrate library (Fig. 2), where P2 was varied with all amino acids (except Cys and Trp) and amide bond hydrolysis occurs between the P1 Pro and the fluorogenic leaving group, AMCC. Even though DPP-4 can cleave dipeptides with a P1 Ala residue, we limited the P1 position of our library to Pro because FAP showed little activity against P2-Ala dipeptide substrates in preliminary studies. The dipeptide cleavage profile of the library provides information regarding protease S2 subsite specificity. As shown in Fig. 2A, FAP preferred Ile, Pro, and Arg in the P2 position and showed little activity against dipeptides with Asp, His, or Asn in the P2 position. DPP-4 readily cleaved all substrates in the library, indicating broad specificity at the S2 subsite (Fig. 2B). Kinetic Constants for Cleavage of Dipeptide Substrates—To extend the results obtained with the dipeptide substrate library, we determined kinetic parameters for cleavage of commercially available dipeptide substrates by FAP (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for substrate cleavage was greatest with Ile-Pro-AFC, followed by Ala-Pro-, Gly-Pro-, and Phe-Pro-AFC, consistent with the dipeptide substrate library results (Fig. 2). With the exception of Ile-Pro-AFC, these differences reflect differences in kcat values, as the Km for each substrate was ∼250 μm. The greater catalytic efficiency observed for Ile-Pro-AFC hydrolysis was due to both kcat and Km effects as the observed Km was ∼2.5-fold lower than the other P2-Pro1-AFC substrates. FAP showed markedly less activity against P2-Ala1-based substrates. GA-AMC was not cleaved, and the catalytic efficiency for Lys-Ala-AFC cleavage was 400–1000-fold less than the catalytic efficiency for cleavage of P2-Pro1-based peptides (Table 1), indicating that FAP prefers Pro in the P1 position.TABLE 1Kinetic constants (average ± S.E., n =3) for hydrolysis of dipeptide substrates by FAP and DPP-4 Substrate cleavage was at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4.ProteaseSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1FAPAP-AFCaAmino acids are listed in single-letter code244 ± 2814.2 ± 0.95.8 × 104FP-AFC245 ± 221.1 ± 0.14.5 × 103GP-AFC248 ± 125.6 ± 0.22.3 × 104IP-AFC106 ± 66.9 ± 0.36.5 × 104GA-AMCNCbNC, no cleavage up to 1 mm substrateNCbNC, no cleavage up to 1 mm substrateNCbNC, no cleavage up to 1 mm substrateKA-AFC189 ± 200.01 ± 0.00153DPP-4AP-AFC16 ± 345.6 ± 1.72.9 × 106GP-AFC76 ± 10121 ± 51.6 × 106a Amino acids are listed in single-letter codeb NC, no cleavage up to 1 mm substrate Open table in a new tab For comparison, we determined kinetic constants for cleavage of Ala-Pro-AFC and Gly-Pro-AFC by DPP-4 (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency for Ala-Pro-AFC hydrolysis was greater than that for Gly-Pro-AFC, consistent with the dipeptide library. Strikingly, the catalytic efficiencies for dipeptide hydrolysis by DPP-4 were consistently ∼100-fold greater than observed with FAP, reflecting both an increase in kcat and decrease in Km. N-acetyl-dipeptide Substrate Specificity—Given reports suggesting that FAP has endopeptidase activity (8Park J.E. Lenter M.C. Zimmermann R.N. Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36505-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 28Lee K. Jackson K. Christiansen V. Chung K. McKee P. Blood. 2004; 103: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we next examined the endopeptidase specificity of the protease. For this, we assayed FAP against an Ac-P2-Pro1-AFC substrate library in which the acetyl group forms an amide bond with the P2 amino acid, thereby mimicking an endopeptidase substrate. Thus, in contrast with the P2-Pro1 library, which contains a free N terminus, the acetylated library is N-terminal blocked. FAP showed a marked preference for a P2 Gly residue in the acetylated library, having little activity against all other substrates in the library (Fig. 2C). Strikingly, DPP-4 had little activity against Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC and all other substrates in the acetylated library (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that DPP-4 has limited endopeptidase activity and that FAP endopeptidase activity is restricted to Gly-Pro-containing substrates. Kinetic Analysis of Gly-Pro- and Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC Hydrolysis—In light of the Ac-P2-Pro1-AFC library results, we performed kinetic analyses with Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC and Gly-Pro-AFC substrates as their hydrolysis rates may be directly compared. FAP cleaved each substrate with similar efficiency as shown in Fig. 3A. FAP showed a moderate increase in Km (330 ± 30 μm) for Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC relative to Gly-Pro-AFC (Table 1); however, a concomitant increase in kcat (7.7 ± 0.2 s-1) for the acetylated substrate resulted in an equivalent catalytic efficiency for both substrates. By contrast, DPP-4 only showed significant activity against Gly-Pro-AFC (Fig. 3B). The catalytic efficiency for cleavage of Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC by DPP-4 was equivalent to 36 ± 3 m-1 s-1 when determined under pseudo-first order conditions. This value is over four orders of magnitude lower than that for cleavage of Gly-Pro-AFC (Table 1), indicating a marked preference for the substrate with a free N terminus. Cleavage of N-substituted-Gly-Pro-AMCC Substrates—To test whether FAP could cleave other N-substituted-Gly-Pro-based substrates, we synthesized N-blocked dipeptide substrates (N-methyl-, formyl-, succinyl-, benzyloxycarbonyl- (Z-), biotinyl-Gly-Pro-AMCC) and a peptide modeled after the FAP cleavage site in α2-antiplasmin (Ac-Thr-Ser-Gly-Pro-AMCC) (28Lee K. Jackson K. Christiansen V. Chung K. McKee P. Blood. 2004; 103: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). With the exception of succinyl-Gly-Pro-AMCC, FAP cleaved all N-substituted-Gly-Pro-AMCC substrates at 35–165% of the rate for Gly-Pro-AMCC hydrolysis (Fig. 4B), indicating that th"

In this study, we showed that c-Abl-PKCδ-Rac1-p38 MAPK signaling is required for the conformational changes of Bak and Bax during ionizing radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Ionizing radiation induced conformational changes and subsequent oligomerizations of Bak and Bax, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Small interference (siRNA) targeting of Bak and Bax effectively protected cells from radiation-induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptotic cell death. p38 MAPK was found to be selectively activated in response to radiation treatment. Inhibition of p38 MAPK completely suppressed radiation-induced Bak and Bax activations, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell death. Moreover, expression of a dominant negative form of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) or siRNA targeting of PKCδ attenuated p38 MAPK activation and conformational changes of Bak and Bax. In addition, ectopic expression of RacN17, a dominant negative form of Rac1, markedly inhibited p38 MAPK activation but did not affect PKCδ activation. Upon stimulation of cells with radiation, PKCδ was phosphorylated dramatically on tyrosine. c-Abl-PKCδ complex formation was also increased in response to radiation. Moreover, siRNA targeting of c-Abl attenuated radiation-induced PKCδ and p38 MAPK activations, and Bak and Bax modulations. These data support a notion that activation of the c-Abl-PKCδ-Rac1-p38 MAPK pathway in response to ionizing radiation signals conformational changes of Bak and Bax, resulting in mitochondrial activation-mediated apoptotic cell death in human non-small cell lung cancer cells."

This study investigated the effects of thapsigargin and a variety of commonly used hydrophobic inhibitors on these SERCA isoforms (i.e. SERCA1b, SERCA2b, and SERCA3a), which were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. In addition, the study assessed whether the introduction of the phenylalanine to valine mutation at position 256 (F256V), known to reduce the potency of thapsigargin inhibition in avian SERCA1, affects the other SERCA isoforms in a similar manner and whether this mutation also affects the inhibition by other inhibitors. This study has shown that the sensitivity to thapsigargin is different for the SERCA isoforms (apparent Ki values being 0.21, 1.3, and 12 nm for SERCA1b, SERCA2b, and SERCA3a, respectively). The reduction in thapsigargin sensitivity caused by the F256V mutation was also different for the three isoforms, with SERCA2b only being modestly affected by this mutation. Although some of the other inhibitors investigated (i.e. cyclopiazonic acid and curcumin) showed some differences in their sensitivity toward the SERCA isoforms, most were little affected by the F256V mutation, indicating that they inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase by binding to sites on SERCA distinct from that of thapsigargin. Three isoforms of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) are known to exist in mammalian cells. This study investigated the effects of thapsigargin and a variety of commonly used hydrophobic inhibitors on these SERCA isoforms (i.e. SERCA1b, SERCA2b, and SERCA3a), which were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

Three isoforms of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) 3The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase; TG, thapsigargin; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; BHQ, 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone; NP, 4-n-nonylphenol; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate; WT, wild type. are known to exist. Each have about a 75% sequence homology between one another and can be expressed in a variety of splice variant forms (1Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their isoform expression profiles are known to differ within different tissues (2Wu K.D Lee W.S. Wey J. Bunard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their levels have also been shown to change during development, injury, and disease (3Magnier C. Papp B. Corvazier E.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As most cell types express more than one SERCA isoform, several studies have proposed that specific SERCA isoforms may be localized to distinct Ca2+ stores within the cell (6Lopez J.J. Camello-Almaraz C. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This proposal was put forward from the findings that some Ca stores responded differently to a variety of SERCA inhibitors, leading to a view that the SERCA isoforms might have distinct pharmacological properties (6Lopez J.J.

The most potent SERCA inhibitor identified to date is the sesquiter-pene lactone thapsigargin (TG), isolated from the Mediterranean plant Thapsia garganica. TG binds SERCA1 with subnanomolar affinity (8Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), favoring the E2 state (9Wictome M. Michelangeli F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TG inhibits all isoforms of SERCA; the Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+ uptake activities of COS-1 cell microsomes overexpressing all SERCA isoforms are totally inhibited by 25 nm TG (11Lytton J.L. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged TG treatment of two different cell lines, the Syrian hamster smooth muscle cell line DDT1-MF2 and the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line DC-3F, led to the development of resistance to TG (12Hussain A.

Mutations were identified in SERCA2 by reverse transcription-PCR of mRNA and were all located at codon 256, a Phe residue; mutation to Leu, Ser, and Val were all observed (13Yu M. Zhang L. Rishi A.K.

Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutations and others were introduced into avian SERCA1, and after overexpression in COS-1 cells, measurements of Ca2+-ATPase activities were undertaken (14Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The study showed that the F256V mutation had the most significant effect, conferring a 40-fold resistance to TG (14Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of Phe-256 for the binding of TG was further confirmed by the resolution of a 3.1 Å structure of SERCA1 in the TG-bound E2-TG state (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). It is as yet undetermined whether this mutation at Phe-256 can also decrease the potency of TG or indeed other hydrophobic inhibitors for the various SERCA isoforms. Like TG, both cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) have been used extensively as pharmacological tools to mobilize Ca2+ within intact cells (16Kass G.E. Duddy S.K. Moore G.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15192-15198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both act by inhibiting SERCA Ca2+ pump activity; CPA was shown to have a Ki of 120 nm for SERCA1 (17Goeger D.E. Riley R.T. Dorner J.W. Cole R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and BHQ was shown to have a Ki of 0.4 μm (9Wictome M. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. East J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 4-n-Nonylphenol (NP), a phenolic endocrine disrupter, inhibits the SERCA1 Ca2+ ATPase with a Ki of 6 μm (18Michelangeli F. Orlowski S. Champeil P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NP has also been shown to inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase activity of rat testicular cells, which express both the SERCA2 and the SERCA3 isoforms, with IC50 values of 0.35 μm (19Hughes P.J. McLellan H. Lowes D.A. Zafar Kahn S. Bilmen J.G. Tovey S.C. Godfrey R.E. Michell R.H. Kirk C.J. Michelangeli F. Biochem. Biophys, Res.

Both have been shown to cause their effects on a variety of Ca2+ channels as well as inhibiting SERCA Ca2+ pumps (20Bilmen J.G. Micheangeli F. Cell.

The aim of the study was to assess whether the hydrophobic inhibitors of SERCA highlighted above inhibit all mammalian isoforms to the same degree and furthermore to determine the effect of the introduction of the F256V mutation to these isoforms with respect to the potency of these inhibitors. Clones—Due to availability, this study used rabbit SERCA1b, human SERCA2b, and human SERCA3a. Human SERCA2b in pcDNA3.1 and human SERCA3a in pMT2 were obtained as a gift from Jonathan Lytton, University of Calgary, Canada. Rabbit SERCA1b in pcDNA1 was obtained as a gift from J. Malcolm East, University of Southampton, UK. Molecular Biology and Mutagenesis—Human SERCA3a was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using the ApaI and AflII restriction sites. Primers were designed such that for each isoform, codon 256 was mutated to GTT, which encodes valine; substitution of phenylalanine to valine at amino acid position 256 was shown to confer the greatest resistance (about 40-fold) to thapsigargin for avian SERCA1 (14Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Overexpression of Wild Type and F256V SERCA cDNA—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2, 95% air. COS-7 cells were cultured in 100-mm diameter Petri dishes to 80% confluence before being transiently transfected with wild type or F256V SERCA cDNA using TransFast (Promega). For each plate of cells, plasmid DNA (10 μg), TransFast (60 μl), and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5 ml) were added to a universal and vortexed for 30 s. The transfection media were left at room temperature for 15 min, after which it was vortexed as before. The media were removed from the COS-7 cells and replaced with the transfection media, and the cells were then cultured in transfection media for 3 h, after which 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prewarmed to 37 °C supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was added to each Petri dish. The following day, the media were aspirated and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were harvested after 48 h after transfection. Preparation of COS-7 Microsomal Membranes—The method used is one modified from that described in Ref. 24Murayama K MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar. For the harvesting of five 10-cm diameter Petri dishes of cells, each 10-cm diameter dish of cells was washed with 5 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) phosphate-buffered saline solution. The cells were scraped in a solution of cold (prechilled on ice) phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA before being transferred to a universal tube on ice. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the resulting pellet was resuspended gently with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline prior to centrifugation, as before. The supernatant was then discarded, and the cells were resuspended gently with 5 ml of prechilled (on ice) hypotonic solution (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2). The resuspended cells were then incubated on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysed cells were homogenized using a Polytron for 10 s and further homogenized with a Potter homogenizer for 30 strokes. The homogenate was then diluted with an equal volume of buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm CaCl2, 300 mm KCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) before being centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and made up to 0.6 m with KCl by the addition of an appropriate volume of a 2.5 m solution, prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain the microsomal membrane fraction. The microsomal pellet was then resuspended in buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.15 m KCl, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The microsomal membranes were rehomogenized by hand using a Potter homogenizer before being aliquoted and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen, prior to storage at –80 °C. Analysis of SERCA Overexpression by Immunoblotting—Microsomal membranes prepared from non-transfected and transiently transfected COS-7 cells were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Resolved protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose for 1 h at 750 mA in transfer buffer (0.1% w/v SDS, 20% v/v methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 190 mm glycine) (26Gershoni J.M. Davis F.E. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Non-transfected and SERCA1b transiently overexpressing COS-7 microsomal membrane proteins were probed with the SERCA1 monoclonal antibody 1/2H7 ascites fluid diluted at a concentration of 1 in 20 for 1.5 h and with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Non-transfected and SERCA2b transiently overexpressing microsomal membrane proteins were probed with SERCA2 N19 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8093) diluted 1 in 100 for 1.5 h and with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Sigma). Non-transfected and SERCA3a transiently overexpressing microsomal membrane proteins were probed with the anti-SERCA3 monoclonal antibody PL/IM430 (Chemicon) diluted to a concentration of 1 μg/ml and with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Following incubation with secondary antibodies, the blots were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) before being used to expose Kodak BioMax MR film, which was developed using an XOgraph. Measurement of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase Activity SERCA- of overexpressing Microsomal Membranes—The Ca2+ -dependent ATPase activity of COS-7 cell microsomal membranes was measured using the phosphate liberation assay, as described by Longland et al. (27Longland C.L. Mezna M. Langel U. Hallbrink U. Soomets M. Wheatley M. Michelangeli F. Howl J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal extracts (typically 5 μg) were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer (45 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaN3, 0.25 mm sucrose), supplemented with 5 μ g/ml A23187 ionophore and EGTA and CaCl2 to give a free [Ca2] of 2 μm, which was determined to be optimal for all isoforms. Assays were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of ATP with a final concentration of 6 mm to initiate activity. The reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, which was shown to be linear, before the addition of 50 μl of 6.5% trichloroacetic acid, and the reactions were then stored on ice for 10 min before centrifugation for 5 min at 20000 × g. Supernatant (100 μl) was added to 150 μl of buffer (11.25% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.25% (w/v) copper sulfate, and 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0). Ammonium molybdate solution (5% w/v, 25 μl) was then added, followed by the addition of 25 μlof ELAN reagent (2% w/v p-methyl-aminophenol sulfate and 5% w/v sodium sulfite). The samples were mixed, and the blue coloration was allowed to develop for 10 min prior to measuring the absorption at 870 nm using a Dynatech Laboratories enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The amount of Pi liberated was determined by comparison with known phosphate standards. The activities were also determined in the absence of the addition of Ca2+ to determine non-Ca2+ dependent ATPase activity. Activities are corrected for the activity of non-transfected COS-7 microsomal membranes. All activities were calculated as pmol/min/mg of microsomal protein. All activities in the presence of inhibitors were then normalized to the activity of the respective membranes in the absence of inhibitor. Stock solutions of thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, 4-n-nonyphenol, BHQ, 2-APB, and curcumin were prepared in Me2SO; when added to the assays, the amount of Me2SO never exceeded 1% v/v, which was shown not to have any effect on the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of the microsomal membranes. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild type and F256V SERCA plasmid DNA, and microsomal membranes were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The overexpression of each isoform of wild type and F256V SERCA was analyzed by immunoblotting with isoform-specific anti-SERCA antibodies. Fig. 1 illustrates typical immunoblots using isoform-specific antibodies to show that the COS-7 cells were successfully transfected SERCA3a to express SERCA1b, SERCA2b, and isoforms of the Ca2+ ATPase. Mutant F256V of all three isoforms were also expressed. Table 1 shows the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity as assessed by the hydrolysis of ATP from membranes extracted from the transfected COS-7 cells. The activities were measured at a free Ca2+ concentration of 2 μm, which we found to be optimal for all isoforms and mutants. During the course of these studies, a number of COS-7 cell membrane preparations were produced for both wild type and F256V mutants of the SERCA isoforms. As can be seen, the activities were variable between preparations even of the same isoform, which we have attributed to variations in transfection efficiency (which was determined to be typically between 30 and 60%) and protein degradation/denaturation during membrane preparation.TABLE 1Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of COS-7 cell membranes overexpressing SERCA WT and mutant (F256V) isoformsPreparationSERCA1b WTSERCA1b F256VSERCA2b WTSERCA2b F256VSERCA3a WTSERCA3a F256Vpmol/min/mg149 ± 3111 ± 292 ± 126 ± 127 ± 228 ± 2228 ± 229 ± 225 ± 237 ± 256 ± 256 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2, A–C, shows the effects of thapsigargin on Ca2+-ATPase activity between the three isoforms and their corresponding F256V mutations. Fig. 2A shows that thapsigargin is an extremely potent inhibitor of SERCA1b having an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.21 ± 0.05 nm, whereas the potency for thapsigargin for the F256V mutant of SERCA1b as expected was much reduced with a Ki of 45 ± 22 nm, indicating a shift in potency of inhibition in the order of about 200-fold. A comparison of the potency of thapsigargin for the wild type isoforms of SERCA2b and SERCA3a (Fig. 2, B and C) showed that there was a difference in their sensitivities (the Ki for wild type SERCA2b and SERCA3a were determined to be 1.3 ± 0.5 and 12 ± 6nm, respectively). This therefore shows that although thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of all SERCA isoforms, there is a measurable difference in the potency between isoforms with SERCA1b being the most sensitive and SERCA3a the least by a factor of almost 60-fold. In addition, these differences were unlikely to be linked to the degree of SERCA expression since there was no correlation in TG potency between high and activity preparations. Comparing the effects of the F256V mutation in SERCA2b and SERCA3a with the corresponding wild type isoforms also showed that this mutation decreased the thapsigargin sensitivity in the other isoforms. For SERCA2b, the Ki shifted from 1.3 ± 0.5 nm for the wild type to 6.3 ± 3.0 nm (indicating a decrease in potency of only about 5-fold). For SERCA3a, the Ki shifted from 12 ± 6 nm for the wild type to 1.3 ± 0.4 μm for F256V, indicating a decrease in potency of more than a 100-fold. Therefore it would appear that for SERCA2b, mutation of Phe-256 to Val has only at best a rather modest effect. A comprehensive study was undertaken to assess the effects of other Ca2+ ATPase inhibitors on the different isoforms of SERCA and the effects of the F256V mutation. Table 2 lists the Ki values for a variety of other commonly used Ca2+ ATPase and well characterized inhibitors on both the wild type and the F256V mutant SERCA isoforms 1b, 2b, and 3a. For SERCA1b, the Ki for CPA is increased from 90 nm for SERCA1b to 2.5 μm and 600 nm for SERCA2b and SERCA3a, respectively. Thus there also appears to be a substantial difference in the sensitivity of CPA between the isoforms, with SERCA2b being especially insensitive to CPA when compared with the other SERCA isoforms. This difference, however, is not so apparent when comparing the Ki values for CPA with the F256V mutants for all three isoforms. When comparing the Ki values between wild type and F256V mutants for CPA, the changes observed are at best only 2–3-fold, which would indicate that this mutation has little effect upon CPA binding. This is in agreement with another study comparing the effects of CPA on the avian SERCA1 and the corresponding F256V mutant (28Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When comparing the Ki values for the three isoforms caused by BHQ inhibition, there appears to be very little difference between them. In addition, there was little substantial difference in inhibition between the wild type isoforms and their corresponding F256V mutants. Thus it must be concluded that BHQ binding is likely to be in a region of great similarity between the three isoforms but distinct from the region around Phe-256 encompassing the thapsigargin binding site, a conclusion drawn by others using inhibitor competition studies (29Logan-Smith M.J.

Open table in a new tab Both the wild type forms of SERCA2b and SERCA3a appear to be more sensitive than SERCA1b for inhibition by NP. However, these differences are modest as the Ki values show relatively small differences. The Ki values for nonylphenol between the three isoforms range from about 3.5 μm for SERCA2b to 23.8 μm for SERCA1b. Therefore unlike thapsigargin and CPA, where SERCA1b is the most sensitive isoform, in the case of NP, it appears that SERCA1b is the least sensitive. Again the Ki values are relatively little affected for the F256V mutation when compared with the corresponding wild type isoforms, except for SERCA3a, where there was a 4-fold shift to lower sensitivity. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the effects of 2-APB on the activity of the three SERCA isoforms (Fig. 3A) and their corresponding F256V mutants (Fig. 3B). The potency of inhibition by this inhibitor is considerably less than for the other inhibitors tested with the Ki values in the mm range; however, previous mutagenesis and modeling studies have suggested that 2-APB binds in a hydrophobic pocket near to or possibly within the site at which thapsigargin binds (21Bilmen J.G. Wootton L.L. Godfrey R. Smart O.S. Michelangeli F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3678-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The effects of 2-APB on the wild type activity of both SERCA1b and SERCA3a were almost identical (Ki values 0.46 ± 0.10 and 0.44 ± 0.06 mm, respectively). The Ki value for SERCA2b was substantially different at 1.5 ± 0.2 mm. For the F256V mutants, the Ki values for SERCA2b and SERCA3a were similar to those for the corresponding wild types (1.9 ± 0.4 and 0.22 ± 0.1 mm for SERCA2b and SERCA3a, respectively). However, there was a modest difference for the F256V mutant SERCA1b when compared with the wild type (i.e. the Ki was 1.4 ± 0.2 mm, which is about 3-fold higher than wild type form). The SERCA inhibition by curcumin (Fig. 4) also showed differences in potency between the isoforms, with SERCA1b and SERCA3a having similar Ki values (5.8 ± 1.6 and 8.6 ± 2.5 μm, respectively). The inhibition of SERCA2b by curcumin was substantially less potent with a Ki of 53 ± 6 μm. Although both of the Ki values for the F256V mutants of SERCA1b and SERCA3a were shifted to lower sensitivity by about 3-fold (Ki values 21 ± 3 and 25 ± 7 μm, respectively), it was, however, SERCA2b that showed the largest difference. The F256V mutant of SERCA2b showed a dramatic stimulation in activity at low concentrations of curcumin (up to 20 μm), where there was up to a 40% increase in activity. At higher concentrations, inhibition was again observed (Ki was 60 μm ± 10). Our experiments clearly demonstrated expression of SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3 in COS-7 cells as assessed by Western blotting using isoform-specific antibodies and that this expression was considerably higher than endogenous SERCA levels in COS-7 cells from activity studies (non-transfected COS-7 cell membranes had a Ca2+-ATPase activity of typically 4 pmol/min/mg when compared with up to more than 100 pmol/min/mg in optimally transfected cells). From Table 1, it can be seen that the degree of activity of the transfected COS-7 cell membranes was variable between preparations even of the same isoform; however, even the lowest value for the transfected cell membranes was about 6-fold higher than endogenous untransfected levels. Therefore even in this preparation, over 80% of the Ca2+-ATPase activity measured would come from the expressed SERCA protein. Although we tried, as far as possible, to transfect the cells using identical procedures, this variability was likely to be due to a number of factors that are difficult to control. These included the condition of cells prior to transfection, the number of passages of the cells prior to transfection, and also variability in membrane extraction (which we have previously shown to be a major factor in the variability of Ca2+-ATPase activity between sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations (30Michelangeli F. Colyer J. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). The results presented in Fig. 2 show that SERCA isoforms vary in their sensitivity to thapsigargin by a factor of about 60-fold when comparing SERCA1b with SERCA3a. However, since the Ki values varied from ∼0.2 nm for SERCA1b to 12 nm for SERCA3a, thapsigargin must still be considered a very potent inhibitor of all SERCA isoforms. The Ki for SERCA1b of 0.2 nm is similar to that found in other studies in which SERCA1 was overexpressed (11Lytton J.L. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition by thapsigargin of SERCA2b was found to have an apparent Ki of ∼1 nm and was completely inhibited by 30 nm thapsigargin, in agreement with the value of 25 nm observed for SERCA2b-expressing COS-1 membranes (11Lytton J.L. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that SERCA3a was found to be the least sensitive to thapsigargin was surprising since thapsigargin has been shown to stabilize the E2 form of the ATPase (9Wictome M. Michelangeli F. Lee A.G. East J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and SERCA3 is also believed to favor the E2 form when compared with SERCA1 and SERCA2 (31Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that SERCA3 has a slightly less than optimal thapsigargin binding domain than SERCA1. As a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of thapsigargin bound to SERCA1 has been solved, the amino acid residues lining the thapsigargin binding domain have been identified (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). From structural analysis and mutagenesis studies, several amino acid residues that are important for thapsigargin binding and inhibition have been identified and include: Phe-256 (on TM3) Ile-765 (on TM5), Ile-828 (TM7), Phe-834 (TM7), and Tyr-837 (TM7). Fig. 5 highlights the position of these amino acids from crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase, which has thapsigargin bound to it. Although the crystal structures for SERCA2 and SERCA3 have not been resolved, they do show a high degree of sequence similarity to SERCA1, and more especially, their sequences are conserved for the amino acids that form part of the thapsigargin binding site. Therefore using the sequence alignments between SERCA1 and SERCA2 and SERCA3 and using SWISS-MODEL (32Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), we have been able to model the structure of SERCA2 and SERCA3 using the SERCA1 structure as a template. Fig. 5 illustrates the arrangement of these conserved amino acids that are predicted to form part of the thapsigargin binding sites of SERCA2 and SERCA3. Although the arrangements of these amino acids within the thapsigargin binding pocket appear similar to those for SERCA1, superimposing the structures shows subtle differences in both distances between some amino acids and orientations and position of the aromatic rings. As these differences are likely to be more exaggerated in the actual proteins, these may well therefore account for the changes in thapsigargin potency between the isoforms. As reported in several studies, the F256V mutation clearly has a significant effect on the sensitivity of SERCA toward thapsigargin (12Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Yu M. Zhang L. Rishi A.K. Khadeer M. Inesi G. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3542-3546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these previous studies, this F256V mutation was introduced into the avian SERCA1 isoform and was shown to induce a 40-fold decrease in its sensitivity to thapsigargin (i.e. the IC50 for wild type avian SERCA1 was 0.3 nm, and for F256V mutant, SERCA1 it was 12 nm). In our study, we undertook to investigate whether this F256V mutation could also affect the sensitivity to thapsigargin for the fetal rabbit form of SERCA1 as well as the human forms of the other SERCA isoforms. Our data clearly showed that the introduction of the F256V mutation in all three mammalian isoforms causes a decrease in sensitivity to thapsigargin, although there does appear to be a significant difference in the degree of this shift between the isoforms. The first major observation to note is that the mutation of F256V in rabbit SERCA1b (fetal splice variant) causes a much larger shift in sensitivity to thapsigargin when compared with SERCA1a (Ki value for wild type SERCA1 was 0.21 nm, and for F256V mutant, it was about 45 nm), highlighting that this splice variant form of the Ca2+-ATPase is even more sensitive to modifications within the thapsigargin binding pocket. Secondly, the thapsigargin sensitivity decrease by the F256V mutation was again very substantial for human SERCA3a (showing a shift in sensitivity of about 100-fold), in comparison with a rather modest change for the human SERCA2b isoform of only about 5-fold. In models of the thapsigargin binding site of SERCA, in which phenylalanine 256 is replaced by valine, the decrease in potency could well be explained by the hindrance of the butanoyl chain at C-8 on thapsigargin, which normally binds in a cleft formed by Phe-256, Ile-765, and Ile-829 (Fig. 5) (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 33Xu C. Ma H. Inesi G. Al-Shawi M.K. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17973-17979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This hindrance, however, would also be seen in the models for F256V mutants of SERCA2 and therefore cannot account for the small effect that this mutation has on TG inhibition in SERCA2. However, it cannot be excluded that there are different conformations of the amino acids within the thapsigargin binding site that are not predicted from these models. When compared with the effects of thapsigargin, both on the different SERCA isoforms and on the F256V SERCA mutants, the other inhibitors investigated in this study generally showed rather modest differences. When assessing the effects of these inhibitors on the different SERCA isoforms, only CPA showed a considerable difference in its potency between the three isoforms (i.e. ∼30-fold between wild type SERCA1 and SERCA2 and 4-fold between SERCA2 and SERCA3). However, when comparing the effects of CPA between the wild type and F256V mutants of the isoforms, only at best a 2–3-fold change was observed. The other commonly employed inhibitor, BHQ, showed little difference between the isoforms and little difference in potency for all three F256V mutants. This latter finding is in agreement with that of Ref. 29Logan-Smith M.J. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2869-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, and therefore, one must conclude that both CPA and BHQ bind to different sites to thapsigargin. For nonylphenol, both SERCA2b and SERCA3a showed a significant increase in sensitivity when compared with SERCA1b. The corresponding F256V mutants of all the isoforms were, however, little different from their corresponding wild types. SERCA2b showed a much reduced effect from curcumin than the other isoforms, and all showed a modest but significant reduction in potency upon introduction of the F256V mutation, which would argue that curcumin is likely to be binding in the near vicinity of the thapsigargin binding site. In a previous study of 2-APB on the Ca2+ ATPase (21Bilmen J.G. Wootton L.L. Godfrey R. Smart O.S. Michelangeli F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3678-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), from mutational and modeling studies, we indicated that 2-APB could bind at one of two sites: one being close to the L6–7 loop and the other being within the thapsigargin site. Since the F256V mutation had no effect on the potency of SERCA2b and SERCA3a and only a modest effect for SERCA1b, this would indicate that 2-APB is more likely to bind at a site close to the L6–7 loop. From the data presented here, it is unlikely that many of the commonly used inhibitors are likely to bind within the known thapsigargin binding site. In addition, several of the inhibitors caused their effects by stabilizing the ATPase in an E2 form like thapsigargin (i.e. BHQ and NP). Therefore these inhibitors must be binding to other hydrophobic binding sites on SERCA that cause a similar or “global”-induced conformational change to inhibit the ATPase by similar mechanisms (29Logan-Smith M.J. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2869-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In summary, this study has demonstrated that the sensitivity to thapsigargin is different for the SERCA isoforms and that the reduction in thapsigargin sensitivity caused by the F256V mutation is also different for the three isoforms, with SERCA2b only being modestly affected by this mutation. In addition, although some of the other inhibitors investigated do show some differences in their sensitivity toward the different SERCA isoforms, most are little affected by the F256V mutation, indicating that they inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase by binding to hydrophobic sites distinct to that where thapsigargin binds.

Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimer that consists of α-, β-, and γ-subunits, all of which are required for its activity. The catalytic α-subunit contains a conventional serine/threonine protein kinase domain, and phosphorylation of Thr-172 residue within the activation loop of the α-subunit by upstream kinases is essential for the activity of the heterotrimer (3Hawley S.A.

Once phosphorylated at Thr-172, AMPK can be further activated by allosteric binding of AMP to the evolutionary conserved cystathionine β-synthase domains in the regulatory γ-subunit (7Scott J.W.

The AMPK β-subunit acts as a scaffold for binding of the α- and γ-subunits (8Woods A. Cheung P.C. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The β-subunit also contains a glycogen-binding domain, and recent findings provide evidence that this motif is involved in targeting the AMPK complex to cellular glycogen stores (9Hudson E.R.

Thus, there are 12 possible combinations of heterotrimeric AMPK, and the physiological function of the AMPK holoenzyme depends on the particular isoforms present in the complex.We have provided evidence that AMPK γ3 is the predominant γ-isoform expressed in glycolytic (white, fast-twitch type II) skeletal muscle (11Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjalm G. Barnes B.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is expressed at low levels in oxidative (red, slow-twitch type I) skeletal muscle and is undetectable in brain, liver, heart, or white adipose tissue (11Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjalm G. Barnes B.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the AMPK γ3-subunit is the only isoform exhibiting tissue-specific expression. Furthermore, the AMPK γ3-subunit primarily forms heterotrimers with the α2- and β2-isoforms in glycolytic skeletal muscle (11Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjalm G. Barnes B.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The functional significance of the AMPK γ3-subunit has been demonstrated by phenotypic analysis of animal models carrying a mutated form of the gene. The dominant Rendement Napole (RN) phenotype identified in Hampshire pigs is caused by a single missense mutation (R225Q) in the AMPK γ3-subunit (12Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Robic A. Thelander M. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundstrom K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Roy P.L. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). RN pigs have a 70% increase in glycogen content in skeletal muscle, whereas liver and heart glycogen content remains unchanged (13Estrade M. Vignon X. Rock E. Monin G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1993; 104: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RN carriers are also characterized by a higher oxidative capacity in white skeletal muscle fibers (14Estrade M. Ayoub S. Talmant A. Monin G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 108: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Lebret B. Le Roy P. Monin G. Lefaucheur L. Caritez J.C. Talmant A. Elsen J.M. Sellier P. J. Anim. Sci. 1999; 77: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Conversely, a second mutation (V224I) identified in pigs at the neighboring amino acid residue of the γ3-protein is associated with an opposite phenotype compared with the RN allele, resulting in reduced skeletal muscle glycogen content (16Ciobanu D. Bastiaansen J. Malek M. Helm J. Woollard J. Plastow G. Rothschild M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of transgenic mice with skeletal muscle-specific expression of the mutant (R225Q) form of the mouse AMPK γ3-subunit, as well as AMPK γ3-subunit knock-out mice, provided further evidence that the γ3-subunit plays a key role in skeletal muscle carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Glycogen resynthesis after exercise was impaired in AMPK γ3 knock-out mice but was markedly enhanced in transgenic mutant mice. An AMPK-activator failed to increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake in knock-out mice, whereas insulin-mediated glucose uptake was unaltered. When fed with a high fat diet, γ3 R225Q transgenic mice were protected against excessive triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, presumably due to an increase in fat oxidation (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Additionally, skeletal muscle from γ3 R225Q mutant mice is characterized by enhanced work performance, whereas knock-out mice are fatigue-prone (18Barnes B.R. Glund S. Long Y.C. Hjalm G. Andersson L. Zierath J.R. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).To further characterize the role of AMPK γ3 in skeletal muscle and to uncover molecular mechanisms explaining phenotypic consequences of the mutations in this isoform, we have studied AMPK γ3-dependent gene transcription by a systematic approach, using global analysis of the mRNA expression pattern in the skeletal muscle of γ3 R225Q mutant and γ3 knock-out mice. Here we describe distinct biomarker patterns, comprising AMPK γ3-dependent transcriptional changes of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle ergogenics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAMPK Knock-out (Prkag3-/-) and R225Q Transgenic (TgPrkag3225Q) Mice—The Prkag3-/- and TgPrkag3225Q mice used in this study have been previously described (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Prkag3-/- mice were created by conventional gene targeting techniques. TgPrkag3225Q mice express the mutant γ3 R225Q subunit under the control of mouse myosin-light chain promoter and enhancer elements. Mice used in the study were bred into the C57BL/6 genetic background. Mice were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle and were cared for in accordance with regulations for the protection of laboratory animals. The study was performed after prior approval from the local ethical committee. Gene expression profiles were characterized in male mice fasted overnight (food was removed 16 h prior to study). The white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle was dissected from anesthetized mice, cleaned of fat and blood, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen as described (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).Preparation of Total RNA—Total RNA was isolated from the white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle using the RNeasy Fibrous Mini Kit (Qiagen) applying Mixer Mill MM 301 (Retsch) followed by a DNase digestion step using RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA yield was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis and the RNA purity was determined based on the A260/A280 ratio. The quality of the RNA was confirmed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Technologies) using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit (Agilent Technologies).Preparation of cRNA, Gene Chip Hybridization—10 μg of total RNA spiked with poly-A controls (pGIBS-TRP, -THR, and -LYS, American Type Culture Collection) was converted to cDNA utilizing a T7 promoter-polyT primer (Affymetrix) and the reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen), followed by a second strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was in vitro transcribed to biotinylated cRNA (Enzo) and then fragmented (Invitrogen). The fragmented cRNA was mixed with control oligonucleotide B2 (Affymetrix) and a hybridization control cRNA mixture (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre, Affymetrix). Aliquots of each sample were hybridized (16 h at 45 °C) to GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430A arrays (Affymetrix). The arrays were subsequently washed, stained, and scanned according the manufacturer's instructions (GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual, Affymetrix).Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using GeneTraffic UNO 3.2-11 (Iobion Informatics) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.1 (Spotfire Inc.). The TgPrkag3225Q dataset was analyzed separately from the Prkag3-/- dataset. For further details see the supplemental information.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantification of mRNA levels for selected genes was performed by qRT-PCR as described (19Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2 ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK1997Google Scholar) using acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (Arbp) as endogenous control (see supplemental Table SI for primer information). qRT-PCR was performed on extended set of samples including 7 Prkag3-/- mice with 8 wild-type littermates and 13 TgPrkag3225Q mice with 10 wild-type littermates, while RNA from 6 animals in each group was used in gene array analysis.Histochemistry—Enzyme activity staining for succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase was done on serial cross-sections (10-μm thickness) of frozen gastrocnemius muscle as described previously (20Blanco C.E. Sieck G.C. Edgerton V.R. Histochem. J. 1988; 20: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Seligman A.M. Karnovsky M.J. Wasserkrug H.L. Hanker J.S. J. Cell. Biol. 1968; 38: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). For succinate dehydrogenase activity staining, sections were incubated for 4 min in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm EDTA, 45 mm disodium succinate, 1.2 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 1 mm potassium cyanide, and 1 mm phenazine methosulfate. Cytochrome c oxidase activity staining was performed by incubating sections for 1 h in a 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.22 m sucrose, 2.3 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 1 mm cytochrome c, and 1300 units of catalase.RESULTSMicroarray Analysis of the mRNA Expression in the Skeletal Muscle of AMPK γ3 Knock-out (Prkag3-/-) and R225Q Transgenic (TgPrkag3225Q) Mice—To determine the role of γ3-containing AMPK complexes in regulation of gene expression in the skeletal muscle, we utilized mouse models that either lack the AMPK γ3-protein (Prkag3-/-) or express a R225Q mutant form of this protein in skeletal muscle (TgPrkag3225Q) (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In Prkag3-/- mice, AMPK γ3-protein expression is completely ablated, and importantly, no compensatory increase in γ1- or γ2-isoform is detected (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Equally important, AMPK expression in TgPrkag3225Q mice resembles the expression pattern in wild-type mice, both with regard to tissue distribution and protein expression, with the mutant (R225Q) form replacing the endogenous AMPK γ3-protein (17Barnes B.R. Marklund S. Steiler T.L. Walter M. Hjalm G. Amarger V. Mahlapuu M. Leng Y. Johansson C. Galuska D. Lindgren K. Abrink M. Stapleton D. Zierath J.R. Andersson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38441-38447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Global gene expression profiles in the white portion of gastrocnemius muscle of Prkag3-/- and TgPrkag3225Q mice were compared with the corresponding wild-type littermates using oligonucleotide microarrays. The expression of 167 genes was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) changed by a factor of 20% or more, in TgPrkag3225Q and/or Prkag3-/- mice, relative to the wild-type controls (Table 1). Applying the same filtering criteria on randomly created groups within the Prkag3-/- dataset and TgPrkag3225Q dataset resulted in six genes determined as differentially expressed. This indicates that the rate of false positives is low. Consequently, the vast majority of the genes appearing differently expressed in Prkag3-/- and/or TgPrkag3225Q mice can be considered as truly regulated.TABLE 1Differentially expressed genes in TgPrkag3225Q and/or Prkag3-/- mice compared with wild-type littermates Global mRNA expression pattern was characterized in the white portion of the gastrocnemius skeletal muscle in male mice of C57BL/6 genetic background. The filtering criteria were set to a mean absolute -fold change >1.2 and a p value ≤0.05. In addition the mean intensity in the group showing highest expression should be >75.Public IDGene symbolGene titleTgPrkag3225Q versus wild-type littermatesPrkag3-/- versus wild-type littermates-Fold

https://openalex.org/W1982002674,"In the nervous system, homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecules participate in the induction and differentiation of presynaptic transmitter release sites. We focus on the heterophilic interaction between postsynaptic neuroligin-1 (Nlg) and presynaptic beta-neurexin (Nrx). Nlg has previously been shown to trigger presynaptic differentiation in a Nrx-expressing axon even when presented on a non-neuronal cell or on beads coated with lipid bilayers. We have now developed a new method to measure single molecule and ensemble distribution of Nrx and Nlg at the contact site between a non-neuronal Nrx-expressing cell and a flat supported glycosylphosphoinositol-neuroligin-1 (GPI-Nlg) lipid bilayer and relate them to adhesion as measured by cell migration and gravity dissociation. We find that within minutes after cell-bilayer contact, Nrx accumulates at the contact site and the contact area is expanded. The strength of cell-bilayer adhesion depends on the morphology of Nrx accumulation, with the focal concentration strengthening adhesion. The results suggest that Nlg-Nrx interaction rapidly establishes a weak, but specific, adhesion between dynamic pre- and postsynaptic processes, which may ultimately require additional molecules for synapse stabilization."

However, the signaling events that mediate healing responses are only partially understood. To identify ITF signaling pathways, proteins that were Ser/Thr phosphorylated in response to ITF stimulation were immunoprecipitated from human colon carcinoma cell lines and identified by mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that Van Gogh-like protein 1 (also designated Vang-like 1 or Vangl1), a protein with four transmembrane domains, was Ser/Thr phosphorylated in response to ITF stimulation. Vangl1 was present in normal human colon and all intestinal epithelial cell lines (IEC) tested. In transfected IEC, FLAG-Vangl1 was mostly present in the Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction as detected by Western blotting, corresponding to the localization of endogenous protein in cytoplasmic vesicular structures by confocal microscopy with rabbit polyclonal anti-human Vangl1 antibody (α-Vangl1). Vangl1 cell membrane association increased with differentiation, as demonstrated by co-localization with E-cadherin in differentiated IEC. Increased Vangl1 phosphorylation after stimulation with ITF corresponded to decreased cell membrane association with E-cadherin.

TFFs share a trefoil domain, a conserved distinct cysteine-rich domain of ∼45 amino acid residues linked by three disulfide bonds (10Thim L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although the actions of trefoil factors are not fully understood, damage to intestinal mucosa results in coordinated up-regulation of trefoil gene expression and protein production (11Babyatsky M.W. deBeaumont M.

ITF does not seem to have intrinsic activity in regulating cell proliferation but promotes epithelial migration in vitro and in crypt to villus migration in vivo (4Mashimo H. Wu D.C. Podolsky D.K. Fishman M.C. Science. 1996; 274: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Studies showed that bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells migrate more rapidly from the crypts to the villus tips in wild-type animals when compared with ITF-null mice (4Mashimo H. Wu D.C. Podolsky D.K. Fishman M.C. Science. 1996; 274: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that ITF increases the resistance of colonic epithelium to apoptosis induced by serum starvation, ceramide, or p53-dependent cell death induced by etoposide (14Taupin D.R.

The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/Gp130/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway has been recently linked to ITF-induced intestinal restitution (2Tebbutt N.C. Giraud A.S. Inglese M.

To gain insight into the mechanism of function of ITF, we used antiserum directed against phospho-serine and phospho-threonine motifs to identify proteins that were phosphorylated in response to ITF stimulation. In combination with immunoprecipitation, we used mass spectrometry and found that Vangl1 is phosphorylated in response to ITF stimulation and appears to be necessary for the effects of ITF. Functionally, Vangl1 enhanced wound closure of intestinal epithelial cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Phospho-Ser/Thr antibodies were as follows: anti-phospho-Ser/Thr (Phe) rabbit polyclonal antibody (α-Ser/Thr, clone number 9631, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) detects phospho-serine/threonine in the context of tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine at the -1 position or phenylalanine at the +1 position. Phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody (clone number 9611, Cell signaling), phospho-threonine polyclonal (clone number 9381, Cell Signaling), and phospho-serine Q5 (Qiagen) were also used. Other antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (α-FLAG, Sigma), E-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories), and EEA1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against N-terminal-41-ELYYEEAEHERRVKK-56... .peptide sequence of the human Vangl1 (α-Vangl1) and affinity-purified (Affinity Bioreagents, Deerfield, IL). Specificity of antibody was tested using blocking of antibody binding with immunizing peptide (Affinity Bioreagents). Cell Culture and Transfection—SW480, HT29, Caco-2, T84, Colo205, HCT116, and HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Norcross, GA). Cells were transfected with a cationic lipid (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For immunostaining experiments, cells were transfected using the TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Construction of Expression Plasmids—FLAG-tagged Vangl1 mammalian expression vector pCMV-TAG-Vangl1 (FLAG-Vangl1) was generated by PCR amplification of Vangl1 cDNA obtained from (clone ID number 6165098, Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), inserting the product into TOPO vector (Invitrogen), digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and then inserted into the multiple cloning site of pCMV-TAG vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences) was used as a control for transfection. The siRNA specific for the human Vangl1 cDNA (siRNA, 1′-CCCAAACCUCCUAACAGCCUCCAAA′; 2′-GGACUCAAGCCACAACAGUUGUAU′, 3′-GCUUACAGUCUGAGACAUCCGUUUA) and control siRNA (catalog number 12935-100) were purchased from Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The depletion of endogenous Vangl1 expression by siRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown on 6-well, 10- or 15-cm plates. Before harvest, cells were starved 24 h in serum-free medium and then stimulated with bovine serum albumin or ITF at 25 μg/ml for 1, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease-inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). Supernatants of cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) incubated with primary antibody, washed, incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of protein in cell lysates from transfected cells (HCT116 after starvation and stimulation) were incubated overnight with 2 μg of either α-FLAG M2 or α-Ser/Thr antibodies together with 30 μl of Hitrap protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h of rocking at 4 °C. A/G beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads by incubation in 2× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) at 70 °C for 10 min and separated on 4-12 or 4-20% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected with α-Ser/Thr or α-FLAG antibodies. Results were quantitated using Scion Image Beta 4.02 software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and expressed as a mean ± S.D. Mass Spectrometry—After immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis, proteins were detected by staining the gel with GelCode Blue (Pierce). Selected bands were excised and digested in-gel with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School). 32P Phosphorylation Assay—Biosynthetic labeling with H332P-O4 was performed as described (18Sefton B. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 18.0.1-18.0.2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997Google Scholar) with modifications. HCT116 cells were cultured on 6-well plates and transfected with plasmids containing FLAG-Vangl1 or GFP control. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and incubated for 10 min, 1, or 6 h with 37 °C warmed phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.15 mCi/ml 32Pi (H332P-O4, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were then stimulated with ITF (25 μg/ml), harvested, and processed for immunoprecipitation with α-FLAG antibody as described above. Labeling was detected by autoradiography and quantitated by STORM 860 (Amersham Biosciences). Values were normalized versus Western blotted total FLAG signal. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA from cell lines was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. For reverse transcription, 2 μg of total RNA were transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in a DNA Engine Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 50 ng of the reversed transcribed cDNA were used for each PCR reaction with 1.2 μmol of forward and reverse primers. Primers for Vangl1 (175-bp product) PCR were: forward, 5′-ttacctccgatcctgtggag-3′, reverse, 5′-aacaaaagggcacgaaacac-3′, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 440 bp), forward, 5′-tcatctctgccccctctgct-3′, reverse 5′-cgacgcctgcttcaccacct-3′. The PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min and then 94 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained for the reactions, reflecting the quantity of the product in the sample. Vangl1 Delta CT (ΔCT) was calculated by subtracting the GAPDH CT value from the Vangl1 CT value, and thus, represented the relative quantity of the target molecule after normalizing with the internal standard GAPDH. The Vangl1 ΔCT values of Vangl1-transfected or siRNA-treated cells were expressed as percentage of Vangl1 ΔCT values of control HCT116 cells. PCR products were sequenced (Massachusetts General Hospital Molecular Biology) and analyzed using National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST software. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—HT29, Caco-2, and T84 intestinal epithelial cells were grown on sterile permanox chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) for 3 days or for an additional 21 days after they reached confluence. In indicated experiments, cells were transfected 8 h after seeding. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed 20 min with methanol at -20 °C, and washed three times with TBST. Cells were blocked for 30 min with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% goat serum and then incubated 2 h with primary antibody as indicated. Immunostaining was performed respectively with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (both produced in goat, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Monolayer Wound Repair Assay—The in vitro wound healing assay was performed as described (19Rosenberg I.M. Goke M. Kanai M. Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G824-G832PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. HT29 intestinal epithelial cells were transfected as indicated and grown to confluence. The cells were then cultured in 2% fetal calf serum medium for 24 h. Wounds were made using a sterile plastic pipette tip. Reproducible results were obtained with initial wound width variation <10%. The width of the wound was measured after fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min), using a picture captured at ×200 at 12 h, and the width of the wound closure was calculated. Widths of the wounds were normalized using unstimulated control at 12 h as 100%. Statistical Analysis—For analysis of the significance of differences in phosphorylation, mRNA levels, and widths of the wounds, Student's t test was used for comparison of two groups of data. All experiments were repeated at least three times. A p value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. p65 Responding to ITF Stimulation Was Identified as Vangl1—HCT116 cells were previously shown to respond to ITF stimulation (14Taupin D.R. Kinoshita K. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells treated with ITF were used to identify proteins undergoing serine or threonine phosphorylation in response to ITF stimulation, using several serine threonine phosphorylation motif specific antibodies. α-Phospho-(Ser/Thr) Phe polyclonal antibody (α-Ser/Thr), which detects phospho-serine or threonine in the context of tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine at the -1 position or phenylalanine at the +1 position (Y/F/W)(S*/T*)F, detected a protein of ∼65 kDa, which was specifically phosphorylated following ITF treatment. p65 (Fig. 1A, arrowhead) was maximally phosphorylated between 5 and 20 min of ITF stimulation. To isolate the responsive band, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-Ser/Thr, and proteins were separated on 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE. p65 was detected by Western blotting with α-Ser/Thr. This band corresponded to a protein visualized by GelCode Blue staining of total protein (Fig. 1B). There were two closely spaced bands in the p65 area revealed by GelCode Blue staining, in the α-Ser/Thr-responsive location (Fig. 1B, inset). The bands were individually excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Both bands were identified by 14 and 10 (n = 2) peptides, respectively, as Van Gogh-like 1 (Vangl1, NCBI Protein Database number Q8TAA9) covering 36% of the protein. Peptides from both predicted N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic ends were represented. Vangl1 cDNA was cloned into FLAG-PCDNA3 (FLAG-Vangl1). When HCT116 cells were transfected with GFP control or FLAG-Vangl1, only FLAG-Vangl1-transfected samples showed a band as detected by Western blotting with α-FLAG antibody at the expected size of 65 kDa (Fig. 2A). This band location corresponded to the area recognized with α-Ser/Thr (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, overexpression of FLAG-Vangl1 increased reactivity to α-Ser/Thr even in samples not treated with ITF but not in GFP-transfected controls (Fig. 2B). Vangl1 (p65) Is Ser/Thr Phosphorylated in Response to ITF Stimulation—To confirm that Vangl1 becomes Ser/Thr phosphorylated in response to ITF, FLAG-Vangl1 was immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells with α-FLAG followed by Western blotting with α-Ser/Thr antibody (Fig. 3). When stimulated with 26 μg/ml ITF, the reactivity of the Ser/Thr band increased (Fig. 3A), whereas the total protein did not change (Fig. 3A). When densities of Ser/Thr bands versus total FLAG bands were normalized and quantified, there was a significant increase in FLAG-Vangl1 phosphorylation 1-15 min after stimulation with ITF. Ser/Thr phosphorylation reached a maximum of 1.72 ± 0.208 (p < 0.001) after 15 min of stimulation (n = 5, Fig. 3B, graph). Vangl1 phosphorylation returned to baseline level (1.08 ± 0.15, p = 0.23) after 30 min of ITF stimulation (Fig. 3A). There was no detectable increase of Ser/Thr Vangl1 phosphorylation following 45 min-6 h of stimulation (not shown). When cells transfected with FLAG-Vangl1 were immunoprecipitated with α-Ser/Thr, there was an increase of the FLAG-Vangl1 band detected by Western blotting following stimulation with ITF (Fig. 4A). When quantified and normalized, the results were similar to those obtained with FLAG immunoprecipitation and reached maximum values of 1.94 ± 0.49 (p < 0.05, n = 3) at 15 min of ITF stimulation (Fig. 4B). To confirm phosphorylation of Vangl1 protein, FLAG-Vangl1 vector-transfected HCT116 cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi, lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG. The amount of 32Pi incorporation was measured and normalized toward FLAG Western blot. Incorporation of 32Pi increased after ITF stimulation with a maximum of 1.44 ± 0.14 at 15 min (Fig. 4D, graph). Because phosphorylation/dephosphorylation can occur quickly after cell lysis, inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphorylation (okadaic acid) can aid the detection of phosphorylation. Consequently, okadaic acid addition to cell culture medium (25 nmol) resulted in an increase in ITF-induced phosphorylation (1.92 ± 0.2, Fig. 4D). When FLAG-Vangl1 was immunoprecipitated from HCT116 cells, stimulated with 0.26 μg-1.3 mg/ml range of ITF concentrations, followed by Western blotting with α-Ser/Thr antibody, the reactivity of the Ser/Thr band increased between 2.6 and 26 μg/ml ITF but decreased at concentration >260 μg/ml, whereas the total protein did not change (Fig. 4C). Vangl1 Subcellular Localization, Effect of Differentiation—Endogenous Vangl1 protein was detected using anti-human Vangl1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (α-Vangl1). Specificity of staining was confirmed using inhibition with immunizing peptide. Short preincubation with the immunizing peptide and the addition of the immunizing peptide together with primary pAbVangl1 inhibited staining (data not shown). When detected in non-confluent Caco-2 cells grown as small colonies for 3 days on chamber slides, there was little co-localization (Fig. 5, arrowhead) of Vangl1 (red) and E-cadherin (Fig. 5, green). Vangl1 was predominantly detected associated with vesicular structures in the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells, whereas E-cadherin accumulated on cell-cell borders. However, prolonged growth (21 days reaching confluence) of Caco-2 cell monolayers increased membrane association of Vangl1 (red) with E-cadherin (green), as demonstrated by yellow staining indicative of co-localization on plasma membranes (Fig. 5, arrowhead). Interestingly, stimulation with ITF (25 μg/ml) decreased association of Vangl1 with E-cadherin on plasma membrane within minutes. Vangl1 translocated from plasma membranes to vesicular structures in the cytoplasm, whereas E-cadherin remained on cell membranes (Fig. 5, green). The yellow co-localization pattern on cell membranes decreased (Fig. 5, arrowhead). Vangl1 returned to cell membranes within 45 min of ITF stimulation (not shown). The translocation of endogenous Vangl1 from plasma membrane to cytoplasmic vesicles was also observed in differentiated T84 cells and FLAG-Vangl1 similarly translocated in HCT116 cells. In confluent monolayers, 49 ± 8.5% of FLAG-Vangl1-positive HCT116 cells had plasma membrane-positive staining pattern. After a 5-min stimulation with ITF (25 μg/ml), only 27 ± 11% of FLAG-Vangl1-positive HCT116 cells were plasma membrane-positive (n = 4, p < 0.05). The number of plasma membrane-positive cells returned to 44 ± 16% 45 min after ITF stimulation. FLAG-Vangl1 in transfected HCT116 epithelial cells was present mostly in an Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction (Fig. 6A) as detected by Western blotting. Effect of ITF on Vangl1 Subcellular Localization—To test whether Vangl1 is associated with wound edges, we examined the expression of Vangl1 in wounded monolayers of differentiated Caco-2 cells. 10 min after wounding, there was no association of Vangl1 with the wound edge. Stimulation with ITF (25 μg/ml) for 10, 45, or 60 min did not increase association of Vangl1 with the wound edge (not shown). To follow Vangl1 translocation after ITF stimulation, T84 epithelial cells were selected for their higher cytoplasm versus nucleus ratio. When T84 epithelial cells were grown to form small colonies, there was membrane association of Vangl1. When cells were stained for both endogenous Vangl1 (red) and early endosomal marker 1 (EEA1; Fig. 6B, green), there was little association in unstimulated cells. However, 10 min after stimulation, there was an increased association of Vangl1 and EEA1 (Fig. 6B). Vangl11 Effects Intestinal Epithelial Restitution—The role of Vangl1 in ITF-induced restitution was examined in an in vitro wound healing assay using HT29 monolayers. This assay recapitulates “restitution,” a process that is critical for the initiation of healing the epithelial barrier in the gastrointestinal tract. ITF function was shown to correlate with its ability to enhance intestinal epithelial migration, without stimulating cell proliferation (20Dignass A. Lynch-Devaney K. Kindon H. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). HT29 cells migrate as a sheet after wounding, resembling restitution of normal epithelium (20Dignass A. Lynch-Devaney K. Kindon H. Thim L. Podolsky D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The widths of wounds were measured at the beginning of the assay and 12 h after wounding. Vangl1 overexpression significantly enhanced both ITF unstimulated (266% ± 79 for Vangl1 overexpressed versus 100% ± 57 for GFP-transfected controls; p < 0.001) and stimulated (372% ± 120 for Vangl1 overexpressed and ITF-treated versus 200% ± 134 for GFP-transfected, ITF-treated controls; p < 0.001) wound closure 12 h after wounding (Fig. 7). There was no significant increase in cell number in different wells, as assessed by cell counting (not shown). About 45% of HT29 epithelial cells were transfected with GFP control when transfection efficiency was evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The specificity of the Vangl1 effect was confirmed using siRNA inhibition of endogenous Vangl1 expression. Down-regulation of endogenous Vangl1 (to 0.45 of control by RT-PCR) expression significantly decreased the response of epithelial cells to ITF stimulation (135% ± 101 for untreated versus 152% ± 140 for ITF-treated, p = 0.33), whereas control siRNA-transfected cells were responsive (88% ± 47 for untreated versus 185% ± 60 for ITF-treated, p < 0.01). Vangl1 siRNA did not inhibit migration. Vangl1 siRNA-transfected cells migrated to the level of control siRNA or GFP controls (135% ± 101 for Vangl1 siRNA versus 100% ± 57 or 88% ± 47 for GFP or siRNA controls, p = 0.42 and p = 0.17). Vangl1 mRNA Is Expressed in Colonic Epithelial Cell Lines—Vangl1 mRNA expression of IEC was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by sequencing the product. Vangl1 mRNA was present in all epithelial cell lines tested (Fig. 8). ITF is associated with intestinal restitution, a process necessary for healing of wounded intestinal mucosa (5Taupin D. Podolsky D.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). ITF-induced effects are crucial during ini"
https://openalex.org/W2017552166,"The bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase catalyzes site-specific recombination between 34-base-pair loxP sequences in a variety of topological contexts. This reaction is widely used to manipulate DNA molecules in applications ranging from benchtop cloning to genome modifications in transgenic animals. Despite the simple, highly symmetric nature of the Cre-loxP system, there is strong evidence that the reaction is asymmetric; the 'bottom' strands in the recombining loxP sites are preferentially exchanged before the 'top' strands. Here, we address the mechanistic basis for ordered strand exchange in the Cre-loxP recombination pathway. Using suicide substrates containing 5'-bridging phosphorothioate linkages at both cleavage sites, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between synapsed loxP sites and a Cre mutant that can cleave the bridging phosphorothioate linkage but not a normal phosphodiester linkage, we showed that preferential formation of a specific synaptic complex between loxP sites imposes ordered strand exchange during recombination and that synapsis stimulates cleavage of loxP sites."

Here we investigated the functions of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tails (C-tails) of human RAMP1, -2, and -3 (hRAMP1, -2, and -3) by cotransfecting their C-terminal deletion or progressive truncation mutants into HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR. Deletion of the C-tail from hRAMP1 had little effect on the surface expression, function, or intracellular trafficking of the mutant heterodimers. By contrast, deletion of the C-tail from hRAMP2 disrupted transport of hCRLR to the cell surface, resulting in significant reductions in 125I-hAM binding and evoked cAMP accumulation. The transfection efficiency for the hRAMP2 mutant was comparable with that for wild-type hRAMP2; moreover, immunocytochemical analysis showed that the mutant hRAMP2 remained within the endoplasmic reticulum. FACS analysis revealed that deleting the C-tail from hRAMP3 markedly enhances AM-evoked internalization of the mutant heterodimers, although there was no change in agonist affinity. Truncating the C-tails by removing the six C-terminal amino acids of hRAMP2 and -3 or exchanging their C-tails with one another had no effect on surface expression, agonist affinity, or internalization of hCRLR, which suggests that the highly conserved Ser-Lys sequence within hRAMP C-tails is involved in cellular trafficking of the two AM receptors. Notably, deleting the respective C-tails from hRAMPs had no effect on lysosomal sorting of hCRLR.

The three RAMP isoforms (RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3) are each composed of ∼160 amino acids, and all exhibit a common structure that includes a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a very short C-tail, but they share less than 30% sequence identity and differ in their tissue distributions (4McLatchie L.M.

They then mediate the transport of CRLR to the cell surface, where the heterodimers form functional CGRP or AM receptors: CRLR/RAMP1 forms the CGRP1 receptor (4McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J.

Exposing cells that express GPCRs to their respective agonists frequently leads to a rapid internalization of the receptor in a process believed to involve clathrin-coated vesicles, caveolin-rich vesicles, or both (14Koenig J.A.

Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The internalized GPCRs may be recycled back to the plasma membrane in order to promote functional restoration of signal transduction, or they may be trafficked to lysosomes, where they are degraded (14Koenig J.A.

Similarly, upon binding their respective agonist, hCRLR/RAMP heterodimers stably expressed in HEK-293 cells are rapidly internalized without dissociation via clathrin-coated vesicles (6Hilairet S.

In that regard, it is well known that G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate serine/threonine sites located in many GPCR C-tails, enabling β-arrestins to bind there (16Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). After internalization, both CRLR and RAMP are targeted to lysosomes (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M.

Although short, the RAMP C-tails do contain potential sites of interaction with other proteins (5Sexton P.M. Albiston A. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N.

For instance, the hRAMP3 C-tail possesses a classical type I PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1) binding motif (TLL) (5Sexton P.M. Albiston A. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Hay D.L. Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the binding of NSF to the PDZ motif of hRAMP3 was found to promote slow recycling of internalized hCRLR/hRAMP3 heterodimers in HEK-293 cells (18Bomberger J.M. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Spielman W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9297-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, a five-residue motif (QSKRT) in the hRAMP1 C-tail can act as an ER retention signal (19Steiner S. Muff R. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11398-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C-tails of RAMPs, like that of CRLR, also contain potential phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites (5Sexton P.M. Albiston A. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Hay D.L. Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is the post-translational attachment of ubiquitin lysine residues in the substrate proteins (20Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 21Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); it is not crucial for receptor internalization but is essential for proper trafficking to lysosomes for degradation (22Martin N.P.

Whether the phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites are also involved in intracellular trafficking of CRLR/RAMP heterodimers remains unknown. To address that issue, we examined the effects of expressing various hRAMP C-tail deletion and progressive truncation mutants and chimeras in which the C-tails were exchanged among the three hRAMPs in HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR.

Expression Constructs—hNSF (GenBank™ accession number BC030613) was cloned from cDNA obtained from human heart (Clontech) using PCR with the appropriate primers and then modified to provide a consensus Kozak sequence as previously described (25Aiyar N.

A double V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was ligated, in frame, to the 5′-end of the cDNAs encoding each intact hRAMP, and the native signal sequences were removed and replaced with MKTILALSTYIFCLVFA (26Guon X.-M.

The deletion and progressive truncation mutations in the V5-hRAMP C-tails were created by using 3′-primers that introduced a translational stop codon at the desired positions (Fig. 1); with RAMP3, for instance, Δ139 represents a mutant in which a stop codon was introduced after residue 139. In addition, various V5-hRAMP chimeras were constructed by exchanging the 9 C-terminal amino acid residues among the three hRAMPs. The hNSF, V5-hRAMPs, V5-hRAMP deletion and truncation mutants, and V5-hRAMP chimeras were then respectively cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS/Neo (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y.

For experimentation, cells were seeded into 6- or 24-well plates and, upon reaching 70–80% confluence, were transiently cotransfected with the indicated cDNAs using Lipofectamine transfection reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 4 h in Opti-MEM I medium containing plasmid DNAs, Plus reagent, and Lipofectamine (see Ref. 27Nagoshi Y. Kuwasako K. Cao Y-N. Kitamura K. Eto T. Biochem.

Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and then incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in the dark with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution). Following two additional washes with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in the dark with PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:400 dilution) in ice-cold FACS buffer. For evaluation of whole cell expression, cells were first permeabilized using IntraPrep™ reagents (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated with anti-V5-FITC antibody (1:500 dilution) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Following two successive washes with FACS buffer, both groups of cells were subjected to flow cytometry in an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using EXPO 2 software (Beckman Coulter). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and the emission was monitored at 530 nm for GFP and 575 nm for PE. Viability was assessed by exclusion of propidium iodide. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR-GFP were plated onto 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan). As determined by the experimental protocol, some cells were then transiently transfected with V5-hRAMP2, Δ166-hRAMP2, or Δ167-hRAMP2. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation for 60 min first with rabbit anti-calnexin (1:200 dilution) and mouse anti-V5-FITC antibody (1:500 dilution) and then, after washing four times with PBS, with the Alexa Fluor® 594 diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. After another three washes with PBS, the cells were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and a 22-mm glass coverslip was seated in the center of each dish. Double labeling was viewed using a TCS-SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica) equipped with a × 63/1.32 numerical aperture immersion lens (Leica). Whole-cell Radioligand Binding Assays—Transfected HEK-293 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with prewarmed PBS and then incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with 125I-[Tyr0]hαCGRP (100 pm) or 125I-hAM (20 pm) in the presence (for nonspecific binding) or absence (for total binding) of 1 μm unlabeled hαCGRP or hAM in modified Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), after which they were washed twice more with ice-cold PBS and harvested with 0.5 m NaOH. The associated cellular radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. cAMP Measurements—Transfectants in 24-well plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in Hanks' buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and the indicated concentrations of hαCGRP or hAM. The reaction mixture was then replaced with 20 mm HCl and 1 m acetic acid to extract the intracellular cAMP, after which the resultant extracts were lyophilized and stored at -30 °C until assayed. The cAMP concentrations were measured using our specific radioimmunoassay (1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichiki Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). FACS Analysis of Receptor Internalization and Recycling—Following cotransfection of the indicated cDNAs into HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR-GFP in 6-well plates, the cells were exposed to selected concentrations of hαCGRP or hAM in prewarmed serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for the indicated periods (up to 2 h) at 37 °C. For receptor recycling studies, the cells were incubating for 60 min with the agonist plus 10 μg/ml cycloheximide and 10 μg/ml brefeldin A and then washed three times with prewarmed PBS. The medium was then replaced with prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for the indicated periods (up to 4 h) at 37 °C. Internalization and recycling were stopped by adding ice-cold PBS, after which the cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer, and labeled with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody and fluorescein PE-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody. The cells were then subjected to flow cytometry and analyzed as described above. mRNA Expression Measured by Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from HEK-293 cells either untransfected or transfected as indicated using total RNA isolation reagent (Invitrogen). Thereafter, the target cDNAs were synthesized from the respective mRNAs by reverse transcription using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The expression of mRNAs encoding hNSF was assessed using real time quantitative PCR (Prism 7700 Sequence Detector, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with original oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-AGAACAGTGACCGCACACCAT-3′; antisense, 5′-TCCACAACCACACAACTGAGC-3′) and a fluorescently labeled probe (5′-AGCGTGCTTCTGGAAGGCCCTCCTCACAGT-3′). The size of the amplified DNA was 223 bp. The levels of hNSF mRNA were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, which served as an internal control. Western Analysis—Following transient transfection of hNSF into cells plated in 6-well plates, the transfectants were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested in 1 ml of sample buffer (28Cao Y-N. Kuwasako K. Kato J. Yanagita T. Tsuruda T. Kawano J. Nagoshi Y. Chen A.F. Wada A. Suganuma T. Eto T. Kitamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 866-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and boiled for 10 min. Equal aliquots of protein (20 μg) were then subjected to 10% SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then blocked with 5% block reagent (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and incubated first for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-hNSF antibody (1:1,000 dilution) and then with secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). hNSF proteins were detected using an ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences), after which they were quantitated by densitometry using Image Gauge (LAS-1000; Fujifilm). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Differences between two groups were evaluated using Student's t tests; differences among multiple groups were evaluated with a one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Deletion of hRAMP C-tails—We previously established HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR-GFP alone or together with Myc-hRAMPs and used them to visualize the cellular localization and trafficking of hCRLR (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Following AM exposure, hCRLR is rapidly internalized together with its associated hRAMP, and then both are trafficked to lysosomes; fusion of GFP to the C terminus of hCRLR had no apparent effect on the trafficking of the heterodimeric receptor. In the present study, therefore, we used HEK-293 cells stably expressing hCRLR-GFP to examine the functions of the C-tails of the three hRAMPs within the respective CRLR/RAMP heterodimers. We initially tested the effect of completely deleting the C-tails of the three V5-epitope tagged hRAMPs (Fig. 2). When coexpressed with hCRLR, V5-RAMP1, -2, and -3 were detected at the surfaces of 45.9, 21.9, and 38.9% of cells, respectively. On the other hand, the V5-RAMP deletion mutants Δ139-RAMP1, Δ166-RAMP2, and Δ139-RAMP3 appeared at the surface of 43.7, 5.0, and 38.8% of cells, respectively. Thus, deletion of the C-tail significantly reduced surface delivery of only RAMP2. Surface immunoreactivity was detected in only 0.55% of cells expressing the empty vector (Mock), which is well within the 2% limit of resolution characteristic of FACS analysis. We next evaluated the binding profiles of 125I-[Tyr0]hαCGRP and 125I-hAM to cells expressing each of the wild-type and mutant receptors (Fig. 3, A and B). When CRLR-GFP was coexpressed with empty vector (Mock), the cells showed only very low levels of specific binding of 125I-[Tyr0]αCGRP and 125I-AM. Co-transfection of RAMP1 led to markedly higher specific 125I-[Tyr0]αCGRP binding than was seen with Δ139-RAMP1 (Fig. 3A), although there was no difference in the surface expression of either heterodimeric receptor (Fig. 2). Likewise, cotransfection of RAMP2 significantly increased the specific binding of 125I-AM to CRLR-GFP-expressing cells, whereas cotransfection of Δ166-RAMP2 did not. In this case, the reduced binding could be due to reduced surface delivery of the mutant receptors (Fig. 2). Finally, deletion of the RAMP3 C-tail had no effect on specific 125I-AM binding. Fig. 3B shows a set of 125I-[Tyr0]αCGRP and 125I-AM competition curves for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The IC50 values derived from the curves obtained with cotransfection of Δ139-RAMP1 or Δ166-RAMP2 were both >1000 nm, which is much higher than those for RAMP1 and -2 (43.0 and 12.2 nm, respectively). By contrast, the IC50 values obtained with expression of RAMP3 or Δ139-RAMP3 were within the same order of magnitude (560 and 257 nm, respectively). We then further characterized the mutant receptors by measuring agonist-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3, C and D). αCGRP and AM elicited little or no cAMP production in HEK-293 cells expressing CRLR-GFP alone, indicating that the stable transfectants used in this study express no functional RAMP proteins. In cells coexpressing RAMP1 and CRLR-GFP, by contrast, αCGRP (EC50 = 0.18 nm) elicited marked increases in cAMP (Fig. 3C). In cells expressing Δ139-RAMP1 with CRLR-GFP, the EC50 for αCGRP was increased only a little, as compared with RAMP1 (to 0.49 nm), and the maximal responses were also similar to those seen with RAMP1 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the responses to [Tyr0]αCGRP by cells expressing CRLR-GFP/Δ139-RAMP1 (EC50 = 8.5 nm) were significantly smaller than those seen in cells expressing CRLR-GFP/RAMP1 (EC50 = 0.79 nm). In cells transfected with RAMP2, AM elicited significant increases in cAMP (EC50 = 0.38 nm), but these responses were diminished by 62.1% in cells transfected with Δ166-RAMP2, although there was no significant change in EC50 (0.16 nm) (Fig. 3D). AM-evoked cAMP production did not significantly differ in cells expressing RAMP3 or Δ139-RAMP3 (EC50 = 0.41 and 0.20 nm, respectively) (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2020643968,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a G protein-coupled receptor for trypsin and tryptase, exerts important physiological and pathological functions in multiple systems. However, unlike PAR-1, the PAR-2-mediated intracellular signal transductions are hardly known. Here, using yeast two-hybrid screening with a human brain cDNA library, we identified an interacting partner of human PAR-2, the Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1). The interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays in vitro, and by co-immunoprecipitation assays in vivo. Jab1 was also shown to be colocalized with PAR-2 in both transfected HEK293 cells and in normal primary human astrocytes by double immunofluorescence staining. Further experiments demonstrated that multiple intracellular domains of PAR-2 are required for the interaction with Jab1. We then showed that agonist stimulation of PAR-2 disrupted the interaction, which could be prevented by the inhibitor of receptor endocytosis phenylarsine oxide, but not by the lysosomal protease inhibitor ZPAD. Importantly, we found that activation of PAR-2 induced the redistribution of Jab1 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, but did not influence expression of Jab1. Furthermore, Jab1 mediated PAR-2-induced c-Jun activation, which was followed by increased activation of activator protein-1. Loss-of-function studies, using Jab1 small interfering RNA, demonstrated that Jab1 knockdown blocked PAR-2-induced activator protein-1 activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Jab1 is an important effector that mediates a novel signal transduction pathway for PAR-2-dependent gene expression.

Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), the second member of the unique subfamily of four members within the superfamily of GPCR, mediates cellular signal transductions to the extracellular serine proteases trypsin, tryptase, and others during cell proliferation, pain, and inflammatory responses (1Cottrell G.S.

Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Rather than mere ligand binding, which is responsible for receptor activation in most GPCRs, PAR-2 is activated by the newly exposed NH2 terminus, which serves as a tethered ligand domain. This tethered ligand domain is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular NH2 terminus of PAR-2 (3Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Synthetic receptor-activating peptide, whose sequence is identical to that of the tethered ligand domain, could mimic the actions of trypsin and tryptase (2Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 3Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Unlike PAR-1 whose signal transductions have been clarified in detail (4Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar), only relatively few studies about signaling pathways mediated by PAR-2 were done. Nevertheless, PAR-2 activation has been found to induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, the extracellular signal regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in multiple cell types (5Temkin V. Kantor B. Weg V. Hartman M.L. Levi-Schaffer F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2662-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PAR-2 could further activate the downstream factors c-Fos, c-Jun, as well as the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (5Temkin V. Kantor B. Weg V. Hartman M.L.

PAR-2 was found to be abundantly expressed in the heart, lung, trachea, liver, pancreas, gut, kidney, prostate, skin, and brain (2Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 8Hollenberg M.D. Compton S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 9Noorbakhsh F. Vergnolle N. Hollenberg M.D. Power C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To date, most findings suggest that PAR-2 contributes to inflammation in the cardiovascular system, airway system, gastrointestinal system, skin, and peripheral nervous system (1Cottrell G.S. Amadesi S. Schmidlin F. Bunnett N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol.

Vergnolle N. Hollenberg M.D. Power C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, it was also reported that high concentrations of the PAR-2-activating peptide (AP) induced neuronal death in the rat hippocampus, suggesting that PAR-2 may be linked to neurodegeneration (10Smith-Swintosky V.L. Cheo-Isaacs C.T. D'Andrea M.R. Santulli R.J. Darrow A.L. Andrade-Gordon P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recent data obtained from PAR-2 knock-out mice indicated that the deficiency of the PAR-2 gene promoted acute focal ischemic brain injury (11Jin G. Hayashi T. Kawagoe J. Takizawa T. Nagata T. Nagano I. Syoji M. Abe K. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although accumulating evidence indicates that PAR-2 is important in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, the potential significance of PAR-2 in the central nervous system still remains elusive. Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) was initially identified as a coactivator of c-Jun (12Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and was later shown to be a component of the COP9 signalosome complex (13Deng X.W. Dubiel W. Wei N. Hofmann K. Mundt K. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 202-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome is a conserved multiprotein complex that has been found in plants, mammals, Drosophila, and the fission yeast (14Schwechheimer C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It consists of eight subunits, which exhibit significant similarity to the eight subunits of the lid of the 26 S proteasome (14Schwechheimer C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Previous work has already demonstrated that a number of diverse proteins interact with the subunits of the COP9 signalosome, especially with Jab1. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, it was found that Jab1 bound to the NH2-terminal activation domain of c-Jun and thereby activated c-Jun (12Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Jab1 was shown to regulate the cell cycle by degrading the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (16Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Recently, Jab1 was found to be connected to the transmembrane protein integrin adhesion receptor LFA-1, and to mediate the activation of LFA-1-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) (17Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It was also reported that Jab1 interacts with the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, as well as the nuclear receptor progesterone receptor and the steroid receptor coactivator-1, which control the transcription and expression of a number of genes (18Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Jeong J.W. Bae M.H. Lee Y.M. Bae S.K. Park J.W. Kim K.R. Kim K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 19Chauchereau A.

In the present study, we screened a human brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system, and identified Jab1 as an interacting partner protein of PAR-2. We found that Jab1 constitutively interacts with human PAR-2 in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, Jab1 potentiates PAR-2-induced c-Jun/AP-1 activation. Our data delineate a novel alternative signal transduction pathway for PAR-2-dependent gene expression. Plasmid Constructs—For yeast two-hybrid screening, the full-length human PAR-2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (GenBank™ accession number AY336105), and cloned into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBKT7 (Clontech), generating the bait plasmid, pGBKT7-hsPAR-2. For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, the GST cDNA containing the linker sequence at the NH2 terminus was cloned into pVL1392 vector (Invitrogen), generating the C-terminal GST expression vector, pVL1392-GST. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the different regions of human PAR-2 (Fig. 2B) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pVL1392-GST. The full-length human Jab1 cDNA containing a consensus Kozak sequence upstream of the initiator ATG was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1mycHis vector (Invitrogen). For co-immunoprecipitation, PCR products of the full-length human PAR-2 with a consensus Kozak sequence upstream of the initiator ATG and the hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA, HA) at the C terminus were cloned into pEAK10 vector (a gift from Dr. T. Koch, Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg). Primer sequences are available on request. All of the DNA sequences of plasmid constructs were confirmed to be in-frame by ABI 310 sequencer. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Assays—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3, according to the manufacturer's protocol and the Yeast Protocol Handbook (Clontech). Yeast strain AH109 cells were transformed with pGBKT7-hsPAR-2 plasmids by the lithium acetate method. The transformants were selected by growth on SD/-Trp media. Commercial pretransformed Y187 cells with the human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library were incubated for 24 h with transformed AH109 for yeast mating. The entire mating culture was plated onto SD/-Trp-Leu-His media, and colonies were further spread onto SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade media. His+Ade+ colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by the LacZ colony lift filter assay. Plasmids were isolated from His+Ade+LacZ+ colonies and transformed into Escherichia coli XL 1-Blue cells for plasmid amplification. The rescued pACT2 plasmids containing the cDNA insert were sequenced, and analyzed with the program BLAST in the GenBank™ data base. Cell Culture and Transfection—The HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 1:1 medium (Biochrom, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Normal primary human astrocytes were obtained from Cambrex Bio-Science Verviers SPRL (Verviers, Belgium). These astrocytes were established from normal human brain tissue. Normal primary human astrocytes were grown in the AGM® Astrocyte Medium (Cambrex) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Normal primary human astrocyte cultures were used within 10 passages in the present study, because their characteristic properties are impaired with subsequent passages. Cells (80% confluent) were transfected using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, 1 day before transfection the cells were plated on a 6-well plate. The following day, the subconfluent cells were transfected or co-transfected with the indicated plasmids using DOTAP. To generate the stable clone, the cells were selected with 500 μg/ml of G418 (for HEK293-Jab1myc), 1 μg/ml of puromycin (for HEK293-PAR-2-HA), or both (for HEK293-PAR-2-HA+Jab1myc). PAR-2 Activation and Inhibitor Treatment—To activate PAR-2 receptor, cells were rinsed with Hank's solution, and stimulated in serum-free medium with bovine pancreatic trypsin (100 nm, Roche Diagnostics) as a physiological agonist or with PAR-2 AP SLIGKV-NH2 (100 μm, Bachem) as a specific agonist. To prevent receptor endocytosis or degradation, cells were pretreated with 80 μm phenylarsine oxide (PAO; Calbiochem) for 15 min or with 100 μm Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (ZPAD, Bachem) for 30 min prior to agonist stimulation. To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were pretreated with 70 μm cycloheximide (Calbiochem) for 30 min. The inhibitors were included in medium throughout the experiments. GST Pull-down Assays—The different GST fusion protein constructs were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, as described previously (20Hanck T. Stricker R. Sedehizade F. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus was amplified and tested for the production of the fusion protein. Cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing PAR-2-GST, PAR-2ΔIL12-GST, or PAR-2ΔIL3C-GST were lysed on ice in membrane fraction buffer 1 containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Germany, one tablet per 50 ml). After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant in membrane fraction buffer 1 was further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. Afterward, pellets were resuspended in membrane fraction buffer 2 (50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Brij 58, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture), stirred, and centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C. The resulting supernatant contained the membrane fraction of the recombinant fusion proteins. On the other hand, cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing PAR-2IL3-GST or PAR-2C-GST were lysed in Sf9 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture. After centrifugation for 5 min at 35,000 × g and 4 °C, the resulting supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction of the recombinant fusion proteins. The recombinant fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST and truncated PAR-2-GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the crude HEK293-Jab1myc cell extracts in HEK293 lysis buffer, containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture. After washing three times with the HEK293 lysis buffer without protease inhibitor, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the anti-myc antibody (1:5000, Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the HEK293 lysis buffer. Equal amounts of lysates were rotated with the anti-HA antibody (1:200, Sigma) or with the anti-PAR-2 (C-17) antibody (1:25, Santa Cruz) for 6 h, followed by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) or protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with HEK293 lysis buffer without protease inhibitor, the bound beads were incubated in Laemmli buffer for 60 min on ice (for immunoprecipitating PAR-2), or boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 100 °C (for immunoprecipitating PAR-2ΔIL12-HA), separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the anti-myc antibody (1:5000, Invitrogen) or with the anti-Jab1 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz). To confirm the specific immunoprecipitation by PAR-2, the membrane was stripped, blocked, and reprobed overnight with the anti-HA antibody (1:2000, Cell signaling technology) or with anti-PAR-2 antibody (C-17, 1:100). Western Blot—The proteins with Laemmli buffer were boiled for 5 min or incubated on ice for 1 h (for detecting PAR-2), electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked and incubated overnight with the primary antibody (anti-GST, 1:80,000, Santa Cruz; anti-Jab1, 1:2500, Santa Cruz; anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology; anti-c-Jun antibody, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology; anti-HA (6E2), 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology; or anti-β-tubulin I, 1:40,000, Sigma) at 4 °C, followed by goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the immune complexes were detected by the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). To remove N-linked oligosaccharides of PAR-2, whole cell lysates were incubated overnight with N-glycosidase F (500 units/reaction, New England Biolabs) at 4 °C. To detect endogenous c-Jun phosphorylation, cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Igepal, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF and Protease Inhibitor Mixture). Immunofluorescence Analysis—As described previously (21Luo W. Wang Y. Reiser G. Brain Res. 2005; 1047: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Then they were incubated overnight with mouse anti-myc antibody (2 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and rabbit anti-HA antibody (4 μg/ml, Sigma) or with mouse anti-Jab1 antibody (8 μg/ml, Santa Cruz) and rabbit anti-HA antibody (4 μg/ml, Sigma) at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (20 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (20 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for 120 min at room temperature in the dark. Mounted slides were observed with a LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were transfected with an AP-1-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (a gift from Dr. J. Kraus, Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg) using DOTAP, as described above. Six hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 100 μm PAR-2 AP for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. The CAT activity in cell lysates was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Diagnostics), and normalized to protein concentration. The empty CAT reporter vector was also transfected in parallel, as a negative control. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Human Jab1 siRNA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. HEK293-PAR-2-HA cells were transfected with human Jab1 siRNA by using magnet-assisted transfection, according to the manufacturer's protocol (IBA GmbH, Germany). Non-silencing siRNA labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 served as a scrambled siRNA control (Qiagen). Jab1 knockdown was assessed by Western blot and RT-PCR at 48 h after transfection. Total RNA and subsequently cDNA were made, as described previously (21Luo W. Wang Y. Reiser G. Brain Res. 2005; 1047: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Specific primers used were as follows: Jab1, forward 5′-CATATGAATACATGGCTGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGCTTCTGACTGCTCTAAC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as an internal control, forward 5′-TCCAAAATCAAGTGGGGCGATGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-ACCACCTGGTGCTCAGTGTAGCCC-3′. Fragments were amplified by PCR for 15 min at 95 °C, followed by repeated cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 53 °C, 60 s at 72 °C, then a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis with 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and visualized by the Bio-Rad gel document system. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences were examined by Student's t test between two groups or one-way analysis of variance within multiple groups. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Jab1 Interacts with Human PAR-2 in Yeast—PAR-2, a GPCR, mediates intracellular signal transduction in response to stimulation with the extracellular proteases trypsin and tryptase. To identify intracellular proteins that are involved in PAR-2 signaling events, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed. The full-length human PAR-2 cDNA was fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait. Using this bait, a pretransformed human brain cDNA library was screened as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From 1.6 × 106 clones screened that were grown on nutritionally deficient plates and that activated the β-galactosidase, 308 colonies were found positive for the selection markers histidine, adenine, and LacZ. Subsequent sequencing and BLAST analysis revealed 24 colonies to be truly positive. From two of these single colonies the cDNAs encoded amino acids (aa) 31-334 and 49-334 of Jab1, respectively (GenBank accession number BC001859) (22Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Grouse L.H.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). Other candidate partners will be described elsewhere. To verify the protein interaction in yeast, we transformed pGBKT7-hsPAR-2 into yeast Y187 cells and pACT2-Jab1 isolated from the library into yeast AH109 cells, and performed yeast two-hybrid tests. As expected, the transformants grew on SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade media, and were shown to be positive by the LacZ colony-lift filter assay. Therefore, these results suggest that Jab1 could interact with human PAR-2 in yeast. PAR-2 Expression in Sf9 and HEK293 Cells—To identify protein-protein interactions of PAR-2 with Jab1 in other systems, we engineered exogenous PAR-2 expression. We generated a novel baculovirus GST expression vector to facilitate the expression of the transmembrane protein tagged with GST in Sf9 cells. The full-length human PAR-2 cDNA was inserted at the NH2 terminus of GST. After transfection in Sf9 cells using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), the recombinant baculovirus was amplified and tested for the production of the fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, PAR-2-GST was strongly expressed with two major bands (∼60-70 and ∼140-160 kDa) in Sf9 cells. The high molecular mass band might represent the PAR-2 receptor homodimer. We also constructed a mammalian expression vector, pEAK10, inserted with the full-length PAR-2 cDNA fused with HA at the C terminus. This recombinant vector was used for stably transfecting HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, PAR-2-HA expression was detected in the whole cell lysates from HEK293-PAR-2-HA cells, by using an antibody against HA. PAR-2-HA protein appeared as a smear band (mainly at ∼37-70 kDa), which is consistent with previous reports by others (23Compton S.J. Sandhu S. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is known that human PAR-2 possesses two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (23Compton S.J. Sandhu S. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Receptor glycosylation is important for PAR-2 expression and activation (23Compton S.J. Sandhu S. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Compton S.J. Renaux B. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To study whether the smear band of PAR-2 resulted from receptor N-glycosylation, whole cell lysates from HEK293-PAR-2-HA were incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F. As shown in Fig. 1C, peptide N-glycosidase F treatment significantly reduced the molecular mass of PAR-2-HA to ∼32-44 kDa, suggesting that PAR-2-HA is a N-glycosylated glycoprotein. PAR-2 might also be O-glycosylated, because N-deglycosylated PAR-2 in Fig. 1C still appears as a smear band. Multiple Intracellular Domains of PAR-2 Responsible for Interaction with Jab1—Next, we performed GST pull-down assays in vitro, to confirm interaction between PAR-2 and Jab1 by using biochemical methods. The PAR-2-GST fusion protein expressed in Sf9 cells was purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. These beads with immobilized PAR-2-GST fusion protein were incubated overnight with whole cell lysates from HEK293-Jab1myc cells to examine the interaction of PAR-2-GST with Jab1myc. The interaction was detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Jab1 specifically interacted with the full-length PAR-2-GST fusion protein (lane 3). To exclude the possible interaction of Jab1 with the GST tag protein, we, in parallel, incubated GST protein with the crude HEK293-Jab1myc cell lysates. Western blot analysis showed that Jab1 did not interact with GST protein alone (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Aliquots from the HEK293-Jab1myc cell lysates, which were used for the pull-down assays also served as control for the Western blot (Fig. 2A, lane 1). To map the domains of PAR-2 responsible for interaction with Jab1, we generated a series of truncated PAR-2-GST fusion proteins, which are given"
https://openalex.org/W2111015751,"The type 3 synthase catalyzes the formation of the Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 capsular polysaccharide [-3)-β-d-GlcUA-(1, 4)-β-d-Glc-(1-]n. Synthesis is comprised of two distinct catalytic phases separated by a transition step whereby an oligosaccharylphosphatidylglycerol primer becomes tightly bound to the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site of the synthase. Using the recombinant synthase in Escherichia coli membranes, we determined that a critical oligosaccharide length of ∼8 monosaccharides was required for recognition of the growing chain by the synthase. Upon binding of the oligosaccharide-lipid to the carbohydrate recognition site, the polymerization reaction entered a highly processive phase to produce polymer of high molecular weight. The initial oligosaccharide-synthetic phase also appeared to be processive, the duration of which was enhanced by the concentration of UDP-GlcUA and diminished by an increase in temperature. The overall reaction approached a steady state equilibrium between the polymer- and oligosaccharide-forming phases that was shifted toward the former by higher UDP-GlcUA levels or lower temperatures and toward the latter by lower concentrations of UDP-GlcUA or higher temperatures. The transition step between the two enzymatic phases demonstrated cooperative kinetics, which is predicted to reflect a possible reorientation of the oligosaccharide-lipid in conjunction with the formation of a tight binding complex.

The transition step between the two enzymatic phases demonstrated cooperative kinetics, which is predicted to reflect a possible reorientation of the oligosaccharide-lipid in conjunction with the formation of a tight binding complex. The Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 capsule is a high molecular weight polysaccharide that grows at the nonreducing end by the alternate addition of Glc and GlcUA 2The abbreviations used are: GlcUA, glucuronic acid; PLD, phospholipase D. (1Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Its synthesis is mediated by the type 3 synthase, which is a processive glycosyltransferase in the GT-2 family that includes other members that synthesize cellulose, hyaluronan, chitin, and related β-glycans (2Saxena I.M. Brown R.M.J. Fevere M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 4Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28581-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of this class, the type 3 synthase contains a carbohydrate recognition site that binds the growing polysaccharide and is an integral part of the complex catalytic mechanism (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both S. pneumoniae type 3 and Escherichia coli expressing the recombinant synthase, a novel lipid determined to be glucosylphosphatidylglycerol accumulates in the membranes and serves as a primer for polysaccharide synthesis (6Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The first reaction catalyzed by the type 3 synthase is the transfer of Glc from UDP-Glc to phosphatidylglycerol. Glucosylphosphatidylglycerol is present at low concentrations in synthase-containing cells and serves as an acceptor for GlcUA from UDP-GlcUA to form the disaccharide lipid, glucuronyl-glucosyl-phosphatidylglycerol. When both UDP-sugars are present at very low concentrations, the synthase catalyzes a short lived processive reaction that results in the formation of a glycolipid fraction consisting of a mixture of short oligosaccharides (7Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As the concentrations of the UDP-sugars increase, the reaction abruptly becomes highly processive, and the products are rapidly extended into polymers of dramatically increased chain length. Presumably, a critical step in the initiation and elongation of high molecular weight polymer is the binding of the oligosaccharide-lipid to the carbohydrate acceptor recognition site of the synthase. Although much is known about carbohydrate acceptor recognition sequences among glycoside hydrolases, there is very little information on this aspect of catalysis by most polysaccharide biosynthetic systems. Several hundred glycoside hydrolases have been grouped into over 40 different families based on the sequences of their carbohydrate binding domains (8Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). In general, these binding domains are noncatalytic and serve to bring the biocatalytic domains into close proximity with their polysaccharide substrates (9Flint J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Taylor E.J. Williamson M.P. Walters C. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23718-23726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, structural studies of glycosyltransferases have not revealed significant sequence motifs that would provide for an interaction with carbohydrate acceptors. Based on hydrophobic cluster analysis, sequence homology, and x-ray crystallographic data, a fairly detailed picture is emerging of the binding and catalytic interaction of some glycosyltransferases with their nucleotide diphosphate sugar donor (10Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Davies, G. J., Charnock, S. J., and Henrissat, B., (201) Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 13, 105–120Google Scholar, 12Unligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This information has led to the development of a rather strong argument for the existence of only a single nucleotide-sugar binding site in polymerases, such as type 3 synthase, that require two distinct nucleotide sugar donors (11Davies, G. J., Charnock, S. J., and Henrissat, B., (201) Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 13, 105–120Google Scholar). The polymerization reaction catalyzed by many processive glycosyltransferases is thought to involve a cyclical translocation process wherein the polymer chain detaches, slides forward, and then reattaches to the enzyme to allow another round of sugar additions. Enzymes similar to the type 3 synthase have been postulated to undergo a translocation step after the addition of every two sugars to avoid the necessity of rotating either the polymer or the synthase (2Saxena I.M. Brown R.M.J. Fevere M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory has shown that polysaccharide chains are ejected from the type 3 synthase when one UDP-sugar is present at high concentration and the other is limiting or absent, suggesting that an abortive translocation process might serve to terminate chain growth (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The current investigation indicates that the carbohydrate recognition site may form a complex with an approximate eight-sugar segment of the growing polysaccharide chain, and that this interaction may provide for the high degree of processivity of chain assembly as well as for controlling the ultimate size of the polymer. Materials—Econo-safe scintillation mixture was obtained from Research Products International Corp. and Biogel P-4 was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Lysozyme, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcUA, and Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D (PLD) were from Sigma. Chromatography paper (3MM Chr) and DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) were from Whatman. UDP-[14C]GlcUA (175 mCi/mmol) was purchased from ICN, and Nonidet P-40 was from Calbiochem. Todd Hewitt broth, yeast extract, and tryptone were from Difco. Preparation of Type 3 Oligosaccharide Standards—[14C]GlcUA-labeled type 3 polymer was digested with Bacillus circulans type 3-specific depolymerase as previously described (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T.

The released oligosaccharides were fractionated and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Biogel P-4, as described below. Growth Conditions and Membrane Preparation—Recombinant E. coli strain JD424 containing the type 3 synthase (Cps3S) has been described (16Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The clone contains a 2.1-kb Sau3AI fragment from S. pneumoniae WU2 consisting of the 3′-end of cps3D and the complete cps3S. The growth of strain JD424, induction of synthase expression, and harvesting of the cells was performed as described previously (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts and membranes were obtained following lysozyme digestion and sonication, as described previously except that leupeptin and pepstatin were omitted from the spheroplasting reaction (7Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Assay of Synthase Activity—Type 3 synthase activity was determined in 100-μl reaction mixtures consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UDP-Glc, 0.01 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcUA, and E. coli membranes (3–15 μg of protein). Standard reactions were incubated at 35 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 12.5 m acetic acid. The reaction components were separated by ascending paper chromatography on Whatman 3MM paper with a solvent mixture of butanol:acetic acid:water (44:16:40). The chromatograms were cut into 1-cm strips, and polymer (origin product) and oligo-lipid (migrating slightly faster than Glc) were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was determined by calculating the nmol of hexuronic acid incorporated per mg of protein. All experiments were repeated multiple times and/or under varying conditions. The results shown are representative of these experiments. Preparation of Preloaded Synthase—The carbohydrate acceptor binding site of the type 3 synthase was preloaded with unlabeled growing polymer in a 3-ml reaction mixture consisting of E. coli membranes (2 mg of protein), 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm UDP-Glc, and 0.1 mm UDP-GlcUA. The reaction was incubated for 2 min at 25 °C and terminated by placing on ice. The membrane-enzyme-polysaccharide complexes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and suspended in 2.5 ml of a wash solution consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol. The washed membranes were collected by centrifugation, as above. The membrane pellet was washed two more times as described above. Preparation of Products for Chromatography—Oligosaccharide-lipid and polymer products were synthesized in scaled-up standard enzyme assay mixtures under the conditions indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were terminated by placing on ice, and the labeled membranes were washed three times by centrifugation as described above. The washed membranes were suspended in 200 μl of 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), heated at 100 °C for 4 min, and solubilized by the addition of 0.25% Nonidet P-40. The solubilized products were digested with PLD (10 units/100 μl) for 1 h at 30°C in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8) and 10 mm CaCl2. The digests were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Analytical Methods—The length of the type 3 polysaccharide was determined using the lipid anchor as a marker for the reducing end oligosaccharide fragment following hydrolysis of the polymer with type 3-specific depolymerase. 3W. T. Forsee, R. T. Cartee, and J. Yother, manuscript in preparation. The size of the residual hydrophobic oligosaccharide was determined, and polymer size was calculated based on the proportions of radioisotope in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligosaccharide fractions. Protein was determined as described with a Coomassie Blue dye using bovine serum albumin as the standard (17Bradford M.M. Anal.

Ion exchange chromatography was carried out on 0.6 × 2.5-cm columns of DEAE-cellulose (OH–) following removal of the lipid component from samples by PLD digestion. The columns were equilibrated with 5 ml of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) and washed with 3 volumes of H2O prior to application of the sample in 2 ml of H2O. The columns were washed with 2 ml of H2O, and the products were eluted by one of two ionic gradient methods. Optimum oligosaccharide separation was achieved with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0–0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions (1.2 ml) were collected and monitored for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and for ionic strength by conductivity. Oligosaccharide and polymer mixtures were fractionated with a 2-step gradient at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The first step consisted of a 30-ml gradient of 0–0.3 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4) and was followed by a second step of 0.3–1.5 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). Fractions (0.65 ml) were monitored as above. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on 1.5 × 88-cm columns of Biogel P-4 irrigated with a solution consisting of 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), 0.04% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Prior to application to the column, samples were digested with PLD as described above. Column fractions of 0.9 ml were collected and monitored for radioactivity. Effect of UDP-sugar Concentrations and Temperature on the Processivity of the Synthase Reaction—When equimolar concentrations of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA are present in reactions with E. coli membranes containing type 3 synthase, a rapid transition from oligosaccharide-lipid to polymer synthesis occurs in the UDP-sugar concentration range of 1–10 μm (7Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By maintaining the UDP-Glc at the more physiological concentration of 1000 μm (18Ramos A. Boels I.C. de Vos W.M. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and varying the UDP-GlcUA concentration, the rate of formation of oligosaccharide-lipids was found to be hyperbolic, whereas the corresponding values of polymer formation generated a concave curve at low concentrations of UDP-GlcUA (Fig. 1A). As the temperature was increased from 40 to 54 °C, the concavity of the rate curve for polymer formation was strikingly accentuated (Fig. 1B). The synthase was stable at these temperatures, and the Vmax at 54 °C was greater than twice that at 35 °C (data not shown). We previously suggested that these concave rate curves might be due to polysaccharide ejection from the carbohydrate acceptor binding site of the synthase (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), since the highest rates of ejection occur at low concentrations of UDP-GlcUA and high levels of UDP-Glc. However, a similar effect was observed when the concentration of UDP-Glc was reduced 10-fold (data not shown), and under these conditions, the rate of ejection would be greatly reduced. Likewise, ejection is relatively low under conditions of high UDP-GlcUA and low UDP-Glc (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but temperature enhancement of concavity was also observed when UDP-GlcUA was maintained at 1 mm while varying the UDP-Glc concentration (Fig. 1C). We therefore further explored the basis for this sigmoid-like behavior. At equimolar concentrations of the two UDP-sugars, polymer synthesis occurs subsequent to that of the oligosaccharide-lipid precursor, indicating a precursor-product relationship (7Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A time lag in the onset of polymer formation was also apparent at 35 °C in reactions containing 1000 μm UDP-Glc and 1.5 μm UDP-GlcUA, whereas the oligosaccharide-lipid began to accumulate immediately (Fig. 2A). Even if this lag were taken into account, the concavity shown in Fig. 1A would be only marginally reduced. At 45 °C and at a UDP-GlcUA concentration of 7.5 μm, which is well within the concave region of the 45 °C rate curve in Fig. 1B, there was only a slight lag in the initiation of polymer formation (Fig. 2B). Accentuation of the concave rate curves with increasing temperature as seen in Fig. 1B is therefore not explained by the time lag in polymer formation. Effect of UDP-sugar Concentrations on Oligosaccharide-lipid Formation—When S. pneumoniae membranes are incubated with labeled UDP-GlcUA in the absence of UDP-Glc, the reaction catalyzed by the type 3 synthase is completely nonprocessive and only a single glucuronosyl unit is transferred to the oligosaccharide-lipid. Digestion of this product with PLD yields a water-soluble product slightly larger than a disaccharide (presumably disaccharyl-glycerol) (6Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubation of the recombinant E. coli membranes in the presence of labeled UDP-GlcUA (1 μm) but in the absence of UDP-Glc similarly resulted in the addition of only a single glucuronosyl unit to the oligosaccharide-lipid. The PLD-digested product of this reaction eluted from DEAE-cellulose at the same ionic strength as a disaccharide Glc-β1,3-GlcUA standard (Fig. 3A, left). Increasing the concentration of UDP-Glc to 0.3 μm resulted in two additional oligosaccharide components that eluted at positions suggesting charges similar to the di- and triuronosyl standards (Fig. 3B, left). When both UDP-sugars were present at 1 μm, the major oligosaccharide corresponded to the charge of the triuronosyl elution position, and an additional minor peak corresponding to the expected charge of a tetrauronosyl constituent was also visible (Fig. 3C, left). At 1 mm UDP-Glc, the triuronosyl oligosaccharide was the predominant constituent, and a small but significant tetrauronosyl oligosaccharide was again evident (Fig. 3D, left). The single anionic product in reaction A (Fig. 3A, left) was resolved into two components by gel filtration on Biogel P-4 (Fig. 3A, right). Based on charge and size, the more rapidly migrating product appears to be glucuronosyl-glycerol, whereas the slower moving product appears to be consistent with GlcUA-Glc-glycerol. The mono-, di-, and triuronosyl components shown in Fig. 3, B and C (right), eluted from the Biogel P-4 column slightly later than the respective type 3 di-, tetra-, and hexasaccharide standards (Glc-GlcUA)n, which were previously characterized (14Campbell J.H. Pappenheimer A.M. Immunochemistry. 1966; 3: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These positions are consistent with the retention of glycerol at their reducing termini following PLD hydrolysis of the respective oligosaccharide-lipids, suggestive of the homologous series (GlcUA-Glc)n-glycerol.3 The oligosaccharides represented by the peaks in the right panel of Fig. 3D were synthesized at a very high concentration of UDP-Glc, and they appear to be slightly larger than their respective homologs in Fig. 3, B and C, which were synthesized at a 1000-fold lower concentration of UDP-Glc. Presumably, the products formed at the high UDP-Glc concentration would have Glc at their nonreducing termini, resulting in the formation of the alternate series, Glc-(GlcUA-Glc)n-glycerol. At the 1 μm UDP-Glc concentration, 5–10% of the incorporated label was in polymer, as demonstrated by gel filtration (Fig. 3C, right), indicating that a low percentage of the oligosaccharide-lipids had attained a size sufficient for recognition by the carbohydrate binding site and had been extended into a high molecular weight polysaccharide. At 1 mm UDP-Glc, ∼20% of the incorporated label was in polymer (Fig. 3D, right). When the concentration of UDP-Glc was maintained at 1 mm and UDP-GlcUA was increased to 5 μm, there was a dramatic shift from oligo-lipid formation to polymer formation, with 82% of the incorporation occurring in polymer (data not shown). Coincident to this shift was an increase in polymer size from ∼200 sugars at 1 μm UDP-GlcUA to ∼4000 sugars at 5 μm UDP-GlcUA. The rapid transition to polymer formation was comparable to that observed at equimolar concentrations of the UDP-sugars (7Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Jensen J.W. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48831-48839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Particularly significant under these conditions, as seen in the left and right panels of Fig. 3D, are the very prominent size of the triuronosyl oligosaccharide, a very small amount of a tetrauronosyl oligosaccharide, and then a very large gap lacking any larger intermediate size components prior to high molecular weight polysaccharide. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate binding site of the type 3 synthase requiring an approximate octasaccharide-(i.e. tetrauronosyl-)lipid primer for recognition and the ensuing highly processive polymer formation reaction. Effect of Temperature on the Transition from Oligosaccharide-lipid to Polymer Formation—In reactions containing 2 μm UDP-GlcUA and 1 mm UDP-Glc, incubation at 25 °C resulted in ∼50% of the incorporated label in polymer and 50% in oligosaccharides (Fig. 4A). At 45 °C, the formation of polymer was reduced to ∼15% (Fig. 4B), and only negligible polymer was synthesized in the 54 °C reaction (Fig. 4C). There was also a marked effect on the size profile of the oligosaccharides, with a steady reduction in size occurring with increasing temperature. Thus, binding of the oligosaccharide-lipid at the carbohydrate recognition site and the cooperativity of the series of reactions preceding the recognition step are quite sensitive to changes in temperature. Effect of Preformed Polysaccharide on the Rate of Polymer Formation— When the type 3 synthase contained preformed polysaccharide, the rate curves for polymer formation were no longer concave but were typically hyperbolic (compare Fig. 5 with Fig. 1B). These data clearly demonstrate that the cooperativity occurred either before or during the binding of the oligosaccharide-lipid primer to the carbohydrate binding site of the synthase. It should also be noted that polymer formation rates in Fig. 5 were greater at the higher temperature, as expected, and in contrast to Fig. 1B. In reactions conducted with 2.5 μm UDP-GlcUA and 1 mm UDP-Glc, the activity with enzyme preloaded with polysaccharide was linear for only a short duration, particularly at the higher temperature (Fig. 6). These data are in agreement with previous observations (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the rate of polymer ejection increases with increasing temperature and with decreasing UDP-GlcUA concentrations. These data also illustrate why the rate of polymer formation shown in Fig. 1B is lower at the higher temperature, which is contrary to the expected norm. When insufficient UDP-GlcUA is present to saturate the synthase, the percent of enzyme engaged in polymer synthesis decreases as the temperature increases. The high and low processive states of the synthase appear to exist in a reciprocal steady state, with polymer formation favored by higher UDP-GlcUA concentrations and lower temperature, although oligosaccharide-lipid formation is favored by lower nucleotide sugar levels and higher temperatures (see Fig. 8 and “Discussion”). In agreement with this, polymer formation with preloaded synthase was increasingly linear with time as the concentration of UDP-GlcUA was increased (data not shown). This is consistent with the decreased rate of ejection from S. pneumoniae membranes as the concentration of the conjugate UDP-sugar was increased (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As would be expected, the initial rate of oligosaccharide-lipid formation by preloaded membranes was greatly reduced as compared with polymer formation (compare Fig. 7 with Fig. 2).FIGURE 8Effect of the concentration of UDP-GlcUA and temperature on the steady state relationship of the biosynthetic modes of the type 3 synthase. The concentration of UDP-Glc is assumed to be much higher than that of UDP-GlcUA, as under normal biological conditions. The membrane-bound type 3 synthase initiates synthesis on a lipid acceptor (▵) and alternately adds Glc (•) and GlcUA (○). At low UDP-GlcUA concentrations or at higher temperatures, oligosaccharide-lipid continuously dissociates from the synthase and accumulates in the membrane. As the concentration of UDP-GlcUA increases a greater percentage of the enzyme transitions into a complex with the tetrauronosyl oligosaccharide-lipid, initiating the elaboration of high molecular weight polysaccharide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Time course of oligosaccharide-lipid and polymer formation with preloaded synthase at 45 °C. The reaction mixtures were identical to those in Fig. 6 and contained 2.5 μm UDP-GlcUA and 1 mm UDP-Glc. Following incubations for the indicated times, the products were analyzed for polymer (○) and oligosaccharide-lipid (•) by paper chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Carbohydrate acceptor binding sites are thought to play an important role in the biosynthesis of numerous polysaccharides, but very little data is available on this part of the assembly process. Type 3 synthase in S. pneumoniae membranes is tightly bound to preformed nascent polysaccharide chains (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under most conditions the polysaccharide chain remains tightly associated with the enzyme, and virtually no dissociation occurs during various experimental manipulations, including centrifugation, freezing, and thawing, and incubation at room temperature. These isolated complexes are able to catalyze the addition of Glc and GlcUA to extend the length of the preformed chains, indicating that the catalytic integrity has been maintained during the isolation. The type 3 synthase in recombinant E. coli, which is unable to synthesize polymer in vivo because it lacks UDP-GlcUA, can be obtained in a polysaccharide-free form and is ideal for studying the initiation of polymer synthesis. The first step in the assembly of type 3 polymer appears to be the transfer of glucose to phosphatidylglycerol to build up a pool of glucosylphosphatidylglycerol in the membrane, which serves as a readily available primer for polymer synthesis when adequate levels of the two nucleotide sugars, UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA, are provided (6Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second phase consists of the alternate addition of GlcUA and Glc to the oligosaccharyl-lipid primer, which initially is only loosely associated with the synthase and is free to dissociate from the enzyme. Here we showed that when UDP-sugar concentrations were low, the oligosaccharide-lipids failed to achieve a critical binding length and accumulated in the membrane. When successive transfers of GlcUA and Glc occurred with sufficient rapidity to produce an oligosaccharide of sufficient length for recognition (approximately four repeating disaccharides), the growing chain became tightly associated with the synthase. No product intermediate in size between an octasaccharide and high molecular weight polymer was observed, indicating that the nascent chain was rapidly extended by a highly processive reaction subsequent to binding. We previously reported on the tendency of the type 3 synthase to generate sigmoid-like kinetics at low concentrations of the nucleotide sugar substrates, but also noted that the enhanced rate of chain ejection under these same conditions complicated further evaluation (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The marked concavity observed here occurs in the absence of bound polysaccharide and is primarily related to an event(s) during the initial sequence of reactions leading to the binding of the oligosaccharide-lipid primer to the carbohydrate recognition site of the synthase. Sigmoid kinetic behavior is also displayed by hyaluronan synthase in Streptococcus pyogenes (19Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and indirect evidence of a possible conformational change in this enzyme in Streptococcus equisimilis has been presented (20Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baron C.A. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9234-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on these studies a “pendulum model” of chain elongation at the reducing end has been proposed in which two functional synthase domains would each contain a separate binding site for the two distinct UDP-sugars required for synthesis (21Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baron C.A. Gotschall R. Haque D. Canfield W.M. Wiegel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13012-13018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Another model has also been proposed to explain how a processive β-glycosyltransferase with only a single catalytic center could provide for the elaboration of a polysaccharide composed of alternating sugars (22Charnock S.J. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the last sugar residue added to the nonreducing end of the bound acceptor in the catalytic center might redefine the affinity of the site for the alternate nucleotide donor. We have previously noted that the type 3 synthase ejects any bound polysaccharide from the carbohydrate binding site when only one UDP-sugar is present, and this ejection is inhibited as the concentration of the second UDP-sugar increases (5Forsee W.T. Cartee R.T. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25972-25978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the available information concerning the complexity of these interactions is scant, the best evidence suggests that ejection of the polysaccharide occurs during an abortive attempt to translocate the chain. Of special interest were the ejection Km values of 0.004 and 880 μm for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-Glc, respectively, compared with their respective Ki values of 2 and 5 μm. These values indicate a marked change in affinity of the synthase for each of the UDP-sugars in reactions containing both nucleotides in contrast to reactions where only a single UDP-sugar is present. Because both the formation of oligosaccharide-lipid in reactions with membranes lacking preformed polysaccharide and polymer synthesis using membranes containing preformed polysaccharide demonstrated typical substrate concentration dependence, it is a reasonable assumption that the primary cooperativity in the overall reaction was manifest in a transitional event(s) linking these two reaction sequences. In particular, the buildup of the triuronosyl product as shown in Fig. 3D, indicates that a synergism supplied by increasing levels of UDP-GlcUA was necessary to provide the momentum enabling the synthase to transition into the highly processive tetrauronosyl primer-enzyme complex. Additional evidence that the primary catalytic barrier is situated at this point in the overall reaction sequence is provided in Fig. 4B, which shows that a moderate reduction in the level of the triuronosyl oligosaccharide due to increasing the temperature to 45 °C was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in polysaccharide synthesis. It would also appear that the heightened concavity in polymer formation observed at the higher temperatures reflected, at least in part, the cooperative action of an elevated nucleotide-sugar level required to counter the temperature-induced higher rate of dissociation of oligosaccharide-lipid from the synthase. The polymer formation rate curves presented here represent a composite of a series of reactions and do not lend themselves to standard kinetic analysis. If the transition step could be studied in isolation from the hyperbolic reactions on either side, it can be speculated that purely sigmoid kinetics would be observed that could be further analyzed. Based on the current knowledge of the biosynthesis of type 3 polysaccharide, the most probable explanation of these results may be a conformational change in the synthase. Because the type 3 synthase and related β-glycosyltransferases are known to simultaneously transport their polysaccharides during synthesis, the initiation of polymerization by the type 3 synthase may involve a reorientation of the growing oligosaccharide and possibly the transport of the lipid anchor from the inner to the outer membrane leaflet. Here, it serves as an anchor for the capsule following ejection of the completed chain from the enzyme catalytic site (6Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The transition event is also thought to lock the oligosaccharide-lipid in a tight binding complex with the synthase, whereupon the highly processive polymerization phase ensues. In theory, the addition of each sugar would now fine tune the affinity of the binding site for the appropriate nucleotide sugar to donate the succeeding glycosidic addition (22Charnock S.J. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), providing for a stable alternating catalytic center enabling the repetitive addition of Glc and GlcUA to the growing polymer. Just how the synthase provides for the integrity of glycosidic addition in the initial reaction sequence to produce the oligosaccharide-lipid is less apparent. The processive nature of the initial reaction sequence indicates at least a transient association of the oligosaccharide-lipid with the synthase that presumably provides for the appropriate sugar addition. However, prior to the addition of the first sugar residue, there would be no apparent way to provide for catalytic specificity. This may explain the unusual ability of the type 3 synthase to utilize phosphatidylglycerol as an acceptor both for Glc (6Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Yother J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and also for GlcUA to form the smaller GlcUA-lipid product in Fig. 3A, right. This latter product appeared primarily in the absence of UDP-Glc and may not occur in vivo at greatly elevated levels of UDP-Glc. In the absence of a bound oligosaccharide substrate to act as a cofactor, the synthase demonstrates a decreased fidelity in recognizing the appropriate acceptor substrate. It is significant that polymer formation rate curves were concave as a function of the concentrations of both UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA and that the concavity of both of these curves was thermally enhanced. This suggests a possible chain of protein-mediated catalytic events initiating at the nucleotide-sugar binding site and translated through the carbohydrate binding site to modulate binding, translocation, and ejection of the elongating polysaccharide chain, resulting in a steady state equilibrium among the various modes of synthase activity, as depicted in Fig. 8. The presence of high concentrations of UDP-GlcUA or low temperature favors a steady state with a high proportion of the synthase in the polymer-forming, highly processive state. At lower concentrations of UDP-GlcUA or higher temperatures, the steady state concentration of synthase in the polymer-forming mode is reduced because of an increased rate of ejection of polysaccharide from the carbohydrate binding site. In the latter case, there is also an increased rate of dissociation of the oligosaccharide-lipid from the synthase resulting in the accumulation of oligosaccharide-lipid consisting of mostly three or less repeating disaccharides. It is through this intricate sequence of interactions that slight fluctuations in the concentration of UDP-GlcUA are able to modulate the chain length of type 3 polymer over a large range. The size of the polymer is a function of both the rate of the polymerization reaction, and the length of time the growing chain remains bound to the synthase. Both of these parameters behave in a convex curvilinear manner with respect to the concentration of UDP-GlcUA, providing for a large increase in polymer size with only a minimal increase in UDP-GlcUA.3"
