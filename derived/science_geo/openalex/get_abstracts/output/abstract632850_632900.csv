https://openalex.org/W2944664266,"Current machine learning techniques enable robust association of biological signals with measured phenotypes, but these approaches are incapable of identifying causal relationships. Here, we develop an integrated ""white-box"" biochemical screening, network modeling, and machine learning approach for revealing causal mechanisms and apply this approach to understanding antibiotic efficacy. We counter-screen diverse metabolites against bactericidal antibiotics in Escherichia coli and simulate their corresponding metabolic states using a genome-scale metabolic network model. Regression of the measured screening data on model simulations reveals that purine biosynthesis participates in antibiotic lethality, which we validate experimentally. We show that antibiotic-induced adenine limitation increases ATP demand, which elevates central carbon metabolism activity and oxygen consumption, enhancing the killing effects of antibiotics. This work demonstrates how prospective network modeling can couple with machine learning to identify complex causal mechanisms underlying drug efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2944581648,"To decipher dynamic brain information processing, current genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are limited in single action potential (AP) detection speed, combinatorial spectral compatibility, and two-photon imaging depth. To address this, here, we rationally engineered a next-generation quadricolor GECI suite, XCaMPs. Single AP detection was achieved within 3-10 ms of spike onset, enabling measurements of fast-spike trains in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the barrel cortex in vivo and recording three distinct (two inhibitory and one excitatory) ensembles during pre-motion activity in freely moving mice. In vivo paired recording of pre- and postsynaptic firing revealed spatiotemporal constraints of dendritic inhibition in layer 1 in vivo, between axons of somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons and apical tufts dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Finally, non-invasive, subcortical imaging using red XCaMP-R uncovered somatosensation-evoked persistent activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Thus, the XCaMPs offer a critical enhancement of solution space in studies of complex neuronal circuit dynamics. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2944634466,"The liver can substantially regenerate after injury, with both main epithelial cell types, hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), playing important roles in parenchymal regeneration. Beyond metabolic functions, BECs exhibit substantial plasticity and in some contexts can drive hepatic repopulation. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to examine BEC and hepatocyte heterogeneity during homeostasis and after injury. Instead of evidence for a transcriptionally defined progenitor-like BEC cell, we found significant homeostatic BEC heterogeneity that reflects fluctuating activation of a YAP-dependent program. This transcriptional signature defines a dynamic cellular state during homeostasis and is highly responsive to injury. YAP signaling is induced by physiological bile acids (BAs), required for BEC survival in response to BA exposure, and is necessary for hepatocyte reprogramming into biliary progenitors upon injury. Together, these findings uncover molecular heterogeneity within the ductal epithelium and reveal YAP as a protective rheostat and regenerative regulator in the mammalian liver."

Our results suggest that coupling specificity is determined by one or more transient intermediate states that serve as selectivity filters and precede the formation of the stable nucleotide-free GPCR-G protein complexes observed in crystal and cryo-EM structures. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors and modify cellular behavior by activating heterotrimeric G proteins (Lefkowitz, 2007Lefkowitz R.J. Seven transmembrane receptors: something old, something new.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2007; 190: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and the Gα subunit contains a nucleotide-binding pocket between Ras-like and α-helical domains (Figure 1A) (Preininger et al., 2013Preininger A.M. Meiler J. Hamm H.E. Conformational flexibility and structural dynamics in GPCR-mediated G protein activation: a perspective.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, the Gα subunit is bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and forms a heterotrimer with Gβγ subunits. Upon agonist activation, the GPCR triggers GDP release, and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binds. The GTP-bound Gα subunit dissociates from both the receptor and Gβγ subunits to activate downstream signaling pathways. GPCRs generally couple primarily to one of three major G protein subfamilies: Gs, Gi/o, and Gq/11. The structural basis of GPCR-mediated G protein activation has been of great interest. The β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs (β2AR-Gs) X-ray crystal structure, the first X-ray crystal structure of a GPCR-G protein complex, revealed the GPCR-Gs interfaces and conformational changes upon complex formation (Rasmussen et al., 2011Rasmussen S.G.

Subsequently, a X-ray crystal structure of the adenosine A2A receptor in complex with an engineered Gs (A2A-miniGs), and single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of calcitonin receptor-Gs (CT-Gs), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor-Gs (GLP1R-Gs), μ opioid receptor-Gi (μOR-Gi), adenosine A1A receptor-Gi (A1A-Gi), serotonin 5HT1B receptor-Gi (5HT1B-Gi), and rhodopsin-Gi complexes have been determined with similar GPCR-G protein interfaces (Carpenter et al., 2016Carpenter B.

These structures provide snap-shots of stable nucleotide-free GPCR-G protein complexes; however, they cannot identify the temporal sequence of coupling events nor do they fully explain the structural basis for coupling specificity, that is, why a particular GPCR prefers a specific G protein isoform. A comparison of the structures of the inactive-state β2AR and the nucleotide-free β2AR-Gs complex reveal structural changes at the receptor-Gs interfaces (Figure 1B): intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) forms an α-helix; the N terminus of ICL3 forms an α-helix as an extension of transmembrane domain 5 (TM5); and TM6 moves outward. The ICL2, especially F139, of the β2AR engages the hydrophobic pocket formed by the αN/β1 hinge, β2/β3 loop, and F376 at α5 helix of Gαs (Figures 1C and 1D, green), while the outward movement of TM6 provides a space in the cytosolic core of the β2AR formed by ICL2 and TMs 3, 5, and 6, in which the C terminus of Gαs can insert (Figures 1C and 1D, red). Understanding the timing and orchestration of these interactions may be key to understand coupling selectivity and the functional activation path. The distance between the GPCR-G protein interface and the GDP-binding pocket is ∼30 Å (Figure 1A), and therefore receptor-mediated GDP release is accomplished by allosteric conformational changes mediated by structural links between the GPCR-G protein interface (Figure 1D, green and red) and the nucleotide-binding pocket (Figure 1D, blue). The C terminus of Gα (the α5 helix) links the guanine pocket TCAT motif in the β6/α5 loop with the cytosolic core of the receptor and undergoes the largest conformational change in the Ras-like domain of Gα upon coupling to the receptor (Figures 1C and 1D). The αN/β1 hinge and β1 strand at the amino terminus of the Ras-like domain links ICL2 with the P loop that binds the diphosphate of GDP (Figures 1C and 1D). Much has been learned about the detailed structural features and conformational dynamics of these two allosteric pathways using a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and computational approaches on different GPCR-G protein pairs (Alexander et al., 2014Alexander N.S.

Nevertheless, understanding the temporal sequence of these substantial conformational changes during GPCR-mediated G protein activation are likely to provide additional insights into GPCR-G protein coupling selectivity (Preininger et al., 2013Preininger A.M.

In the present study, we employed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and hydroxyl radical mediated protein footprinting with mass spectrometry (HRF-MS) (Figure S1A) in a time-resolved manner to investigate the sequence of events during GPCR-mediated GDP release. HDX-MS and HRF-MS have been proven to be useful complementary techniques to investigate the conformational dynamics of proteins (Bavro et al., 2015Bavro V.N. Gupta S. Ralston C.

Both techniques provide information on changes in structure and/or solvent interactions of proteins; HDX-MS probes the exchange between amide hydrogen in the peptide backbone and deuterium in the solvent and is governed by both the stability of the secondary structure elements and the overall tertiary and quaternary conformations. HRF-MS probes the solvent accessibility of side chains of proteins to hydroxyl radicals (generated by radiolysis) derived from bulk or ordered water (Konermann et al., 2008Konermann L. Tong X. Pan Y.

Complementary structural mass spectrometry techniques reveal local dynamics in functionally important regions of a metastable serpin.Structure. 2008; 16: 38-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). HDX-MS can productively monitor the dynamics of protein secondary structures as these backbone amide hydrogens are involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds in protein secondary structures; the amide hydrogens within structured regions (e.g., α-helix or β strand) are labeled more slowly than more flexible regions. HRF-MS provides a readout of changes in local solvent structure in a region of interest irrespective of secondary structure per se; residues in close proximity to bulk or ordered water are labeled with a radiolytically derived OH⋅ radical, providing a covalent reporter for both changes in structure and association with or exposure to solvent. These techniques are quite complementary as HDX-MS provides data on structural changes at the second to minute timescale (on the backbone) whereas HRF-MS can provide residue-level solvent accessibility data on timescales from milliseconds to seconds. There are two different labeling approaches when employing either HDX-MS or HRF-MS. Continuous labeling studies (exposure to deuterated buffer or X-rays for a certain period of time) simply compares two or more different states of proteins (Figure S1B) (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K.

Conformational dynamics of activation for the pentameric complex of dimeric G protein-coupled receptor and heterotrimeric G protein.Structure. 2012; 20: 826-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), while pulse-labeling (i.e., time-resolved) studies monitor the sequential events of conformational changes (Figure S1C) (Konermann and Simmons, 2003Konermann L. Simmons D.A. Protein-folding kinetics and mechanisms studied by pulse-labeling and mass spectrometry.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the pulse-labeling study, the conformational changes of a protein are triggered (i.e., the addition of an agonist-activated GPCR to GDP-bound G protein), and the sequential events are detected by performing a brief deuterium or X-ray pulse with samples recovered at various time points post initiation (and quenched) to capture conformational changes as a function of time. While HDX-MS is challenging for monitoring conformational changes at the millisecond timescales available to HRF-MS, it is complementary, monitoring the dynamics of secondary structural elements at later time points (i.e., seconds to minutes). In this study, we used the Gαsβ1γ2 heterotrimer (Gs) as a model G protein and the β2AR and the A2A as model GPCRs and analyzed them via HDX-MS and HRF-MS. The β2AR-Gs complex is well-characterized by X-ray crystallography (Rasmussen et al., 2011Rasmussen S.G. DeVree B.T. Zou Y. Kruse A.C. Chung K.Y. Kobilka T.S. Thian F.S. Chae P.S. Pardon E. Calinski D. et al.Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar) and continuous labeling HDX-MS (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K. Conformational changes in the G protein Gs induced by the β2 adrenergic receptor.Nature. 2011; 477: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), allowing easier interpretation of the pulse-labeling HDX-MS data. The A2A is another well-known Gs-coupled receptor, and the X-ray crystal structure with engineered Gαs has been recently reported (Carpenter et al., 2016Carpenter B. Nehmé R. Warne T. Leslie A.G. Tate C.G. Structure of the adenosine A(2A) receptor bound to an engineered G protein.Nature. 2016; 536: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The β2AR and the A2A belong to the class A GPCRs, and therefore, studying the β2AR and the A2A can be expected to elucidate the general Gs-coupling mechanism of the class A GPCRs. We observe conformational changes by HRF-MS at the C-terminal end of the α5 helix, followed by coordinated changes in the proximal α5 helix and the β3 strand that would likely alter the GDP-binding pocket, leading to GDP release. Of interest, based upon the HDX studies presented here, the conformational changes at the C-terminal end of the α5 helix, that are expected based on crystal and cryo-EM structures, do not occur until long after GDP release. These results suggest that the first complex formed by Gs and the β2AR or by Gs and the A2A differ from their respective crystal structures, yet may be responsible for GDP release and coupling specificity. In a companion manuscript, we present the crystal structure revealing an alternate interaction between the β2AR and the α5 helix of Gs, along with functional evidence that this interaction is important for GDP release (Liu et al., 2019Liu X. Xu X. Hilger D. Aschauer P. Tiemann J.K.S. Du Y. Liu H. Hirata K. Sun X. Guixá González R. et al.Structural insights into the process of GPCR-G protein complex formation.Cell. 2019; 177 (this issue): 1243-1251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). Prior to investigating the time-resolved conformational changes upon GPCR-Gs coupling, we examined the stably formed, nucleotide-free β2AR-Gs and A2A-Gs complexes by continuous labeling HDX-MS (Figure S1B) to determine the shortest D2O pulse duration that could detect a difference between the GPCR-Gs complex and the individual proteins. Moreover, we wanted to determine if the A2A-Gs complex formation leads to changes in Gαs that are similar to those observed in the β2AR-Gs complex (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K. Conformational changes in the G protein Gs induced by the β2 adrenergic receptor.Nature. 2011; 477: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A stable nucleotide-free A2A-Gs complex was formed under conditions previously used to study the β2AR-Gs complex (Figure S2) (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K.

Calinski D. et al.Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). This involved incubation of GPCR and Gs for 90 min followed by the addition of apyrase to hydrolyze released GDP and incubation for an additional 90 min. The GDP-bound Gs or the A2A-Gs complex were incubated in the D2O buffer for 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 s at room temperature, and the HDX levels were analyzed. The HDX changes in Gαs upon forming a complex with the A2A (Figure S3A) are similar to those we previously observed with the β2AR-Gs complex (Figure S3B) (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K. Conformational changes in the G protein Gs induced by the β2 adrenergic receptor.Nature. 2011; 477: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar); the differences between Figures S3A and S3B are likely due to different peptic peptides generated by different pepsin columns and the use of different LC-MS systems to analyze the peptides (Figure S3, legend).Figure S3Continuous Labeling HDX-MS Analysis of Gαs before and after Interaction with the A2A and the β2AR before and after Interaction with Gs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Deuterium uptake profile changes of Gαs upon interaction with the A2A were color-coded onto the Ras-like domain of the X-ray crystal structure of Gαs (PDB: 3SN6): white indicates no MS data were obtained; light orange indicates no HDX change upon complex formation; blue indicates decreased HDX upon complex formation; and red indicates increased HDX upon complex formation. Detailed deuterium uptake levels of selected peptides are shown as uptake plots, which were generated by three independent experiments. Error bars represent the SEM ∗p < 0.05.(B) Deuterium uptake profile changes of Gαs upon interaction with the β2AR were color-coded onto the Ras-like domain of the X-ray crystal structure of Gαs (PDB: 3SN6): color codes are same as (A). Data are reproduced from (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y. Rasmussen S.G. Liu T. Li S. DeVree B.T. Chae P.S. Calinski D. Kobilka B.K. Woods Jr., V.L. Sunahara R.K. Conformational changes in the G protein Gs induced by the β2 adrenergic receptor.Nature. 2011; 477: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It should be noted that there are differences in a few regions between (A) and (B), probably due to different peptic peptides analyzed because of the different pepsin column and LC-MS system used. For example, a peptide from αN was detected in the present work but no peptide from αN was identified in the previous study. No peptide from β1 was identified in the current work while a peptide from β1 was detected in the previous study. β6 shows no change in the current study while it showed higher HDX in the complex in the previous study, which is probably due to different peptides analyzed (i.e., the peptide from the current study does not contain β6/α5 loop while the peptide from the previous study contain β6/α5 loop). The α4 region showed higher HDX in the complex in the current study while it showed no change in the previous study, which might be due to the fact that different receptors interact with G proteins slightly differently, possibly due to differences in the length of ICL3.

It should be noted that there are differences in a few regions between (A) and (B), probably due to different peptic peptides analyzed because of the different pepsin column and LC-MS system used.

Detailed deuterium uptake levels of selected peptides are shown as uptake plots, which were generated by three independent experiments. Error bars represent the SEM ∗p < 0.05. To complement HDX-MS data on Gs, we sought to monitor HDX changes in the β2AR and the A2A. In the previous continuous labeling HDX-MS study with β2AR-Gs, the sequence coverage of the β2AR was ∼12%, and we could not obtain significant conformational information (Chung et al., 2011Chung K.Y.

In the present study, we were able to observe HDX data for ∼65% of the β2AR with majority of cytoplasmic regions covered except for the C-terminal part of ICL3 and the TM7/H8 hinge (Figure S3C). With continuous labeling HDX-MS, ICL2 and ICL3 of the β2AR showed decreased HDX upon interaction with Gs (Figure S3C) reflecting α-helix formation after interaction with Gs (Figure 1B). TM4 underwent a slight increase in HDX, while helix 8 (H8) showed a slight decrease in HDX upon interaction with Gs (Figure S3C).

In contrast to organs with high rates of cell turnover that harbor constitutively active tissue stem cell niches, the liver utilizes facultative stem cells that contribute to regeneration on demand (Miyajima et al., 2014Miyajima A.

BECs form the bile ducts responsible for bile excretion as well as peripheral ductules and canals of Hering, where bile is collected. Upon injury, activated BECs expand around the portal vein, forming a transient luminal epithelium and establishing an auxiliary biliary system in a process referred to as a ductular reaction (DR) (Kamimoto et al., 2016Kamimoto K.

In addition to their ability to form auxiliary ducts draining hepatotoxic bile, BECs can also differentiate into functional hepatocytes to support liver regeneration and are therefore considered facultative liver stem cells (Deng et al., 2018Deng X.

Despite the physiological relevance, the mechanisms regulating BEC activation and expansion for establishing a DR are incompletely understood. BEC-like organoids (BEC-organoids) expand in vitro with a luminal epithelium and have a BEC signature, similar to BECs forming ductular structures during a DR, and are derived from LGR5+ liver cells that appear following injury (Hu et al., 2018Hu H.

Lgr5 was initially identified as a WNT/β-catenin target gene and marker of highly proliferative intestinal stem cells (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3966) Google Scholar) and is expressed in several tissue stem cell niches that require R-Spondin (RSPO)-LGR4/5-mediated WNT/β-catenin signaling for organ homeostasis and repair (Clevers et al., 2014Clevers H. Loh K.M. Nusse R. Stem cell signaling. An integral program for tissue renewal and regeneration: Wnt signaling and stem cell control.Science. 2014; 346: 1248012Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In a healthy liver, LGR5 marks quiescent pericentral hepatocytes with high WNT/β-catenin activity (Planas-Paz et al., 2016Planas-Paz L. Orsini V. Boulter L. Calabrese D. Pikiolek M. Nigsch F. Xie Y. Roma G. Donovan A. Marti P. et al.The RSPO-LGR4/5-ZNRF3/RNF43 module controls liver zonation and size.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A key question pertains to the elusive identity and role of periportal organoid-initiating LGR5+ putative liver stem cells that appear during a DR (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Dorrell C. Boj S.F. van Es J.H. Li V.S. van de Wetering M. Sato T. Hamer K. Sasaki N. Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and the contribution of RSPO-LGR4/5-mediated WNT/β-catenin signaling to this process. We performed a CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function (LOF) screen in mouse BEC-organoids to identify signaling pathways regulating BEC expansion in vitro. Moreover, we validated the requirement of these pathways in vivo using several DR-inducing liver damage models. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of EPCAM+ BECs, WNT/β-catenin reporter mice, lineage tracing, and in situ hybridization (ISH), we further provide single-cell and spatial resolution of the mechanisms regulating a DR. Finally, we clarify the cellular identity and role of periportal LGR5+ cells. The most prevalent mechanism that establishes a DR is the expansion of BECs (Kamimoto et al., 2016Kamimoto K. Kaneko K. Kok C.Y. Okada H. Miyajima A. Itoh T. Heterogeneity and stochastic growth regulation of biliary epithelial cells dictate dynamic epithelial tissue remodeling.eLife. 2016; 5: e15034Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To identify pathways regulating BEC-organoid growth and formation, we performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9-based LOF screen in BEC-organoids generated from livers of mice expressing Cas9 from the Rosa26 locus (R26-SpCas9 mice) (Figure 1A). These BEC-organoids were EPCAM+/SOX9+ with a similar biliary gene signature as previously described BEC-organoids isolated from LGR5+ mouse liver cells (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Dorrell C. Boj S.F. van Es J.H. Li V.S. van de Wetering M. Sato T. Hamer K. Sasaki N. Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) or EPCAM+ human liver cells (Huch et al., 2015Huch M. Gehart H. van Boxtel R. Hamer K. Blokzijl F. Verstegen M.M. Ellis E. van Wenum M. Fuchs S.A. de Ligt J. et al.Long-term culture of genome-stable bipotent stem cells from adult human liver.Cell. 2015; 160: 299-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar; Figures S1A and S1B). We achieved effective lentiviral delivery to R26-SpCas9 BEC-organoids stably expressing Cas9 (Figures S1C and S1D) and high Cas9 editing efficiency (98%) (Figure 1B). A take rate screen using a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) library with over 50 million unique non-targeting barcode sequences indicated a loss of library representation in BEC-organoids expanded over time (Figure S1E), suggesting that only a fraction of dissociated BEC-organoid cells generate new organoids. We then designed a DNA-barcoded curated custom-pooled lentivirus CRISPR library containing, on average, 5 gRNAs per gene against 192 genes hypothesized to be involved in liver regeneration (genes involved in liver development, cell cycle, liver cancer, and tissue homeostasis were included; Table S1) as well as positive (core essential genes) and negative (olfactory genes and non-targeting gRNAs) controls. We empirically determined the gRNA representation required for reproducible pooled screening results by comparing the reproducibility of gRNA counts for a subset of the CRISPR screening library consisting of 51 genes (255 gRNAs), suggesting that 10,000 cells per gRNA are required to compensate for the stochastic loss of BEC-organoid cells during splitting steps (Figure 1C). The CRISPR library was therefore delivered to R26-SpCas9 BEC-organoid single cells at a representation of 10,000 cells per gRNA, and gRNA-transduced BEC-organoids were subjected to barcode sequencing after 12 days in culture (Figure 1A). Barcodes that were under- or over-represented corresponded to genes that enhanced or repressed BEC-organoid growth, respectively (Figure 1D). All gRNAs were represented in all next generation sequencing (NGS) samples, with slightly lower counts in day 12 samples compared with the total library because of strongly reduced counts for core essential control genes (e.g., Copa, Spc25, Eif3a, Plk1, Prpf8, and Gtpbp4) reported to be required for cell fitness and proliferation (Hart et al., 2015Hart T.

Under-representation of gRNAs targeting the transcription factors Sox9 and Hnf1β indicates that they are not only required for biliary differentiation during development (Lemaigre, 2009Lemaigre F.P. Mechanisms of liver development: concepts for understanding liver disorders and design of novel therapies.Gastroenterology. 2009; 137: 62-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) but also required for BEC-organoid growth in vitro. In contrast, common BEC markers, such as Krt7, Epcam, Cd24a, Prom1 and Aqp1, did not affect BEC-organoid growth. Yap1, a key mediator of hepatocyte growth and an oncogene in cholangiocarcinoma (Camargo et al., 2007Camargo F.D. Gokhale S. Johnnidis J.B. Fu D. Bell G.W. Jaenisch R. Brummelkamp T.R.

Moreover, gRNAs targeting β-catenin were under-represented, although not significantly, because of variability between the different gRNAs. Several gRNAs targeting components of the Hippo complex (Piccolo et al., 2014Piccolo S. Dupont S. Cordenonsi M. The biology of YAP/TAZ: hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol.

SAV1 mutations have also been observed in cholangiocarcinoma patients (Sia et al., 2013Sia D. Hoshida Y. Villanueva A. Roayaie S. Ferrer J. Tabak B. Peix J. Sole M. Tovar V.

Interestingly, RNF43 mutations have also been found in human cholangiocarcinoma (Ong et al., 2012Ong C.K. Subimerb C. Pairojkul C. Wongkham S. Cutcutache I. Yu W. McPherson J.R. Allen G.E. Ng C.C.

A genetic screen reveals Foxa3 and TNFR1 as key regulators of liver repopulation.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were both identified as negative regulators of hepatocyte regrowth in vivo, only Map2k4 deletion promoted BEC-organoid growth. High reproducibility of the CRISPR screen (R = 0.949) with a false negative hit rate of 5% and a false positive hit rate of 0% suggest a strong level of confidence in identified hits (Figures S2E–S2G). In summary, our CRISPR LOF screen highlights WNT/β-catenin, mTORC1, and YAP signaling as well as other key pathways regulating BEC-organoid expansion in vitro. To assess the translatability of pathways controlling BEC-organoid growth to the regulation of BEC expansion during a DR, we used 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet, bile duct ligation (BDL), and choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet, which all induce a DR via different mechanisms and, hence, allow study of this process in vivo (Fickert et al., 2007Fickert P.

First, C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice were treated with either the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (Faivre et al., 2006Faivre S. Kroemer G. Raymond E. Current development of mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 671-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) or a vehicle control and subjected to 16 days of DDC diet. Reduced phospho-S6 levels in CK19+ cells within a DR indicated mTORC1 inhibition in BECs (Figures S3A and S3B). Although vehicle-treated mice showed a substantial DR, indicated by an increase in the BEC markers CK19 and SOX9, inhibition of mTORC1 reduced the numbers of CK19+/SOX9+ BECs in response to 16 days of DDC diet (Figures S3C and S3D). Impaired proliferation of CK19+ BECs during the DDC-induced DR suggests that mTORC1 is important to promote BEC proliferation (Figures S3E and S3F). An attenuated DR in RAD001-treated mice following 14 days of BDL or 13 days of CDE diet further confirmed that mTORC1 contributes to DR formation (Figures S3C and S3D). Although RAD001-treated mice showed a similar bilirubin elevation following DDC, CDE damage did not increase bilirubin levels in these mice to the extent seen in vehicle-treated mice (Figure S3G). However, a comparable increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), body weight loss, and viability following DDC, BDL, and CDE suggest that the reduced DR in RAD001-treated mice is not due to increased RAD001-mediated hepatoprotective mechanisms (Figures S3G and S3H). Although ectopic YAP signaling in hepatocytes has been shown to dedifferentiate hepatocytes into BEC-like progenitor cells (Yimlamai et al., 2014Yimlamai D. Christodoulou C. Galli G.G. Yanger K. Pepe-Mooney B. Gurung B. Shrestha K. Cahan P. Stanger B.Z. Camargo F.D. Hippo pathway activity influences liver cell fate.Cell. 2014; 157: 1324-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), it is not known whether the YAP-Hippo pathway controls a DR by promoting BEC expansion or hepatocyte dedifferentiation. YAP deletion in BEC-organoids derived from floxed YAP mice infected with Adeno-Cre (Ad-Cre) reduced organoid formation and growth, confirming that YAP is important for BEC expansion in vitro (Figures S4A–S4C). We next crossed floxed YAP mice with albumin (Alb)-Cre mice to generate YapDEL mice with YAP1 deletion in both hepatocytes and BECs (Figure S4D) and subjected these mice as well as littermate controls to DDC diet. ISH for the YAP target genes Cyr61 and Ctgf revealed YAP pathway activation in CK19+ BECs and periportal hepatocytes during DDC-induced DR, suggesting a role of YAP in controlling this process and confirming loss of YAP signaling in most EPCAM+ BECs and hepatocytes in YapDEL mice (Figures 2A–2D). YapDEL mice showed a significantly smaller increase in CK19+/SOX9+ BECs compared with control littermates following 14 days of DDC diet, an effect that was even more pronounced after 6 weeks of DDC diet (Figures 2E and 2F). This suggests progressing severity of the DR impairment during prolonged DDC diet feeding in YapDEL mice, similar to what was observed in response to BDL (Bai et al., 2012Bai H. Zhang N. Xu Y. Chen Q. Khan M. Potter J.J. Nayar S.K. Cornish T. Alpini G. Bronk S. et al.Yes-associated protein regulates the hepatic response after bile duct ligation.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 1097-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We next assessed whether YAP is required for SOX9 induction in hepatocytes, which mediates hepatocyte-to-BEC conversion (Tanimizu et al., 2014Tanimizu N. Nishikawa Y. Ichinohe N. Akiyama H. Mitaka T. Sry HMG box protein 9-positive (Sox9+) epithelial cell adhesion molecule-negative (EpCAM-) biphenotypic cells derived from hepatocytes are involved in mouse liver regeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7589-7598Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Increasing numbers of Ctgf-expressing periportal hepatocytes in DDC-treated compared with naive mice indicates activation of YAP signaling in response to injury (Figures 2A and 2B). Although control mice showed a substantial increase in SOX9+ periportal hepatocytes 14 days or 6 weeks post-DDC damage, YapDEL mice did not show an increase (Figures 2E and 2G). Moreover, YapDEL mice exhibited significantly less Ki67+/CK19+ BECs in response to 14 days or 6 weeks of DDC diet compared with control mice (Figures 2H and 2I), indicating that YAP deletion reduced BEC expansion by attenuating their proliferative potential. In addition, YapDEL mice with 6 weeks of DDC diet feeding showed increased apoptosis in CK19+ cells compared with controls (Figures 2J and 2K). In YapDEL mice after 6 weeks of DDC diet, 38% of all portal tracts, identified by absence of the pericentral hepatocyte marker glutamine synthetase (GS), lacked CK19+ bile ducts, similar to patients with vanishing bile duct syndrome (Desmet, 1997Desmet V.J. Vanishing bile duct syndrome in drug-induced liver disease.J. Hepatol. 1997; 26: 31-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Figures 2L, 2M, and S4G). Staining for additional bile duct markers (PanCK and dolichos biflorus agglutinin [DBA]) confirmed this finding, which was less evident in portal tracts of naive YapDEL mice (1.4%) and after 14 days of DDC diet (3.9%), whereas control mice in all treatment groups were unaffected (Figures S4E–S4G). Hepatocyte damage was assessed using cleaved caspase-3 staining because YAP transcriptionally regulates the expression of transaminases (Yang et al., 2018Yang C.S. Stampouloglou E. Kingston N.M. Zhang L. Monti S. Varelas X. Glutamine-utilizing transaminases are a metabolic vulnerability of TAZ/YAP-activated cancer cells.EMBO Rep. 2018; 19 (e43577)Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which would bias serum ALT and AST levels in YapDEL mice. Comparable numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes in YapDEL and control mice following 14 days or 6 weeks of DDC diet suggest that different hepatocyte damage did not account for the reduced DR in these mice (Figures S4H and S4I). Although we did not detect significant hepatocyte damage or a bilirubin increase in naive YapDEL mice (Figures S4H–S4J), it is possible that occasional bile duct loss induced the increased numbers of SOX9+ hepatocytes in these mice (Figures 2E and 2G), which may represent hepatocytes that escaped YAP deletion and showed YAP signaling (Figures S4D and 2A–2B). Although the bilirubin levels were comparable in naive YapDEL and control mice, they were largely increased in YapDEL mice with DDC damage and accompanied by higher body weight loss and reduced viability during 6 weeks of DDC damage (Figures S4J and S4K). Moreover, YapDEL mice deteriorated rapidly and died prematurely on the CDE diet, preventing DR assessment but further indicating the importance of YAP signaling to alleviate and repair liver injury (Figure S4L). Although mTORC1 inhibition attenuated YAP signaling during the DR (Figures S3I and S3J), residual YAP activity and pleiotropic effects of mTORC1 blockade (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6166) Google Scholar) might explain the less dramatic phenotype in RAD001-treated mice compared with YapDEL mice in response to liver damage. Together, this suggests that YAP is an important mediator of the DR and restoration of the biliary system, especially following prolonged damage.

Unfortunately, the β2AR-Gsempty complex does not provide a clear explanation for G protein coupling specificity. Evidence from several sources suggests the existence of a transient complex between the β2AR and GDP-bound Gs protein (β2AR-GsGDP) that may represent an intermediate on the way to the formation of β2AR-Gsempty and may contribute to coupling specificity. Here we present a structure of the β2AR in complex with the carboxyl terminal 14 amino acids from Gαs along with the structure of the GDP-bound Gs heterotrimer. These structures provide evidence for an alternate interaction between the β2AR and Gs that may represent an intermediate that contributes to Gs coupling specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2943983020,"Mitochondrial calcium uptake is crucial to the regulation of eukaryotic Ca2+ homeostasis and is mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). While MCU alone can transport Ca2+ in primitive eukaryotes, metazoans require an essential single membrane-spanning auxiliary component called EMRE to form functional channels; however, the molecular mechanism of EMRE regulation remains elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the human MCU-EMRE complex, which defines the interactions between MCU and EMRE as well as pinpoints the juxtamembrane loop of MCU and extended linker of EMRE as the crucial elements in the EMRE-dependent gating mechanism among metazoan MCUs. The structure also features the dimerization of two MCU-EMRE complexes along an interface at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of human MCU that is a hotspot for post-translational modifications. Thus, the human MCU-EMRE complex, which constitutes the minimal channel components among metazoans, provides a framework for future mechanistic studies on MCU."
https://openalex.org/W2944578833,"Under-connectivity between cerebral cortical association areas may underlie cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders, including the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). Using the LgDel 22q11DS mouse model, we assessed cellular, molecular, and developmental origins of under-connectivity and its consequences for cognitive function. Diminished 22q11 gene dosage reduces long-distance projections, limits axon and dendrite growth, and disrupts mitochondrial and synaptic integrity in layer 2/3 but not 5/6 projection neurons (PNs). Diminished dosage of Txnrd2, a 22q11 gene essential for reactive oxygen species catabolism in brain mitochondria, recapitulates these deficits in WT layer 2/3 PNs; Txnrd2 re-expression in LgDel layer 2/3 PNs rescues them. Anti-oxidants reverse LgDel- or Txnrd2-related layer 2/3 mitochondrial, circuit, and cognitive deficits. Accordingly, Txnrd2-mediated oxidative stress reduces layer 2/3 connectivity and impairs cognition in the context of 22q11 deletion. Anti-oxidant restoration of mitochondrial integrity, cortical connectivity, and cognitive behavior defines oxidative stress as a therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental disorders."

We and others showed that this pathway can be triggered by heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP), an LPS intermediate produced in gram-negative bacteria that represents a new pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Here, we report that our attempts to identify HBP in lysates of H. pylori revealed surprisingly low amounts, failing to explain NF-κB activation. Instead, we identified ADP-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP heptose), a derivative of HBP, as the predominant PAMP in lysates of H. pylori and other gram-negative bacteria. ADP heptose exhibits significantly higher activity than HBP, and cells specifically sensed the presence of the β-form, even when the compound was added extracellularly. The data lead us to conclude that ADP heptose not only constitutes the key PAMP responsible for H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation in epithelial cells, but it acts as a general gram-negative bacterial PAMP.-Pfannkuch, L., Hurwitz, R., Traulsen, J., Sigulla, J., Poeschke, M., Matzner, L., Kosma, P., Schmid, M., Meyer, T.

https://openalex.org/W2943977078,"Decision making is often driven by the subjective value of available options, a value which is formed through experience. To support this fundamental behavior, the brain must encode and maintain the subjective value. To investigate the area specificity and plasticity of value coding, we trained mice in a value-based decision task and imaged neural activity in 6 cortical areas with cellular resolution. History- and value-related signals were widespread across areas, but their strength and temporal patterns differed. In expert mice, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) uniquely encoded history- and value-related signals with persistent population activity patterns across trials. This unique encoding of RSC emerged during task learning with a strong increase in more distant history signals. Acute inactivation of RSC selectively impaired the reward-history-based behavioral strategy. Our results indicate that RSC flexibly changes its history coding and persistently encodes value-related signals to support adaptive behaviors."

Despite their epidemic potential, there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccines for any alphavirus infection. Alphavirus genomes encode four non-structural and five structural proteins. The non-structural proteins are required for virus replication, protein modification, and immune evasion. The structural proteins (capsid [C]-envelope [E]3-E2-6K-E1) are synthesized from a subgenomic promoter and cleaved co- and post-translationally.

The E1 ectodomain consists of three β-barrel domains termed Domain I (DI), DII, and DIII. The fusion peptide is located at the distal end of DII. E1 monomers lie at the base of the surface spikes and form trimers surrounding the icosahedral axes. E2 localizes to a long, thin, leaf-like structure on the top of the spike. The mature E2 protein contains three domains with immunoglobulin (Ig)-like folds: the N-terminal domain A, located at the center; domain B at the lateral tip; and the C-terminal domain C, located close to E1 and the viral membrane. We recently used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify mouse Mxra8, a cell adhesion molecule containing two Ig-like domains, as a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses, including CHIKV, RRV, MAYV, and ONNV (Zhang et al., 2018Zhang R. Kim A.S. Fox J.M. Nair S. Basore K. Klimstra W.B. Rimkunas R. Fong R.H. Lin H. Poddar S. et al.Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.Nature. 2018; 557: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Importantly, the human ortholog MXRA8 also bound to CHIKV and other alphaviruses, and its cell surface expression was required for efficient infection of primary human target cells, including fibroblasts, skeletal muscle cells, and chondrocytes. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced attachment and internalization into cells, and Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocked CHIKV infection of several cell types. Administration of Mxr8a-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking mAbs to mice reduced CHIKV or ONNV infection and associated joint swelling. Despite defining several biological characteristics of CHIKV interaction with this receptor, structural insight as to how Mxra8 engages the alphavirus spike proteins on the virion is lacking. To date, there has been limited structural information of the binding of receptors to icosahedral enveloped viruses. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure of the Mxra8 ectodomain and cryo-EM reconstructions of CHIKV virus-like particles (VLPs, produced as capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1 but lacking viral RNA) and fully infectious CHIKV in complex with Mxra8. Mxra8 has an unusual architecture, as its two Ig-like domains are oriented in a disulfide-linked head-to-head arrangement, with domain 1 inserted into a loop of domain 2. Mxra8 binds into a cleft formed between two CHIKV E2-E1 heterodimers within a trimeric spike and also extends to engage an adjacent trimeric spike. Two binding modes for Mxra8 were observed with mature CHIKV VLPs, which is consistent with a high- and low-affinity binding-site model supported by surface plasmon resonance measurements. The low-affinity binding sites, however, were sterically obscured by the retention of E3 on infectious CHIKV. Overall, our structural analysis defines how CHIKV engages its receptor Mxra8 to facilitate attachment and infection of cells. This information may inform the basis of therapies and improved vaccine designs that mitigate disease of multiple emerging alphaviruses. The soluble ectodomain of murine Mxra8 (amino acids 23 through 296) was produced as E. coli inclusion bodies that were oxidatively refolded (Figure S1A). Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis reveals that refolded Mxra8 is monomeric with a molecular weight of 31 kDa (Figure S1B). Each Mxra8 monomer contains three disulfide linkages, as indicated by a monoisotopic molecular weight of 31,092.45 determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. This value corresponds to the predicted weight of the native expression construct, minus the first methionine removed by aminopeptidase and six hydrogens lost during formation of the three disulfide bonds. We also produced a mammalian-expressed soluble form of Mxra8 by engineering a Mxra8-Fc fusion protein (Zhang et al., 2018Zhang R. Kim A.S. Fox J.M. Nair S. Basore K. Klimstra W.B. Rimkunas R.

After production of Mxra8-Fc fusion protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293F cells and purification by protein A affinity chromatography, we cleaved the Fc domain with HRV and isolated Mxra8 in the flowthrough of a second round of protein A agarose affinity chromatography (Figure S1C). SEC-MALS analysis revealed that cleaved mammalian-cell-generated Mxra8 is monomeric, with a molecular weight of 38 kDa (Figure S1D), and N-terminal sequencing using Edman degradation showed that the mature N terminus of the protein begins at position 23 (Figure S2). These preparations of Mxra8 were used for the crystallographic and cryo-EM studies described below.Figure S2Sequence Alignment of Mouse and Human Mxra8 Orthologs, Related to Figures 1, 4, and 5Show full captionAlignment was performed between mouse (NP_077225) and human (NP_001269514) Mxra8 using PROMALS3D (Papadopoulos and Agarwala, 2007Papadopoulos J.S.

Poddar S. et al.Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.Nature. 2018; 557: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we produced CHIKV VLPs (strain 37997) after transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with a plasmid encoding C-E3-E2-6K-E1 (Akahata et al., 2010Akahata W.

Soluble VLPs were collected, buffer exchanged, and monitored for purity by SDS-PAGE and antigenicity by western blotting with anti-capsid and anti-envelope-protein antibodies (Figures S1E and S1F). Dynamic light scattering experiments revealed a particle diameter of ∼680 Å (Figure S1G), which is close to the expected external diameter of 700 Å for a CHIKV virion (Cheng et al., 1995Cheng R.H. Kuhn R.J. Olson N.H. Rossmann M.G. Choi H.K. Smith T.J. Baker T.S.

Diffraction quality crystals of bacterially produced murine Mxra8 (ectodomain residues 23 to 296) were obtained in space group I222 with cell dimensions a = 72.59 Å, b = 142.85 Å, and c = 195.59 Å. There are two copies of Mxra8 in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using junctional adhesion molecule-like protein (JAML; PDB: 3MJ6) as a model. There was visible density for all but the first nine and last two residues of chain A and all but the first seven and last two residues of chain B. The final statistics for the Mxra8 model, refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å, are provided in Table S1. Mxra8 consists of two Ig-V-like domains arranged in a head-to-head orientation, with the CDR-like loops pointing towards one another. The two FG-loops (CDR3-like) are connected by a disulfide bond (Figures 1A–1C). Unexpectedly, the first two β-strands of each domain are swapped, such that the full domain 1 is seen as an insertion into the BC-loop (CDR1-like) of domain 2. Domains 1 and 2 are similar in sequence (Figure S2) and nearly identical in fold, with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.90 Å over 68 Cα positions for chain A and 1.13 Å over 67 positions for chain B in the crystal structure. In comparison, the two domain 1 structures in the asymmetric unit align with an RMSD of 0.4 Å over 110 residues, whereas the two domain 2 structures align with an RMSD of 1.0 Å over 104 residues. The hinge connecting the two domains is flexible, and comparison of the two independent Mxra8 structures indicates that domain 1 can move by at least ∼43° relative to D2 (Figure S3) (Hayward and Berendsen, 1998Hayward S.

Electron micrographs of CHIKV VLPs with or without bound mammalian-cell-derived Mxra8 were recorded using a 300 kV Titan Krios cryo-electron microscope with Gatan K2 detector at the Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI) (Figure 2A; Table S2). The images were corrected for beam-induced motion using MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017Zheng S.Q. Palovcak E. Armache J.P. Verba K.A. Cheng Y. Agard D.A. MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Particles were auto-picked from the micrographs and subjected to two-dimensional classification to remove ice contamination and debris (Figure 2B). The remaining particles underwent ab initio three-dimensional reconstruction and refinement in cisTEM (Grant et al., 2018Grant T. Rohou A. Grigorieff N. cisTEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing.eLife. 2018; 7: e35383Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The reconstructions of CHIKV VLP alone and with Mxra8 were determined at overall resolutions of 4.16 Å and 4.06 Å (Figures 2C and 2D), respectively, based on Fourier Shell Correlation (FCS) analysis (Figures 2E and 2F). The three-dimensional reconstructions showed no large conformational changes in the structure of the CHIKV VLP when Mxra8 is bound (Figures 3A and 3B ). Despite the different chemical environments of the structural glycoproteins within the asymmetric unit of the particle, Mxra8 binds E2-E1 heterodimers in a 1:1 ratio, with 240 Mxra8 molecules bound per virion. The local resolution of the reconstruction of CHIKV VLP-Mxra8 complex indicates that the membrane-proximal regions of the E2-E1 heterodimers were the best resolved, with an estimated resolution of 3.9 to 5.4 Å for E1 ectodomains. In comparison, the radially distant trimeric spikes and Mxra8 were resolved less well, with an estimated resolution of 4.2 to 8.0 Å for Mxra8 chains (Figures 3C and 3F). Mxra8 binds to the CHIKV VLP with a complex quaternary epitope, wedging into a cleft created by two E2-E1 heterodimers in one trimeric spike, effectively wrapping around the distal end of one E2-E1 heterodimer (herein referred to as “wrapped”) and contacting an adjacent heterodimer within the same trimeric spike (the “intraspike” heterodimer). Mxra8 also engages another heterodimer on a neighboring spike (the “interspike” heterodimer) (Figures 3D and 3E). We iteratively built an atomic model of the CHIKV VLP structural proteins and Mxra8 using a combination of published CHIKV crystal structures and de novo modeling. As a starting point, we used the structures of the CHIKV capsid (PDB: 5H23) and CHIKV p62-E1 (PDB: 3N42), modeled transmembrane domains of E1 and E2 from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (PDB: 3J0C), and used our structure of Mxra8 (Figure 1) to build one assembly into the cryo-E"
https://openalex.org/W2944452573,"Long-term synaptic plasticity requires a mechanism that converts short Ca2+ pulses into persistent biochemical signaling to maintain changes in the synaptic structure and function. Here, we present a novel mechanism of a positive feedback loop, formed by a reciprocally activating kinase-effector complex (RAKEC) in dendritic spines, enabling the persistence and confinement of a molecular memory. We found that stimulation of a single spine causes the rapid formation of a RAKEC consisting of CaMKII and Tiam1, a Rac-GEF. This interaction is mediated by a pseudo-autoinhibitory domain on Tiam1, which is homologous to the CaMKII autoinhibitory domain itself. Therefore, Tiam1 binding results in constitutive CaMKII activation, which in turn persistently phosphorylates Tiam1. Phosphorylated Tiam1 promotes stable actin-polymerization through Rac1, thereby maintaining the structure of the spine during LTP. The RAKEC can store biochemical information in small subcellular compartments, thus potentially serving as a general mechanism for prolonged and compartmentalized signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2944794345,"The cardiogenic transcription factors (TFs) Mef2c, Gata4, and Tbx5 can directly reprogram fibroblasts to induced cardiac-like myocytes (iCLMs), presenting a potential source of cells for cardiac repair. While activity of these TFs is enhanced by Hand2 and Akt1, their genomic targets and interactions during reprogramming are not well studied. We performed genome-wide analyses of cardiogenic TF binding and enhancer profiling during cardiac reprogramming. We found that these TFs synergistically activate enhancers highlighted by Mef2c binding sites and that Hand2 and Akt1 coordinately recruit other TFs to enhancer elements. Intriguingly, these enhancer landscapes collectively resemble patterns of enhancer activation during embryonic cardiogenesis. We further constructed a cardiac reprogramming gene regulatory network and found repression of EGFR signaling pathway genes. Consistently, chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling augmented reprogramming. Thus, by defining epigenetic landscapes these findings reveal synergistic transcriptional activation across a broad landscape of cardiac enhancers and key signaling pathways that govern iCLM reprogramming."

Many protozoan parasites are becoming resistant to chemical treatment. The challenge of finding alternatives is presented to researchers by exploring other methods of eliminating protozoan parasites from wastewater. The aim of this study was to assess the speciation and the viability of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in environmental samples with the specific objective of evaluating if effluent chlorination and UV affect the viability. Different doses of chlorine with different exposure times were experimented with both distilled water and waste water spiked with (oo)cysts derived from environmental samples. UV irradiation at different doses was also experimented using the same spiked samples. Two methods of quantification and detection, namely, microscopy and flow cytometry, were used in the experiment. Two vital dyes, Syto-9+PI and DAPI+PI, were the used for staining the collected wastewater samples. It was found that the (oo)cysts responded to chlorination and UV treatments with Giardia responding better than Cryptosporidium. Giardia responded very well to UV irradiations with almost 0 percent remaining viable after a low dose of UV. Cryptosporidium was found to be resistant to chlorination even at high doses but responded well to high UV doses. DAPI+PI dye gave a lower mean percentage viability values than Syto-9+PI. Flow cytometry gave higher mean percentage than microscopy from the results. It is concluded that UV is a promising alternative to Chlorine in removing Cryptosporidium and Giardia from waste water. Appropriate treatment method for wastewater is necessary to minimize water resources pollution when wastewater is released into water systems."
https://openalex.org/W2944123504,"Arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), cause severe and debilitating rheumatic diseases worldwide, resulting in severe morbidity and economic costs. Recently, MXRA8 was reported as an entry receptor. Here, we present the crystal structures of the mouse MXRA8, human MXRA8 in complex with the CHIKV E protein, and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human MXRA8 and CHIKV virus-like particle. MXRA8 has two Ig-like domains with unique structural topologies. This receptor binds in the ""canyon"" between two protomers of the E spike on the surface of the virion. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal that both the two domains and the hinge region of MXRA8 are involved in interaction with CHIKV E1-E2 residues from two protomers. Notably, the stalk region of MXRA8 is critical for CHIKV virus entry. This finding provides important information regarding the development of therapeutic countermeasures against those arthritogenic alphaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2944132366,"Proprioceptive sensory axons in the spinal cord form selective connections with motor neuron partners, but the strategies that confer such selectivity remain uncertain. We show that muscle-specific sensory axons project to motor neurons along topographically organized angular trajectories and that motor pools exhibit diverse dendritic arbors. On the basis of spatial constraints on axo-dendritic interactions, we propose positional strategies that can account for sensory-motor connectivity and synaptic organization. These strategies rely on two patterning principles. First, the degree of axo-dendritic overlap reduces the number of potential post-synaptic partners. Second, a close correlation between the small angle of axo-dendritic approach and the formation of synaptic clusters imposes specificity of connections when sensory axons intersect multiple motor pools with overlapping dendritic arbors. Our study identifies positional strategies with prominent roles in the organization of spinal sensory-motor circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2944567014,"Segregation of maternal determinants within the oocyte constitutes the first step in embryo patterning. In zebrafish oocytes, extensive ooplasmic streaming leads to the segregation of ooplasm from yolk granules along the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte. Here, we show that this process does not rely on cortical actin reorganization, as previously thought, but instead on a cell-cycle-dependent bulk actin polymerization wave traveling from the animal to the vegetal pole of the oocyte. This wave functions in segregation by both pulling ooplasm animally and pushing yolk granules vegetally. Using biophysical experimentation and theory, we show that ooplasm pulling is mediated by bulk actin network flows exerting friction forces on the ooplasm, while yolk granule pushing is achieved by a mechanism closely resembling actin comet formation on yolk granules. Our study defines a novel role of cell-cycle-controlled bulk actin polymerization waves in oocyte polarization via ooplasmic segregation."

Perceived discrimination in daily life was reported in 2010/11. Participants could attribute their discrimination experience to characteristics including age, sex, race, physical disability, and sexual orientation. Self-rated health, limiting long-standing illness, depressive symptoms, quality of life, life satisfaction and loneliness were assessed in 2010/11 and 2016/17. Analyses adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, partnership status and socioeconomic position.Perceived discrimination in daily life was reported by 144 (47.4%) participants. Cross-sectionally, perceived discrimination in daily life was associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.21), loneliness (OR = 3.37, 95% CI 1.60 to 7.10) and lower quality of life (B = -3.31, 95% CI -5.49 to -1.12).

Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images.

https://openalex.org/W2946212583,"The highly interactive nature of predator-prey relationship is essential for ecosystem conservation; predators have been extirpated, however, from entire ecosystems all over the Earth. Reintroductions comprise a management technique to reverse this trend. Species Distribution Models (SDM) are preemptive tools for release-site selection, and can define levels of habitat quality over the species distribution. The Atlantic Forest of South America has lost most of its apex predators, and Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyja—Earth’s largest eagle—are now limited to few forest pockets in this domain. Harpy Eagles are supposedly widespread in the Amazon Forest, however, where habitat loss and degradation is advancing at a rapid pace. We aim to describe the suitability of threatened Amazonian landscapes for this eagle. We also aim to assess the suitability of remaining Atlantic Forest sites for Harpy Eagle reintroductions. Here we show that that considerable eagle habitat has already been lost in Amazonia due to the expansion of the “Arc of Deforestation”, and that Amazonian forests currently represent 93% of the current distribution of the species. We also show that the Serra do Mar protected areas in southeastern Brazil is the most promising region for Harpy Eagle reintroductions in the Atlantic Forest. Reintroduction and captive breeding programs have been undertaken for Harpy Eagles, building the technical and biological basis for a successful restoration framework. Our distribution range for this species represents a 41% reduction of what is currently proposed by IUCN. Furthermore, habitat loss in Amazonia, combined with industrial logging and hunting suggest that the conservation status of this species should be reassessed. We suggest researchers and conservation practitioners can use this work to help expand efforts to conserve Harpy Eagles and their natural habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2944803507,"Self-reported pain levels in patients with fibromyalgia may change according to weather conditions. Previous studies suggest that low barometric pressure (BMP) is significantly related to increased pain, but that the contribution of changes in BMP has limited clinical relevance. The present study examined whether BMP influenced variability in perceived stress, and if stress levels moderated or mediated the relationship between BMP and pain. Forty-eight patients with fibromyalgia enrolled in a randomized controlled trail (RCT) reported pain and emotional state three times daily with mobile phone messages for a 30-consecutive day period prior to the start of the treatment in the RCT. The patients were unaware that weather data were collected simultaneously with pain and emotional reports. The results showed that lower BMP and increased humidity were significantly associated with increased pain intensity and pain unpleasantness, but only BMP was associated with stress levels. Stress levels moderated the impact of lower BMP on pain intensity significantly, where higher stress was associated with higher pain. Significant individual differences were present shown by a sub-group of patients (n = 8) who reacted opposite compared to the majority of patients (n = 40) with increased pain reports to an increase in BMP. In sum, lower BMP was associated with increased pain and stress levels in the majority of the patients, and stress moderated the relationship between BMP and pain at the group-level. Significant individual differences in response to changes in BMP were present, and the relation between weather and pain may be of clinical relevance at the individual level."
https://openalex.org/W2944134436,"Background Shorter, more effective treatments for tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. While many TB drugs are available, identification of the best regimens is challenging because of the large number of possible drug-dose combinations. We have found consistently that responses of cells or whole animals to drug-dose stimulations fit a parabolic response surface (PRS), allowing us to identify and optimize the best drug combinations by testing only a small fraction of the total search space. Previously, we used PRS methodology to identify three regimens (PRS Regimens I–III) that in murine models are much more effective than the standard regimen used to treat TB. However, PRS Regimens I and II are unsuitable for treating drug-resistant TB and PRS Regimen III includes an experimental drug. Here, we use PRS methodology to identify from an expanded pool of drugs new highly effective near-universal drug regimens comprising only approved drugs. Methods and findings We evaluated combinations of 15 different drugs in a human macrophage TB model and identified the most promising 4-drug combinations. We then tested 14 of these combinations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected BALB/c mice and chose for PRS dose optimization and further study the two most potent regimens, designated PRS Regimens IV and V, consisting of clofazimine (CFZ), bedaquiline (BDQ), pyrazinamide (PZA), and either amoxicillin/clavulanate (AC) or delamanid (DLM), respectively. We then evaluated the efficacy in mice of optimized PRS Regimens IV and V, as well as a 3-drug regimen, PRS Regimen VI (CFZ, BDQ, and PZA), and compared their efficacy to PRS Regimen III (CFZ, BDQ, PZA, and SQ109), previously shown to reduce the time to achieve relapse-free cure in mice by 80% compared with the Standard Regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, PZA, and ethambutol). Efficacy measurements included early bactericidal activity, time to lung sterilization, and time to relapse-free cure. PRS Regimens III–VI all rapidly sterilized the lungs and achieved relapse-free cure in 3 weeks (PRS Regimens III, V, and VI) or 5 weeks (PRS Regimen IV). In contrast, mice treated with the Standard Regimen still had high numbers of bacteria in their lungs after 6-weeks treatment and none achieved relapse-free cure in this time-period. Conclusions We have identified three new regimens that rapidly sterilize the lungs of mice and dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure. All mouse drug doses in these regimens extrapolate to doses that are readily achievable in humans. Because PRS Regimens IV and V contain only one first line drug (PZA) and exclude fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, they should be effective against most TB cases that are multidrug resistant (MDR-TB) and many that are extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB). Hence, these regimens have potential to shorten dramatically the time required for treatment of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. If clinical trials confirm that these regimens dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure in humans, then this radically shortened treatment has the potential to improve treatment compliance, decrease the emergence of drug resistance, and decrease the healthcare burden of treating both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB."

Isolates BGSP7, BGSP9, BGSP11 and BGSP12 produced the largest zones of inhibition against all four pathogens when grown in LB broth with aeration at 37°C. Isolates BGSP7, BGSP9, BGSP11 and BGSP12 were identified as Brevibacillus laterosporus and pulsed field gel electrophoresis and extracellular protein profiles showed that three different strains (BGSP7, BGSP9 and BGSP11) were isolated. A semi-native SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel overlay assay showed that BGSP7 and BGSP9 produce small antimicrobial molecules of about 1.5 kDa, while BGSP11 produces antimicrobial molecules of 1.5 and 6 kDa active against S. aureus ATCC25923. Amino acid analysis of two antimicrobial molecules (1583.73 Da; from BGSP7 and 1556.31 Da; from BGSP11) revealed that they have a similar composition and differ only by virtue of the presence of a methionine which is present only in BGSP11 molecule. Genome sequencing of the three isolates revealed the presence of gene clusters associated with the production of non-ribosomally synthesized peptides (brevibacillin, bogorol, gramicidin S, plipastatin and tyrocin) and bacteriocins (laterosporulin, a lactococcin 972-like bacteriocin, as well as putative linocin M18, sactipeptide, UviB and lantipeptide-like molecules). Ultimately, the purification of a number of antimicrobial molecules from each isolate suggests that they can be considered as potent biocontrol strains that produce an arsenal of antimicrobial molecules active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative multi-resistant pathogens, fungi and insects."

However, only a few studies have focused on the role of city amenities in determining the intentions of rural-urban migrants. Such a relation is a key issue in Chinese urbanisation development. The current study investigates the effects of urban amenities on the settlement intentions of rural-urban migrants in China. We find that medical amenities have a significantly positive effect on rural-urban migrants' intentions. We also indicate that educational amenities and transportation services attract rural-urban migrants to settle in cities. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneous effects of amenities on different cohorts by education and age. High- and low-skilled rural-urban migrants focus on transportation amenities, while young and middle-aged migrants are attracted by urban educational amenities. Results suggest that increasing access to urban amenities for rural-urban migrants and improving urban amenities enhance the willingness of rural-urban migrants to stay in cities."
https://openalex.org/W2944108935,"The transcription factor STAT6 is strongly expressed in various tumours and is most highly expressed in human malignant lymphomas and pancreatic, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers. STAT6 is associated with cancer cell proliferation, an increased malignancy and poor prognosis. Thus, techniques aimed at reducing or blocking STAT6 expression may be useful in treating STAT6high cancers. Among these cancers, colorectal and breast cancers represent two of the most common worldwide and their incidence is increasing every year. In 2018, colorectal and breast cancers represented 10.2% and 11.6% of all new cases of cancer diagnosed, respectively. In this study, four proprietary STAT6 specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences were tested in vitro using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, and the breast/duct carcinoma cell line, ZR-75-1. Decreases in STAT6 mRNA and protein levels were analysed to confirm the transfection was successful and STAT6 knockdown effects were measured by analysing cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results showed that 100nM siRNA concentration was the most effective and, although all individual sequences were capable of significantly inhibiting cell proliferation, STAT6 siRNA sequences 1 and 4 had the largest effects. STAT6 silencing also significantly induced apoptotic events. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that STAT6 siRNA sequences are capable of inhibiting proliferation of and inducing apoptosis of HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells, halving the number of cancer cells in a short period of time. These experiments will be repeated in other STAT6high cancers in vitro, and animal studies in immunocompromised mice have been planned using xenografts of STAT6-expressing human colorectal and breast cancer cells. The STAT6 siRNA sequences therefore represent a potential treatment for STAT6high colorectal and breast cancers and a wide variety of other STAT6-expressing cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2944207953,"This paper examines the levels of health system efficiency and their possible determinants across Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries using national-level data for those countries, as well as for other emerging and developed countries. The data are analyzed using data envelopment analyses and econometric advances that yield reliable estimations of the relationship between system efficiency and its potential determinants. We find that there is substantial room for efficiency improvements in the health system of most LAC countries. For example, LAC countries could improve life expectancy at birth by about five years on average at current public spending levels if they followed best practices. Furthermore, the paper assesses what factors amenable to policy act as the main possible levers for some countries to be able to translate a given level of health financing into better performance on access to care and health outcomes. Our econometric analyses suggest that efforts to increase health system efficiency could be focused in a few key policy areas associated with broader access to health services and better outcomes. These areas include general governance aspects, in addition to improvements in specific dimensions of the quality of health system institutions, notably stronger reliance on results-based management in the production of healthcare goods and services."

The dynamic domain rearrangements of this multimeric protein have thwarted structural study of the full-length form for decades, until now. In this study, a tractable C29S variant of hPAH (C29S) yielded a 3.06 Å resolution crystal structure of the tetrameric resting-state conformation. We used size-exclusion chromatography in line with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC–SAXS) to analyze the full-length hPAH solution structure both in the presence and absence of Phe, which serves as both substrate and allosteric activators. Allosteric Phe binding favors accumulation of an activated PAH tetramer conformation, which is biophysically distinct in solution. Protein characterization with enzyme kinetics and intrinsic fluorescence revealed that the C29S variant and hPAH are otherwise equivalent in their response to Phe, further supported by their behavior on various chromatography resins and by analytical ultracentrifugation. Modeling of resting-state and activated forms of C29S against SAXS data with available structural data created and evaluated several new models for the transition between the architecturally distinct conformations of PAH and highlighted unique intra- and inter-subunit interactions. Three best-fitting alternative models all placed the allosteric Phe-binding module 8–10 Å farther from the tetramer center than do all previous models.

EC 1.14.16.1) dysfunction is the primary cause of phenylketonuria (PKU, ∼1:10,000 births global average), which results in neurotoxic concentrations of the essential amino acid l-phenylalanine (Phe) (1Blau N.

PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder with nearly 1,000 different disease-associated alleles (1Blau N. Genetics of phenylketonuria: then and now.Hum.

ACT domains are a family of structurally homologous elements that serve as sensors for small molecules, often amino acids, and are named for the first three discovered examples (2Chipman D.M.

PAH populates architecturally distinct multimeric conformations, including a low-activity resting-state PAH (RS-PAH) conformation, first determined for rat PAH (rPAH) (Fig. 1B) and an activated PAH (A-PAH) conformation with high activity (5Jaffe E.K. New protein structures provide an updated understanding of phenylketonuria.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2017; 121 (28645531): 289-29610.1016/j.ymgme.2017.06.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ACT domain of PAH binds the allosteric Phe (at one per ACT domain), which secures an ACT–ACT dimer, shown in Fig. 1C, which is present only in the A-PAH conformation (6Patel D. Kopec J. Fitzpatrick F. McCorvie T.J. Yue W.W. Structural basis for ligand-dependent dimerization of phenylalanine hydroxylase regulatory domain.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27049649)2374810.1038/srep23748Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The equilibrium between RS-PAH and A-PAH serves to maintain Phe levels sufficient for normal metabolism but below neurotoxic levels (5Jaffe E.K. New protein structures provide an updated understanding of phenylketonuria.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2017; 121 (28645531): 289-29610.1016/j.ymgme.2017.06.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As Phe levels rise, the conformational equilibrium shifts toward A-PAH; the subsequent metabolism of Phe is accompanied by a conformational shift back toward RS-PAH. Because Phe is both substrate and allosteric activator, the kinetic behavior of hPAH depends upon the order of addition of reaction components; preincubation with Phe results in a significant increase in the initial velocity of Tyr production, relative to hPAH that has not been preincubated. Our understanding of hPAH recently advanced with the determination of the crystal structure of the highly homologous rPAH in a resting-state conformation (PDB codes 5DEN and 5FGJ (7Arturo E.C.

Together, these data support the hypothesis that 1) activation of mammalian PAH minimally involves substantial movement of the N-terminal regulatory domain, and 2) the A-PAH conformation is stabilized by Phe binding allosterically to a multimer-specific binding site at the interface of two ACT domains (12Jaffe E.K.

Unfortunately, crystals of rPAH grown in the presence of Phe have yet to provide a structure in the A-PAH conformation (8Meisburger S.P. Taylor A.B. Khan C.A. Zhang S. Fitzpatrick P.F. Ando N.

Chem. 1987; 262 (3546287): 2228-2233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a wealth of data now available. Although the hPAH and rPAH sequences are highly homologous, the proteins are sufficiently different in their in vitro properties to justify pursuit of structures of full-length hPAH for a better understanding of PKU. One clue to the basis for the resistance of hPAH to structural studies is a lower-fold activation of hPAH (∼3) relative to rPAH (∼5) when comparing assays done with and without preincubation with 1 mm Phe (15Kaufman S. The phenylalanine hydroxylating system.Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 67 (8322620): 77-264PubMed Google Scholar). This difference suggests that hPAH has a higher propensity to sample the A-PAH conformation in the absence of Phe, making it more heterogeneous under Phe-free conditions, relative to rPAH. Understanding that the mole fractions of the RS-PAH and A-PAH conformations reflect an equilibrium, one approach to increasing the uniformity of hPAH is to further stabilize the RS-PAH conformation, which we have done here by design. We describe an hPAH variant where cysteine at position 29 is replaced with serine (C29S). Inspection of the highest-resolution crystal structure of full-length rPAH (PDB code 5DEN; RS-PAH conformation) allowed identification of a species-specific stabilizing intra-subunit hydrogen bond between Ser-29 in the autoregulatory region and Asp-112 near the hinge region between the regulatory and catalytic domains (Fig. 1B). This substitution was predicted to introduce an RS-PAH–stabilizing interaction by similarity to the rPAH sequence. Indeed, the crystal structure of C29S reveals the hPAH in an RS-PAH conformation. Additional biochemical and biophysical analysis demonstrates that the solution behavior of C29S mirrors that of hPAH both in its resting and activated forms. Consistent with the hypothesis that Ser-29 more highly favors the RS-PAH conformation relative to Cys-29 is a prior report that the S29C variant of rPAH is activated relative to WT rPAH (16Wang G.A. Gu P. Kaufman S. Mutagenesis of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11171986): 1537-154210.1073/pnas.98.4.1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A classic affinity purification of mammalian PAH exploits the different physical properties of the alternative conformations of mammalian PAH (17Shiman R. Gray D.W. Pater A. A simple purification of phenylalanine hydroxylase by substrate-induced hydrophobic chromatography.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254 (500646): 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At high Phe concentrations, the protein has high affinity for phenyl-Sepharose resin, whereas removal of Phe from the elution buffer causes PAH to dissociate. Relative to the high yield and purity of rPAH prepared using this method, the yields and purity of hPAH are reproducibly lower (12Jaffe E.K. Stith L. Lawrence S.H. Andrake M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. A new model for allosteric regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase: implications for disease and therapeutics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 530 (23296088): 73-8210.1016/j.abb.2012.12.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, C29S could be obtained in good yield and high purity with this method and retained full catalytic activity when stored at modest ionic strength (150 mm KCl). Analytical characterization of hPAH, C29S, and rPAH using phenyl-Sepharose suggests that hPAH experiences a slower conversion to the RS-PAH conformation following Phe removal from the elution buffer (Fig. S1). These observations are consistent with a prior report that the S29C variant of rPAH impaired purification using phenyl-Sepharose (16Wang G.A. Gu P. Kaufman S. Mutagenesis of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11171986): 1537-154210.1073/pnas.98.4.1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The initial velocity of the PAH-catalyzed reaction is higher if the protein is incubated with Phe prior to being introduced to the assay mixture (12Jaffe E.K. Stith L. Lawrence S.H. Andrake M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. A new model for allosteric regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase: implications for disease and therapeutics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 530 (23296088): 73-8210.1016/j.abb.2012.12.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the difference (+/− Phe preincubation) is a function of the concentration of Phe and of the initial position of the conformational equilibrium (RS-PAH ⇔ A-PAH) in the enzyme sample. For this reason, PAH activity assays performed using a preincubation of PAH with versus without Phe (often set to 1 mm) have become a standard approach to determining the ability of a given PAH (or disease-associated PAH variant) to become “activated.” Table 1 reports kinetic parameters derived from activity assays performed with and without preincubation with Phe, using Phe concentrations in the range of 10 μm to 1 mm. The preincubation is carried out at the same Phe concentration as is used in the assay. We find comparable KM values for hPAH relative to C29S, both with and without preincubation with Phe and regardless of whether or not the protein was cleaved from an affinity purification tag. We find hPAH undergoes an ∼3-fold activation due to preincubation with 1 mm Phe, whereas the activation for C29S is ∼5-fold. These observations support the design criterion for C29S, which was to stabilize the RS-PAH conformation of hPAH. Consistent with this idea is the observation that C29S exhibits a lower Vmax (−Phe) relative to hPAH.Table 1Measured kinetic parameters for the hPAH and C29S catalyzed production of Tyr from PheEnzyme or conditionKM for PheHill coefficientVmaxFold activationμmhnmol of Tyr·min−1·mg−1Phe preincubation−+−+−+(Vmax+Phe ÷ Vmax−Phe)hPAHaData were on PAH cleaved from a His6–SUMO construct and affinity-purified with Tris buffers.,b[Phe] was at 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 600, 800, and 1,000 μm.303 ± 54144 ± 101.1 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.31749 ± 1405179 ± 13.0C29ScNative protein was purified using the Shiman method (17).,d[Phe] was at 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 1,000 μm.217 ± 8180 ± 41.9 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.1837 ± 174077 ± 64.9C29Sb[Phe] was at 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 600, 800, and 1,000 μm.,eData were on PAH cleaved from a His6–TEV construct, affinity purified with Tris buffers.391 ± 45153 ± 101.7 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.31367 ± 1016919 ± 2095.1a Data were on PAH cleaved from a His6–SUMO construct and affinity-purified with Tris buffers.b [Phe] was at 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 600, 800, and 1,000 μm.c Native protein was purified using the Shiman method (17Shiman R.

The intrinsic protein fluorescence for both hPAH and C29S (Fig. 2A), both in the absence and presence of activating concentrations of Phe, is identical to each other and reproduces a well-documented red shift upon addition of 1 mm Phe (20Zhang S. Hinck A.P. Fitzpatrick P.F.

Sedimentation equilibrium (SE–AUC) analysis of C29S in the absence and presence of 1 mm Phe provides additional information about its self-association equilibrium. Both linearized plots (Fig. 2B) and global fits (Fig. S2) of the radial distributions show M¯w values as those expected for PAH in its tetrameric form in the presence of Phe, and intermediate values between dimer and tetramer in the absence of Phe. In the absence of Phe, the apparent KD value for the dimer ⇔ tetramer equilibrium at 4 °C is 18.8 ± 0.91 μm, whereas in the presence of Phe the fit yields an uncertain value of 0.46 ± 0.82 μm, which indicates the virtual absence of dimer under these experimental conditions (Fig. S2). In all cases, attempts to model species larger than tetramer failed to yield reasonable fits to the experimental data.

Each of the four ACT domains are situated in a characteristic RS-PAH conformation, where they do not interact with each other. The asymmetric unit is a tetramer assembled as a dimer–of–dimers that form an irregular quadrilateral shape (Fig. S3). The shortest sides of the tetramer contain two dimers that are twisted about a point that is centered on the 4-helix bundle composed of each subunit’s C-terminal α-helix (see Fig. 1B and Fig. S3). Each of the four active sites of C29S are not significantly different from those observed in any of the 13 documented crystal structures of the truncated hPAH catalytic domain (residues 117–424) or within the full-length rPAH structure (PDB code 5DEN). Each active site contains one iron ion (with an average occupancy of 90%), and first coordination sphere water molecules can be modeled for all chains. The overall quaternary architecture of C29S in the tetrameric RS-PAH conformation is like that of rPAH, yet there is a more pronounced difference between the orientations of the dimer pairs. Alignment with the catalytic domain of one chain shows that the four chains of C29S segregate into two conformations that differ at the hinge that connects the C-terminal helix with the rest of the protein (Fig. 3A, top). Although a similar asymmetry is observed within rPAH, alignment of the C-terminal helices, instead of the catalytic domain, shows the more pronounced differences between the hinge positions of each dimer pair for C29S relative to rPAH (Fig. 3A, bottom). The structure of C29S shows regions of apparent disorder. Like the rPAH structure, disorder at the N and C termini, as well as at the active-site lid, is observed, and the extent of the disorder is different in each of the four chains of the asymmetric unit. The disorder is most notable within the ACT domains, where electron density for known atomic inventory is not observed (see Table 2). The overall degree of disorder is greater for this structure relative to rPAH (PDB code 5DEN), despite similarities in resolution (3.06 versus 2.9 Å, respectively). Unlike the structure of rPAH, the structure of C29S contains additional disorder within the ACT subdomains and at the hinge between the auto-regulatory sequence and the ACT subdomain (Fig. 3B). We surmise that sequence differences between rPAH and hPAH may partially underlie the disorder of the missing inventory within the ACT domain. There are nine residues that differ between the two species; these differences occur at residues 60 at loop L2; 73 at L3; 82 at the β3–L4 junction; 88 and 90 at L4; and 92, 93, 97, and 100 all at α2.Table 2Data collection and refinement statistics for the X-ray crystal structure of full-length hPAH C29SPDB code6N1KData collection BeamlineBNL-NSLS II 17-ID-1 (AMX) Wavelength (Å)1.008 Space groupP1211 Unit cell a, b, c (Å); b (°)72.4, 202.6, 72.6; 90, 90.3, 90 No. of monomers in asymmetric unit4 Resolution range (Å)36.3–3.06 (3.17–3.06) Total no. of observations153,999 (15,045) No. of unique reflections39,316 (3,885) Completeness (%)99.54 (98.16) Multiplicity3.9 (3.9) 〈I/σ(I)〉11.5 (1.7) R-merge§0.078 (0.66) R-meas+0.091 (0.76) CC1/20.998 (0.63) R-pim0.045 (0.38) Wilson B-factor (Å2)93.6Refinement No. of nonhydrogen atoms13,689ChainsABCD Residues modeled21–28; 31–136; 142–44620–29; 32–93; 86–102; 105–137; 141–44822–136; 141–44820–29; 33–59; 63–102; 105–137; 141–446 No. of waters2212 No. of Fe ions1111 R-work/R-free*0.228/0.276 Twin lawl, −k, h No. of reflections in working set39,316 (3,885) No. of reflections in test set1,980 (203) Mean B-factor (Å2)101.2 RMS deviationsBonds (Å)0.003Angles (°)0.54 Ramachandran plot (%)Preferred95.4Allowed4.6Outliers0R-free is the R factor based on 5% of the data that were excluded from refinement.

The results, when inspected as an ensemble and relative to the rPAH structure, provide an indication of the greater mobility of the C29S ACT subdomain and the C-terminal helices of the multimerization domain (residues ∼426-end) versus the same regions in rPAH. The analysis shows that despite the two structures possessing comparable coordinate error (0.47 Å for rPAH and 0.5 Å for C29S), and even though the structure of C29S contains a lower-phase error (28.7° versus 36.8° for rPAH), the C29S ensemble appears to sample more accessible space as shown by larger RMSD at more positions throughout the tetrameric assembly of C29S relative to rPAH (Fig. 4).

Early attempts at evaluating the causal effect of fibrinogen on coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infraction (MI) using Mendelian randomization (MR) used single variant approaches, and did not take advantage of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or multi-variant, pleiotropy robust MR methodologies.We evaluated evidence for a causal effect of fibrinogen on both CHD and MI using MR. We used both an allele score approach and pleiotropy robust MR models. The allele score was composed of 38 fibrinogen-associated variants from recent GWAS. Initial analyses using the allele score used a meta-analysis of 11 European-ancestry prospective cohorts, free of CHD and MI at baseline, to examine incidence CHD and MI. We also applied 2 sample MR methods with data from a prevalent CHD and MI GWAS. Results are given in terms of the hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), depending on the study design, and associated 95% confidence interval (CI). In single variant analyses no causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD or MI was observed. In multi-variant analyses using incidence CHD cases and the allele score approach, the estimated causal effect (HR) of a 1 g/L higher fibrinogen concentration was 1.62 (CI = 1.12, 2.36) when using incident cases and the allele score approach. In 2 sample MR analyses that accounted for pleiotropy, the causal estimate (OR) was reduced to 1.18 (CI = 0.98, 1.42) and 1.09 (CI = 0.89, 1.33) in the 2 most precise (smallest CI) models, out of 4 models evaluated. In the 2 sample MR analyses for MI, there was only very weak evidence of a causal effect in only 1 out of 4 models.A small causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD is observed using multi-variant MR approaches which account for pleiotropy, but not single variant MR approaches. Taken together, results indicate that even with large sample sizes and multi-variant approaches MR analyses still cannot exclude the null when estimating the causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD, but that any potential causal effect is likely to be much smaller than observed in epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2946024917,"Recently, oxidized phospholipid species have emerged as important signaling lipids in activated immune cells and platelets. The canonical pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids is through the release of arachidonic acid by cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) followed by its enzymatic oxidation, activation of the carboxylate anion by acyl-CoA synthetase(s), and re-esterification to the sn-2 position by sn-2 acyltransferase activity (i.e. the Lands cycle). However, recent studies have demonstrated the unanticipated significance of sn-1 hydrolysis of arachidonoyl-containing choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids by other phospholipases to generate the corresponding 2-arachidonoyl-lysolipids. Herein, we identified a pathway for oxidized phospholipid synthesis comprising sequential sn-1 hydrolysis by a phospholipase A1 (e.g. by patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 8 (PNPLA8)), direct enzymatic oxidation of the resultant 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids, and the esterification of oxidized 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids by acyl-CoA-dependent sn-1 acyltransferase(s). To circumvent ambiguities associated with acyl migration or hydrolysis, we developed a synthesis for optically active (d- and l-enantiomers) nonhydrolyzable analogs of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-AA-LPC). sn-1 acyltransferase activity in murine liver microsomes stereospecifically and preferentially utilized the naturally occurring l-enantiomer of the ether analog of lysophosphatidylcholine. Next, we demonstrated the high selectivity of the sn-1 acyltransferase activity for saturated acyl-CoA species. Importantly, we established that 2-15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) ether-LPC sn-1 esterification is markedly activated by thrombin treatment of murine platelets to generate oxidized PC. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the enantiomeric specificity and saturated acyl-CoA selectivity of microsomal sn-1 acyltransferase(s) and reveal its participation in a previously uncharacterized pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids with cell-signaling properties."

The present study investigated (1) diversity of Octopodidae in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and (2) connectivity and genetic structure of Octopus cyanea and O. vulgaris populations in order to obtain baseline data for management plans. A fragment of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was sequenced in 275 octopus individuals from Madagascar, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, 41 sequences of O. vulgaris from South Africa, Brazil, Amsterdam Island, Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Galicia were retrieved from databases and included in this study. Five different species were identified using DNA barcoding, with first records for O. oliveri and Callistoctopus luteus in the WIO. For O. cyanea (n = 229, 563 bp), 22 haplotypes were found, forming one haplogroup. AMOVA revealed shallow but significant genetic population structure among all sites (ϕST = 0.025, p = 0.02), with significant differentiation among: (1) Kanamai, (2) southern Kenya, Tanzania, North and West Madagascar, (3) Southwest Madagascar and (4) East Madagascar (ϕCT = 0.035, p = 0.017). For O. vulgaris (n = 71, 482 bp), 15 haplotypes were identified, forming three haplogroups. A significant genetic population structure was found among all sites (ϕST = 0.82, p ≤ 0.01). Based on pairwise ϕST-values and hierarchical AMOVAs, populations of O. vulgaris could be grouped as follows: (1) Brazil, (2) Madagascar and (3) all other sites. A significant increase in genetic distance with increasing geographic distance was found (Z = 232443, 81 r = 0.36, p = 0.039). These results indicate that for O. cyanea four regions should be considered as separate management units in the WIO. The very divergent haplogroups in O. vulgaris from Brazil and Madagascar might be evolving towards speciation and therefore should be considered as separate species in FAO statistics."

Users increasingly purchase MA kits directly from pharmacies, in some cases experiencing perceived complications and approaching a facility for care. We present findings of a qualitative research tracing the decision-making pathway(s) of MA users in Uttar Pradesh, India, to help understand knowledge and behaviour gaps, and recommend ways to improve the overall quality of care at these service delivery points.Forty in-depth interviews were conducted with recent MA users (20 each of clinic and pharmacy clients) across three districts. Providers were purposively selected in collaboration with an international organization selling MA kits, using their list of pharmacies and clinics. MA users were identified from the clients of the selected providers, and additionally through the snow ball method. Interviews were conducted in Hindi with verbal informed consent in a private place convenient to the respondent. Transcripts were translated to English and analysed thematically.Users first sought MA kits at pharmacies out of convenience, low cost and customer anonymity. Men often purchased kits for their partners and trusted the chemist for guidance on dosage, progression and side effects. For side effects or other concerns after using an MA kit, users first visited their neighbourhood doctor or traditional practitioner. These providers either attempted to treat the issue and failed, or directly advised her to consult a gynaecologist. The final point of care was gynaecologists, preferably female private practitioners with their own clinics. They diagnosed most abortion-related cases as incomplete abortions, emptying the uterus using the dilation and curettage method. Comparatively low cost and convenience made users inclined towards repeat use of MA.There are information gaps at various stages in the MA pathway that need to be addressed. Large scale public information programmes are required on safe abortion care- when is it legal, where to obtain MA, dosage, side effects and signs of possible complications. Pharmacists could be trained or incentivized to improve their quality of care to facilitate adequate exchange of information on MA. Since, for most couples, the male partner purchases MA, information approaches or tools are needed that pharmacists can give men to share directly with the MA user."
https://openalex.org/W2946179250,"The ETYHLENE RESPONSE FACTOR/APETALA2 (ERF/AP2) transcription factors have been shown to control a wide range of developmental and environmental responses in plants. These include hormonal responses to ethylene and Abscisic Acid (ABA) as well as to cold and drought. In Actinidia chinensis (kiwifruit), ripening is unusual: although it is sometimes classed as a climacteric fruit (ethylene-associated ripening), much of fruit ripening occurs independently from autocatalytic ethylene production. Initiation of ripening appears to be strongly developmentally controlled and modulated by low temperature. In this study, fruit treated with different temperatures showed an increase in soluble sugar accumulation, and a corresponding increase in ß-AMYLASE (BAM) genes (predominantly BAM3.2 and BAM9) with lower temperatures. To investigate the potential role of the AP2/ERF gene family in the control of fruit ripening in kiwifruit this family was investigated further. Using the new genome annotation and further genome sequence analysis we identified 226 ERF-like genes, 10 AP2L/RAV-like genes and 32 AP2-like genes. An RNA-seq screen from kiwifruit of different maturities, and following treatment with ethylene and temperatures between 0 and 16°C, revealed 4%, 26% and 18% of the ERF-like genes were upregulated by maturation, ethylene and cold temperatures, respectively. Focusing on the C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR (CBF) cold master regulators, nine potential genes were identified based on sequence similarity. Five of these CBF-like genes were found in a copy number variant (CNV) cluster of six genes on chromosome 14. Expression analysis showed that two homeologous genes (ERF41 and ERF180) increased in abundance with cold and ethylene, while the cluster of CNV CBF-like genes had lost the ability to respond to cold and increased only with ethylene, suggesting an evolutionary progression of function of these genes."

We show that DNAJA1, a heat shock protein 40 family member, interacts with the PIWI protein SMEDWI-2, as validated by the Y2H screen and co-immunoprecipitation assays. We found that DNAJA1 is enriched in planarian adult stem cells, the nervous system, and intestinal tissues.

Furthermore, we noted that human DNAJA1 binds to Piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 1 (PIWIL1) and is required for PIWIL1 stability in human gastric cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2945076983,"In 2018, the Olympic shooting regulations were modified to increase the number of women’s shots from 40 to 60, equaling the number given to men. This research presented in this paper addresses two research issues: (1) has the performance of women’s shooting changed as a result of this increase in the number of shots? and (2) with the equalized number of shots in place, do women and men perform differently? This study included 292 shooters who competed in the 2016 and/or 2018 European Championships who all obtained top-50 results. Our sample included balanced quotas for sports (50% pistol and 50% rifle) and by category (50% women and 50% men). Both championships were held in the same facilities and in the same month of the season, but with the difference that in 2016, women had 40 shots and in 2018 they had 60 shots. We observed that women’s performances did not diminish for the pistol or the rifle category when their number of shots were increased. Men and women shot equally well with rifles, although the men’s performance with pistols was higher than that of women. We concluded that sports in which physical strength is a minor factor, as in the case of shooting, should revise their regulations in the interest of greater gender equality in sports."
https://openalex.org/W2945875153,"Salmonid Rickettsial Septicemia (SRS) is the disease of greatest economic importance in the Chilean salmon farming industry, causing high mortality in fish during the final stage of their productive cycle at sea. Since current, commercially available vaccines have not demonstrated the expected efficacy levels, antimicrobials, most commonly florfenicol, are still the main resource for the treatment and control of this pathogen. The aim of this study was to determine the most appropriate single dose of florfenicol, administered through medicated feed, for the treatment of Piscirickettsia salmonis (P. salmonis), using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models. Previously, Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of florfenicol were determined for 87 P. salmonis isolates in order to define the epidemiological cut-off point (COWT). The most commonly observed MIC was 0.125 μg mL-1 (83.7%). The COWT value was 0.25 μg mL-1 with a standard deviation of 0.47 log2 μg mL-1 and 0.36 log2 μg mL-1, for Normalized resistance interpretation (NRI) method and ECOFFinder method, respectively. A MIC of 1 μg mL-1 was considered the pharmacodynamic value (PD) to define PK/PD indices. Three doses of florfenicol were evaluated in fish farmed under controlled conditions. For each dose, 150 fish were used and blood plasma samples were collected at different time points (0-48 hours). PK parameters were obtained from curves representing plasma concentrations as a function of time. The results of Monte Carlo simulation indicate that at a dose of 20 mg/Kg l.w. of florfenicol, administered orally as medicated feed, there is 100% probability (PTA) of achieving the desired efficacy (AUC0-24h/MIC>125). According to these results, we suggest that at the indicated dose, the PK/PD cut-off point for florfenicol versus P. salmonis could be 2 μg mL-1 (PTA = 99%). In order to assess the indicated dose in Atlantic salmon, fish were inoculated with P. salmonis LF-89 strain and then treated with the optimized dose of florfenicol, 20 mg/Kg bw for 15 days."
https://openalex.org/W2921527387,"Objectives Soft tissue wounds with exposed bone often require extended healing times and can be associated with severe complications. We describe the ability of artificial dermis with autogenic adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to promote the healing of wounds with exposed bone in a rat model. Methods Adipose tissues harvested from the bilateral inguinal regions of Wistar rats were used as ADSCs. Rats were randomly divided into control and ADSC groups to investigate the efficacy of ADSC transplantation for wound healing (n = 20 per group). Soft tissue defects were created on the heads of the rats and were covered with artificial dermis with or without the seeded ADSCs. Specimens from these rats were evaluated using digital image analysis, histology, immunohistochemistry, cell labeling, and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). Results The average global wound area was significantly smaller in the ADSC group than in the control group on days 3, 7, and 14 after surgery (p<0.05). After 14 days, the blood vessel density in the wound increased by 1.6-fold in the ADSC group compared with that in the control group (p<0.01). Real-time RT-PCR results showed higher Fgfb and Vegf expression levels at all time points, and higher Tgfb1 and Tgfb3 expression levels until 14 days after surgery in the ADSC group than in the control group (p<0.05). Conclusions In wounds with exposed bone, autogenic ADSCs can promote vascularization and wound healing. Use of this cell source has multiple benefits, including convenient clinical application and lack of ethical concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2944345961,"Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the human diarrheal disease cholera, exports numerous enzymes that facilitate its adaptation to both intestinal and aquatic niches. These secreted enzymes can mediate nutrient acquisition, biofilm assembly, and V. cholerae interactions with its host. We recently identified a V. cholerae-secreted serine protease, IvaP, that is active in V. cholerae-infected rabbits and human choleric stool. IvaP alters the activity of several host and pathogen enzymes in the gut and, along with other secreted V. cholerae proteases, decreases binding of intelectin, an intestinal carbohydrate-binding protein, to V. cholerae in vivo. IvaP bears homology to subtilisin-like enzymes, a large family of serine proteases primarily comprised of secreted endopeptidases. Following secretion, IvaP is cleaved at least three times to yield a truncated enzyme with serine hydrolase activity, yet little is known about the mechanism of extracellular maturation. Here, we show that IvaP maturation requires a series of sequential N- and C-terminal cleavage events congruent with the enzyme’s mosaic protein domain structure. Using a catalytically inactive reporter protein, we determined that IvaP can be partially processed in trans, but intramolecular proteolysis is most likely required to generate the mature enzyme. Unlike many other subtilisin-like enzymes, the IvaP cleavage pattern is consistent with stepwise processing of the N-terminal propeptide, which could temporarily inhibit, and be cleaved by, the purified enzyme. Furthermore, IvaP was able to cleave purified intelectin, which inhibited intelectin binding to V. cholerae.

The transition of V. cholerae from the host intestine to aquatic reservoirs relies in large part on secreted enzymes. Cholera toxin, a paradigmatic AB5 toxin secreted by V. cholerae, is the principal virulence factor responsible for stimulating fluid loss from the gut (2Ritchie J.M. Waldor M.K.

Enzymes that enable V. cholerae to cycle between intestinal and aquatic niches could be targeted to help curb the spread of cholera. Using a chemical proteomic approach, we recently identified a number of pathogen-secreted serine hydrolases that were active during V. cholerae growth in the cecal fluid of V. cholerae-infected rabbits and in biofilm cultures (9Hatzios S.K.

One of these enzymes, named IvaP (for in vivo–activated protease), was also active in human choleric stool. IvaP was found to alter the activity of other serine hydrolases in the gut, including the host enzymes kallikrein 1 and cholesterin esterase and the pathogen enzymes VCA0812, VolA, VCA0218, and VesB (9Hatzios S.K.

In addition, along with three other secreted V. cholerae enzymes (VesA, VesB, and VCA0812), IvaP reduced the abundance and binding of intelectin to the V. cholerae cell surface in vivo (9Hatzios S.K.

IvaP is homologous to subtilisin-like enzymes (also known as subtilases), which belong to the S8 family of serine peptidases (17Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J.

Academic Press, London2013: 2491-2523Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The S8 family includes enzymes from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes with diverse substrate specificities and biological activities. Many subtilases contribute to catabolic processes through nonselective protein degradation, whereas others catalyze the selective cleavage of protein precursors, peptide hormones, or growth factors at highly specific sites (18Shinde U. Thomas G. Insights from bacterial subtilases into the mechanisms of intramolecular chaperone-mediated activation of furin.Methods Mol.

Subtilases share a conserved catalytic triad in the order of Asp, His, and Ser and normally contain an N-terminal peptidase inhibitor I9 domain, which serves as an intramolecular chaperone and temporary inhibitor of protease activity (17Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Chapter 559–Introduction: Serine peptidases and their clans.in: Rawlings N.D. Salvesen G. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 3rd Ed.

The I9 domain is a propeptide that is cleaved by the peptidase domain during protein folding, separating the propeptide from the mature enzyme (19Hohl M. Stintzi A. Schaller A. A novel subtilase inhibitor in plants shows structural and functional similarities to protease propeptides.J. Biol.

The excised propeptide remains noncovalently bound to the enzyme's active site, forming an autoinhibited complex (18Shinde U. Thomas G. Insights from bacterial subtilases into the mechanisms of intramolecular chaperone-mediated activation of furin.Methods Mol.

Subsequent degradation of the propeptide is typically catalyzed by its cognate peptidase or by another active molecule of the protease in trans (20Yabuta Y. Takagi H. Inouye M. Shinde U.

Like other subtilases, IvaP undergoes extensive post-translational processing (9Hatzios S.K. Abel S. Martell J. Hubbard T. Sasabe J. Munera D. Clark L. Bachovchin D.A. Qadri F. Ryan E.T. Davis B.M.

Multiple extracellular cleavage events contribute to IvaP maturation, and peptide sequences corresponding to the active enzyme in biofilm culture supernatants and in rabbit cecal fluid suggest that proteolysis occurs at both the N and C terminus (Fig. S1) (9Hatzios S.K.

In addition, IvaP contains a C-terminal bacterial prepeptidase PPC domain that is not typically found in subtilases but facilitates the secretion of other prokaryotic enzymes and is often cleaved extracellularly (17Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Chapter 559–Introduction: Serine peptidases and their clans.in: Rawlings N.D. Salvesen G. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London2013: 2491-2523Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mosaic domain structure of IvaP suggests a unique process of proteolytic maturation; however, the molecular mechanism of IvaP processing has not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that IvaP maturation requires sequential proteolysis of the enzyme’s N and C terminus via intermolecular and intramolecular cleavages. In contrast to classic bacterial subtilisins, cleavage of the IvaP propeptide is consistent with a stepwise mechanism of autoprocessing that results in several intermediates. We show that IvaP is temporarily inhibited by the purified propeptide domain, which is also a substrate for the purified enzyme. In addition, we show that IvaP catalyzes intelectin cleavage in vitro. Proteolysis inhibits intelectin binding to V. cholerae cells, providing a possible mechanism for how V. cholerae subverts this host–pathogen interaction in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that the extracellular activation of IvaP is regulated by an unconventional mechanism of autoprocessing that could be targeted to inhibit protease activity and potentially alter pathogen interactions with the host. We previously demonstrated that autoproteolysis contributes to IvaP processing (9Hatzios S.K. Abel S. Martell J. Hubbard T. Sasabe J. Munera D. Clark L. Bachovchin D.A. Qadri F. Ryan E.T. Davis B.M.

Mutation of the catalytic Ser-361 to an alanine (V. cholerae S361A) caused IvaPS361A to migrate with a molecular mass of ∼47 kDa in biofilm culture supernatants; in contrast, IvaP from WT V. cholerae migrated with a molecular mass of ∼38 kDa, corresponding to the fully processed enzyme.

In addition, we detected a major ∼47-kDa band corresponding to IvaPS361A in stationary-phase culture supernatants from V. cholerae S361A; a small amount of the fully truncated protein (∼38 kDa) was also detected by Western blotting. These data indicate that Ser-361 contributes to successive autoprocessing of IvaP from ∼47 to ∼38 kDa in stationary-phase cultures, although some cleavage can occur in the absence of catalytically active IvaP. Furthermore, because the expected molecular mass of the full-length enzyme is ∼57 kDa, these findings suggest that IvaPS361A can be cleaved to the ∼47-kDa form through a mechanism other than autoproteolysis.Table 1V. cholerae strains used in this studyStrainRelevant characteristicsaivaP refers to the vc0157 gene of V. cholerae (NCBI Gene ID 2614886).

We generated epitope-tagged constructs of WT IvaP and IvaPS361A in the arabinose-inducible expression plasmid pBAD33 to analyze the positional processing of the enzyme in stationary-phase culture supernatants. A His6 tag was cloned immediately downstream of the IvaP signal peptide, along with a C-terminal truncated FLAG (i.e. 2× DDDDK) tag. Consistent with our prior analyses of WT V. cholerae (Fig. 1), supernatants from ΔivaP V. cholerae expressing the epitope-tagged enzyme (V. cholerae WT*) contained three major IvaP* species with serine hydrolase activity (Fig. 2A). None of these species retained the His6 tag, and only the highest-molecular-mass IvaP* precursor (∼49 kDa) retained the C-terminal tag. Because we were unable to detect His6-tagged IvaP*, we reasoned that the enzyme most likely undergoes rapid N-terminal processing under these culture conditions. To inhibit both autoprocessing and potential cleavage by other serine proteases in solution, we analyzed supernatants from ΔivaP V. cholerae expressing the catalytically inactive enzyme with an N-terminal His6 and C-terminal FLAG tag (V. cholerae S361A*) in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). PMSF substantially reduced the serine hydrolase activity of S361A* culture supernatants relative to supernatants from cultures expressing empty vector, as indicated by the apparent decrease in FP-TAMRA-labeled proteins (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis revealed a single IvaPS361A* species with intact N- and C-terminal tags that migrated with a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa (Fig. 2A), consistent with loss of the signal peptide. Together, these findings demonstrate that, following secretion, IvaP* is cleaved at the N terminus to give a ∼49-kDa intermediate (∼47 kDa for native IvaP) that lacks the N-terminal His6 tag (Fig. 2B). Next, the enzyme is cleaved at the C terminus to ∼44 kDa, with a corresponding loss of the C-terminal FLAG tag. The final major processing step most likely occurs at the N terminus. Peptide sequencing data from activity-based proteomic analyses of active IvaP in biofilm culture supernatants (Fig. S1) suggest that IvaP processing results in the loss of ∼139 amino acids (∼15 kDa) from the IvaP N terminus and ∼23 amino acids (∼3 kDa) from the IvaP C terminus. These sequencing results are consistent with N-terminal cleavage of the ∼44-kDa IvaP intermediate to the fully cleaved ∼38-kDa form (9Hatzios S.K. Abel S. Martell J. Hubbard T. Sasabe J. Munera D. Clark L. Bachovchin D.A. Qadri F. Ryan E.T. Davis B.M. Weerapana E. Waldor M.K. Chemoproteomic profiling of host and pathogen enzymes active in cholera.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 (26900865): 268-27410.1038/nchembio.2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of IvaP processing, we incubated stationary-phase culture supernatants from S361A* with biofilm culture supernatants from WT V. cholerae containing the fully processed form of IvaP. As described under “Experimental procedures,” IvaPS361A* expression was induced in the presence of ethanol for 6–7 h to partially inhibit IvaPS361A* proteolysis (our initial attempts to prevent IvaPS361A* proteolysis using PMSF inhibited the serine hydrolase activity of the biofilm culture supernatants used in these assays). The mechanism by which ethanol diminishes IvaPS361A* proteolysis is unclear; bacterial growth attenuation resulting from ethanol treatment may indirectly inhibit the expression and/or activity of other V. cholerae protease(s) that cleave IvaPS361A*. Western blot analysis revealed that IvaPS361A* is cleaved from ∼55 to ∼49 kDa in the presence of active IvaP (Fig. 3A, lane 4). An intermediate precursor of ∼52 kDa was also cleaved to ∼49 kDa following the addition of WT biofilm supernatants (we occasionally detected this precursor and other minor processing intermediates in our analyses of the IvaP* and IvaPS361A* overexpression constructs). Biofilm culture supernatants from ΔivaP V. cholerae also cleaved IvaPS361A* to ∼49 kDa, although the extent of processing was more variable (Fig. 3A (lane 2) and Fig. S2A (lane 2)). We did not observe cleavage of IvaPS361A* beyond ∼49 kDa using biofilm supernatants from either WT or ΔivaP V. cholerae. Furthermore, WT supernatants were unable to cleave the ∼47-kDa precursor produced by V. cholerae biofilms expressing chromosomal IvaPS361A (Fig. 3A, lane 7). Similarly, Western blot analysis of biofilm supernatants from a V. cholerae strain expressing chromosomal copies of both WT IvaP and IvaPS361A (V. cholerae lacZ::S361A) revealed that the catalytically inactive mutant is not fully cleaved in the presence of endogenous IvaP (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Together, these data suggest that the initial N-terminal processing event required for IvaP maturation can occur in trans and that cleavage of IvaP from ∼47 to ∼38 kDa occurs via a mechanism of intramolecular proteolysis. To investigate the mechanism of IvaPS361A* processing by other V. cholerae proteases, we grew stationary-phase cultures of V. cholerae S361A* and V. cholerae WT* in the presence of benzamidine, a reversible inhibitor of trypsin-like enzymes. Unlike S361A* cultures treated with ethanol, cultures grown in the absence of inhibitor produced IvaPS361A* that was partially processed to ∼49 kDa by 3 h post-induction (Fig. S2B, lane 2). Benzamidine decreased processing of IvaPS361A* (Fig. S2B, lane 3), suggesting that a trypsin-like serine protease can cleave the inactive form of IvaP. In contrast, benzamidine did not inhibit maturation of the catalytically active enzyme in stationary-phase cultures of WT*. These data suggest that although benzamidine-sensitive serine protease(s) can contribute to IvaPS361A* cleavage, autoprocessing may be the dominant mechanism of IvaP maturation.

Islets in juvenile pigs are smaller than those in young adult pigs, but the insulin content is very similar. In addition, as juvenile pigs are more easily reared in uncontaminated conditions, many researchers have conducted studies using pancreatic islets from juvenile pigs. We aimed to analyze the distributions of endocrine cell clusters by comprehensively evaluating juvenile porcine pancreatic development and to propose an appropriate age at which islets could be isolated from the juvenile porcine pancreas.Splenic (SL) and duodenal lobe (DL) samples were collected from the pancreases of pigs aged 0-180 days (n = 3/day after birth). The chronological changes in endocrine cell clustering were analyzed in relation to morphological changes, cell characterization, numbers, islet areas, and gene expression.In juvenile pigs aged 0-21 days, the pancreas contained numerous endocrine cells, and compact islets appeared from 21 days of age. Well-defined small islets were seen at 28 days of age, and the clusters were denser in the SL than in the DL. At 35 days of age, the islets were morphologically similar to those observed at 180 days of age, and the greater number of islets was similar to that seen at 90 days of age. The differences in the islets' cytoarchitecture between the lobes were negligible. The expression of β-cell-related genes was higher in the juvenile pancreas than in the adult pancreas, and the expression of neurogenin-3 decreased dramatically over time.These findings may have implications for attempts to refine the most appropriate age for islet isolation from porcine donors. Focusing on porcine pancreatic islets isolated at around 35 days after birth may offer benefits regarding their xenotransplantation potential."

This study aims to explore the functional similarity and the common role of both genes in breast cancer cell proliferation. Methods CTG, crystal violet assay, clonogenic assay, wound healing assay, cell cycle analysis, Hoechst staining and ROS measurement were performed to assess cell viability, colony forming potential, cell cycle arrest, nuclear condensation and ROS production after knocking down of PTOV1 and PIN1 by siRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. CO-IP, qPCR and western blot were performedto study interaction, transcriptional and translational regulation of both genes. Results Knockdown of PTOV1 and PIN1 inhibited the cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, cell cycle, and induced nuclear condensation as well as ROS production. Interaction of PTOV1 and PIN1 was validated by Co-IP in MDA-MB-231 cells. Genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis were regulated by PIN1 and PTOV1. PTOV1 knockdown inhibited Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and inducedBAX, LC3 and Beclin-1expression. Overexpression of PIN1 increased the expression of PTOV1. Knockdown of both genes inhibited the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and β-catenin. Conclusions PTOV1 and PIN1 interact and exert oncogenic role in MDA-MB-231 cells by sharing the similar expression profile at transcriptional and translational level which can be a promising hub for therapeutic target."

The Ser/Thr kinase 90 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p90RSK) belongs to a protein family that regulates many cellular processes, including cell motility and survival. p90RSK is predominantly expressed in the kidney, but its possible role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains largely unknown. Here, we found that p90RSK expression is dramatically activated in a classic mouse obstructive chronic kidney disease model, largely in the interstitial FSP-1–positive fibroblasts. We generated FSP-1–specific p90RSK transgenic mouse (RSK-Tg) and discovered that these mice, after obstructive injury, display significantly increased fibrosis and enhanced tubular epithelial damage compared with their wt littermates (RSK-wt), indicating a role of p90RSK in fibroblast–epithelial communication. We established an in vitro fibroblast–epithelial coculture system with primary kidney fibroblasts from RSK-Tg and RSK-wt mice and found that RSK-Tg fibroblasts consistently produce excessive H2O2 causing epithelial oxidative stress and inducing nuclear translocation of the signaling protein β-catenin. Epithelial accumulation of β-catenin, in turn, promoted epithelial apoptosis by activating the transcription factor forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1). Of note, blockade of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or β-catenin or FOXO1 activity abolished fibroblast p90RSK-mediated epithelial apoptosis.

In response to injury, epithelial cells, especially proximal tubular epithelial cells, not only initiate inflammatory response by producing proinflammatory chemokines, but also undergo apoptotic death, leading to kidney parenchymal destruction. Structurally, fibroblasts reside in the renal interstitium surrounding the tubules formed by epithelial cells. This proximity facilitates interstitial–epithelial communication and interactions that are fundamental in maintaining the integrity of the kidney structure and environment, as well as fine-regulated process of adaption to pathogenic cues (7El-Achkar T.M.

The 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) are a group of serine/threonine kinases that regulate diverse cellular process, such as cell growth, cell motility, and cell survival (9Anjum R. Blenis J.

There are four RSK isoforms (RSK1–4), of which RSK1 is also designated as p90RSK and is predominantly expressed in the kidney (9Anjum R. Blenis J.

Recently, p90RSK has been shown to promote endothelial cell dysfunction and atherosclerosis in a diabetes model (11Le N.T. Heo K.S. Takei Y. Lee H. Woo C.H. Chang E. McClain C. Hurley C. Wang X.

However, the role of p90RSK in CKD development and progression remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of p90RSK in CKD pathogenesis in a novel FSP-1–specific p90RSK transgenic mouse. Our data demonstrated that p90RSK promotes kidney fibrosis by inducing fibroblast-mediated epithelial apoptosis through a novel signaling mechanism involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), β-catenin, and forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1). To evaluate the activation of p90RSK during CKD, we examined the phosphorylation of p90RSK in the fibrotic kidneys from C57BL/6J mice with unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO), a classic CKD model, for 3, 7, and 14 days. We found that with the progression of kidney fibrosis, as indicated by increased fibronectin deposition (Fig. 1, A and C), p90RSK phosphorylation was dramatically induced (Fig. 1, A and B). However, there was little change of total-p90RSK abundance during kidney fibrosis (Fig. 1, A and B). Of note, phospho-p90RSK was largely induced in the interstitial FSP-1–positive cells (Fig. 1D). Based on the above finding that p90RSK is activated, primarily in FSP-1–positive interstitial cells, during CKD (Fig. 1), we generated FSP-1–specific p90RSK transgenic mice (RSK-Tg) by cross-breeding p90RSK-Tgflox mice (11Le N.T.

Consistently, we also confirmed the overexpression of p90RSK in primary kidney fibroblasts from these transgenic mice (Fig. 2A) compared with their littermates (RSK-wt), and RSK-Tg mice displayed dramatically increased phosphorylation of p90RSK in FSP-1–positive fibroblasts after fibrotic kidney injury (Fig. 2B). Under physiological condition, RSK-Tg mice had a phenotype similar to RSK-wt mice (data not shown). However, after receiving UUO for 7 days, RSK-Tg mice displayed significantly more severe tubular epithelial damage (Fig. 2, C and D) and increased interstitial fibronectin and collagen deposition (Fig. 2, E–G). We further evaluated apoptosis in the fibrotic kidneys from RSK-Tg and RSK-wt mice using TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 immune staining. It was shown that there were more apoptotic cells in the obstructed kidneys from RSK-Tg mice, and these apoptotic cells were almost exclusively lectin-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 3, A–C), consistent with the histological assessment of epithelial damage (Fig. 2, C and D). Because FSP-1–positive cells are largely fibroblasts in the kidneys, it is presumable that fibroblast-specific p90RSK mediates epithelial damage. We established an in vitro fibroblast–epithelial coculture system to test our hypothesis (Fig. 3D). Briefly, primary kidney fibroblasts extracted from RSK-Tg and RSK-wt mice were seeded onto Transwell inserts in a 6-well plate with HKC-8 cells on the bottom. After serum-free overnight, low concentration of two classical apoptosis inducers, staurosporine and H2O2, were added to the lower chamber for additional 4 or 16 h, respectively, and followed by apoptosis assay. Consistent with our in vivo studies (Fig. 3, A–C), RSK-Tg fibroblasts dramatically enhanced epithelial apoptosis compared with RSK-wt fibroblasts (Fig. 3, E–H), suggesting a pathogenic role of p90RSK in mediating fibroblast-induced epithelial damage. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we examined the level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a specific marker for oxidative stress, in the fibrotic kidneys from RSK-Tg mice and their littermates. We found that there was remarkably increased 4-HNE expression largely in tubular epithelial cells of the fibrotic kidneys of RSK-Tg mice compared with control littermates (Fig. 4A). Notably, positive 4-HNE staining concentrated at the basal aspect of tubular epithelial cells, as well as in the interstitium (Fig. 4A), strongly implicating an interstitial origin of oxidative stress. We also measured the ROS level in mouse kidney homogenates and found that obstruction-induced renal ROS production was dramatically increased in RSK-Tg mice (Fig. 4B). To confirm the role of oxidative stress in fibroblast-mediated epithelial damage, we further measured the H2O2 content in the medium of our coculture system. We found that RSK-Tg fibroblasts consistently released remarkably higher levels of H2O2 into the coculture medium (Fig. 4C). To clarify whether ROS is necessary to fibroblast p90RSK-induced epithelial cell death, ROS-specific inhibitor YCG063 was added into the coculture. We found that YCG063 remarkably decreased the effects of fibroblast-specific p90RSK in both staurosporine- and H2O2-induced epithelial apoptosis (Fig. 4, D–G). Thus, it is clear that ROS mediates fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced epithelial cell death. We further found that H2O2, at a concentration comparable with that in the medium of fibroblast–epithelial coculture system, was able to induce epithelial β-catenin nuclear translocation (Fig. 5A). We also uncovered that ROS mediated epithelial induction of β-catenin, because YCG063, a specific ROS inhibitor, largely abolished fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced epithelial β-catenin accumulation (Fig. 5, B and C), as well as active β-catenin (Fig. 5D), in our fibroblast–epithelial coculture system. Moreover, knockdown of epithelial β-catenin by siRNA, as indicated by Western blotting in HKC-8 nuclear extracts (Fig. 5E), almost completely abolished p90RSK-enhanced epithelial apoptosis (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus, we conclude that ROS-activated epithelial β-catenin mediates fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced tubular epithelial apoptosis.

Given the prominent role of TGF-β1 and β-catenin in kidney fibrosis, we further examined the role of FOXO1 in fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced epithelial apoptosis. First, we checked the effect of H2O2, at a concentration comparable to that in the medium of fibroblast–epithelial coculture system, on epithelial FOXO1 activity. We found that H2O2 dramatically induced FOXO1 nuclear translocation in epithelial cells (Fig. 6A). We further examined the epithelial FOXO1 activation level in our fibroblast–epithelial coculture system using two complementary approaches such as measuring FOXO1 abundance in epithelial nuclear extracts (Fig. 6, B and C) and evaluating FOXO1 activity by a TransAM FKHR Transcription Factor ELISA Kit (Fig. 6D). We found that RSK-Tg fibroblasts triggered a dramatically higher level of epithelial FOXO1 activation than RSK-wt fibroblasts (Fig. 6, B–D). Intriguingly, we also discovered that FOXO1 was dramatically up-regulated, predominantly in tubular epithelial nuclei, in the fibrotic kidneys from RSK-Tg mice (Fig. 6E), indicating an in vivo significance of FOXO1 in fibroblast–epithelial communication and kidney fibrosis. We further found that ROS-specific inhibitor YCG063 eliminated RSK-Tg fibroblast-induced FOXO1 activation in epithelial cells (Fig. 6F), suggesting that FOXO1 acted in the downstream of ROS pathway. Additionally, FOXO1-specific inhibitor AS1842856 (Fig. 6, G and H) or siRNA (Fig. 6, I–K) abolished fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced epithelial apoptosis in fibroblast–epithelial coculture system. Thus, FOXO1 clearly mediates fibroblast-specific p90RSK-induced tubular epithelial death. Although p90RSK has been shown to be predominantly expressed in the kidney (9Anjum R. Blenis J.

In the present study, we found that the abundance of total p90RSK was little changed during progressive CKD. However, phosphorylation or activation of p90RSK was dramatically induced and correlated with the extent of fibrotic injury (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that activation status of p90RSK, rather than its abundance, determines the severity of kidney fibrosis. Consistently, RSK-Tg mice, under physiological condition (lower p90RSK activation level), had a similar phenotype as their littermates, whereas, after obstructive injury (higher p90RSK activation level), these mice displayed a significantly enhanced fibrosis (Fig. 2). It is known that other types of cells, such as macrophages and podocytes, also express FSP-1. Previous work strongly indicates that FSP-1–Cre–driven cells are primarily fibroblasts in various organs, including kidneys (14Inoue T. Takenaka T. Hayashi M. Monkawa T. Yoshino J. Shimoda K.

However, we cannot exclude the possible contribution from macrophages to p90RSK-induced epithelial apoptosis because some kidney macrophages also express FSP-1. Future investigations in this aspect are warranted. In summary, we have found that fibroblast-specific p90RSK induces tubular epithelial apoptosis and promotes kidney fibrosis. As summarized in Fig. 7, fibroblasts with p90RSK overexpression produce and release excessive H2O2, causing ROS accumulation and β-catenin nuclear translocation in the surrounding epithelial cells. Excessive β-catenin interacts with transcription factor FOXO1 to promote tubular epithelial apoptosis, leading to kidney structural destruction and eventually fibrosis. The current results have illustrated a novel mechanism and the pivotal role of p90RSK-mediated fibroblast–epithelial communications in CKD development and progression. The juxtaposition of fibroblasts and epithelium facilitates their interactions. Under physiological condition, interstitial–epithelial communication plays a fundamental role in maintaining the integrity of the kidney structure and environment (7El-Ach"

Objectives We tested the role of physical injury as potential risk factor for development of dystonia using The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Methods We identified 65704 people who were coded in the database as having had peripheral traumatic injuries (ICD-9-CM 807–848 and 860–959) in the year 2000. Patients with traumatic brain or spine injuries were excluded from analysis. We matched them using purposive sampling with 65704 people in the database who had not suffered peripheral trauma. We looked then at the incidence of dystonia occurring at least 1 year from the date of the peripheral trauma until 2011. Psychiatric symptoms (depression and anxiety) and sleeps difficulties have been investigated as potential covariates. Results We found 189 patients with dystonia (0.28%) in the trauma group, and 52 patients with dystonia (0.08%) in the non-trauma group. Trauma was independently associated with dystonia (adjusted HR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.30–4.24). The incidence density of dystonia in the trauma group was 2.27 per 10000 person-years, while it was 0.71 per 10000 person-years in the non-trauma group Beyond the peripheral trauma, other variables associated to the incidence of dystonia included female sex, aged 40 years and above, depression and sleep disorders. Conclusion These data from a large population dataset support traumatic injury as a risk factor for the development of dystonia."
https://openalex.org/W2946698390,"Two ektaphelenchid nematodes representing one new and one known species are illustrated and characterized using morphological and molecular data. Ektaphelenchus kanzakii n. sp. is mainly characterized by its tripartite stylet having a well visible wide lumen, encompassing a sclerotized and acute anterior part (the conus), a short and slightly tapering middle part (the conophore) that is equally sclerotized but clearly separate from the conus, and a long posterior part that is cylindrical and only weakly sclerotized (the shaft) without basal knobs or swellings. It is further characterized by 863.5 (772-926) μm long females having 23.8 (21.2-27.0) μm long total stylet, distinctly annulated cuticle, three lines in lateral field, vulva at 76.6 (75.3-80.0)%, no rectum, vestigial anus in some individuals, conical posterior body end (tail) with narrow ventrally bent tip, common males in population with two pairs of caudal papillae (the single precloacal papilla and the third caudal pair lacking), spicules with dorsally bent tip and conical tail with sharp or blunt tip. The new species is morphologically compared with close species having conical posterior body end and stylet lacking basal knobs or swellings. Iranian population of Devibursaphelenchus teratospicularis, the second studied species, is characterized by 679.5 (620-709) μm long females having 18.6 (17.5-20.0) μm long total stylet with similar structure to the previous species, subcylindrical body end with widely rounded tip, and rare males with typical spicules of this species and a pair of precloacal and a pair of caudal papillae. Molecular phylogenetic studies of the two recovered species using small and large subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU and LSU rDNA) partial sequences revealed they have close phylogenetic affinities with Ektaphelenchus obtusus in both reconstructed trees. However, species of both genera Ektaphelenchus and Devibursaphelenchus don't form monophyletic groups in SSU and LSU trees. New observations on stylet structure of the two presently studied and some other ektaphelenchid species having available light microphotographs (LM) yielded on definition of a new term ""conophore"" for the middle part of the ektaphelenchid-type tripartite stylet."
https://openalex.org/W2943875082,"The inclusion of an allograft wedge during medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy has been shown to lead to satisfactory time-to-union in larger corrections (>10°). Such large corrections are associated with greater incidences of intraoperative hinge fracture and reduced construct stability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biomechanical stability that an allograft wedge brings to an osteotomy. Ten medium-size fourth generation artificial sawbone tibiae underwent 12 mm biplanar medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy with a standard Tomofix plate. Five tibiae had an allograft wedge inserted into the osteotomy gap prior to plate fixation (allograft group). The gap in the remaining tibiae was left unfilled (control group). Each group underwent static compression testing and cyclical fatigue testing until failure of the osteotomy. Peak force, valgus malrotation, number of cycles, displacement and stiffness around the tibial head were analysed. Intraoperative hinge fractures occurred in all specimens. Under static compression, the allograft group withstood higher peak forces (6.01 kN) compared with the control group (5.12 kN). Valgus malrotation was lower, and stiffness was higher, in the allograft group. During cyclical fatigue testing, results within the allograft group were more consistent than within the control group. This may indicate more predictable results in large osteotomies with an allograft. Tibial osteotomies with allograft wedges appear beneficial for larger corrections, and in cases of intraoperative hinge fracture, due to the added construct stability they provide, and the consistency of results compared with tibial osteotomies without a graft."
https://openalex.org/W2949193973,"Telomere stability is important for cell viability, as cells with telomere DNA damage that is not repaired do not survive. We reported previously that androgen receptor (AR) antagonist induces telomere DNA damage in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells; this triggers a DNA damage response (DDR) at telomeres that includes activation of ATM, and blocking ATM activation prevents telomere DNA repair and leads to cell death. Remarkably, AR antagonist induces telomere DNA damage and triggers ATM activation at telomeres also in 22Rv1 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells that are not growth inhibited by AR antagonist. Treatment with AR antagonist enzalutamide (ENZ) or ATM inhibitor (ATMi) by itself had no effect on growth in vitro or in vivo, but combined treatment with ENZ plus ATMi significantly inhibited cell survival in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. By inducing telomere DNA damage and activating a telomere DDR, an opportunity to inhibit DNA repair and promote cell death was created, even in CRPC cells. 22Rv1 cells express both full-length AR and AR splice variant AR-V7, but full-length AR was found to be the predominant form of AR associated with telomeres and required for telomere stability. Although 22Rv1 growth of untreated 22Rv1 cells appears to be driven by AR-V7, it is, ironically, expression of full-length AR that makes them sensitive to growth inhibition by combined treatment with ENZ plus ATMi. Notably, this combined treatment approach to induce telomere DNA damage and inhibit the DDR was effective in inducing cell death also in other CRPC cell lines (LNCaP/AR and C4-2B). Thus, the use of ENZ in combination with a DDR inhibitor, such as ATMi, may be effective in prolonging disease-free survival of patients with AR-positive metastatic CRPC, even those that co-express AR splice variant."

A sucrose gradient fractionation of the nuclear lysate resolved several ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing rRNAs and ribosomal proteins. Characterization of the RNP complexes with MS-based protein identification and Northern blotting–based rRNA detection approaches identified two types of preribosomes we named here as intermediate preribosomes (IPRibs) and composed preribosome (CPRib). IPRib complexes comprised large preribosomes (105S to 125S in size) containing the rRNA modification factors and premature rRNAs. We further observed that a distinctive CPRib complex consists of an 85S preribosome assembled with mature rRNAs and a ribosomal biogenesis factor, Ly1 antibody–reactive (LYAR), that does not associate with premature rRNAs and rRNA modification factors. rRNA-labeling experiments uncovered that IPRib assembly precedes CPRib complex formation. We also found that formation of the preribosomal complexes is nutrient-dependent because the abundances of IPRib and CPRib decreased substantially when cells were either deprived of amino acids or exposed to an mTOR kinase inhibitor.

If the stiffness of sclera increased, it can inhibit myopia progression. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the collagen crosslinking with different types and concentrations of carbohydrates on chemical bond and ultrastructural change of rabbit sclera.Nine New Zealand white rabbits were treated with five, sequential sub-Tenon injections of 0.15 mL solutions of ribose, sucrose, and glycogen of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 M concentration at the right eye over 14 days. Ten weeks after the last injection, the rabbits were sacrificed and chemical bond and ultrastructural changes were compared with those of the untreated left sclera using Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and histology.Raman spectroscopy of the control and cross-linked rabbit sclera tissue revealed different types of collagen interactions. Raman shift of 919 cm-1 (C-C stretching and vibration of the proline ring in collagen) was the highest in ribose, followed by sucrose and glycogen. Total energy intensity was also highest in ribose, followed by sucrose and glycogen, and showed a tendency to increase at higher concentrations. AFM revealed interlocking arrangements of collagen fibrils. The collagen fibril diameter was 105.6 ± 21.2 nm, 109.4 ± 28.8 nm, 113.1 ± 30.8 nm and 137.6 ± 25.3 nm for control group, 0.4 M glycogen, sucrose, and ribose, respectively. Histology indicated increased density of the collagen bundle and no increase in inflammatory cell recruitment compared to control at high concentrations of ribose.Scleral crosslinking using glycation increased the scleral biomechanical rigidity and these results were particularly pronounced in ribose. Scleral crosslinking using glycation may be a promising method for inhibiting high myopia progression."

https://openalex.org/W2946572112,"Research has shown that romantic love can be regulated. We investigated perceptions about love regulation, because these perceptions may impact mental health and influence love regulation application. Two-hundred eighty-six participants completed a series of items online via Qualtrics that assessed perceived ability to up- and down-regulate, exaggerate and suppress the expression of, and start and stop different love types. We also tested individual differences in perceived love regulation ability. Participants thought that they could up- but not down-regulate love in general and that they could up-regulate love in general more than down-regulate it. Participants thought that they could up-regulate infatuation less than attachment and sexual desire. Participants also thought that they could exaggerate and suppress expressions of infatuation, attachment, and sexual desire, but that they could not start and stop infatuation and attachment, or start sexual desire. The more participants habitually used cognitive reappraisal, the more they thought that they could up- and down-regulate infatuation and attachment and up-regulate sexual desire. The more participants were infatuated with their beloved, the more they thought that they could up- but not down-regulate infatuation, attachment, and sexual desire. Finally, participants thought that they could up- and down-regulate happiness more than infatuation These findings are a first step toward the development of psychoeducation techniques to correct inaccurate love regulation perceptions, which may improve mental health and love regulation in daily life."
