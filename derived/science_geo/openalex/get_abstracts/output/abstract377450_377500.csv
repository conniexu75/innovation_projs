https://openalex.org/W2060772429,"Magnetic ferrites of great homogeneity have been prepared in this Laboratory. In these ferrites the tangent of the loss angle between B and H is found to rise at a certain frequency fairly suddenly from values less than 1 per cent to values much exceeding unity. The permeability at the same time goes down to very low values, which shows that not only the boundary displacements but also rotation of domains as a whole are affected at these frequencies. behaviour of the complex susceptibility Xc = X′ − iX″ (see graph) suggests a phenomenon of resonance."

https://openalex.org/W2023918965,"The dependence of the colour of iodine solutions upon the nature of the solvent is generally believed to be due to the presence of loosely bound iodine-solvent complexes, or ‘solvates’, in the brown solutions (for example, in ethanol) and of ‘unsolvated’ diatomic iodine molecules in the violet solutions (for example, in carbon tetrachloride)1. The nature, however, of this ‘solvation’ remains obscure. It is obviously not a simple electrostatic solvation, for it has little to do with the dielectric constant of the solvent; nor would such a solvation serve to account for the marked difference in chemical properties between the violet and brown solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2041282659,"Mehl announced in 19451 that by the use of ethylene glycol an alkaline copper reagent could be prepared in which copper, besides not being precipitated, could give the biuret reaction. At the high proportion in which glycol enters into Mehl's reagent, the presence of reducing impurities made it necessary to prepare the reagent in two stages, heating in order to speed up the reaction, and filtering in order to remove the precipitated copper. Nevertheless, the presence of the colour of the alkaline copper reagent causes the reaction to depart considerably from Beer's law; Mehl deduces from a spectrophotometric analysis that, starting from the 750 mµ and 545 mµ absorptions, the quantity of proteins present can be approximately calculated."

https://openalex.org/W1997718425,"Among the genera of Cichlid fishes peculiar to Lake Nyasa, Corematodus, comprising two species, is characterized by the dentition, which consists in each jaw of a broad file-like band of small pointed teeth. Otherwise these two species would be included in the large genus Haplochromis, of which more than a hundred, nearly all endemic, have been recorded from Nyasa. Among the Haplochromis and their related genera in Nyasa, many species have a colour pattern characteristic of the Lake and rarely met with elsewhere in Africa, namely, a dark oblique band from nape to caudal fin. Corematodus tæiatus Trewavas also has this pattern on a silver-grey ground; the largest specimen known is 19 cm. in total length. C. shiranus Blgr. has quite a different pattern, consisting of vertical, or nearly vertical, black bars extending from the back to near the ventral surface. This pattern is exactly similar to that of females and non-breeding males of the Nyasa species of Tilapia of the T. squamipinnis group; and C. shiranus reaches a length of 27 cm., which is one of the commonest lengths of the T. squamipinnis caught during the Fishery Survey of 19391."
https://openalex.org/W2044684870,"The fact that cyclo-octatetraene—in contrast to benzene—shows a markedly unsaturated character has generally been used as an argument in favour of the assumption that the molecule contains alternate double and single bonds. The resonance energy, which is not much smaller per CH-group than that of benzene, makes the correctness of this assumption seem rather doubtful. On the other hand, a preliminary Raman analysis leads E. R. Lippincott and R. C. Lord, jun.1, to believe that the spectrum can best be interpreted on the basis of a puckered eight-membered ring with alternate single and double bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1983676455,"We have recently described an isotopic method for the determination of oxygen1 and carbon2 in organic compounds by using heavy oxygen (O18) and carbon (C13) respectively in conjunction with a mass spectrometer. Using the same method, higher precision is possible in the determination of nitrogen and hydrogen, since N15 and H2 (deuterium) are available in higher concentrations (30–35 per cent for N15) than the oxygen isotope (1.2 per cent) and the carbon isotope (10–20 per cent)."
https://openalex.org/W1995891959,"THERE is ample experimental evidence that the free surface of liquids is in a state of tensile stress, but this stress has never been satisfactorily explained in terms of the positions and motions of molecules. It is generally recognized that liquids cannot permanently withstand shear, and yet a two-dimensional tensile stress implies shear in all planes inclined to the plane of the tension. How is this possible? The most acceptable previous explanation is that due to Bakker1, which has recently been discussed by R. C. Brown2; but the Bakker theory is not very satisfying, as it is an attempt to show that the surface of a liquid could be in a state of effective tensile stress without an associated shear stress. The failure to explain the tension stress in the surface of liquids has led many writers to regard it as unreal. Authors who have referred to the stress as a ‘fiction’ include Laplace, Rayleigh and N. K. Adam. Adam3 also writes, “The surface tension does not exist as a physical reality”. J. Rice4, in his commentary on Gibbs' papers on surface phenomena, is at pains to absolve Gibbs from having the notion that the surfaces of liquids are in a state of tension stress."

The cause of the disease, in the eastern counties at least, was shown by A. R. Wilson1, in 1937, to be the common fungus Botrytis cinerea Fr. He proved, however, that similar symptoms could be brought about by other Botrytis species, such as B. Tulipæ Lind."

https://openalex.org/W2015925894,"WATER supply undertakings are primarily concerned with the production of an adequate supply of water of purity suitable for human and industrial consumption. Three features require attention. For human consumption it is of prime importance that the water must be free from deleterious substances and from disease-causing organisms. Secondly, for any purpose, uniformity of quality is a great virtue, and the quality must be such as to include freedom from unpleasant tastes or smells as well as from the more noticeable forms of chemical contamination. (We may leave on one side the question of the suitability of certain types of water for particular industrial uses.) Thirdly, the volume of water required is becoming an increasingly important factor in the problems of supply."
https://openalex.org/W2068135739,"Although fairly complete information is available regarding the first two systems of bands of Li2, Na2 and K2, the position with regard to the higher systems cannot yet be considered satisfactory. For this reason the spectra of these alkali-metal molecules, in the regions corresponding to the third, fourth and higher systems of bands, have been investigated in absorption, employing a quartz E1 spectrograph for lithium, and a 21-ft. concave grating (Eagle mounting), having a dispersion of 1.3 A. per mm., for sodium and potassium. A hydrogen discharge tube has been used as source of continuum below λ 3600 and a tungsten lamp above that."
https://openalex.org/W2045895226,"Results, obtained to date, by different authors on the investigation of the influence of the sexual organs in experimental tuberculosis vary very much indeed. Mautner1 and Bricker2 admit that castration prolongs the life of the inoculated animals, whereas Brack and Gray3 and Long and Vogt4 deny such results. Vercesi and Merenda5, Gray and Brack6 and Long and Vogt4 maintain that injection of œstrogens does not modify the course of experimental tuberculosis. Carnes and Biskind7, who administered testosterone, reach the same conclusion. Most of these investigations have been carried out with very small groups of animals, and in others the results have been observed a few days after the inoculation; thus it has not been possible to define with precision the reaction of the animals to the tuberculous infection. Studies were carried out by us in the guinea pig to establish not only the type of pathological lesions, but also the survival-rate of the animals. These animals were grouped in the following manner: 20 castrated animals, 10 males and 10 females; 20 non-castrated females, which were injected intra-peritoneally with 50 µgm. of œstradiol dipropionate three times a week; 20 non-castrated males, injected intraperitoneally with 250 µgm. of testosterone propionate three times a week; 20 control animals. All these animals were injected subcutaneously with 1 c.c. of an emulsion which contained 0.1 mgm. of tubercle bacilli of the human type."

https://openalex.org/W2091718854,"A query concerning the possibilities of crossing various horticultural varieties of Bougainvillea led me to examine meiosis in several of the more important ones available in Jamaica. Six varieties, Snow White, Formosa, Dark Purple, Ruby, Orange King and Royal Purple, were used. The first three have been assigned to the species Bougainvillea glabra, the next two to B. spectabilis, and the last is reputed to be a cross between unknown glabra and spectabilis types. In all six varieties, the chromosome number was found to be 2n = 34. None of the available, chromosome number lists gives any number for B. spectabilis, but Darlington and Ammal1 list, B. glabra as 2n = 20. Since a counting error of 14 chromosomes is unlikely, it seems probable that the horticultural glabrous types are not directly derived from the true B. glabra but are species hybrids resulting from doubling in an (x = 10) × (x = 7) type. There is, however, little direct evidence for this assumption."
https://openalex.org/W1975047929,"Investigating ocular tissue of man and of some animals by a clearing method during the last seven years, I have found intramural vessels in retinal arteries and veins. They were discovered in bulk specimens, their existence proved later on by reconstruction of serial sections. Intramural vessels in the retina run within the wall parallel to the lumen or encircling it or in spirals around it. They often branch and the twigs frequently reunite. I have not found them so far in the retinal vessels of young healthy human beings. Intramural vessels have been described in atheromatous diseased coronary arteries of the heart1. The purpose of these newly built retinal vessels in some cases may be to bypass an obstacle in the bloodstream. In other cases with intramural vessels, however, the retinal arteries show hyaline sclerosis with preservation of the lumen. It is possible that in the latter case the intramural vessels act as vasa vasorum and improve the insufficient nourishment of the changed vessel wall. They are considered as an attempt at healing of the sclerotic process. A detailed account of these findings will be published elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2043665966,"AT a meeting of the Physical Society held on January 31, the results of several recent researches by radar and radio methods into ionospheric ionization effects produced by meteors were described. The E-layer of the ionosphere, which occurs in a region around a height of 100 km., is characterized by one regular and two irregular forms of ionization. The regular ionization, the normal E-layer, is known to be controlled in a uniform manner by ultra-violet radiation from the sun. The problems of the origin and control of the irregular forms, which for many years have been largely a matter for speculation, were the subject of the papers presented at the meeting. In 1932, A. M. Skellett1 in the United States had suggested that meteors were an important agency in producing irregular ionospheric ionization, and with J. P. Schafer and W. M. Goodall2 he gave experimental evidence of certain increases in ionization which could be associated with meteors. Although the experimental data which accrued in subsequent years appeared on the whole to support Skellett's suggestions, it is only by the recent work, particularly in Great Britain, that a more comprehensive account of the complex characteristics of the irregular ionization in relation to the meteoric theory could be given."

https://openalex.org/W1966971704,"An account has been given by H. D. Slack of the cibarial suction pump of Corixidæ, in which a modification producing the effect of chitinous jaws was noted1. A full account of the head and mouth parts of Rhamphocorixa acuminata has been previously given by M. E. Griffith2. Further, H. B. Hungerford3 has found solid food in the alimentary canal of Corixidæ, in particular, jaws of rotifers, filaments of Oscillatoria sp. and Mougeotia sp., slime diatoms, etc. In an investigation begun in 1943, I have confirmed much of this work, and, in addition, have found legs of Crustacea, Anabæna sp., undamaged filaments of Spirogyra sp., an unexploded nematocyst, pollen grains, etc. I have also made observations on the feeding of Sigara striata, S. falleni, Corixa punctata and C. panzeri, on chironomid larvæ, Mayfly nymphs and daphnids. In all cases the live food was pierced and anchored by the mouth parts, probably by the mandibular teeth described by M. E. Griffith2. The food thus seized was held for periods varying from five to twenty minutes, during which time some of the contents of the living animal were sucked into the corixid. On one occasion black pigment from the eye of a daphnid was observed streaming through the pharynx."

https://openalex.org/W2031313054,"In view of the recent naming of new elements, the following two quotations, which have lately come to my notice, may interest or amuse historians of science. They refer to an early claim that barium oxide can be reduced by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe. In Thomas Thomson's famous “System of Chemistry” (5th edit.; London, 1817), vol. 1, p. 342, we read: “Dr. Clarke has decomposed barytes by exposing it to an intense heat, produced by thee combustion of a stream of oxygen and hydrogen gas, mixed together in the requisite proportions to form water. He has given to the metal of barytes the name of plutonium.” It appears that, in this quotation, ”barytes“ means barium oxide and not the sulphate, as now (see below)."

https://openalex.org/W2993616376,"THE design of even the simplest atomic energy reactor, the water-cooled carbon pile using natural uranium, presents many awkward technical problems. Metallic uranium has properties which make it a difficult material to work with. It melts at about 1,150° C.; but below this temperature it undergoes two transitions, with unusually large volume changes. It is very reactive chemically, and readily attacked by water. For these reasons, and to retain the radioactive fission products, the uranium rods in a pile have to be enclosed in gas-tight sheaths, of materials which are good heat conductors, non-corrosive and do not absorb neutrons appreciably."

Fosdick, is accustomed to give, that they provide not merely a picture of the activities of the Foundation but also of the fundamental needs and problems in the intellectual as well as the physical life of mankind that the Foundation is trying to serve or to solve. In this way these reviews have come to possess a value for assessing the importance or significance of trends in the scientific world or in the activities of other organisations that is almost unique. The review for 1946 admirably illustrates this characteristic, and will be read with interest and profit by those interested in the new World Health Organisation established under the United Nations, the development of the social sciences, the fostering of understanding between the West and the East, or the promotion of that full intercourse of minds in every field of intellectual effort upon which the advancement of knowledge depends."
